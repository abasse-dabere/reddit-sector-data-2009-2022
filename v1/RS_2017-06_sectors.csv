personalfinance,"No Health Insurance, No Parent Support, Enrolled in College","Hi personalfinance, I am in a bit of a sticky situation. I took a year off after high school to save up money and I am now enrolled in a state university for computer science. I currently have no health insurance and the only help I got from my parents is that my mother agreed to fill out FAFSA. I am getting about 9,300$ in Grants + 5,500 in Loans. My Tuition Costs about 14,000$ and I am getting kicked out of the house so I'll need to find off campus housing. I found a place that is about 325$ a month (plus all utilities), I figure with adding in food and gas costs I'll be spending no more than 600$ a month while at college. I have about 5,000$ saved up in my personal bank.

I feel like I should get health insurance as soon as I can but I don't think I can afford it. Max loans I can take out is 5,500 (without going to private loaners) for this year. I don't count as independent by school standards.

**TL;DR:**

Enrolled at State School for Computer Science

Tuition Costs: $14,000 

Room/Board: ~$6,000 

Books/Misc: ~$1,200

Amount in Grants received: $9,500

Scholarships: $0 

Federal Loans (Subsidized and unsubsidize): $5,500 

Money Saved: 5,000

**My two main questions are as a 19 year old in this situation:**

Can I afford some kind of health insurance?

Should I take out private loans?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on Parent Plus loans,"I need advice Redditt!   Currently age 53.  Raised 3 sons alone with single determined goal of seeing them all get that college degree.  Unfortunately, a huge part of that was Parent Plus loans through the Department of Education. The loans for the older sons are already in repayment, the youngest son recently graduated and the remainder of the loans will be coming out of grace soon.   Current payoff for all 11 different loans is $122,000.   Interest rates 6.84%, 6.41%, 8.5% and the rest are all 7.9%.  I have excellent credit and own my home, owe about $65,000 left on it, so have quite a bit of equity but it's probably only worth $150,000.  House payment is $450.00.  No other debt and I make about $65,000 per year.  The sons are helping me pay this debt as they also pay their own student loans.  I want to know....should I consolidate?  If so, with who?

personalfinance,(AUS) 20 with 9k in CC debt. Please help.,"Hi reddit, 


I know I fucked up badly here. At 18 I moved out of a home due to an awful living situation and barely qualified for a credit card. Bank gave me a 7.5k limit (at 20k/year for income). I stupidly maxed it out and have overdrafted the account. It's now sitting at $9,181 at 19.74% (it was over 10k a few months ago!). I also stupidly couldn't pay it some months and didn't let the bank know, so I received a notice saying the bank would be taking action unless the overdrafted amount is paid off within 90 days. This was 2 months ago.


Since then I've gotten a new job that pays approx 50k a year and moved into a cheaper place short-term (monthly expenses are about 1k, give or take a few hundred). I've been working with the bank on a monthly basis on what they call ""promises"" - i.e. pay back x amount on/before date. By doing so they are delaying legal action.


I've been paying back a minimum of $500 a month, but I know that this isn't enough.


Our end of financial year is coming up, and as I worked casually for most of last year I paid a huge amount in tax (9k+). I should receive about 7k back. 


I'm very seriously considering throwing my entire tax return at my CC debt, and would have no problem doing this if I didn't have to move in ~3months. I recently moved in with my bf so we and our housemates can all save money. Unfortunately the house has been sold and will be torn down once our lease is up. Bf also got a job in a rural location so we will need to move. 


As I moved in afterwards, I never paid a bond for the place we're currently living in and have no savings whatsoever. We will need to purchase a fridge, washer, dryer, couch, tv, kitchen stuff, dining stuff, the cost of moving 3+ hours away and save for a bond on a place (rent is about $300/week to the place we're moving to). I can work remotely with monthly meetings in the city we are originally from. 


So, questions:

* Should I use my tax refund to just pay off the overdraft? If I do, I will then have the money saved so I can pay for my half of our moving expenses and buy some of the furniture (each buying whole pieces, not 50/50 on everything because that's messy if we break up). 

* Should I pay off the entire CC debt and hope I can save enough money for when we move? 

* Should I look at buying a car? I don't currently have a car and the location we're moving to doesn't have any public transport. We're looking to move into town so hopefully I can just walk to the shops, post office, etc. BF has a motorbike.

* What should I do once all the debt is gone? How should I save/invest any money in the future? I don't ever want to find myself in this position again.

* Should I do a balance transfer (some banks have a 0% transfer fee at a lower interest rate)?

* If I do a balance transfer, can it/will it include the overdrafted amount? 

* I think I qualify for something like this: https://www.finder.com.au/st-george-vertigo-platinum, but I don't know what my credit score is. How do I find out? 


Other than this debt I have no other debt. All tertiary education was placed on HECS and my grandmother paid it off before she died.

EDIT: Found out how to pull a free credit report so I'm doing that now (went to https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/faqs-for-individuals/credit-reporting/accessing-your-credit-report).",finance

personalfinance,Struggling to regain my footing financially..,"I'm 29, with about 54 credits at a local university. Sorry for the long winded post, but I think it matters to give perspective on the elephant in my life.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Backstory&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
The company I worked for while bar-tending went under early last year due to the owners binge drinking at their establishment and being loose with their money. I was bringing in $1500 to $4000 monthly before the company fell apart, luckily I was able to remain on unemployment while looking for a job.

When I first accepted the job I asked for two to three days a week while in school for the winter and fall. She promptly during semester scheduled me 60+ hours. She was hoping to stack as much cash as she could in the final handful of months, which explains her lack of hiring. After two weeks of pure hell and realizing not even superman could keep it together I left my college, attaining a large fee of around $4,000.

I didn't at the time know if I'd return to school, however I wanted to keep my options open so I used my credit card to pay the $4,000 tab so I could return to school, thinking I'd have plenty of money the upcoming summer. After a grueling winter of consistent 60+ hours a week waiting tables and bar-tending I was able to pay off my vehicle, and tackle a bit of debt, yet at the beginning of march (slow season was February/April at this restaurant/bar) we all had our first free meal after a buffet, then we got mass fired with no need to return for our shifts the next day.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Job Loss&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
I spent the summer scraping by with barrel bottom unemployment. I went back to Mexico City to clear my head, I was depressed and angry that college wasn't working nor was my career. When I got back I attempted to use my old Medical Assistant certification to put myself in a better position for the future. At week 19, after applying for around 100 different medical jobs, I finally received a call and got a job in the medical field. I started my job, and was barely making ends meet with my monthly bills, and my manager was screaming at us about overtime.

Right before my 90 days, I was fired for starting the machinery and controls, then clocking in after, sometimes late although I was in the building and already working. It was naive, I didn't think a red flag would flip and someone from across town whom I had never met would come fire me, I took it as ""I'm not clocking in early, so I'm saving you money and I'm being valuable."" The worst part was my manager (who just got the job, and was a desk worker for 10 years previously) didn't stick up for me in the firing meeting.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Second Job Loss/Bill rundown&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
My monthly take-home at the hospital was $1,200. My monthly is as follows;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Verizon 120

Rent 300

Electric 44

Car Ins 99.87

Credit minimum 220 (23%+ APR)

Coin laundry (roughly 40$ a month)

Cigs (Roughly 95-110 monthly)

Car Gas 110 (roughly)

This left roughly a couple hundred. Factor in oil changes, replacing car lights, registration for my vehicle in may, etc. There is also groceries, laundry soap, house necessities. Times were hard.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Peak Credit Card Balance&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
After a large amount of depression about my state of finances and lack of success I accrued $7,000 total, this is my 4,000 bill from the college, my previous balance, and my added balance. I survived for about a month making sure my bills got taken care of with my credit card, while explaining what happened at the hospital in every interview as honestly and non-judgemental as possible while owning my mistake.

I started working at one of the nicer restaurants in the area waiting tables and I had to play catch up for a few months due to everything. I had to pay into the IRS for unemployment(200+), vehicle registration (120+) and my bill had gotten so high at Verizon, I jumped ship and I now pay 40 a month for my phone service, yet I have a couple more months to pay off my $160 phone. I got my balance down a couple hundred but it's feeling impossible to pay off. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Updated Bills after some shuffling&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Here is my updated standing;

MetroPCS 40

Metrophone payment 25

Rent 300

Gas stove 12

Electric 44

Car Ins 99.87

Credit Min 220 (21.7% APR)

Verizon debt pay off 20 (each month)

Federal Loan 19.95

Coin laundry (roughly 40$ a month)

Cigs (Roughly 95-110 monthly)

Car Gas 110 (roughly)

Total: 1040.82 Essentially the same as before after trying to adjust my amounts, the job change gives me maybe another 100 or 200.

&lt;Reflection on current job/Income&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
I was promised a busy restaurant with tons of tips, what I really see is a few tables with okay tips. We are not allowed to reach 30 hours, yet they want you available every moment the bar/restaurant is open. The Fall/Winter season is best at this restaurant, while every summer will be terrible.

I've been keeping track of my tips for three weeks now, something I should have done all along. Twice my manager failed to tell me a private room function canceled so I made $0 for two separate days. Last week I made 274.60, the week before (including mothers day buffet) I made 414.70, the week before that I made 276.05 (but I'm missing two shifts, this is when I started keeping track). This total including yesterday for work (65) is $965.35 total for the month, minus the first week. I would estimate I'm around $1,450 for this month. This is a far cry from my one and only bar-tending/waiting job before where I never walked out with less than 80, sometimes never less than 150.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Financial progress/The 'now'&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
I still owe 180 to verizon, 145 on my new phone, then those will be gone. My federal loan IDR will disappear come my return this fall. After having a labbatt blue from my neighbor and spending the time calculating one thing that is evidently clear is that my smoking habit must go. I played hard ball bouncing between call center employees to get my APR lowered, however it's still astronomical. My credit score has jumped over 100 points since april. Things are on the right track, but it's happening extremely slowly (aside from my score). My plan is to take my school loan disbursement and apply it to my card for the fall (3,100~4,200), and then the same for the winter semester(3,100~4,200). This will simply be a debt transfer, but it's my plan to fix my revolving credit anyway. I've already tried credit transfers that offer 2% additive with 0% for a year, I'm declined due to my high revolving credit.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;Questions/Brain storm&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Any suggestions are more than welcome, I've made it through an extremely rough patch, now I gotta patch things up. I have researched many things, including my only three year old card and gotten a slightly better position but I still feel like I'm in the weeds. Do I find a new job for the summer that allows me to go full time until I return to university? Will my 90 day hospital job (fired), 8 month bar-tending job (company closed), and my 6 month waiting table job look too horrible on a resume? I planned on staying long term through college at this restaurant to fix my resume. I'd like to slave away all summer before the fall semester to better my position making as much cash as I can while still penciling in my girlfriend and her two boys, but I don't want to work a full 40 for the same wage.

Do I consider bankruptcy to get ahead or use my student loans? I know it's not exactly a great idea, and it's unconventional, but I think it'll help me slide by in the meantime until I graduate. Does anyone have any fantastic financial budget programs that do not involve linking a bank account (as I get tips instead of a wage)?
Or really, any general suggestions would be great too.

personalfinance,Paying off credit card by buying a car?,"Any logic to this?

I have A $7,000 credit card debt with 11% interest rate.

I have a 2010 chevy equinox with 100,000k miles
I got a quote from carmax to buy my car for $7,000.

We need a car and my wife has a business.

Should we sell the car and buy another Chevrolet Equinox with less miles and put it in her businesses name?

I found a 2015 for $15,000 with 25kmiles.  We decided to put two thousand down from the 7k offer from carmax and two thousand from the business. (5k would go to the credit card)

So we would then have a car payment of 220/mo and a car with less miles.  And closer to paying off the cc.

Any logic to this.  Is this totally ridiculous.  Paying off a cc is hard as hell.

personalfinance,Evaluate my finances,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.    
    
Here's my situation/background:    
    
Me:    
Mid 20’s. Income: $45,000/year base. I estimate on the low end but usually a 1-2k bonus.    
    
**Cash/Investment accounts:**    
    
IRA: Max out my IRA every year. $13,500 total.    
401k: Put 7% into my 401k (company match is 7% over a 4 year vesting schedule). $3,000 in there now.    
HSA: I put a small amount into an HSA, $650 per year. So far, I use this as a backup emergency fund; I have receipts for $900 that I am able to withdraw if needed. Current amount is 1,000. Deductible is 1,500.    
E-Fund: I keep mine in an Aly CD getting 1.5%. Amount is $5,250. This will cover 4 months.    
Individual Investment Account: Vanguard Individual investment account of $15,000. Mix of Domestic/Foreign/Bond ETFs. All low expense ratios.    
Peer-to-Peer Account: Prosper account of $8,000. I was just testing out P2P accounts, not sure if I want to keep this but it has been returning roughly 10%.    
Ally: Savings account: $13,750 @1.05% interest.    
BoA Checking: $2,000. Have to maintain 1,500 minimum, thinking about canceling to go to a no minimum account. Just transfer my monthly budget every month and transfer remaining amount back to savings, rinse and repeat every month.    
BoA Savings: $300 @ a laughable interest rate. Old account, transferred money out to the bare minimum.    
    
**Debts:**     
Auto: Payment is 380/month. 17,500 left on my auto loan @ 2.29%. 48 months left. Put zero down, last car was totaled in an huge accident; insurance payout took a while but its building my credit. Not planning on selling.    
No credit card debts; pay them off every month.    
No student loans, graduated debt free.    
    
**Monthly budget:**    
Income: $2,500 (take home after tax and deductions, IRA not included. Biweekly so I have “extra” income 2 months out of the year that goes to savings. Does not include overtime.)    
Rent and utilities: $350 (taking care of a relative’s house)    
Car payment: $380    
Auto insurance: $85    
Cell phone: $40    
Food: $400 (I round up on expenses, I usually spend less/buy bulk/cook at home every day. I like cooking.)    
Gas: $75 (pretty consistent per month)    
Misc: $400 (seems high but this is literally everything that is not grocery/gas. Oil changes, eating out, fun money, gifts, ect.)    
Roth IRA: $460 (I treat this as a fixed expense)    
    
I keep a pretty strict budget. I direct deposit my paycheck into savings and “pay myself” every month. After my budget, I am usually left with about $325 per month to save per month (doesn’t include the ""extra"" paychecks twice per year). Right now, I am pouring everything I can save into savings for a house. I estimate high on food/misc so most months I am able to save more, sometimes up to 500 to 600 per month. I estimate I save at minimum $6,400 per year.    
    
**Plans/Goals:**    
I plan on getting married (very small/low key wedding, she is not wanting anything big) in next 1-2 years. Have to purchase the ring too.    
    
I am planning to buy a house in the next 2-3 year hopefully. 260,000 total/max. We would like to put 20% down.

personalfinance,Paying car loan off with student loan to get cheap insurance for high risk driver (USA),"So long story short, I am 21, have a 2012 ford focus and my insurance is currently $240 a month, which is managable but im 99% it is going to increase in october at least another $100 because of an accident claim. So I am not down with paying that much for car insurance, so ideally I would like to sell my car, pay off the loan, and buy a beater, but I dont think anyone is going to give me 8.5k - 9k so I can pay it off, or take over my loan payments of $155 a month. So I was thinking, why don't I just take an extra $9000 out in student loans, pay off my car loan, and get much cheaper insurance, because that seems like the cheapest option. I know that any extra money from the loan that does not get used for tuition gets mailed to me as a check, so they won't have any way of knowing what I use it for, and the auto loan will just be paid off in cash. Now, here is the math, that I am pretty sure I did correctly. My current auto loan is 3% and the student loan would be around 10-11%. So basically the question because is the savings from the insurance greater than extra 7-8% being paid annually. Thanks for reading.




Option 1: keep car loan (3% interest rate) and insurance 

Car payment: 155 month (9700 left)
Insurance: 350 month
65 month final cost: 32,450 ($505 avg/month)




Option 2: pay off car loan through school loan (11% interest rate) + 700 down 


Car payment: 120 month (9000)


Insurance: 120 a month (liability)


65 month early payoff: 19,500 ($300 avg/month) - (120cp x 65 months= 7800 with 2700 being just interest. Which means another + 3900 to pay off loan) + (120ins x 65months) so total (7800+3900 + 7800=19500)


120 month payoff: 29,500 ($240 avg/month) - (120cp x 10 years) + (120ins x 10 years)





Paying it off at 65 months saves me around 3k in interest, realistically I will pay the car off within 36 months, but I did 65 for the sake of that is the amount left on my original car loan.",finance

science,Science AMA Series: I’m a stay-at-home mom and citizen scientist who helped expose the Flint water crisis. People are calling me the next Erin Brockovich. AMA!,"Hi everyone!

In April 2014, a decision was made to switch Flint's water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River. Since then, the city has faced unending water woes. After numerous boil advisories and a violation of TTHM (total trihalomenthane) levels, our water became discolored, and I decided to educate myself on everything water and water distribution. Eventually we had the water tested properly and it came back at 2.5 times the level of hazardous waste. It was after that and reading the monthly operational reports that I learned that officials were breaking a federal law. They denied it and threatened me with Child Protective Services if I didn't bow to their wants. They wanted me to sign a document stating I would never pursue them for poisoning my son. They even offered me money.

Then, when trying to figure out what I should expect from my son (who also has a compromised immune system) being lead poisoned, I was told by a state nurse that it was nothing. ""Just a few IQ points—it’s not the end of the world."" With the local, state, and federal government against us, my family forged ahead and with the help of Marc Edwards and his Virginia Tech team led a sampling of almost 300 homes. This sampling proved there was a city-wide problem. Because of everything that has happened, I have now become a water activist and citizen scientist. The breaking of a federal law in Flint makes what happened an anomaly, but there is still a nation-wide problem.

After [releasing a “skinny budget” last month,] (https://www.aaas.org/news/first-trump-budget-proposes-massive-cuts-several-science-agencies) the Trump Administration has finally released its full budget for fiscal year 2018, spelling out in more detail the significant cuts proposed in the “skinny budget.” In fact, according to [AAAS estimates](https://www.aaas.org/news/trump-administrations-science-budget-toughest-apollo), this would be the toughest budget proposal for research and development since the Apollo era, and taking a similar, but tougher, approach to the first Reagan Administration budget. However, the Congress has consistently supported federal R&amp;D in recent years and voted to increase funding by five percent above FY 2016 levels earlier this month, with increases for basic and applied research, development, and R&amp;D facilities funding.

What is specifically in this budget request for science? How will the Congress incorporate, or not, the President’s proposals when it writes appropriations bills for FY 2018? What kind of say does President Trump have over all this? How does the federal budget process even work? And how can scientists and science enthusiasts influence the process? Ask us anything!

Bitcoin,Screwed my pass phrase,"So I have dun goofed. I saved a passphrase for an alt coin wallet in a notepad file, tested it, all works yesterday. Today I have attempted to make a withdrawal and my passphrase is incorrect. 

I looked at the passphrase and it seems that one of the words has been reduced to ""er"" which could be one of thousands of possible words.

I didn't save the seed, again, I'm a turnip. Is there any remote chance of me salvaging the contents of this wallet? Is there any way of finding old versions of notepad files that may be the old file I saved?

Bitcoin,An incredible comment about bitcoin from a zerohedge reader,"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-31/ethereum-forecast-surpass-bitcoin-2018#comment-9633923

""The deflationary aspects of a free market avalanche of investment capital into cryptocurrencies is terrifying, especially for a world that is drowning in debt represented by existing national currencies. 

Here's the frightening scenario : you owe several hundred thousand dollars or yen or euro on your mortgage and other debt. Your employer is pretty hip and they start paying you in this new cryptocurrency because they see the currency rising so they have transferred all the company's cash assets including payroll into a cryptocurrency. They hope the transfer will lead to increased bottom line earnings for the company, since the cryptocurrency keeps rising and that means the company may enjoy a currency arbitrage profit as their former currency not in crypto keeps rising and providing profits. 

For you, the new payments in crypto are great, because by the time you finish paying your bills each month your paycheck has risen in value...so its like getting a bonus with every paycheck ! What's even better, you easily transfer enough cryptocurrency each month into dollars because the mortgage servicer who you sends your mortgage to specified in the mortgage agreement that your payments will be in dollars. So too did the credit card companies. So you translate some of your crypto paycheck into dollars and pay your debt bills. 

Here's where it gets interesting...

The mortgage servicer and the credit card banks receive your dollars as planned. But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world, and so the dollars they are being paid by you to settle your debts with them are becoming less and less powerful in terms of how much cryptocurrency those dollars can buy. In real buying power terms, the banks you owe money to start losing buying power when they have to translate dollars they are paid into cryptocurrency, and that is causing the banks to suffer loses to its overall earnings. 

When banks start losing money, they become more cautious and lend less money. There will be the constant losses doe to currency translation from dollars to crypto, along with risk managers in the banks cautioning not to make new loans in crypto because the more the crypto rises in value against existing currencies, the more likely will there be a correction in crypto value that means the crypto collected on the new loans will be worth less than the crypto lent. 

When banks reduce their appetites for making loans, economies slow down and suffer. The gain that indebted consumers made from the cryptocurrency translation resulted in offsetting losses for banks. Since there are a lot fewer banks than borrowers, the gains for each individual borrower are a lot smaller than the huge losses that the banks will take in receiving loan payments in a currency that is in free fall because of the supply-demand equation for the more favored crypto. What you then have is a mortgage crisis like in 2007, magnified several times over. In the mortgage crisis, individuals received small benefits by living in homes without paying mortgages, while banks and holders of mortgage backed security liabilities died a death of a million slashes as they absorbed all of the defaults. This time it will be far far far worse. 

What makes this scenario even more catastrophic is that in order to stay in business, the banks will need massive capital infusions from governments, just like last time. But since governments cannot mine cryptocurrency like they could print currency, whatever infusions of liquidity they make to the banks to save them will simply serve to push the value of cryptocurrencies higher, causing this entire process to multiply to the point of runaway reaction. Cryptocurrency mining procedures are just too small and difficult and time consuming to be useful in a liquidity starved world.

The solution, of course, is to pull the cryptocurrency plug once the problem appears. But as we see time and again in financial crises, by the time the problem appears its way too late to take corrective action that would avert a catastrophe. 

So that's where the world unwittingly is going, and because governments have lost so much trust in their constituencies, and also because they have shown an incredible set of blind eyes to work on fixing problems, this deflationary firestorm will occur and destroy the world's financial system. There is a huge amount of money to be made on all of this, just think about who gets hurt if the major banks really fail and the governments are unable to save them. Bank stocks, industrial stocks, home builders, home furnishers...basically everyone. This is the one scenario in which the stock market could not even be saved by the government printing press...what an interesting idea !

So from an investment standpoint, the growing wave into cryptocurrency will provide the investment opportunity of a lifetime. Its the perfect storm...it combines the seemingly universal dislike of government intervention to prop up highly overvalued stock markets so the rich get richer while the working person cannot get a decent raise, with the also seemingly universal desire to keep the internet free and beyond the clutches of government regulation. It gets rid of these dastardly Central Banks that have done nothing to help anyone but that same wealthy one percent that benefits from zero percent interest rates, and individuals love the perceived strength that a currency freed from government entanglement means to a free world. Everyone sees the nirvana, but hardly anyone understands the devastation that deflation has on a world so over-leveraged on debt. 

Interestingly, the winnings from this deflation have nothing to do with whether you decide to put a few thousand dollars into Bitcoin so you can look cool to your kids and co-workers. No, the profits in this one will be in the old school avenues, assets denominated in the old currencies that crypto is looking to replace. Imagine shorting Goldman's stock and actually seeing it drop and stay down. Or seeing Berkshire Hathaway put that old man who has been a beneficiary of his time sink into oblivion and turn the old wizard into an old fool. 

The most interesting times in the financial world occur when the world moves from one age to another. Think of agrarian to industrial, industrial to government/military, and now government/military to information age. At all of these interfaces, the seams were sharp enough to cause a terrible rip in the fabric of the world economy, and winter came in the form of global depressions to wipe away the old leaves and dead wood. Cryptocurrency will be the death knell of the government/military age, because it takes government out of controlling the money. There will be a new money with millions of new overseers and a free market that replaces the dominance of small cabals of government bureaucrats who dictate the terms of commerce in the world. 

That seam is going to be greater than most in the past, because of the magnitude of what is being replaced and the terribly ripe condition that exists to be replaced. The interface will be epic, the transition states along the way will be horrific. Remember what Brad Pitt cautioned in The Big Short :""...for every one point rise in the unemployment rate, 40,000 people die"". That relationship will rise when this nightmare takes hold.

It’s so interesting how a development led by young people - the advent and expansionary use of cryptocurrency - still will be subject to the old rules of society. The axiom ""may you live in interesting times"" - originally intended to be a cautionary advisory - along with the caution to ""be careful what you wish for as it might come true"" both ring in my ears as I contemplate how cryptocurrency will be the bleach that washes away the excesses of a dying age in favor of the birth of a new one. 

Economic depressions are magnificent social colonics, as they wash away all of the filth that accumulated in the prior age. Every bad thing that you saw on display in the lead  up and psot script of the financial crisis is about to be gutted and burned. Yet the world will enter its new economic age hamstrung by the pains of paying a severe penance for its foolishness of the age it is putting to rest. The best thing about economic depressions is that the greatest transfers of wealth - usually from the haves to the have nots - occur in these times. 

So if you really believe that cryptocurrency is here to stay and the next big thing of the future, then take precautions now and get yourself in position to be one of these beneficiaries of the transferring wealth. Have your plan ready, you will know when its time to execute. Fortunately for the foolishness of the Gods of the old world, they have put up the prices of assets so high that you will have plenty of time to get onboard when the train starts heading down the mountainside.

personalfinance,Successfully refinanced my car loan!!,"Wanted to make a thread because I've thought for a long time that this wasn't possible based on how much I owed and my KBB value. 

So, I bought a car in April 2016. It was around 19k at 8% through Capital One for 72 months. I researched refinancing months ago but never thought I'd be approved because KBB was saying my car was worth around 11k, but that was through dealer trade in. 

So about a week ago I began plugging numbers again. I owe 16.5k at this point. I looked for the highest value on KBB I plugged everything in and I selected private party and put my car as excellent condition. I got a value of 13.8k. I realized that this is within 120% of 16.5k and that I could refinance as long as the institution went along with it.

Put in an application with Digital Federal credit union, put in my 13.8k figure. Had to pay $15 to become a member, submitted all my paperwork. Got off the phone with them this morning and the check is on the way to Capital One &amp; they offered me 4.24%. They asked me if I wanted a term of 65 months which I'm guessing would be a continuation of my old term, but I asked for the loan term to be lowered to 48 months.


Saved myself thousands of dollars and if you asked me a month ago if I could refinance I would've told you no.

Hope this helps someone.",finance
personalfinance,Best loans for bad credit?,"I would like to pay off my student loans with Navient due to just shady business practices. I have about 50k left with them in school loans but due to changes in plans and interest rates I've got pretty bad credit. About 590 - 610.

Navient says the only way they'll release my loans is for them to be paid in full. I've tried a few school loan consolidation companies and they are only for federal loans. I've tried a few banks but they won't give me a loan for that much and I don't have a viable consigner at the moment. 

Are there any other options? Or ways of getting a loan to get away from Navient? I've managed to lower my payments with them to $400 a month after some crying and having them review my finances and bank statements, but that's only for a few months and then I'll have to see if I qualify again? 

I can make regular payments of about $400 a month but it's not feasible to try to plan an extra $200-300 a month just in case Navient tries to do something. 

I make about 46k a year already working about 55 hours a week, (comes out to about $1200 per paycheck after taxes in CA) pay about $1000 in rent and utilities, got my food budget down to $150-200 a month depending on if I need to restock items. I do have a jiu jitsu gym membership for about $100 a month plus doing some work for them, which I really don't want to give up due to the social bonding and mental/ physical health benefits. Then besides Netflix and phone and public transit which is al another $100ish per month. I do have private loans which are $200 and $5000 in credit card debt where those payments are about $300-350 a month. So usually I have about $100 as extra/ emergency funding/ savings if I can. 

Due to a recent breakup with my boyfriend I had to suddenly move so I don't have a savings at the moment and won't get my security deposit back for about 30 days. But that should be about $800 once they take out the associated cleaning fees. 

I know I could get a second job and I've looked into doing things online, but I travel a bit for my job so that sometimes makes it difficult when you don't always have reliable internet or need to rely on fate for hoping you get somewhere on time. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Tl; dr: is there anyway to get an approximately 50k private loan so I can leave navient with a credit score of around 590-610 and only making 46k a year? 

UPDATE: thanks for the replies! I knew it was pretty futile but didn't know if anyone had advice or suggestions. Appreciate the help!",finance
personalfinance,Why should I pay off my car quickly?,"So a common theme I've found with finance advice on the internet is that car loans are essentially the devil and need to be paid off as soon as possible, but I don't understand why.

If I have $20,000 in the bank that is available without putting me in a tough spot financially. Now let's say I do a trade-in and the final cost to me is $20,000. I could pay it off right then and there or get a loan with a 3-4% interest rate and invest that $20,000, which generally will experience ~7% growth per year. Wouldn't the loan net me more money in the end since my investment growth is greater than the loan interest?",finance

personalfinance,Can we talk the effective interest rate of student loans after deductions? Should I pay them off after accounting for this?,"So I make under the AGI of $65K and my student loan interest is also below the maximum income deduction of $2,500. In reality I could pay off close to all of my loans today (About $10K).

 But I'm wondering if it would be marginally more worth wiled to invest in some dividend/bond ETF's and use the income to help pay off the interest on the student loans. Considering that I could earn an average of 3-6% annually between income and capital gains (assuming long-term of minimum 10 years) and my Student loan rate is currently 4%, with the true effective rate being lower due to the tax reductions, would you guys think this makes sense. 

I like the idea of this because it still allows me to hold onto my liquidity, while not really loosing money -- if anything breaking even. I do currently have other smaller credit card debts ($750 @ 0% interest for a year, paying that off in 11 months and another credit card that I just payoff in full every month that I use for daily use)

economy,Full ‘Bilderberg 2017’ Guest List Confirmed (entire list in comments),"This year’s line-up features 131 guests in total, and has placed the Trump administration’s performance at the top of its agenda. A full list of guests is below.

Four of those attending have direct links to the current incumbent of the White House. A list of attendees – and a brief summary of topics – was posted online by the Bilderberg Group on Wednesday night, just before the conference began.

Wilbur Ross, Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, is on the list, as is the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, his deputy chief technology officer.

National security advisor H. R. McMaster is also attending, along with National Security Council member Nadia Schadlow.

Republican senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham as well as Virginia governor Terence McAuliffe are also due.

They will be accompanied by Bilderberg regulars like Henry Kissinger, IMF boss Christine Lagarde, and former EU boss turned Goldman Sachs banker José Manuel Barroso.

George Osborne, the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and now editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper, is also attending.

Although writers and executives from the Financial Times, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and numerous European publications attend, no internal accounts of the meetings are ever made public – and Bilderberg claims not to keep any records of what happens inside.

Protesters often gather outside the meeting, and have been met in the past by a strong police presence.

Conservative journalist Lauren Southern was arrested last year while trying to report on the gathering in Dresden, Germany.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy?,"Hello,

I just graduated with $53k in graduate student loans, and am starting a $50k a year job. All of my loans are federal, with the highest interest being 5.9%, and the lowest being 5% (Perkins loans). I have fairly low cost of living (~$370 rent), no car, no other major expenses (other than occasional traveling).  My biggest money drain is going out/drinking, (which, though not out of control, I am trying to cut down on). I am planning to start with the highest interest loans first. Currently, I have about 2k saved up. I have a few questions.

Beyond paying off the highest interest rates first, is there more strategies to pay the least money? Like trying to pay off all the interest before the grace period ends so the interest doesn't get compounded.

Since the Perkins loan doesn't accumulate interest until after the grace period ends, should I ignore it until that time, and focus on the other loans? Generally, are there loans that I can ignore while I am paying off the higher interest ones, or do I have to pay the minimum on all of them?

Should I consolidate the loans? I am not expecting to have to rely on PAYE, PSLF, or other Federal loan perks, though, of course, who knows what might happen. Does it make sense to refinance my higher interest loans to hopefully lower the interest rate? (My credit score is 740). 

I know that I could earn more than I am earning now (I have been offered an 85k job), and I am planning to stay with my current job for only a year, mostly for experience. However, I am considering doing a PhD as well. Should this effect the way I approach repayment?

Finally, while I am using Mint, and have a student loan hero account, are there any other apps that help you control your spending or pay off loans? Im particularly looking for something to track/warn me about my credit card spending. Can one use student loan hero to set up automatic loan payments? Thank you for any suggestions!",finance

personalfinance,Advice on balance transfer or personal loan to pay credit card debt.,"So, over a few years of slowly increasing credit limits, I've got myself in about $11k of credit card debt. I'm now in a much more secure financial state with better budgeting and I'm working to pay this debt off. I don't use the card anymore, and I'm making a bit more than my minimum payments.

The killer for me is the interest rate. I'm considering a balance transfer or a personal loan to pay off the credit card debt. I've never done anything like this before, so I wanted to get the advice of reddit.

My only other debts are student loans and a car payment--both of which are at really good interest rates, so I have no reason to consolidate them.

A 0% interest balance transfer makes the most sense to me, but I've just never done anything like that and aside from things like hidden fees, I want to make sure this would in fact be a smart move. Is there any reason a personal loan at a better interest rate might be a good alternative to a balance transfer? Any reason I should just stick it out and keep paying on my current card without either option?

For what it's worth, I have a pretty good credit score (which I guess is how I kept getting credit limit increases, putting me in this hole in the first place)",finance

After graduation I got a full time job that pays me a little under $40k and I still live at home with parents and will continue to do so for at least another 6 months, so I'll have very minimal monthly expenses.

personalfinance,Got first career job couple months of ago. Want to make sure my plan is good.,"22yrs/M

Started 2 months ago, making 60k/yr with a pay bump every 6 months (providing I don't suck so much that they fire me).

I get a 5% match on my 401k, so I'm contributing 5% of my gross income per month. Health insurance is $294, supplied by employer.

So after taxes/insurance/401k, I take home ~3200 a month. I save 15% of whatever I get from my paycheck (I get paid monthly), but probably going to bump that to 18%. I'll probably top out at $10000. 

Expenses would be:
-Rent: Generally $600 (living at home EDIT: with parents)
-Phone: $48
-Internet/cable: $75 (halvsies on internet/cable)
-Monthly metrocard: $121 (live in NYC)
-Food Shopping: Generally $250. Not strict though.

Got about 26k in student loans, and I'd like to pay that off as quick as I can (edit: while not becoming a total hermit who doesn't tip/go out with friends). So gonna pay $700 a month towards that. 

After all that, generally leaves me with ~$750 of spending money, which I use for eating out, clothes, drinking etc. I usually have $100-200 left after fun spending 

I'd like to open an IRA though so should I save enough to get the $3000 buy in for the best interest rate?

After 18months, pay bump should go up to 86k. Plan then is to contribute 21% to max out 401k, max out $5500 IRA. But after maxing those out, wouldn't know what to do with excess money. Put it into an ETF? Am I doing this right? I feel like I'm fudging up by not contributing to an IRA now",finance

personalfinance,Debt repayment - monthly or bi-weekly?,"Hello,

I have a refinanced student loan through SoFi.  I am one year into a 5 year repayment plan.  My question is, would it have any kind of positive impact if I paid the monthly payment amounts in bi-weekly increments instead of all at one time?  I would have to cancel auto pay to do this which would result in a 0.25% interest increase.  Unfortunately SoFi isn't able to setup multiple auto payments.

Loan Balance: $37,600

Current Interest Rate (w/ auto pay): 5.54%

Interest Rate (w/out auto pay): 5.79%

Would the bi-weekly payments keep interest from accruing enough to offset the interest increase from the cancellation of auto pay?

Before you call me a deadbeat—I’m not. This is the ONLY black mark on my credit report. Here’s the story…

I was a poor high school student. When I was fresh out of high school, my options were limited. For completely selfish reasons, my parents convinced me to go to Culinary School. Despite my objections, they talked me into signing on for 2 different federal loans to cover the cost. Had no clue what I was getting into.

Fast Forward to 20+ years later… I had my wages garnished for a few years of time when I lived in California. That’s why I currently only owe $17,000. It was originally over $25,000.

- I live in Texas.
- I’m over 40
- I make less than $50,000 a year.
- The Collection Agency is Windham Professionals, Inc.
- I’m going back to school in Austin… Enrolling as a full time student in the Fall
- I already did a consolidation loan in 2012

I know the Debt Collector is not looking after my best interests… How do I make sure I don’t get screwed even more?

Where do I even start? What are the steps I should follow? How do I get out of collections a this point?

personalfinance,Opinions on Student loan options,"Hi everyone i would like to know what you guys think about my student loans situation. So i am going into my first semester of College at a 4 year university.  

Tuition for the 2017-2018 school year is $332.50 per credit hour. which at 30 hours is $9,975, there is a required campus fee of $454 per semester or $908 for the year. Books are estimated at $1080 for the school year.   For the school year i get $3,570 for federal Pell grant.  Comprehensive grant for $1000. Federal Subsidized direct loan for $4500. Then lastly i have a option for a unsubsidized loan option for $2000. 

This comes out to $11,070 in available funding, meanwhile the Cost is $11,963.  So i am planning on taking out the subsidized loan along with the grants. That puts me at a leftover $2,893 for the year. 

I have two options i can take out the $2000 in unsubsidized loans and have to pay $893 out of my pocket. The school offers payment plans in either 3 or 4 payments interest free.  That puts it at ~$112 per month. Which my mom wants to take the unsubsidized loan out but id rather not take it out and take the leftover $2,893 i owe and do the payment plan at ~$362 a month  which i confident i can afford.

 I live at home so i only have real expenses of around $150 a month for my phone and gas. I plan on working at a warehouse job once i am out of hours for the year at my current job. Which ill probably make 10$/hour, but i have $2,000 currently in a savings account. then $500 in checking accounts. 

I have about $1000 in stocks, and i have $5000 in a bond that matures on 7/12/2019 with a .875% coupon. I also have this summer to help save up, i pull in about 50-55 hours a week at $10.75 base with time and half over 40. So i plan on making about $6,000 this summer working.

personalfinance,Recent college graduate looking for investment guidance.,"Hi good people of Reddit! I usually read a lot of useful advice here to gain second hand experience and really love the knowledge everyone brings. I just transitioned from an intern to full time position and will finally have a steady stream of income in my account for the first time ever. I am aware that piling up your money with such low interest rates in US saving accounts is useless and was thus looking for some kind of investment as an alternative. I will start working next week and earn about $60k annually without taxes.

Originally I am from India and am thus not very aware of my options in US. Since I am still on my student visa I will be paying lower taxes for about a year till I get my H1-B visa. I would appreciate any higher level input and I don't mind doing my own research and am just looking for direction. I don't have student loans as my parents paid off my grad school expenses (I know I am really fortunate!) but I would like to repay them one way or the other later. I live in Boston area where my monthly expenses are within $1200-1300 after food, utilities etc. Thanks a lot folks!",finance
personalfinance,"23 year old new professional who doesn't understand taxes, retirement, and loan repayment plans.","Firstly, allow me to apologize in advance for my lack of understanding. I currently have like 7 tabs open about the difference between traditional and Roth 403b's and like 4 tabs looking through this sub's search page. For context, I am single, have no dependents, am currently living with my parents, and have no monthly bills (other than groceries?). 

Here's my story. I recently graduated from graduate school, and have landed my first, real, full-time job with benefits and everything. Yay adulting! I work in student affairs at a non-profit university making close to $50k annually. In terms of benefits, my parents gave me their blessing to stay on their medical insurance so that I wouldn't have to pay for it for the next few years. I'm assuming that's a good thing? I'm all for it because that leaves more money in my paycheck. Are there any foreseeable downsides to this? Also, I was told that I should have my dad remove me as one of his dependents so I can file independently. I was also told that that would be better for me, but would be bad for my dad. Are there justifiable reasons I can use with my dad about this other than ""I want what's best for me now that I'm an adult, even though I still live in your house?"" Or is it like a negligible difference that I shouldn't bother bringing it up until I move out? Clearly I don't understand anything about taxes. 

Next: In thinking about retirement, I've already discussed this with a close family friend who's worked in finance for a few years, but I still don't really understand. Retirement plans--I have no clue whether or not a traditional 403b or Roth 403b would be better for me. After hearing from my friend, reading up on some articles, and even doing some digging on this subreddit, it sounds to me like Roth is the way to go because the money is not taxed when I take it out for retirement. In my head, that means I could take out $200k when I retire instead of like $150k if I went with the traditional pre-tax retirement plan. Am I understanding that correctly? To me, it sounds like a good idea, however both my dad and this family friend both said their plans are pre-tax and that they recommend it... I just don't fully understand why. Context for my retirement plan: after 6 months of employment the university automatically puts in 5%; if I make a 5% contribution, the university will match it an additional 5%, for a combined total of 15% from the university (10%) and myself (5%). 

Lastly: because I work at a non-profit university and will qualify for loan forgiveness in 10 years, how do I figure out the math regarding which repayment plan would make the most sense for me? I currently have $47k in principal, and around $2.3k in interest (rates from 3.4%-5.8%). So my monthly payment with the default 10-year plan would be $547, and the total paid in 10 years would be close to $64k. When calculating my IDR, my monthly payments are $247. Does it make the most sense to just do an IDR because it looks like it'll be less than $64k in 10 years? Or should I just tackle my loans aggressively and get them out of the way? 

Also, something I'm not super concerned about but would like to hear what people have to say about it--I do not have (or ever had) a credit card. I don't really have a desire to get one, but do I NEED one?

Sorry for the super long post, but I would be extremely appreciative if someone could explain this stuff as simply as possible to me. Thanks in advance!",finance

Or so they thought, because this was not the first, nor the second, but the third time someone has tried luring me into this company. Unlucky me, there are two branches near me.

The first time (2014), I didn't know any better. I got dressed up (way too dressed up) for this meeting (seance) , interview (ritual), or whatever you want to call it. And the vibes I got made me sick to my stomach. I was sat in the front row with a couple other recruits (sacrifices) and we went over a quick slideshow of who they are and what they do and it seemed off to me. I raised my hand and mentioned that it sounded like an MLM and I could tell this annoyed the guy, who proceeded to tell me why they aren't, things which all sounded like technicalities, and that questions will be answered toward the end of the meeting. After that things got weird. The group of people behind us would chant and repeat things the guy would say. Then someone got promoted and it was all made to look very promising, but it was painfully obvious what was going on. It literally felt like a cult.

Being a server for 4 years in high school, I learned to spot a fake smile when I saw one, and every single person I talked to at the end of this meeting wore the same half cocked grin and fed me stories of the great time they were having working with Primerica and how they have their team and barely have to do any work. Then I was handed a paper and was asked to write 50 contacts down. They pressured me to fill out as much as I could before I left and I said I'd like to attend another meeting before I start putting anything on paper for anyone else I know. This really seemed to annoy them and then I was told there would be a $150 dollar fee to take the classes or whatever. I then laughed at the guy and walked out while my (at the time) friend and her boyfriend chased me out and scolded me for embarrassing them.

The second time I ignored it.

But this last time, this last time a guy I went to school with, who I've only ever seen post videos of girls twerking and some other really crude stuff on Facebook messages me after I make some post about the 14 hour day I had just worked. The conversation was pretty normal; same old, same old. But then the tone completely changed and he started telling me about this opportunity meeting and how I can make money working with him. Red flags everywhere. Defcon 2. Fight or flight. Screams in the distance. I tell him if this is some Primerica bullshit that I'm not interested. To which he confirms and asks why I resent his beloved company so much. I chew him out and he tries to change my outlook by spouting the same script I heard years ago. He gets really upset by my response and tries to reassure me once more how great the opportunity is. I tell him to fuck off and to have fun burning every bridge he's built in the last 10 years, then point him in the direction of 6 other people who were once optimistic and bright eyed towards Primerica and the shady people that work there. He blocks me.

I just want some reassurance that I'm not the only person who can see through the glass houses and plastic people associated with this group.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto-Ponzis, How to Navigate","**UPDATE EDIT: Said friend just (Post + 5 mins) pulled loot out of the 1st HYIP mentioned, verified on the Blockchain.**

Hey All, 

So I just sunk in about $1400 into cryptocurrencies for the first time (well, second time, but I put ~$300 on a paper wallet a few years ago then lost it), and after a brief, terrifying dip last week, am back up ~$200. A friend - the one who got me back into crypto-coins - dumped a few grand into bitcomet.io, and a few more into cryptobalance.biz. The former offers a return of ""7% per day, *FOREVER* [gushing gleeful emphasis mine], and the latter offers an astounding 2000% ROI after a mere 8 days permitted one sinks $3000+ into the fund. 

So, bullshit alarms clearly ringing louder than a stuck cat, but, being a military man, high-risk, high-reward isn't something that scares me as much as it might others. I am not as liquid as my friend, but am liquid enough to absorb a few hundred bucks if it goes tits up. 

Another point: clearly these are not schemes that can run forever. Like many/all ponzi pyramids, the key is to be nearer the top than anywhere even remotely approaching the stratocumulus. I would imagine that there is *some* legitimacy mixed in here (obviously if you're crowdsourcing lending, for example, and a loan is at a 12% interest rate, you can afford to give your actual funders 7% and take your 5% free and clear). Toss in mining contracts, illegal Chinese arms trading, money laundering, and international SPECTRE-level conspiracies and I see the possibility for a return outside of exclusively stealing people's money. But I am insanely skeptical and wondered if there were a way to get some clarity on how to judge the relative legitimacy of these sites. 

My friend pointed to the investment/withdrawal ticker as evidence that people are making lots of transactions in and out every few minutes, then I googled a GitHub random number/name ticker and put a pin in that. 

Both sites, it's worth pointing out, have registered business names and people attached to them when you google the principals and/or look them up in the UK biz directories.

So in summation, ANY insights whatsoever on the following would be greatly appreciated:

* How to spot a fake.
* How to judge the risk vs the reward.
* How these sites are built and operate.
* If you ARE a risk-comfortable idiot such as myself and want to be involved in a fund of 10 idiots each putting in $300 for a potential payout of $60,000/10 ($6,000) in 8 days, holler at your boy.
* How the perpetrators of such scams would get away with stealing my (and my friend's, and presumably thousands of others') money.

personalfinance,"Best use of my income: Huge loan, but still want to look into investing or other retirement options","As a little background, I graduated from law school in May of last year and was hired by a small law firm. However, the firm is a start-up, and we are expanding, so, for the time being, I'm making about 20k per year less than what I could in a similar firm in another practice area. Additionally, I have a large Federal law school loan (&gt;$180,000) that is broken up into 8 different loans with varying interest rates between 5-7%. I appreciate that if I changed jobs, I could relieve some of my financial stress, but I don't want to leave within less than a year, and, frankly, I love my job, which makes it worth it to me.

After budgeting and living frugally, I have managed to save up a small emergency fund to cover 3 months of living with no income, and have filled my ROTH IRA for 2016 and 2017. Unfortunately, my firm does not yet have a 401(k), but I spoke to the powers that be, and they're working towards it. When this happens, I'll readjust my budget to match any offer they give.

In the meantime, this leaves me with about $2,400 that I have budgeted to go towards my loans. Right now, this payment is broken up to cover the interest accrued on each loan every month so they stay at a zero gain, and the rest dumped into my biggest loan (it has the second highest interest rate but is significantly larger, so it gets the most interest, which is why I prioritized it).

Which leads me to my question:

First, I have considered refinancing and consolidating, as my credit is good, but this would stop me from being able to avalanche my biggest loans. Should I still refinance even if it stops me being able to avalanche?

Second, I want to begin investing to continue contributing to retirement and have been looking at the basics of how and where to start. I believe I could reasonably dedicate $400 dollars (reducing my loan payments to $2,000) per month to investing while still paying enough to pay off my loans in 10 years. Is this money better spent focusing on paying my loans down as quickly as possible, or would investing $400 every month be wise or even effective?

personalfinance,Choosing to split Student Loan Account to Target 1 Individual Loan at a Time,"Hi so recently I read some posts from here of other graduates that decided to focus on paying off individual loans on MyGreatLakes rather than having to put money into each loan at the same time. I recently contacted MyGreatLakes and they provided me with this response when I asked to split my account. 

&gt;While I understand that you are interested in this option, I want to ensure that you are aware of the possible repercussions that may result from processing this request. When your loan account is ungrouped, or split, into separate loans, the following may occur:


&gt;If you are paid ahead, you will lose your paid ahead status
    Your monthly payment amount may increase compared to when you had a single loan account (each account that is split out must have a minimum monthly payment of $50)


&gt;Many borrowers request that their accounts be split due to payment allocation concerns. For example, they may wish to pay off their highest interest rate loan first, or ensure that extra payments are directed to a specific loan disbursement, such as an unsubsidized loan. 

 
&gt;In these situations, Great Lakes recommends that you utilize the Excess Payment Preference option. By submitting an Excess Payment Preference, you will be able to automatically direct excess payments to the loan tokens of your choosing. More information can be found at our website, mygreatlakes.org.

 

&gt;If you still prefer to split your loan accounts, it is generally recommended that you :

&gt;Splitting your loan into individual accounts based on the same interest rate
    Splitting your loan into individual accounts based on subsidized or unsubsidized
     Splitting your loan by isolating the individual loan account(s) with the highest interest rate

&gt;If you wish to proceed with splitting your loan accounts, please advise us in what manner you would like your loan to be split. Please keep in mind that we can also accommodate borrowers who may consider splitting their loan accounts based on the following situations:

&gt;Splitting a loan due to participation in an employer’s loan repayment program

&gt;Splitting a loan to allow a third party (e.g., parents) to submit loan payments

&gt;Splitting a loan based on which school a disbursement was issued to

So what I'd like to do is pay the $50 (i read other people had $25 fees -_-) for the increase in monthly payment to focus an individual loan and pay that loan off, then rinse &amp; repeat so I can both target loans and reduce my monthly payment in the long term. Any idea on whether or not this will be possible, or will they tell me I won't be allowed to constantly have 1 account split at a time? 

Thanks for the help as always",finance
personalfinance,Buyer's remorse after trading in my underwater car,"Hello, having a hard time sleeping thinking I made a bad financial mistake. Traded in a car I've had for 1 year and 7 months for $6k with 6.6% interest rate when the payoff amount is $9800. Original loan was $13565/60 months. Got a used 2013 Honda accord for $17900/60 months with a 4.2% interest rate. Dealer was pushy and I felt duped looking at the contract. It looks like they used my 3k down payment to cover the negative equity and financing the accord with 0 down. I used to make $300 payments on my trade-in and with this newer car, $333. I really don't know what happened but I feel like it was a bad thing to do. Should I just pay the negative equity again since the car on KBB is only worth 11k and then sell it?",finance
personalfinance,I am a sophomore in college. Should I start taking subsidized loans out as they are offered for my junior and senior year?,"I have had my first year completely covered and it seems my second year will be covered as well by my FAFSA 100% Tuition Grant and my Federal Pell Grant (besides books, of course). A semester costs approximately $6000. I am currently being offered $2250 a semester in subsidized loans. Would it be financially wise to accept the $4500 a year and put it aside for next semester, just in case I don't get as lucky with grants as I did this year? Worst case scenario, I get no grants next year and I have to pay 12000 for the year. I would have the $4500 from this year and the $4500 I project to be offered next year in subsidized loans. If I happen to get covered by grants again next year, I can take the loan out again and I have a pocket $9000 plus a projected $4500 in subsidized loans for my last year, leaving $13500 for me to use on paying for my latter two semesters, and some leftover in case I need to take an extra semester. Also, wouldn't taking a subsidized loan be convenient in case I decide to take a summer semester in 2018, knowing FAFSA doesn't cover summers? I just don't see many cons in it besides not being confident in my ability to keep the money aside.

Forex,Understanding fundamentals and keeping a spreadsheet?,"Those of you who keep a spreadsheet for each currency and it's fundamental data, can you help me get started with one? I've been ignoring news and economic data but I want to start keeping track. As a purely technical trader, I don't know much about fundamentals but I want to start thinking like a fundamental trader. Not that I'm going to learn overnight but I want to be able to recognize the overall health of an economy and start thinking like the ""big players"". I have some questions below if anyone can help guide me, it would be much appreciated. 

* Should I only keep the high impact news in the spreadsheet or do the lower impact releases matter too? Keep in mind my goal is to foretell the health of an economy with these news releases and historic data, do the lower impact releases have an impact on the bigger picture even though they don't move the market much?

* Probably a dumb question but should I include interest rates on the spreadsheet? From the little I know, interest rates aren't changed that often and when they do it's not a huge jump but it does matter. I've also read somewhere that interest rate changes are already priced into the market months before the release. Is this true?

* Let's say I have spreadsheet with all data that's released, are there any calculations I can make that give me more information? Or do I just keep the data and not do anything with it?

* Is there anything not on an economic calendar that I should also keep track of? I'm not too bright in Economics right now but I'm reading books about it. It's just general economic stuff though, I don't know how to tie all together to determine currency price.

* Even dumber question but how do I keep track of things Trump says or does that could potentially move the market? I don't know if this even matters because the only time I've seen him significantly move the market was when the presidential election votes were being counted and when he launched those missiles and got a 3 kill streak.

* Also, just browsing through all the High impact news is overwhelming, can I find a list of everything that matters to keep track of it?

If there is anything important that I didn't mention, please enlighten me. I want to learn more on fundamentals so if there are any external sources, books, or videos that can help, please send them to me!",finance
economy,Shrinking the Fed’s Balance Sheet,,finance
Ripple,Ripple will hit parity with US dollar by December,"With $13.7 Trillion in globally negative yielding debt, we are treading on new territory, never previously seen by humanity ... ever, in commerce.

Negative yielding debt?  Imagine.  Would you lend $100,000 to anyone - even family - if the interest rate meant, instead of you receiving money, or being zero (aka family), that every month you (the ""Lender"") had to pay the borrower, more money?  Think about that! You lend someone, your hard earned dollars and then, month after month, instead of making a return on your money, you have to pay out more money?  Insanity.

This alone reflects the failing of the Western Central banking system; and has never previously been witnessed in 5000 years of recorded commerce; and not enough people are talking about it - period.

Like a tsunami of capital, this $13.7Trn in negative yielding debt will - and very soon - seek out a return; and, as we speak, has already begun this process of, ebbing out of the countries whose government bonds presently provide this negative yield (Japan, Germany, France, Europe). 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-02/negative-yielding-bonds-jump-to-almost-12-trillion-after-ebbing

If one wants to really understand from more than just a surface opinion on why the recent rally of crypto, one need only understand this very under-reported tidbit of data/knowledge.  A tsunami of capital, like a fire-hose, will find its way to other investments - it's that simple.  And while historically, precious metals juniors, cannabis stocks, crypto, etc. has been seen as a more ""risky"" investment, nothing is more risky than a guaranteed negative yield, like this government debt.

Lets be honest, countries like Japan, which have recently adopted Ripple in a big way, are already very well aware of such crisis' - even though general market may not be. Proof: Negative interest rates in Japan have driven up safe (physical vaults) sales up to 1000% of previous year sales (year after year).  Citizens are doing whatever they can to put their wealth somewhere and avoid paying bank fees.  Which guarantees the banks are scrambling to figure out how to reduce such fees; hence why block-chain is so so appealing.  Not to mention, why Ripple is being adopted left right and center all over the world; it is exactly, what the banks have been looking for.
http://fortune.com/2016/02/23/japans-negative-interest-rate-driving-up-safe-sales/

However, $13.7Trn in negative yielding debt, implicitly and absolutely points to a failing system - the hull is already taking on water, but nobody is paying attention. And as awareness grows of such failure, you can guarantee cryptographic commodities are also going to see the love - as they have been.  If banks weren't nervous themselves they wouldn't have implemented Bail-in legislation all over the world (in 2009 US; and 2013 Canada; and many other countries).  In the US and Canada the Bail-in provisions were the largest Acts ever passed in Congress, and you never heard a peep about it.  A financial jujitsu, where upon the next big crash happening, banks not expecting ""Bail-out"" monies to be enough, have passed law, to allow them to keep your hard earned deposits.  [A crash that Buffet, says could be 12-18 months away.]

And lets be honest with ourselves: If citizens are scrambling to store cash and physical bullion in a country, because of the growing awareness of such things, you can bet the banks get it! 

THE BIG TAKE AWAY
While saving on transactions costs is the primary alluring feature of Ripple, there lay an even more shiny gem within its heart - and it has not gone unmissed by those implementing it, be assured.  While these countries and central banks are money printing, ""attempting"" to pay interest obligations on ever increasing debts, you can bet they see that, $1B invested in XRP, instead of being thrown at debt interest, could be printed and invested and be worth 1000x in the future, or $1Trn NPV; solving many ""larger"" issues besides just institutional lending. :)  You can bet the ESF (in the US) is already, well invested in crypto (or is doing so), to do this very thing - aka make a fortune and pay off/erase national debts behind the curtain.

By Q4 of 2017 Ripple will hit at least $1.00, easily, reaching parity with the USD.  Why you ask?  Because the guys with the biggest wallets in the room will be doing the buying: banks, nations and elite families.  -- That's not a statement, or a sales pitch, it's a fact.

Now, is this just isolated to Ripple? Nope. All crypto will see love! However, Ripple, being introduced from the top down has the support of the elites, and as the richest families in the world begin buying, you can bet it will permanently skyrocket.

Banking,"[Question] What can I do about wells fargo? Long post,please help!","I'm at my breaking point with them. Literally every week my debit and bank account is getting flagged for fraud by their algorithm. They state there are suspicious transactions so they do this to protect me. Bull crap. 3 weeks ago it was a panda express that deactivated my card. You know how embarrassing it is in a drive through to tell the lady that I promise I have the money but my bank is run by dummies that don't know how to run a security program and to give me 10 minutes? This literally happens every week, a couple times when I call I've been told ""you know you can let us know online when you're traveling so this doesn't happens and I usually let them know that's helpful but I've been in my town and not left it in over a year which was before I had them. They then tell me that I should setup security alerts, which by the way I have! I have never received a text and it's not my phone company I receive all other short codes and I even had my phone provider double check the black list just to make sure! They say they will open a ticket, which does nothing and is just probably the csr  doing nothing. This literally happens on a weekly bases.

The straw that finally broke the camels back, was last week, just like every other month I had my phone bill setup to withdraw the money on its due date through auto pay. I go to make a purchase of an online course which they make you do through PayPal. I opened up my PayPal account on my laptop attempt to make the purchase and it's declined. Yay here we go again.  Pick up my cell phone to make a call and my call is routed directly to my cell phone carrier. Okay? They decide to inform me that my account was suspended for not paying the bill. Weird I have auto pay, I have them run it again and declined again. So I have them setup a payment arrangement to get services activated until i can get the bank stuff figuered out and I get charged a 140 reactivation fee which they and their supervisor won't wave. So I call wells Fargo, tell them to unblock my account. Verify transactions, I inform them that they blocked my auto pay to my phone provider and asked why when I had more than enough money. They state it looked like fraud because the payment had an address with an out of state address. I ask them it, and ask what my other payments to them address is, and it's the same address. I looked up that address and it's their corporate address of course.so I tell the guy I got charged 140 to reactivate my account because of their mess up  and I want them to reimburse me. He states he cannot and that I should have responded to their security message that I never got. Cool, I'm done and gone with wf at this point and I ask for a supervisor and he transfers me to the fraud department supervisor. I tell him to stop blocking my stiff and to give me my 140 bucks back or else I'm gone. He states he can't and that it's my fault it was blocked because I didn't call them when the payment was declined online. I tell him how was I supposed to know? He states I should have got a decline message and called them, I tell him it was an automatic payment that's always been setup. He shuts up real quick and them says it doesn't make sense. I explain to him I'm not the one responsible for this, your company is for blocking a valid transaction when I had enough funds to pay that bill. He let's me know that he is at the bottom of the totem pole but he will send it up to the executive team to call me.  He then gets smart with me and tells me they didn't block the PayPal transaction that it was PayPal. The PayPal error said my bank blocked it and to call them. So I tell him he is dumb and to unblock my account and I will run the transaction again with him on the phone to see if it goes through, he unblock it, I pay and guess what it went through! I then hangup on him...

Sorry this is so long I'm just very frustrated... a couple days later I get a call from the executive team. They emphasize and do nothing. They make the same mistake of not realizing this was auto pay and that it looked like fraud so they blocked it. They let me know they can refund charges that I've been billed through them but then tell me I'm a great customer, never over drafted and the only fee they can refund is a $2 atm charge if I'd like that. What an insult, I let them know I'm going to consult with a lawyer and hangup. I then file complaints with the bbb and the federal reserve, I get a response back that I'll receive a call from the presidents or whatever office. They call and say sorry, should responded to the text.  I hangup. I'm done, I've opened up a new account, switched direct deposit, cancelled all my auto pays. 

What can I do now? I feel defeated. I'm not getting anywhere. Sure I could consult a lawyer, or go to small claims court, but that will cost me more money then the original 140. I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here, if I didn't have the money then sure it's on me, but that's not the case. I literally don't know what I could have done differently outside of just not banking with wells Fargo. Should I try to go to the media? Public? I don't know if there are any laws pertaining to this so any help is appreciated",finance

personalfinance,Tuition Reimbursement Tax Question,"Hello PF. So I am currently working for a company and getting my MBA part-time from a pretty prestigious (expensive) university. I chose this school because my employer offers 100% tuition reimbursement for A's and 80% for B's. The way the system works is I pay for 6 weeks of classes up front with my own money, I turn in the grades for the classes to my employer, then get a check back for the amount.

My question is about the Tax aspect of this entire transaction. So under federal law, approx $5200 of tuition reimbursement in a calendar year is tax exempt however, I have to pay taxes on any amount over this limit. This is pretty substantial since the tax rate is coming out to be about 44% because it is taxed as if I am receiving this amount as a normal paycheck. So my question is am I being double taxed since I have to pay taxes on my income and then on the reimbursement that I receive from paying with that income? Will this all get refunded to me when I do my taxes next year? Does anyone have an experience like this with tuition reimbursement and taxes?",finance

btc,Why DOGE is a perfect complement for Bitcoin,"Bitcoin was born out of frustration with the Fed bank bailouts and remains true to that purpose. It is a strictly deflationary long term store of value.

However, in order to protect that status, it must remain lean, expensive, immutable, and - over time - largely unaffordable. It is, ironically, the Berkshire Hathaway of cryptocurrencies, and will probably stay that way forever.  

People can talk all they want about Litecoin and ETH - indeed they love to. But Bitcoin doesn't need to ""learn"" from these tokens... except to learn that inflation is a bad idea, smart contracts don't belong in your money supply, and segwit actually works.

DOGE, on the other hand offers a unique value statement: it is not intended to be a store of value. It has runaway inflation, a limitless money supply, and a surprisingly strong and active user base.

What DOGE is *great* at is : *cheap fast transactions*. By the very definition of DOGE transactions will always be cheap. With its *1 minute block time* and minimum viable fee of .000002 cents .... DOGE is the perfect solution to the ""cheap transaction"" problem. It kills ETH, BTC or any other token for cheap transactions.

Nobody will ever use DOGE as a store of value, so you don't have to worry about holding it. Just buy and sell coffee all day long.

And when you have an extra $2 to pay for fees.... deposit to your deflationary, uncensorable BTC wallet for wealth preservation.

Until segwit happens and lightning works or until ETH shards and goes PoS or whatever... DOGE seems like the best currency for cheap transactions. 

The next time someone bitches about fees in bitcoin: tell them to use DOGE until Bitcoin gets a working layer 2 system. *Indeed DOGE can be bitcoin's layer 2.*",cryptocurrency

Some notes: I'm still on my parents health insurance. I will be buying a car - financing about $10,000. I will put 3,000 of my savings plus my signing bonus of ~3000 (bonus is $5000 -tax) as the down payment. I project somewhere around 2000 for furnishing my apartment and other misc travel expenses (The company pays for moving company, temporary storage, and my flight). I haven't signed a lease yet. I have a roommate moving out with me, and 1,300/person seems like an upper bound in Downtown Portland for what we're looking at.  I know that some apartments will require 1st month, last month, &amp; security deposit upon signing. Additionally, I'm granted 30 days free temporary housing - so I'll have a 2 pay check buffer before I need to incur some of these moving expenses. 

Eye-balling my plan, what am I missing and where do you see problems? What changes would you make?  

I know this is a lot of info, and I would appreciate any input! Please let me know if anything is unclear or I've made some wild assumption. If nothing comes, at least I was able to collect my thoughts.

personalfinance,How do I select funds for my Vanguard Roth IRA?,"Hi Reddit,

I decided to start a Roth IRA and made a payment of 350 dollars towards it. Now I want to select some funds and Vanguard customer service person said there are minimums of $1000, $3000 and even $10000. Right now I can see that the money is being held in ""Federal Money Market (Settlement fund)"".

As the title says I have 20k in a savings account, 2.9k in checking, 3 credit cards that are fully paid every month back to 0. Total combined limit is 18k credit, unsure of interest rates on them as I never intend on accruing any. Credit is 800+. I have an IRA that's doing nothing (rolled over 401k I didn't know I had from when I was a kid) in the amount of 2.5k. No mutual funds, I know nothing of the stock market (and it terrifies me), no CDs, nothing. 

I owe 120k on my home which is at 3.2% on a 30 yr repayment. Home is valued at 152k. I owe 12k in student loan debt, 3 loans at 6.55% and one at 4.25%. I have a car loan from 2 years ago, 2012 Civic Si, 26k miles on it, balance is 10.4k at 6.9% (first auto loan ever, I qualify for 1.95% if I refinance).

I live with my gf (of 9 years, known for 15. We are basically married)  who often splits our bills, there's been 2 times in the past 2 years she hasn't been able to. She however has been living paycheck to paycheck for 5 years and it's taken her that long to save 3k.

The question: What do I do? After thinking things over, what I believe to be the best option would be to throw 12k at my student loans and be done with them and refi my car. What's holding me back there is that while a car is a depreciating asset, it's still an asset. I've always heard the phrase ""pay yourself first"" so would paying off the car and refi'ing ST loans (if possible)  be a better move? Or would a better move be to refi BOTH and invest in something... or stay the course since worst case scenario monthly bills are 2500 x 6mo is 15000, which I like to have 2k in checking at all times in the event of an emergency so 17k.

personalfinance,Sally Mae/Navient,"Hello All! I have looked through the credit wiki and repair and don't know how it can help this specific problem. I took out a private student loan in 2008 and defaulted after graduation. I pulled all my federal student loans from the company because they weren't working with me. I could not pull the private student loan away. :/

I've been paying a CA for this debt for almost two years. In total, I've paid them around $1900. Here's the problem Navient moved my debt to a different agency. I was dumb and have lost the papers from the original agency, so have no proof, but I paid them $1000 dollars and got the debt down to $5300, at the original CA. Great right?! Wrong!

I moved banks and have been attempting to repair my credit. I noticed that the amount was in the $6000, on my credit report. I called the agency listed to ask them what happened and they said Navient moved the debt to somewhere else. I needed to speak to Navient about how they are reporting on my credit report. I call Navient and they say I need to speak to the CA, but it's all listed under navient. Are they playing games? Should I take a settlement amount, in the future, if there is potentially a class action lawsuit? Or should I just continue to hack away at the amount they say I owe, paying in full?

Next question....it shows up on my credit report as unpaid not paying on Navient's end! Although the amount does change monthly after a payment! All says charged off. Is there anything I can do? 

(Principal amount- $3980, w/ interest- $7200, current-$5989) 2 initial payments of $500=$1000 then $50 payments. I was looking to increase payments and discovered all of this. Didn't increase because I was angry and thought what's the point if they are going to pull the debt in a year again increasing it! 

I'm in Michigan and class action lawsuit isn't here yet either.

Which of the following scenarios makes more sense?

1. Take out car loan now with the hope that it will play into getting me a lower interest rate on a future home loan due to the improved credit history and save money in the long run.

2. Forget buying another car, make what I currently have work for me and continue to save the money that I would have otherwise spent on the new vehicle.

personalfinance,Will we save money by getting married?,"Hey there, PF. My fiancé and I have been together for four years. We've lived together for three of them and been engaged for a month. It's going to be a while before we can afford a formal wedding because we'd rather use the money elsewhere right now, but we *do* want to have a real wedding and we're not opposed to a lengthy engagement. What we're trying to determine is whether there's a fiscal benefit to quickly getting married on paper and celebrating our marriage later. If there's a substantial savings to be had from being legally married then we can divert that savings to pay for the wedding or whatever other budgetary line items we've got.

Some quick numbers:

* Income #1 (me): $100,000/year paying $163/month into health benefits with no deductible (would increase to $244/month to add my partner to my plan)
* Income #2 (my partner): $40,000 paying $275/month out of pocket for insurance on the healthcare marketplace with a high deductible
* Tax stuff: He owns his home outright with a small home equity loan that we took out for some renovations (remaining balance $16,000)
* Car insurance: I pay $110/month on my own policy and he pays $84/month for the same coverage. I’m planning on moving over to his insurance at the end of the year when my car is paid off and they quoted us at $105/month if we are unwed and said that there would be additional savings if we’re married but that she couldn’t calculate it without us actually being married
* Financial aid: He recently opted to go back to school (previously made the same salary as me, took a large paycut for it) and anticipates having to take out student loans for medical school once he finishes whatever prerequisites we’ve been paying for out of pocket. We don’t anticipate him being eligible for any financial aid since he owns property, but if my income would affect his ability to secure financial aid then we need to weigh that into our decision
* Credit Scores: Mine is right around 800 and his is in the mid-600s with some normal fluctuation. We anticipate taking out another home equity loan in roughly 18 months to redo our kitchen. My creditworthiness would likely affect the interest rates

We’ve calculated a savings of $2300 just on health insurance but can’t seem to figure out whether our income tax and deductions would be grossly affected by marrying now. So whadya think? Are there more savings that we haven't figured out, or is it just the 2k on insurance that we'd be saving?",finance
personalfinance,Home-buying: Borrowing for down payment?,"I am looking into buying a house as an investment (rental property). My budget for a home is about $300-400K, and I'd like to put 20% down, so $60-80K cash. I think my question ultimately comes down to borrowing for the down payment. My situation is the following.

&amp;nbsp;

Previously, I was investing (non retirement) money using Wealthfront. I divested because I intended to place a down payment within the next 1-2 years, and wanted to avoid market volatility (1-2 years is convention, right?). They recently announced a [service](https://www.wealthfront.com/portfolio-line-of-credit) where they will provide a line of credit up to 30% of your portfolio at 3.25-4.5% interest rate, and I'm considering another option (hence this post).

&amp;nbsp;

My current situation is the following:

* I have about $50K in cash (because I divested), and I don't like having cash.
* I believe I could have another $50K in about 2-3 years, placing my portfolio at &gt;= $100K (depending on market), allowing me to take advantage of Wealthfront's line of credit (while keeping my money invested).
* I have a partner willing to split the deposit with me.


What I believe my options are:

* Don't use the line of credit. Buy a house sooner, with down payment coming straight out of pocket
* Use the line of credit. Requires me to wait till my portfolio is &gt;= $100K in order to buy, but allows me keep my cash invested. The interest rate Wealthfront offers (3.25-4.5%) seems attractive, at a rate that is much less than the historical return of the US stock market.

So my main questions are:

* What would be the pros/cons of using Wealthfront's credit (and leverage in general) on a down payment?
* Specifically, what are the risks?
* Is this a common thing to do?
* Any opinions / suggestions on this idea?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading, I hope everything is clear. Would love opinions and advice. 

Edit: formatting (thanks LineBreakBot!)

Edit2: Is this something that's even possible? Commenters have mentioned borrowing for a down payment isn't an option. However, on Wealthfront's line of credit [page](https://www.wealthfront.com/portfolio-line-of-credit), down-payment is the first thing they mention.",finance

Should I use it to refinance some of my other bad debt?,"I'm starting a Masters program next month and was awarded over 20k in fed loans for the year. The total cost of tuition and fees should only be about 10k, books probably another 1k. Basically I'm going to be left with about 9k in refund money. I've thought up a few strategies in how I can use this, tell me which you think is best:

1. Store it away in a savings account and keep it just in case I can't get fedloans for my second year in the program (my income won't change, but the political environment surrounding fedloans might). If I end up not needing it, pay it on my fedloans to reduce the amount owed.

2. I have a private student loan I took out for my undergrad that I defaulted on about three years ago. It's currently in collections for $25k. I could call them up and offer a settlement value of 9k and pay-for-delete, effectively refinancing that.

3. I have a nasty car loan I took out about 2.5 years ago when my credit was shot (see defaulted loan above) and it has a terrible interest rate. 15.47%. I still owe 7.5k on it and have another 3.5 years of $240/month payments. I could pay that off completely and free up another $240/month for saving/debt reduction. I also have about $900 I still owe on lease-end charges from my last lease that I can pay off.

4. I currently have about 3k in credit card debt, all currently on 0% APR cards. I could pay those off before they start charging me interest.

5. My wife has a 29k private loan with Navient that we could make a dent in. We are currently paying $320/month across four different loans, 2k, 5k, 10k, and 12k. We could pay off the 2k and 5k ones which would reduce our monthly payment to probably $250.

I feel like the obvious choice is to pay off the 15.47% APR car loan. It would free up $240/month for us to pay down other debts or save up for an emergency fund (currently only have $500 in that...). I just want to see what advice PF has, if it differs, as I'm wondering if with this being a fedloan there may be different recommendations.",finance

You folks very quickly poked a massive hole in this logic - IRS debt is not dischargeable, making it pointless to consider.

 Hi all! 

I've been struggling with debt for about three years now and I've done very little to fix the situation (I'm an idiot). I was earning $30k but last month got promoted to $42k, so I actually feel like I can do this now. 

All the figures below are approximates: 

$10k - IRS (long story!) 
$10k - personal loan
$4k credit card debt
$1k medical debt

Rent is about to become $800/m when I move in a couple months, on the flip side I don't pay utilities at the new place so other costs are just internet and cell phone (no car btw), so total $150 ish in expenses. I make about $2000 a month. 

I know I need to get more precise with what I owe and what interest rates are on these debts. But right now I wanted to get your opinion on bankruptcy. My friend thinks I should consider it, she said she had to do it and it worked out fine (her credit score is back up after 5 or so years).

I took on my debt at a time when I worked for my sister. I made a lot of money in the job, and stupidly took out loans to buy nice things. We split ways rather abruptly (over two years ago), which left me with the tax burden of the previous years high income (that's part of why I owe to the IRS, the other part is me not paying enough tax last year cuz I didn't understand how much to withhold from my paycheck!)

Thing is I know if I budget hard core and work at it I could pay off my debts in about 5 or so years. But I also feel like I have little to lose if I file for bankruptcy. Yes I'll carry that stigma with me, but I will eventually recover. 

I'd really like to know what you folks think. I live in PA if that helps anyone.

personalfinance,20% equity or clear credit card debt?,"Long time lurker first time poster to this sub. You guys helped a ton since I was fresh out of college giving me the right mentality in dealing with money and debt so now I'm hoping you could give insight on a current predicament.

I'm currently buying a house and, with the sale of my current house, I'll have exactly enough equity for 20% downpayment. That being said, I'm planning on only staying in this house for about 15 years.


So the predicament is this: I have about $27k in credit card debit, spread across 4 credit cards, each with a minimum of about $400. I can either use all the capital and put down 20% on the new house OR put 15% down and use the remaining capital to clear out 3 of the 4 credit cards and reduce the last by about 25%.

I'm leaning towards the 2nd option. My rational is that 1) I'll save money on the vastly lower interest rate on the mortgage compared to the same amount of cash but higher interest on credit cards and 2) I'll have substantially more cash on hand every month to cover the PMI on the house and then even put about $1,000/month to savings.

From the May 31, 2017 opinion in U.S. v. Ulbricht, issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:

&amp;nbsp;

The federal appeals court noted that Silk Road transactions used ""**Bitcoins, an anonymous but traceable digital currency**,"" and then expanded in a footnote:

&amp;nbsp;

""Bitcoins allow vendors and customers to maintain their anonymity in the same way that cash does, by transferring Bitcoins between anonymous Bitcoin accounts, which do not contain any identifying information about the user of each account. The currency is “traceable” in that the transaction history of each individual Bitcoin is logged in what is called the blockchain. The blockchain prevents a person from spending the same Bitcoin twice, allowing Bitcoin to operate similarly to a traditional form of currency. Bitcoin is also a completely decentralized currency, operating free of nation states or central banks; anyone who downloads the Bitcoin software becomes part of the Bitcoin network. The blockchain is stored on that network, and the blockchain automatically “self- updates” when a Bitcoin transaction takes place.""

personalfinance,Panic attacks after seeing my bank balance/updating my budget.,"Hello. 

I'm very up in the air right now, panicking, so I'll try to structure this as clearly as possible.

I was off work, sick, for the best part of last year. Doing so reduced my salary and I had to dip into my savings each month to keep myself afloat and the bills paid. I went back to work at the end of the year, and slowly got back into full time. We then were evicted from our home (Nothing to do with us, Landlord had a meltdown and sold everything). So we had to move into another place that was offered to us, slightly more expensive, and non furnished. Stupidly, rather than admitting to my fiancé that I was very low on cash (I had done this when we were young, and the look on her face when I told her I was broke and needed her help nearly broke my heart. It was that of sheer disappointment, I can't face that again) I decided to do my part of the shopping with downpayment plans. That's not the worst, though. I then saw how much was coming out, was missing payments due to bills coming from all over the place and decided that I wanted to consolidate them into one fixed payment. So I took out a loan. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Didn't bother to check the interest rate because I was closing in on bills that I couldn't pay and people that I owed money. Of the 434 euro I have to pay each month, 380 of that is interest. I have this for 25 years. 

Then a series of accidents happened with my dog, meaning I maxed out my credit card also. 

I've emailed all of the companies I owe money to and asked if they can either freeze my accounts temporarily or lower the amount that I pay back each month. Is there anything else that I can do? I'm having panic attacks daily just thinking of this mess. I bring home between 1800-2000 euro each month. 

Please, any help is appreciated. I know I'm a world class fool, so please don't berate me any more than I'm doing to myself.",finance

personalfinance,"Have an employer pension, still max out 401k/IRA?","I'm a federal government civilian who's been finding himself relatively cash flow light recently. I know the collective wisdom of PF and most of the other personal finance blogs and subreddits is to always maximize your 401k (TSP in my case) and IRA. I want to lower my contribution rate to my TSP, but I feel guilty about dropping it.

Stats (rounding numbers a bit):

* Age: 28

* Years of Service: 6

* Salary: $80,000 (will be bumping to $95,000 in a few months)

* Bi-weekly gross pay: $3,050

* Personal TSP contribution: $500 (16.3% of gross) (I also realize this isn't maxed, I plan on actually setting it at $692 when I get the promotion/raise)

* FERS retirement contribution: $135

* Roth IRA saving/investing (I max out the $5,500 every year, this is saving to invest next year): $215/paycheck

* TSP Balance: $35,000 (in retirement target fund)

* Roth IRA: $19,000 (in retirement target fund)

* Online savings: $14,000

By my math, that's a 27.7% savings rate, which seems pretty good as is, let alone that the FERS retirement pension is 1%/year service of the average of your 3 highest salaries.

So, my questions:

1. Can I lower my TSP contribution rate? If so, any suggestions on where I should set it (as long as it's the 5% for full matching)?

2. How should I factor in my FERS retirement for total retirement planning? Are there any guides or tips on how to consider pensions (beyond Social Security) when retiring?

3. Am I at a point where I should switch my Roth IRA to a traditional? If so, should I re-characterize my 2017 contributions as traditional?

personalfinance,New Grad Making 40k CAD in Toronto,"Looking for some budget help. I'm starting my first post grad job in July and it's paying 40k a year. It isn't much but it's in the pharmaceutical industry and the position leads directly into sales rep so it's a very good start. Until I achieve that promotion I need help with me budget. 


I just graduated from University. 


15k student loan at (I think) 3.5% interest. 


I have two or three months of no rent, utilities or any other expenses of pay (living with my cousin until I save up a bit).


 I spend 500 a month on food. This includes my going to bars, restaurants, etc money. 


I want to spend 1000/month on rent. I think I could get by with 1100. I will be living with a roommate so we'll split a two bedroom place (1900-2200 total rent). 


Other monthly expenses (phone, internet, gym, etc...) would total up to 300ish. 


So my total monthly expenses would be 1800. Let's say 1900 to be safe. That gives me on a tax rate of 20.05% (5.05 provincial and 15 federal) about 700 of spare money. 


How much should I negotiate on my student loan fees? Again my position leads directly into a sales rep position in pharmaceuticals so I don't mind paying less and ramping up once I make the big sales rep money. 


Do my numbers make sense?

For reference I live in Toronto and want to live near downtown. If I wanted to live in the suburbs I wouldn't of moved here I would've stayed where I was and been miserable.

personalfinance,"Rental Scam, domestic bank account","Hi, 

Need a bit of help with a rental scam that I go into while ironically searching for housing for a financial advising position in Chicago.

So, essentially I got scammed 600 from someone who offered rent in a house in the location I will be interning. I had been in contact with them via email and received pictures and reversed imaged searched them to ensure they weren't take off Google, and asked for passport image which I had gotten and in which white pages showed was consistent with a person living in that general area. That being said, I felt I had done my due diligence and after receiving the routing and banking number of Wood Forrest National Bank, which is a domestic bank, I felt that all seemed in line, despite the emailers poor English which being an immigrant I didn't want to hold against him.

That being said, I sent him 600 from my small federal union to the name given in the passport to Wood Forrest National Bank. However, after receiving the payment he asked for another month of rent because another tenant wanted the apartment and he told me to send it via the Western Union in which case, I automatically knew it was a scam.

So, in trying to reverse my payment I called my bank and they said nothing could be done since it was an electronic transfer and it has been cleared (contacted them two days after sending). Then I called WoodForrest and they told me to forward them all relevant information to their phishing email. I was wondering if you had any other ideas on how I could reverse that payment or get it back since it is a domestic bank and should really have internal controls.

any help would be appreciated, I don't appreciate losing $600, but, at the same time, it's a sum that I thankfully can afford to lose.",finance
personalfinance,When to refinance a car loan?,"So I am in the process of building my credit. I am pushing 50, and for most of my life lived paycheck to paycheck working nearly menial jobs that barely afforded me the ability to pay bills and little more. Poor life choices and all that.

A little backstory. Cut to a few years ago. I really, really got tired of it, so I dropped everything, cut ties with 95% of the people I knew, and moved across the country to start a new life. I knew no one, and intended to not fall back into the same rut so insisted to myself that whatever I did, was going to be something I had never done before.

I did. Within a month I had a job with a company that was *almost* exactly that. (I had part-timed a similar type of job back around 2000 but for all intents and purposes, this was going to be all new.) I was starting the job making nearly 5 bucks an hour more than I was just a month beforehand, getting the hours I needed to actually make a living, and feeling good about myself and life in general.

Cut to today. I am making weekly paychecks that almost equal my monthly pay a few years ago, and have another small raise coming next month. So now that I am making decent money, I am seeing that finally, I am able to do something beyond week to week survival. About 9 months or so ago, at the behest of one of the remaining 5% of people from 'before', I began to look into my credit situation. As expected, it was poor, because essentially there was nothing. I had two entries in collections and a child support entry, and a score of 525. I paid off the two collection accounts (they were less than $500 total), and a month or so later they were gone and my score hit 600.

Next up, I got a secured discover card. And just for the hell of it applied for a regular capital one card- which I got, $1000 unsecured. I keep up on them and try like hell to carry less than 5% at statement time. I also traded in my old ride for a new one a couple of months ago, which curiously has not affected my score at all,, aside from the few points for the hard inquiries for financing.

Well suffice it to say that I am getting beat up on interest. I was told by the salesman and finance manager that it was going to happen, because I had a very thin file and absolutely nothing on it regarding making payments on an installment loan. OK, I figured, even with the absurd interest, I need to have the loan on my report so I can develop a history- my goal is to buy a house within the next 5 or so years.

So here I am, paying almost 21% on a car loan for $32k. Payments are $780/mo, which I can afford; I am also putting aside enough to make an extra payment towards principal every other month (3 payments every 2 months.) It hurts to do it (both the extra payment, as well as suffer the interest rate), but I look at it as a necessary evil towards achieving my end game. But needless to say, I don't want to continue this any longer than necessary. 

Since I am new to the whole credit game, I play the nerdwallet and credit karma game every payday (they update when I get paid.) I always see things that tell me I should refinance. My question is, when is the time? Should I attempt it right now? I have had my new ride for a month and a half and have only made one payment. Also, I got a few aftermarket accessories for it and put them on my credit card, but timed it bad and it all hit right when the statement rolled around, so I had high utilization and lost almost 50 points which dropped me to just under 630.

Or, should I keep on keeping on, get some payments under my belt and get my score back to the 700+ range, before I attempt to refinance?

Also, what are the ramifications (if any) of refinancing? I would assume minimal if any, but if there are negatives associated with it then would they be balanced out by the monthly savings I could hope to see over time by refinancing?",finance

personalfinance,To Buy or To Rent,"To Buy or To Rent

So, my husband and I are wondering whether or not we should buy a house or rent at the place we are moving to. He will be going to the police academy in a town in NJ and we will live there for more than 10 years or possible until he retires. However, we do not know if we should buy the house right off the bat or rent for a year or more. He was born and raised in that town so he knows his way around so picking a neighborhood would not be the problem. We want advise purely regarding the financial aspect. I will state the factors below and I would appreciate it if you could tell me what makes better financial sense.

 

In the town we are moving to,

If RENT,

Average

$1800 - $2000

1200 sqft

2b 2b

3 options

 

If BUY,

Under $ 350,000

Average

2000 sqft

3b+ 2b+

More than 30 options

 

To buy, according to the mortgage calculator, the monthly payment for $350,000 home will look like,

$70,000 down payment (currently sitting in savings)

3.2% (assuming) interest rate

$656 tax (NJ 2.25%)

$ 67 insurance

= $1934/month

*will be $1667/month if we buy a $300,000 home

*plus possibly additional cost of owning a house (something breaking down, buying appliances)

 

For our finances,

·         760+ credit score

·         $200,000+ in savings and mutual funds

·         No loans

·         Including my income and husband’s income (which may include BAH)

$8300/month (for six months) – in the academy

$7900/month (for one year) – on probation

$7700/month (for two more years) - the latter two years of first three years pay if no raise

*possibly a raise in there somewhere
*The reason it might go down is because of GI bill. 

Other factors:

*I am planning to go back to school in-state with some of the savings (estimating $35,000 total) and will try to get scholarships or some form of aid (no loans).",finance
personalfinance,"Got married May 22nd, started new job June 1st = worried about messing up new W-4","I recently got married and started a new job. I'm filling out the W-4 and I'm using the IRS Withholding Calculator to try and determine how much I should withhold per check to make sure I'm covered at tax time, but I get a bit confused on what *specific* numbers to use and was hoping to get a spot check that I'm not mucking it all up. Here's what I'm (loosely) dealing with:

Me: 100k yearly salary

Wife: 42k yearly salary

We're going to do a joint filing. We have no children and own a condo.

On the calculator, the first line states ""*Enter the gross wages, salary, and tips you expect to receive in 2017*"", to which I put 66,666 (since I expect to be paid my salary over the remaining 8 months and not the total 12). This is the part I'm not 100% of because there's a line later on the calculator that asks when I started the job in 2017. My paranoia stems from that line because it makes me think that I should put my entire salary amount on the first line and the mid-year start date would automatically update the calculator to use the appropriate tax amount based on the salary I would require for the remainder of the year. I don't think that's right, but figured I should mention it. Also, since I started the job 2 days ago, I have not received a paycheck yet (get paid twice a month), so the lines that ask for amount of tax paid and such are all 0. 

When I input all of the figures in to the calculator, using the 66k amount for the first line, it said to claim 0 allowances and withhold an additional $581 for 2017 (about $33 a paycheck). That feels oddly low to me (no real reason behind that), so I was thinking maybe just withholding an additional 100 a paycheck just to make sure I'm completely covered?

I would majorly appreciate any assistance that calms my anxiety, haha.

Thanks!

I did enter my wife's relevant salary/tax/etc information in to the calculator. She's been at the job for the full year and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,Real Estate Investing Question (not Noob - but would like some advice),"Here's the deal: I have a personal residence that I owe 260K on, which is conservatively worth 360-375 today. I've owned and lived in it for 1 year and 9 months. My plan was to sell, and put this money into another property - mainly because I did an FHA loan, which includes lifetime dreaded PMI and not a wonderful interest rate. 

I own 4 other rental properties (SFR) at good rates, with plenty of equity (just purchased one with cash, one has 11.5 years left on a 15 year note, one I just did a cash out refinance to purchase the one that's paid off, and the other has 23 years left on a 30 year note... total equity is around 400K in the rentals combined.

I'm thinking in October, with the ""tax free windfall"" of 100K or so from the sale of my primary, I have some options:

1. Purchase another home. Put down 100K on a 500K house that needs a little work (I live in St Louis - so this would be a very large nice house that simply needs some updating).

2. Put the money into a 4Plex which would generate some decent cash flow... and then rent a 3BR loft (I live with fiancée and 2 kids).

3. Inst ad of selling the primary, refinance and do a 15 year note, which would pay down 25-28K into the loan over the next 2 years, live here during that time frame.

4. Rent the primary (and do a refinance, live in a different location by renting). 

Our temptation is to cash out and buy another one, but we both like property - and enjoy acquiring, fixing up, and this would seem like a good opportunity to get either a duplex or two, or a nice fourplex in what seems like an up and coming market (St Louis). 

Thoughts? Of course, we'd love to own a 4 plea and another primary, but it would seem difficult unless we can show the income for 2 years from the investment in order to qualify for both.",finance
personalfinance,"New tax lien showed up on my credit report for 90,000$!","Hi,

let me make a long story short. back in 2008 I had a business that went under. I couldnt pay the taxes that year and currently owe about 50k in back taxes from that time. 45 for federal, 5k for state.

I havent been able to pay those taxes and for the past 8 years or so I've been skirting by, doing odd jobs to keep me afloat. I haven't filed a tax return in about 2-3 years since I've made less than 10k a year and most of that money I made came from odd jobs and paypal and I have no real way of proving my income.

personalfinance,"Reminder: If you are a dependent with a summer job, you may be able to use a higher allowances number than 1 on your W-4","This is a post for people who are dependents and who have summer jobs as their only source of income. 

If you will earn under $6350 for the year at a W-2 job, and you have no other sources of income, and you did not have any tax last year, you can use Form W-4 line 7 and write ""Exempt"" to prevent any federal income tax from being taken from your paychecks. That's because if you earn under $6350, your standard deduction amount as a dependent will be greater than your income, so you won't have taxable income and won't owe federal income tax.

But if you will earn over $6350, or you did have tax last year, you are not allowed to use the line 7 ""Exempt"" option. You need to figure out what allowances figure to write on Form W-4 line 5 so that the amount of federal income tax that gets taken from paychecks is not too much. 

If you simply follow the instructions for Form W-4 without considering that you are earning for only part of the year, you might find it suggesting that you use ""1"" allowance on line 5 if you are a dependent. This is likely to take out too much withholding if you are only working part of the year. 

Any amount beyond what you actually owe as federal income tax would get returned to you as a refund when you file your taxes, but perhaps you'd like to not overpay in the first place and would rather see more take-home pay in your paychecks. If so, the material below helps explain why you can use a larger allowances number and how to figure it out.

---

Let's suppose you're earning $600/week and are getting paid biweekly. For example, you might be working 30 hours at $20/hr or you might be working 40 hours at $15/hr. Also, let's say you will be working 14 weeks during the summer, so you will have 7 biweekly paychecks.

First, let's look at what your actual federal income tax will be. 

gross wages = $1200 biweekly * 7 paychecks = $8400

Your standard deduction as a dependent with more than $6350 income is going to be $6350. This is an amount that will not be subject to federal income tax.

taxable income = $8400 – $6350 = $2050

You'll find your income tax by using a tax table. Your first $9325 of taxable income get taxed at 10%, so your income tax would be $206. (You might think it should be $205, but anyone in the $2050-$2075 range gets taxed as if their income is the midpoint, $2062.50, and 10% of that rounds to $206.)

So if your income tax is $206, and you have 7 paychecks, you would want to have $29 or $30 taken from each paycheck.

---

What happens if you simply use 1 allowance on your Form W-4, as the lines A-H imply?

The withholding algorithm works by looking at your paycheck gross and multiplying it by the total number of paychecks you would get in a full year. It uses that value as an estimate of your annual income. 

$1200 biweekly * 26 paychecks = $31200

The algorithm them calculates what the taxable income would be for such an earner, based on the allowances number provided on the W-4.

taxable income = $31200 – $6350 = $24850

Then it figures out the income tax on the taxable income. It uses $24875 as the taxable income, because anyone with taxable income in the $24850-$24900 range is treated as if they earn the midpoint of that range.

tax on $24875 taxable income = 10% * $9325 + 15% * $15550 = $932.50 + $2332.50 = $3265

The algorithm then supposes that if $3265 is your total tax for the year, you should pay $3265/26, or about $126 per paycheck, which means about $879 total across 7 paychecks.

So, if you were to write ""1"" allowance on your Form W-4, you'd find that about $126 will be taken out of every paycheck. 

But you really need only about $30 taken out of every paycheck, because your annual income is a lot less than $31200.

**Key idea** These two numbers are NOT the same:

* 7/26 of the tax on someone earning $31200 = $879

* The tax on someone earning 7/26 of $31200 = $206

The first amount is what would be taken via withholding if you blindly use ""1"" allowance on your Form W-4 during the summer job. You might not want to overpay so much.

---

So how do you get the withholding algorithm to take out only $30 per paycheck instead of $126 per paycheck?

Look inside [IRS Publication 15](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf). It has tables that show what amount will be withheld based on your filing status (single), your paycheck gross ($1200), and your paycheck frequency (biweekly). 

Here is the row for people earning 1200-1220 biweekly, from page 52 of Publication 15.

    Allowances:  0   1   2  3  4  5  6 7 8
    Withheld:  150 127 104 80 57 34 19 3 0

As expected, the amount withheld if you use ""1"" allowance is $127. From this table, it's apparent that you should use ""5"" allowances to have about $34 taken from each paycheck. This is a little bit more than the $29 or $30 you ideally would want withheld, but the result will be a small refund.

You'd pay $34 * 7 paychecks = $238

You'd owe $206 federal income tax.

You'd get a refund of $238 – $206 = $32.

This way, you'll see about $93 more in take-home pay in each biweekly paycheck!

---

Technically, if you owe under $1000 in federal income tax, you could just pay your entire tax at April tax deadline and not have any withholding and not be exposed to any underpayment penalty. So if you wanted to, you could choose ""8"" allowances to force no withholding, and then just pay your entire $206 tax at tax time. You could legitimately do that rather than incorrectly using line 7 ""exempt"" option in this situation.

---

What if you don't want to download and refer to IRS Publication 15?

There's an online tool from the IRS that can give you a suggestion of what allowances number to use: www.irs.gov/w4app.

If you enter you are Single and Yes you can be claimed as a dependent, then on the second screen say you have 1 job, and on third screen enter $8400 as income, choose Jun 1 as start date and Sep 15 as end date (for example) and that you are paid ""Every 2 weeks,"" then if you proceed to the final result screen, it tells you your tax is $206 and you should use 5 allowances.

So consider using that online tool with your best approximation of your gross income and the closest approximation of your job start and end dates. (If you also have work during other months of the year, there are ways to tell the calculator how much you earned and how much withholding you've had.)

Using a larger allowances number than ""1"" allowance is perfectly legitimate if it results in your withholding being more precisely attuned to your actual tax liability. It does not mean you are claiming that you have dependent children. It is just finding the way to have the right amount withheld.

personalfinance,Looking for wiggle room in budget,"Hi all.  Have followed this sub for a while &amp; always enjoy reading all of the scenarios, and the great advice given by the readers.  Money has always been a struggle for me personally, growing up with parents who were extremely fiscally responsible.  But, I think I am at a point in my life now (I'm almost 30) where I have been making sound decisions and recognizing mistakes my parents have made.  Anyway I am trying to find some wiggle room to take on a car payment, here is where we are at:

Our take-home income is $2,250 biweekly (combined).  
We own our home; mortgage + utilities per month = $1900
We own our car and my motorcycle outright; hubby's motorcycle is still financed, $170 per month payment, has about 3 years left - about $6000 left on the loan.
I have student loans (all federal) totaling about $34,000.  Currently in repayment for about a year now, monthly payment is $315 and is based on income. I am in the public service loan forgiveness program so have about 9 years left.
We don't have cable - just Netflix and Hulu so that's about $30 a month.
We also pay ourselves allowances, $50.00 per week, per person ($200 per pay period).  This is for our personal spending on things we want.

I currently set aside money in the following ways after bills are paid - 
- $200 a month cash which we keep in the house (this is divvied up into envelopes for saving for car/motorcycle repairs, home improvement expenses, Christmas, vacation, and the inevitable times we need cash for work like office parties, etc.)
- $170 per month is transferred to savings for our biannual car insurance, we pay in full to get the discount
- $100 per month into an emergency fund

So after those bills and savings, we use what little remains on groceries, gas, some entertainment, and anything else that we routinely need to buy.  

Here's where we are at currently:
Checking- 1450
Emergency Fund- 3000
Insurance- 773  (***it's way higher than normal right now, I am temporarily saving more because hubby works for the school board, will have off this summer, and will have reduced pay - so trying to have some extra cash set aside to make up for that.  Our normal car insurance bill is like $375 per six months)
Hubby received an inheritance of just over $10,000 in US savings bonds, we haven't touched them but the bonds are at maturity and no longer earning interest - not sure what to do with these.

No credit card debt.  We have credit cards but pay them off every month.  I just use them for cash back/etc.  They come in handy for big purchases too, like we just had to replace our washing machine 2 months ago...

We both participate in Florida Retirement System, and I also set aside $20 every pay period into a 403b deferred compensation plan.  I want hubby to do this too but haven't made any moves yet on that.

What are my goals?  Well I'd love to figure out a way out of those student loans - they are a huge chunk of cash every month.  We could pay off the motorcycle I guess.  We have some housework that is needed - need to repair/replace the roof over our patio, it has wood rot.  We are also very long overdue for a house re-paint, and we need to replace our garage door.

*****This is what I need wiggle room for though.  Our car is a 2006 Mitsubishi - it was my grandmother's and when she passed in 2009, we took over the payments.  It had only 3k miles at the time and $6k left on the payments.  We paid it off quick quick and haven't spent hardly any money on it except oil changes, and we replaced the tires.  Now it is at 106k miles and starting to become littered with issues... Headlight is out, but replacing bulb didn't fix it, problem is in the wire housing and will cost over 1k to repair.  Backseat, driver side window off the track so it's currently duct-taped closed (ugh!).  Noticed yesterday the air conditioning started blowing hot air instead of cold, but that fixed itself when I turned the car off/on.  Anyway it's on its way out.  I'm nervous about when this happens because buying a car is a big decision and want to make sure we do it right.  Looking for a hybrid like a Prius to replace it but don't want to get raped on the payments.

So given all that........ have at it.... Should we be doing anything differently? How can I find the money each month for the car payment?  Should I save less?  Do I really need to get a 2nd job?  I already put in 60+ hrs a week and barely have time to take care of my house!",finance
personalfinance,Money Towards Investing or Towards Student Loan?,"Hello!

My parents had one of those Gerber life insurance policies on me as a child and now that they don't really need it since I somehow survived childhood, they closed it out and gave me the value of it. It came out to about $2,500.

Student Loans:

About $43/mo going towards principal, $24/mo towards interest


$6200 at an interest rate of 3.61%

About $58/mo going towards principal, $18/mo towards interest

I started a new job about 3 months ago so I'm just starting to get the hang of budgeting my money out properly. I can probably save about $200-400 per month to put in whatever direction seems appropriate. I'd like to get my savings up to about $2500 before I start investing any of that or putting any extra towards my student loans. My credit score is in the mid 700's if that makes any difference with anything.


I'm pretty good with my money in the spending/saving aspect but I don't know much at all about investing or interest rates or anything like that so maybe don't explain like I'm five but....twelve or thirteen?


Any advise or tips would be greatly appreciated, let me know if I'm forgetting anything!



Edit: thanks for the help everyone! I'm going to go with using it to pay off my higher interest loan. You're all great =)",finance
personalfinance,"Recent college graduate, need critiquing for personal budget","Hi r/personalfinance, so I have posted a couple times about my budget previously and I just wanted to fine tune it a bit more since I am a little bit more knowledgeable in how taxes work.

So I am an hourly position making $20/hr. I did 365 days divided by 7 days to give me 52.14 weeks in a year, divided that by 12 months to give me 4.345 weeks in a month (just used 4.3 to be more conservative in my budgeting). Then multiplied 4.3 by 40 hours in an average work week and then multiplied by $20/hour to give me a monthly budget of $3,440. ($3,240 after $200/month 401k contribution to calculate my federal and state income tax). I have about $15,800 in student loans, $0 in credit card debt,  and my parents will take care of any insurance premiums.  My budget is as follows:

I have been working for 6 months and my monthly take-home ranges from $2400-$2800. Other things to note are that I have never had a previous car loan (payed cash for my beater) and I have NEVER had a credit card. I know that no credit can be worse then bad credit, so I am in the process of applying for them. I have a ballpark of what I want my monthly payment to be, but I know I will have issues getting a reasonable interest rate if I even get approved at all for a car loan. I also want to note that I could make a down payment on the car of around 4k which includes my trade in.  So my question would be, does anyone have an estimated interest rate for a car loan if I were to get approved?

personalfinance,Trying to save a substantial amount of money,"23(F) - I had wonderful credit when I got my apartment and because of a miscommunication in regards to my Federal loans I'm now way overdue on my balance. The balance that they're asking is not something I can afford to pay right now, but at least have a plan for that with calling them and legitimately just asking for help and options. I make about 4g per month and have bills like rent, car payment, insurance etc to pay. I can't really take on another bill unless it's minimal which is why I'm trying to save a substantial amount so I can begin making the payments without having to stress. Also, I'm currently trying to move out of my apartment. Like I said, my federal loans and the miscommunication killed my credit score which is making this whole process much more difficult.

personalfinance,"Some awesome (personal) news, and a rant about my bank.","So after talking here a few days ago I went forward with some big decisions.

Decision one: A car was mandatory, as it was determined my car is upside-down (its paid off but worth $500 and in need of a $2,000 repair). 

Decision two: If possible, debt consolidation for the $2-$3k of personal credit card debt. I found out I was paying between 18%-25% interest on two cards.

Part one was easy, we got a well-timed ad from a local used car dealership so we checked it out. They originally wanted $12k for a 2014 electric car with less than 500 miles on it, but I talked them down to $7.5k including taxes (financed at 2.49%, $135/month). They also took my old car off of my hands, so I didn't have to junkyard it. This was my first time negotiating to buy a car, my first time signing the paperwork on a car, etc. The price on the car isn't the best, I could have fought harder, but I feel generally pleased with the amount I will be paying per month and overall.  (2014 Smart Fortwo, fully electric). I need to look up tax information about what to do when I bought an electric car, because I know many electric cars qualify for a government rebate. Its worth looking into.

I was expecting part two to be hard after signing the paperwork for part one. But I went to the loan institution, a local credit union, to ask about it anyway since I had a pre-existing account with them already (and to make sure all of my accounts were available as one unit/login, for my own sanity). They gave me a quote for an interest rate of 2.9% but I didn't commit just then, they promised they could hold it for a week. I decided to try my other bank too and see what they said. 

My Wells Fargo account, which I've had since 2005-2006, is where the credit card debt is. So I figured they might want to entice me to pay it all off. I was wrong. They gave me an offer for a personal loan of 3k at 16%. I tried not to visibly balk and signed up for the credit union's offer (a credit card with limit of $3k at 2.9%, plus free balance transfer service, so they are going to max out the card before it arrives to me by sending payments to my other credit card companies).

Seriously though, fucking Wells Fargo. Its nice to have a free account with them, because their website is really convenient for bill payment options and its nice to have other features they offer, but goddamn they are crooks lately! And my credit score, even after all the credit checks I underwent this week, is above 725. So there's no good reason for such a high interest rate from them.

So now, I have a nice newer car that I don't need to worry about breaking down, and I will no longer be paying between $45-$60/month in interest! Yay! Now its down to like, $7 (about $4 on the car and $3 on credit debt). Plus this helps me prepare for trying to finance a home loan, which is something I plan to do within four years. I may have increased my debt by about $7k (the car loan), but my overall monthly expenses are lowered and it'll look excellent on my credit score to have a car loan.

After this I will probably be moving all of my assets to the credit union's account, since they are willing to work with their customers.

personalfinance,I am a 21-year-old college student and have six credit cards. Am I screwing up?,"I've been following this subreddit for a few months because of the fantastic advice. I admit, too, that I like to learn vicariously through everyone's experience. The wealth of information found here is truly one of a kind, and I knew that my time to seek help would come sooner or later. 

In 2015, at the age of 19, I applied for my first credit card with Discover and was approved for a $500 credit line. I managed it responsibly, and today I have a $7,000 line on that card. Later that year I applied for a student credit card with Capital One, starting at $2,000. Now it's at $4,750. At the start of 2016 I tried applying for a few other ones but was denied. Finally, in August of last year I got the Amazon Chase rewards card, with a line of $7,000. I took a break from applying for more to built my history always paying my balances in full. To date I've never paid any fees or interest on any of my cards. I have about 5-7 hard inquiries on my credit report (depending on what bureau's file I'm looking at), some of which are due to expire over the next few months.

In 2017 I got sloppy and acquired three more cards I didn't actually need: a low interest card with Barclaycard, an AMEX, and as of this morning, a travel card with Capital One. My available credit is as follows:

Discover it = $7,000

Capital One Journey = $4,750

Amazon Chase = $7,000

AMEX = $12,000

Barclaycard Ring = $4,000

Capital One VentureOne = $3,000

Because I've been responsible with payments and the way I use them -- never going over 5% of my credit line on any of them, negotiating lower interest rates regularly, and such, my credit scores have fluctuated between 715-750 over the last year. Because of the last few hard pulls, I'm expecting my scores to dip further before leveling out again.

So, my question is, if I don't apply for any more cards from now until I get a real job (I work very few hours a week and don't make a whole lot), am I screwing myself over in the long run? My end goal is to have a good credit score and a healthy credit line by the time I graduate, and I know I can't keep getting cards without serious consequences to my score. I just want to have really high credit lines in case something happens and I don't have enough savings.

What advice can you give me considering I'm only 21 regarding all of these credit cards? My next financial goal is to open a Roth IRA to save for retirement, but I'm scared my greed for credit will set that back.

Am I screwing up? 

TL;DR: I'm a full time student who makes about $600 a month and has a combined credit line of $37,750 over six credit cards because I want to build my credit history and have an irrational fear that I could need this much credit in an emergency. My lowest credit score is 720, and I don't have a whole lot saved up (yet). Am I screwing myself over or will I be okay if I keep using my cards responsibly?",finance

personalfinance,Question about grace periods &amp; late payments on student loans,"My credit reports list 6 federal student loans that have late payments of 90 days. I'd like to try to get them removed but I need to know how to proceed.

These student loans are through the Department of Education/Navient. 

I graduated on December 2011. I assume I went into grace period status (how do I check this?).

I entered graduate school in August of 2012. I remember filling out something to go into grace period status again. 

When I graduated in May of 2015, I assumed that I would get the 6 month grace period again.

I had little savings, which quickly ran out. I didn't get a job till September 2015. Late payments everywhere.  I decided to check on my student loans so I could figure out when I could start paying.

Turns out I made a bad assumption. According to the Navient rep, I had no more grace period. For some reason Navient had been trying to contact me at some New Jersey woman's address and phone number. I had no idea why.  Then I started getting that New Jersey woman's mail at my home in California. It was so weird, but I had no sign of identity theft on my part.

In the end, I was put into forbearance and have been making my student loan payments on time.  My credit has been slowly improving - my MyFico8 score is at around 676-684, but definitely could be improved.

Anyway, what I'd like to do is confirm my grace period dates. It appears that if I go to school within the 6 month grace period, then it resets. But if more than 6 months have passed then I have already exhausted it. Is that correct?

I've been reading about goodwill letters to get the late payments removed. How likely is that going to be successful for me?

Bitcoin,Another warning. I almost had a heart attack. Get your money off the exchanges. Listen to my amateurish story of how I had the worst sinking feeling of my life today.,"So I put a cable modem on Craigslist for $30 today.  Some dude texts me and says, hey I'm Alex, I'm calling from a google phone so you need to type in ""51"" in the keypad to enter our conversation.  I live in a pretty predominantly Mexican neighborhood so probably thought it was weird but not that abnormal.  I get the call, typed in the 51 and then an automated voice said ""your account activation is complete.""

I knew it was a scam and I did it anyway, thought, whatever, let's just play this out and see, what's the worst that can happen.  Suddenly I realize I have my google Authenticator tied to my cell phone and after reading up on the scam the guy just did, I find out it's a common way to register my phone number to google voice.  

My heart starts pounding... if he has my phone spoofed and I just authorized something through google, did this motherfucker just steal all the info he needed to get in to my coinbase account?  Was my computer infected and all he needed was those two extra pieces of info?  I run downstairs to my PC and in a panic type in my password.  ""Invalid password."" Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.  I finally am able to log on to my coinbase account.  Change the password, change the Authenticator, recover and remove my phone from google voice, and immediately send whatever bitcoin I had to my trezor.  It should have been on it already but I was lazy three days ago when I got it and only had set it up and sent a test amount.  

I try to send my bitcoin and my computer says I'm not logged in anymore, I think this mother fucker and I are battling over who is in my account and it's a race to get my f#*%ing coins off coinbase or its all gone.  For good. 

I finally am able to make it work, and sent my coins and waited.  I verified the address and everything and the coins made it off the exchange.  After about 5-10 minutes of cursing myself for being so stupid, and having the voice of many on this sub constantly and every day warning me about this shit, having a flashback about that guy who used a bunk Authenticator with Verizon customer service screwing him out of $8K I finally calmed down when I saw my trezor show the btc received.

I swear dudes.  Listen to the people here, and don't be lazy.  Educate yourselves and be careful.  

Afterward I sent a email to coinbase support and explained what happened and  that I still want to use their service but to let me know if I need to do anything else if I continue using my account to ensure it is secure.

After reading up on it now, I found out that the google Authenticator is tied to the device only that you set it up on and not the phone number, something I didn't know, and would have saved me probably a TON of anxiety today.  I haven't felt like that in a long ass time.

They didn't take a payment out May 15th. I emailed them asking if they were taking a payment and they said no, that the payment plan had ended and that I had a payment due of $219.25 (which is about $2 higher than normal) on June 4th.

btc,Is Segwit a Trojan Horse to replace Bitcoin with Blockstream's Liquid payment system?,"**TL;DR - Blockstream's Liquid could be an attempted corporate takeover of Bitcoin. And Segwit could be the linchpin required to make it all possible.**


I've been doing some research on [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/2015/10/12/introducing-liquid.html), Blockstream's proprietary payment system:

* It's a federated payment system which means that users don't transfer funds directly, they ask their Bitcoin exchange to do it for them via Liquid. It's much like doing a bank transfer where your Bitcoin exchange acts like your bank and Liquid is the central clearing house for transactions.
* Blockstream intends for exchanges and Bitcoin businesses to use the system directly instead of using the Bitcoin blockchain. This would mean that the vast majority of transactions would occur entirely within Liquid and never touch the blockchain at all. Bitcoin's blockchain would mostly be used to ""peg"" existing funds into Liquid.
* Blockstream and/or other corporations [collect a ""network fee""](https://blockstream.com/2017/05/31/liquid-beta-demo.html) for every transaction made on Liquid.
* There's no such thing as miners or Nakamoto Consensus in this system.

**The good**

* Liquid offers very fast payments - within seconds rather than minutes or hours.
* Transactions between the federated entities are secure and private.
* It'd definitely solve the current congestion issue and it looks like it'd scale well.

**The bad**

* If it succeeds in getting widespread adoption it'll essentially replace the Bitcoin we know today with a commercial, proprietary alternative controlled by a single company.
* Back before Blockstream took control of the Core development team Bitcoin transactions were close to free. Liquid would have a fee for service model instead.
* All the revolutionary decentralization features of Bitcoin are lost. It's not fully decentralized the way Bitcoin is, it's not trustless, it doesn't allow direct person to person transactions and it's not open source (at this time).

**The ugly**

* Blockstream is a company which works with a variety of sidechain related blockchain technologies. As far as I can tell they have only one technology with an actual business model though, and that's Liquid. So they must be very very keen to have it adopted.
* The whole thing hinges on them making some changes to Bitcoin so people can transfer funds from Bitcoin into Liquid. Without those changes to Bitcoin Liquid's very limited in what it can do.
* Call me paranoid but if you listed those changes it'd look suspiciously like Segwit's feature list. Like really very similar indeed.


You can see what I'm alluding to here - maybe it's all just a big coincidence but just going by appearances it looks a lot like Segwit is a trojan horse to get Liquid implemented. And right now with Bitcoin in a terrible state with high fees and long confirmation times people would jump at the chance to use Liquid's fast, cheap transactions instead of Bitcoin. That could result in pretty fast adoption of Liquid and an exodus from the Bitcoin blockchain while still being able to call it all ""Bitcoin"" even though everything has changed.

If this theory is true it might explain a few other things:

* Why did Blockstream spend so much effort taking control of the core development team, slinging mud at and ousting some of the world’s most respected cryptocurrency developers in the process? _If they needed to get Segwit implemented they'd certainly have to gain influence over the development team and crush any opposition to their agenda._
* Why did Bitcoin encounter terrible congestion problems under Blockstream's governance? _It'd all make sense if they were trying to sell a competing technology which would ease a problem they could deliberately allow to occur._
* Why did Blockstream claim out of the blue that a ""fee model"" is necessary? _If they were trying to smooth the path to their own fee based system that'd make perfect sense. And it's even better if you allow Bitcoin's fees to run out of control so your own fees look attractive by comparison._
* Why would luke-jr claim that reducing the block size to 300KB was a good idea when it seems quite insane? _If most transactions move to Liquid then Bitcoin's blockchain congestion will ease and Bitcoin's transaction fees would go back to almost zero. They'd still want to keep Bitcoin's fees high to make Liquid attractive. They could do this by reducing the block size again._
* Why do they keep insisting that Segwit’s a scaling solution when it isn’t even capable of fixing the current congestion issue? _Turns out it is a scaling solution, kind of - it enables Liquid which is the actual scaling solution._
* Why don’t they care that they’re annoying the heck out of the miners who provide an essential part of the Bitcoin ecosystem? _Miners aren't used in Liquid so why would they care?_

##Are cryptocurrencies an investment?

This post is going to deal with bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrencies as an *investment*... they're more [speculative.](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/speculation/)  All currencies are speculative mostly due to how the forex market works, but more because of exchange rates between countries keep currencies balanced (including inflation, country debt, interest rates, political &amp; economic stability, etc), so you can only profit in price fluctuations.

Sure you could buy the currency of a depressed country, like Mexico decades ago, and then hold in the hopes it'll go up (which it did for Mexico), but that's also speculation (no one knew Mexico would pay off so much debt).

Bitcoins are also affected by other countries' currency values, but more so by the future expectation of legitimacy, world wide adoption, limited gains from mining, and eventual limit in supply.  But at any given moment the United States could pay off more debt, raise interest rates to reduce inflation (or cause deflation), grow GDP, or even reduce the supply of USD all of which would increase the value of USD (keep in mind bitcoins can't do any of these things).

Far too many people are treating cryptocoins as an investment because currently (June 5th 2017) a lot of crypto *investors* are worth a lot of money, god bless you people, so this post will also help you determine if we're headed for a crypto crash and maybe you can keep those profits.

##Should I *invest* in cryptocurrencies?

Understand that an investment is something you hope will go up in the future or provide income, both of which for the long term vs speculation which profits on [short term inefficiencies.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp)

**Speculative securities** are typically commodities, options, bonds, and currencies, but also stocks that are volatile enough to give you extreme returns or extreme loses.

###Examples of investments:

* Stocks:  A company's stock is an investment because the company's purpose is to continually grow and profit which is reflected in the stock price.
* Real estate:  Typically you're in real estate for the rental income, but there is also the opportunity that property value will go up in the future depending on the local property market.

###Examples of speculation:

* Overvalued stocks: AMZN a few years ago was more speculative than an investment when P/Es were over 1000 because the stock price was so high compared to how much Amazon was earning at the time and the possibility of earning even more was speculative.
* Options: An option contract worth 10 cents to buy AAPL at $200 in 2018, if AAPL goes over $200 you'll make several 100s of percentage points, if not you'll lose everything.
* Bio pharmaceutical stocks - FDA approval can send these stocks soaring or a bad drug trial will make you lose everything
* [Penny stocks](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp) - several factors contributing to extreme price movements up &amp; down
* Gold - global turmoil can send gold to new highs
* Hoarding a ton of [Flooz giftcards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7V9I7LVp4) or Facebook credits in hopes they'll go up in value, if not they're worthless.  Also works on beanie babies, tickle me elmos, and collector items.

##Reducing the risk of speculation

Typically for speculation you reduce risk by reducing your trade size and timeframe, but since you're trying to invest into something that is speculative, you can try:

**Asset allocation**, [a strategy that reduces risk.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp).  If you're 80% stocks, 15% bonds, 4% gold, and 1% bitcoins, if something were to happen to bitcoins, you still have 99% of your money.

But even very aggressive long term portfolios **leave speculation out completely** and just go 100% stocks because stocks benefit from growth while speculative securities like gold benefit from global turmoil in the short term.  Only mid risk &amp; mid term portfolios can take advantage of gold's speculative returns.

I also mention asset allocation because many crypto investors have been using this strategy on a portfolio of 100% crypto coins, but that doesn't help you reduce the overall risk of crypto coins, you're just reducing the risk of 1 speculative asset with another speculative asset.  100% crypto portfolio would face the same risks such as being made illegal, IRS aggressively hunting down crypto profits, a drop in correlated coin markets, or just a loss of popularity would all cause a sell off.  Even the USD or Chinese currencies becoming more valuable would reduce the value of crypto coins.

##Should I buy coins right now?

Cryptocoins are a better *investment* after a period of [consolidation](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp) when [volatility](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) has stabilized:

###[Bitcoin 2013/2014 speculation, chart](http://i.imgur.com/AP0xS5N.png)

* High volatility, extremely overbought signals

###[Bitcoin 2015 consolidation, chart](http://i.imgur.com/4Susvx7.png)

* Becoming more of an investment opportunity after volatility went down

Source Bitstamp exchange, while the volume is #2 to GDAX, Bitstamp is better to look at for historical price/data, [more charts here.](https://bitcoincharts.com/markets/currency/USD.html)

###RSI &amp; MACD key for above charts and primer

* RSI overbought =&gt; 70%, oversold =&lt; 30%
* MACD crossover is generally used for buy/sell signals and the green histogram anticipates that crossover by growing/shrinking.  Also when the lines rise or fall to extremes (which is relative) give overbought/oversold signals, so we're going to use it to confirm or reject RSI.  (If you think MACD crossovers are magic, don't, it's always late (crossing after the point you should sell or buy), but the crossover usually signals even more buying/selling, yet MACD is best used for confirming other indicators which is why I'm using them in these charts)

###Analyzing overbought signals

So the first chart above have RSI &amp; MACD screaming that bitcoin is overbought and you shouldn't invest in 2013/2014.

The black squares in the 2nd chart show consolidation and reduced volatility, a ""better"" time to invest.  If you were trading short term, it would be a whole different story, and there would be opportunities to buy &amp; short, but since this is written for investing, the small overbought signals are ignored, so if you were to buy Bitcoin at $300 inside the first blacksquare (2nd chart) and then it suddenly drops to 25%, it's okay because the volatility is much lower compared to previous price movements (nothing compared to 80% loss in the 1st chart).  Any investor would tell you a 25% drop is terrible, but bitcoins are speculative and that kind of drop is pretty damn good for this level of volatility.

##Nothing goes straight up forever

and anything that comes near this vertical incline will eventually lose 80% to near 100%, always happens, it's usually preceded by **emotions (price euphoria), attention, and increased volume**, all classic [signs that something is becoming riskier.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020216/4-things-make-stock-risky-bet.asp)

Other speculative securities gaining multiples and then losing 80% to near 100% of value:

* [Gold](http://i.imgur.com/UQNYds7.png) - detailed, shows two big corrections *happened multiple times in gold's long history
* [AMD](http://i.imgur.com/1bNGOYL.png) - 475% gains, then slide down to 84% loss  *this has happened several times to AMD (1983, 1997, 2001, 2006)
* [MJNA](http://i.imgur.com/ATBmtD9.png) - these patterns in penny stocks are easier to see, they're the epitome of speculation
* [Crude oil](http://i.imgur.com/0Brkbj6.png) - I only took the 2006 to 2010 period which saw 3x increase and then a 76% loss, but oil was actually in a 7.5x incline since 2002
* [AAPL](http://i.imgur.com/lBmd51s.png) - YES APPLE NO EXCEPTIONS, however with stocks it's easier to justify price increases because of earnings growth, but in this case AAPL was very overbought and earnings couldn't grow fast enough (even though earnings was already extreme).  After a few mini corrections, a big one came which was 50% loss from the top.  Keep in mind when looking at this chart that the previous price before the 7-1 stock split was $705 making the top $100.71 (I wrote it on the chart).  Here the missing signal is increased volume, but we have another signal being MACD divergence which came late, but could have saved you another 20ish % loss.

##Is Bitcoin going to crash?

Maybe, the signals are getting louder, you tell me:  [The only chart you wanted to see this entire time.](http://i.imgur.com/g34ktRg.png)

So based on the above chart, is bitcoin overbought?  MACD levels are the same as 2013's crash, but the increased in value is around 4.3x or 2.4x (depending on which you look at), so maybe we'll see another spike before a crash, I don't know, it's up to interpretation right now.  There's the [emotional price levels](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/061802.asp) of 3000 and 4000 that we might have no problem getting to in an overbought environment before a correction.  And how big will the correction be?  I think 80%, but it very well could be around 50% down to $1200, the previous level of resistance which would become support.

I have the incredible fortune that my parents are in a position to allow me to live with them rent free.

I should mention that the majority of these loans are private. I only intend to refinance these as my federal loans are at an acceptable rate.

personalfinance,Disagreement About Student Loans/Debt,"So my fiance and I have very different views about debt and our personal finances.  Let me give a little back story.

Currently we have about $300,000 in student loan debt.  We are paying it off at a 10 year clip (~$4,000/month).  Currently we are saving for our wedding and put asides about $3,500 a month for that.  Additionally, we have about $2,000 in monthly expenses related to her car and my down payment on the house that will be done in 2 months.

Our annual income in salary alone, combined, is $300,000.  I also anticipate an additional $20-25,000 bonus.

Our disagreement stems from our plans on how to handle our student loan debt following our nuptials.  Our tentative plan at this point is to get married, raise our savings back up to ~$40,000 and then to aggressively pay off our loans to the tune of $8,000-$10,000/month.  This plan was me acquiescing to her goals of getting our from the student loan debt.

Personally, I am fine with paying the loans off faster than 10 years as we have refinanced and the interest rates are at 5%.  I'd like to maybe throw $6,000/mo at them and use any excess to save for a beach house (something we both very much want).

She is a big fan of Dave Ramsey and he advocates getting rid of all debt.  I work in finance (on the legal side) and have a good understanding of debt, cash flow and good/bad debt.  

I guess my questions are this:

1.  Am I being reasonable to not want to sacrifice so much liquidity by paying off loans so fast?

2.  How can I convince her that our student loans aren't some looming specter that will crush us if not paid off immediately.  I work 65+ hours a week and don't want to live like a pauper just to save a little money on interest.

It all Started when I lost my truck to my break system a few months ago around February (break pads and rotors went out while i was driving and tore up my break line and my caliber) and I ended up loosing two side jobs because of this ( I did Amazon flex and I was driving 40 mins out to do a part time job) so I lost a bit of income. On top of that I learned my dad who gave me the truck stopped paying it off years ago along with my insurance and the financing company owns it. so even though it would be a cheap quick fix i could get pulled over and arrested for having a stolen vehicle. 

 I still have my two other jobs but have to spend 40$ a week on a lyft to get to it or bike the two hours it takes to get there. and at my main job I've been paying a coworker to drive me out the 40 mins it takes to get there.. so I work about 70 hrs a week on 11 an hour :/

 I've been having trouble saving up just 1,000 for a piece of shit car just so i can get to point A and point B and my BF just lost his PT job about two weeks ago. I worked a ton and I only have enough to pay my rent and my water bill until another two weeks comes around and I'm just stressed out because my gas is getting cut off today and my internet has been off for a week so he cant apply anywhere 

._. I feel like i work so many hours and i just make chump change. I'm never home to take care of my critters nor can I work enough to just keep them and my BF fed (I tend to starve myself and don't notice it so I don't put myself towards my income) . I've already cut back on so much already and try to not complain about it like he does with a lot of things. I just dont know what to do at this point without burning myself out more than i already am. I'm trying to be a rock for the both of us but I feel like falling apart on the inside  :/


TL;DR 20/F stressing out over loosing my truck and two out of 4 jobs . I only work 2 jobs now and my BF lost his PT job. I make just enough to pay rent but would have to risk a lot to just pay off bills and shit. and Its impossible for me to save up for a car since my truck is considered stolen to the state.

I am very lucky to have been gifted stock from my grandparents, but this stock was purchased many years ago and has a large amount of gain because of it.

I am trying to be proactive by selling the stock when I have a low income to reduce the taxes I pay on them. Since the federal capital gains tax is 0% until I surpass a gross income of $37,950, will I be able to sell all the stock to realize the capital gains this year and thus not have to pay any federal capital gains tax? In my state, I am almost positive that I will have to pay some capital gains tax no matter how low my income is, so I'll take a hit there no matter what. Other than that, am I missing anything in my logic? Is selling the stock now, before I have a full-time income the best approach? Also, would I be able to reinvest in the same stocks after selling them to effectively raise the cost basis to the present day value?

I don't see how I am possibly going to make it to this interview or any subsequent interviews without basically putting in my notice first.  This is going to require both me and my GF to move and get new jobs.  Which I assume will take longer than just finding a job for myself in a new place.  

Anyway I guess what I want to know is if people think I am going to be ok if I just quit first and hopefully find a new job soon.  I can't see another way to do it, I am constantly traveling and working.  

Is this going to put me at a terrible disadvantage for salary negotiation?  What do I do with my 401k?  Do I have enough money to live off till I get a new job?",finance

Basically, I will enter in my estimated taxes for each quarter and the processing company will ""bill me"" and email me to remind me to pay these taxes. I can choose to get billed monthly or quarterly.

At the end of the year I can print out a statement for the year and send it to my accountant, which will note all of the payments I've already made.

personalfinance,"Balancing Student debt, retirement, and short term savings.","Hello PF! I’m not sure if this sort of multi-disciplinary advice request is allowed, but I’m desperate for help and do not have any other trust worthy source of advice. 

I am a 23 year old recent college graduate starting off my career. I need help with balancing student loans, short term savings, and retirement planning. 

**Loans:** I have around 90k Student loan debt. 29k Federal (3-6% ir), 21k PPL (that I am paying)(3-6% ir), 40k private (via my personal bank)(6-11% ir). My current plan is to pay off the minimum on all loans each month and then add on extra money to the highest interest rate. I prefer the avalanche method.


**Employer Retirement:** I have read up on the benefits of Roth accounts, 401k, and traditional IRAs. My employer will match up to 6% of my salary to either a Roth or a standard 401k. Should I put the maximum ($2750 x2 with employer match) into a Roth with the remaining matched amount into a 401k? Roth makes more sense to me right now, beginning my career at a lower tax bracket. Are there any drawbacks to splitting up my retirement savings between two accounts? A common piece of advice I have ran across is to max the employer matching into a 401k and then add additional money into a Roth IRA, but what do I do if my employer has Roth matching. Right now with student loans, should I put more than the matched 6% into a retirement account or should I put that off until I pay back my loans?

The retirement account has a variety of different investment options. The standard option has a mix of domestic, foreign, and bond investments. How do I know if they recommended blend of investments is safe and should I be comfortable with an investment firm being in control of my retirement account or do I need to make specific decisions on where to put my retirement money?


**Loans/IRA/STS:** To my knowledge, it makes the most sense to put any “extra” money towards my higher interest student loans until I can pay them off. After that, or if that’s incorrect, Should I put money in a retirement account separate from my employer sponsored accounts?  I want to retire comfortably one day as well as put my future kids through school, buy a house and what not, but I also obviously want to save money short term for vacations and fun things here and there. Starting earlier is better, but I don’t know how little/much is an appropriate amount to start saving for future purchases.

I have a pretty exhaustive breakdown of my monthly expenses for my current living situation, and it looks like after paying for insurance, rent, loans, utilities, life… I’ll have around 850-1000 “left” to put back into loans, short term savings, or IRAs.

I listened to a podcast laden with thick concern of the unknown future with regards to scaling.  Bitcoin will blow through it like a Terminator rising through the flames and smoke.

The US economy is crushed under national debt, deficit spending, insolvent banks, defaulted student loans,a Federal Bank printing money as fast as it can and a stock exchange supported by Central banks trying to prop up their balance sheets.

The price of bitcoin is still cheap.  I invest as much as I can as it has proven to be the best place in spite of the volatility.  Bitcoin will continue to grow and nobody's crystal ball can say where it should be.  Applying stock trends and behavior might look similar but it's not stock.

personalfinance,"I'm a 22 year old about to enter graduate school, and I have a lot of questions","I need some advice on the best way to build my credit, balance my savings account, pay my bills, and take on an insane amount of student loan debt.

Background info-
1) In June 2013 (the year I graduated high school), I bought a 2013 Mazda for $20,500. I currently owe $3,800 on it. Monthly payments of about $320. 
2. I have $7800 in savings currently, and do not anticipate having the ability to save any more money before I start school in August.
3. When I finish graduate school in 2019, my total tuition and fees debt will be about $45,000. 
4. I can't work in my graduate program so I have to also take cost of living loans- my monthly expense will be about $800- unless my car is not paid off, then it will be $1220.
5. $40,000 of my debt will be in unsubsidized loans w/ interest rate of 6%. I'm anticipating another $30,000 of my debt will be in unsubsidized graduate plus loans w/ interest of 7%. 
6. As far as my credit score goes- I have 1 credit card, and then 4 in store credit cards that I never use.
8. My credit score is good, about 750, but I have not accepted any loans yet. 

Questions:

Should I use my savings before I start school to pay my car off? Or should I save my savings to pay the interest on my loans every 3 months while I'm in school so my loan principle does not capitalize? 

Is it better for your credit if you pay the last chunk of debt ($3800) all at once-or is it better to pay it off in smaller increments? Does it not matter?

I need to close 2 of the 4 in store credit cards because I don't use them. Does this harm my credit? How close together can I close them?

Any other general input advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Sorry this is so long.",finance

personalfinance,High CC Interest. Loan? Heloc? Need Help.,"I’ve been relatively foolish with CC Debt. I recently actually read a statement and found that if I just pay the minimum I’ll be paying 23 years worth of payments at 115$/month for ~ 6000 worth of debt. 

That got me thinking. I have way higher interest on my cards than most anyone I’ve read about on reddit personal finance. 

For my CC Debt I have 
$6,000 @ 16.74 
$6,000 @ 19.99 

And my wife has
3700 @ 19.99 

Her Credit score is 680 Transunion 650 Equifax (due to collections on one score and not another). Mine is 657 across the board due to High Utilization. 

Due to utilization I doubt I would be able to get a card high enough to balance transfer this. Would a personal loan be worth it? Would I be able to get a better interest rate? I get a lot of mail offers, but I know that if they're mailing it to me they stand to benefit quite a bit by having high fees/interest.  

Would I have to do a HELOC? It seems like a HELOC would require a lot more paperwork and fees (appraisal, etc). I also recently refinanced my house (to go from 5.5% interest to 4%, and a 20 year loan), so that may make it out of the question. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be most helpful. I know it's wishful thinking but loan calculators indicate a 10% APR Loan for 5 years of 16,000 would have me paying less than I currently am monthly and cut 18 years of payments off of one of my cards.

There is also a decent chance that I will receive a raise to about €70k ($78k) in October, but this is not 100% set yet so I can't really count on it.

* pay off at least $10k of the debt immediately
* pay back my loans at about $1000/month

**Basic OP info**
Age : Early Twenties - FICO : 760+ - Income : 26K - Employment Duration : 25 months+ - Credit Card Debt : 1K

**Situation**
Alright, so situation is this... 
I ended up having a vehicle that was a total POS. I've put more money into than the original purchase price, and I'd have to probably put even more into it before someone would purchase it at even 75% of what I bought it for. The transmission on it is barely operating and I'm not intending on repairing it.

Which leads to..
I've submitted a application for a vehicle loan from my main bank ,which I've been with for 5 years, for 5-6k loan over 4-6 years. Now they didn't deny me for credit but they did ask for a cosign. Now this may because of age or just because my income is so low vs living charges. Either way I unable to do that because my mother recently got laid off, company closing, and my father is retired and only get checks from the state.

Which leaves me relying on a coworker, who works 4/5 same days, and mother giving me rides to and from work. Bout 15-30 minutes each way. 

**So my conundrum comes into play if I should...**
Wait till my mother finds work (less than 2-3 weeks hopefully), gets her first few checks, and apply for the loan then. 
Or to go to an independent loan company which would probably have a higher interest rate and min/max payments, and then just refinance later.

This is my first time taking this large of a loan and I since I've already hit my credit once with an application I'd rather not hit again just to end up with a short term shitty deal. 

This all comes in at a very inconvenient time, as I was planning on leaving my job 2 months from now. As that would be the time frame of when my 1k credit card debt would have been paid off. (glasses &amp; brakes for the vehicle)

**All in all,** 
I just want insight on what are my options and what the pro-cons are. 
I need to leave this job as the position I hold used to pay about 35k a year, and now it's gotten to the point of where I have to stay late and if I equate overtime. I have to tell them take the hours off my paycheck in fear of losing my job. But^that's^a^different^story...


**TL;DR** - Can't get vehicle loan without cosign, do I wait for family member to get job so I can get a cosign or just sign with a independent loan business and refinance later?

personalfinance,Need help refinancing student loans,"Hello PF!  I recently got denied for a home loan because of some student loan default that happened back in 2013.  My payments have been good every month since then but I noticed in looking in to my student loans that what I thought was a single Stafford loan is actually broken out in to 4 different loans, 3 subsidized Stafford and 1 unsubsidized Stafford.  The 3 subsidized are at a 4.25% interest rate and the unsubsidized at 6.55%.  This means that the $139 monthly payment I've been making every month has been spread out across all 4 and I'm effectively paying almost 20% interest which explains why my original loan of $10k is only down to $8.8k.

I will come right out and admit that I am terrible with money, but I'm trying to get better.  I had a period with this loan where I went in to default, and I deffered payments a couple of times, but as of 2014 I put the account in to an auto-pay program and figured I would just ""set it and forget it"".

personalfinance,Calculating post-tax hourly wage? Very different federal income tax rates withheld,"First off apologies if this is a stupid question. I [23M] just started a new job in the tourism industry getting paid hourly at $16/hr, but my hours per pay period are pretty fluid depending on how busy our port is. I am trying to create a budget for myself but when attempting to calculate my post-tax income, my first two paychecks come out to different percentages. 

My first paycheck I worked 41.15 hours at $16/hr, yielding $658.40 pre tax. My taxes withheld were as follows:
Fed Income Tax: $5.63
Social Security: $40.82
Medicare: $9.53
State Unemployment Insurance: $3.29
Total Withheld: $59.29 or ~9% of my paycheck

My second paycheck I worked 64.5 hours at $16/hr, yielding $1,032.00 pre-tax, with the following amounts withheld:
Fed Income Tax: $45.06
Social Security: $63.98
Medicare: $14.96
State Unemployment Insurance: $5.16
Total Withheld: $129.16 or ~12.5% of my paycheck

Why is my federal income tax percentage so much larger for my second check? With there be more consistency in my following paychecks? Is this due to something I wrote on my W2?

It is an experiment. It is extraordinary risky and you could lose all your money if you invest in it. You do also have the potential for upside returns.

Personally I think that the global markets are and will continue to reward digital sound money that has no leader and are and will continue to reject the phony corporatist fiat which has caused so much harm on our earth. Either because they are pragmatists, economists, idealists, dreamers or opportunists ... I personally believe that more and more people will see the beauty of code bound by laws of math as a preferred and secure replacement for authority. For whatever reason they will shift.

They will shift to a better currency for the same reason people shifted from stones to shells as currency and from shells to coins to bills... because it's a better form of money. What makes money better? Portability, scarcity, fungibility, durability, divisibility...these are the properties which make Bitcoin a better form of money as all others before it.

personalfinance,"$20k debt, broke, work part time, full-time student in Wisconsin. What to do - and where to go for credit counseling?","I have four credit cards and a little over $20k in CC debt. Only one card is at a decent interest rate and with my Credit Union, the rest are between 20-30% or so. I'd say half of it is up to a few years old, the other half goes back many years.

I'm 35, live in Madison WI, went back to school a few semesters ago, and have between 1-3 years left depending on whether or not I go for a 4 year degree which I probably will. I'm currently working part time at a crap-paying job and hope to find something better for the summer - it's 29 hours/week at $9.35/hr.  School is quite difficult and time consuming so I don't exactly have the time or energy to work full-time during the semester. At the moment, I am dead-broke and my cards are nearly maxed out, lately using them only when I absolutely have to for bills/necessities/etc.

I always make all my payments, somehow, but I'm now at the point where I'll no longer be able to. My CC monthly payments total around $700 or so at the moment. What should my first step be? I assume it's go to a credit counselor, but I'm not sure how to go about finding a good one and I've read some are not too great. I'd consider debt consolidation but only if it could very substantially lower my monthly payments, and I don't want to end up paying more over time than I would as-is. Something like Chapter 7 bankruptcy seems pretty drastic, but I would consider it if it were my only option for crawling out of this hole. Just not really sure what to do. And whatever I do or don't do I'm probably going to be missing some credit card payments for the first time in a few weeks anyway.

personalfinance,Is it possible/feasible/not-stupid to buy a house with my situation? [40 and not rich],"Where I live now it costs roughly 2.5-3k to rent/live for a month as a reasonable human with basic amenities, if you count all the insurances and the power, water, etc.

All in all, here are the facts.

* My wife and I are almost 40

* 5 person family - one of our sons is special needs who will live with us for a long time.

* I've been working from home for several companies as a transcriptionist and I'm in the National Guard right now too (which turns out to be more of a nuisance than of any kind of help from a financial standpoint)

* My wife has an online business that isn't really making much. But she drives for Uber occasionally.

* We only make about 20-24k / year combined, not even enough to owe taxes.
(I just heard a big resounding NOPE from my in-brain audience)

* We have about 1.5k in savings (I know, that's nothing)

* We have about 30k in debt to include federal student loan bills which are conveniently split into 4 interest accruing chunks (how clever of them).

* My credit is excellent but my wife's is not

* I'm looking for a better job which will hopefully change this situation drastically but I'm also trying to prepare for the worst before hoping for the best. The instability of the military has had us moving since the 90's and we're both just ready to stop moving and stop throwing money away into the bin.

* We plan to never move again if it's possible to buy a house that is relatively decent.

* I've been using the ""snowball"" method to get rid of debts and it has brought debts down a couple of grand so far but we've a long way to go

* I'm a veteran and I'm doing my best to make these old bones make it through a few more years (~4) so that I can qualify for guard retirement once I'm 60 or so.

For a small town bum like me, it makes sense to switch out a rent payment for a mortgage payment because we're spending 1k+ on rent anyway which goes toward nothing, and it may be possible to give ourselves some breathing room to pay off the debts and work toward ownership if we have a slightly lower than 1k mortgage. 

As far as I'm concerned, nothing is off the table. Tiny homes, modular homes, trailers, plots of land with some type of potential for something. Just a plain old tent in the wilderness would be fine for me, but obviously I've a family to think of as well. We've even talked of selling most of our belongings and moving into an RV. Mobile + cheap living. I think what that boils down to is just desperation, though.

Please feel free to tell me all the stupid things I've said. My feelings won't be hurt. I honestly just want a small home with a quarter acre or so somewhere to live in peace and quiet and retire (someday). I'm not looking for a mansion. Beyond that being unfeasible at my age, I also don't care to own one. I'm just looking for a realistic approach toward a quiet and debt free retirement.

Other than doing my best to find a better job, I'm not sure what steps to take or if my small town logic is garbage or not. 

I realize there's a lot going on in this post and I sincerely appreciate (not an empty platitude) those that take the time to read horror stories like this and are willing to offer their advice.

We live in Pennsylvania and are staring at a $10,0000 tuition fee next year for my son.

I've seen that you can give one-time gifts to your children (per year) and I'm wondering if there is a way I can utilize a gift like that into his account and then pay the tuition from there.

personalfinance,Can you refinance if the home is held in family Trust?,"I keep getting e-mails and mailers from Citimortgage with 3 options: lower interest rate (keep same loan period), lower the monthly payment (extend loan period by 5 years), or pay it off sooner (monthly payment a little higher, but decrease loan period by 5 years).

There's no reason not to do it since keeping the same loan period but lowering the interest rate is saving money with nothing else really changing.  It says there are no other costs associated with doing this re-finance (provided by HARP program).

The mortgage is under my sister's name, and I spoke with her about the mailers... she said Citi told her once that since the property is in a family trust, we wouldn't be able to take advantage of the re-finance offer in the mailer.

personalfinance,I'm having trouble paying off my credit card because I'm earning wages in a foreign country,"I moved to Australia a few months ago, which has largely worked out, but it took me a lot longer than planned to find a job. As a result, I racked up some credit card debt - the remainder is about $2200 US, so not a massive amount.

I'm making good wages, but there are a couple of factors that are making this really hard to pay off.

* First, my bank doesn't accept payments from foreign accounts, so I have to get any payment from my AU account into my US account.

* I'm making a good wage, but I'm also getting taxed at a *flat* 35% tax rate (!!) because I'm not a resident. I get most of this back, since my real rate is only 15%, but not until August or so at the earliest.

* Transferring money between my bank accounts via a wire is murderously expensive. Not only is there a $22 fee, but my US bank only gives me about $.65 USD per AUD, when the real exchange rate is $.75. I sent $522 last month and received less than $350 in my account.

* I could do it all in one lump sum via a service, which seems optimal, but my interest rate on the card is 25%. This has never mattered since I've never carried a balance, but it's costing me about $50 a month now, at least (I haven't done the math).

Anyway, I estimate that I could have enough to pay this off completely sometime in August. What should I do in the meantime to reduce how much money I'm losing, via both interest, bank fees, and conversion rates?",finance
personalfinance,Need some advice on other places to refinance my college loans,"Here I am. Recently 30. Yearly income is 45,000. I have a credit score around 820.

I paid my way through college with student loans. I come from a family who has made consistent financial mistakes and even declared Bankruptcy. I worked hard to not fall into those same pitfalls and to always keep my personal finances strong. I have a Roth IRA, A strong 401k and I consistently save a rotating 6 month emergency fund.

I carry one credit card and always pay the balance. My car payment is strong and I have never had a derogatory mark on my credit in my life. I pride myself in my credit and my life choices.

So here I am wanting to move into a larger area from a small town where 50,000 dollar jobs are impossible to find.

personalfinance,"I need help deciding what to do, maybe one of you will have some input that will help me decide.","OK, this is gonna be a long one... I really hope someone reads this and comments. 

I work about 32 hours a week for $15/hr, helping manage a family owned furniture store. It's a warehouse/discount type, and honestly we're the best bargain in town. Nothing bad to say about the company, or how it's run, and I've known the family 18 years. Job security is just fine. HOWEVER, there's no A/C, and I'm physically uncomfortable day in and day out, sweating, working hard, doing more than one job description. Maybe I'm underpaid, but I don't ask for more because I know owner well, and he's living off his social security, not profiting much from the business.

Then, I own the delivery business (basic LLC to keep it legally/honestly ""outsourced"") that the above company gives exclusivity to. Meaning I make sure all the deliveries are taken care of. I do this off the clock, on my own time, and 70% of the time I'm doing the delivery by myself (because they are that easy), and the other 30% with a friend/coworker/""employee"" that I pay cash under the table to. My goal is to get someone that I can trust to run this operation without needing me to walk them through every delivery. Total yearly revenue is roughly $42,000/yr. We're on track for about 600 deliveries this year averaging about $70 each, which take an average of 1.5 hours each, and I pay my ""employees""/friends $12-15/hr based on the difficulty/length of the job. If I paid someone $15/hr to do every delivery, and I'd only need to help on 30% of them (upstairs, or large items that need to be carried in), I'd be paying out $13,500 every year, leaving me with $28.5k from working about 6-8 hrs/week average. I could even have my ""employee"" bring a friend/someone on the other 30%, leaving me with working 0 hours, for roughly 25k income (Of course I'll have to pay taxes on $42k - expenses : I can show lots of expenses). 

My debts are all in my mother's name, meaning they're on her credit cards or equity line. They range from prior business loans, to old personal credit cards with high interest rates, to vehicle loans, that have all been consolidated to her lower interest rate credit lines. I currently owe a total of $67,000 (highest interest rate being 5.25%) on 3 different accounts. One of which is a $33,000 box truck that I just purchased 2 months ago, which I was planning on purchasing with an equity line from my own home, but she had a 6 month 0% interest rate, so the plan is to either refinance my home, or take out an equity line to pay off this credit card within the 6 months. The other $34k is from past personal/credit card debts, as well as a business loan and a car loan from several years ago. Again, only in her name because consolidating with her was for lower interest rates.

I co-own a home with my girlfriend. Our current mortgage is $1054/mo (which includes tax, insurance, and PMI which is $140/mo), on a balance of $120k @ 3.75% fixed 30yr that we bought Dec. 2014, on a home that is worth $200k(maybe a bit more). We have been considering taking out an Home Equity Line Of Credit (HELOC), or just refinancing the home for an undetermined amount. Both the HELOC and refinance would put us around 4.25% fixed rate, but refinancing would eliminate the PMI ($140/mo) (mortgage would then be  ~$914/mo at $120k for 30yrs). By the way, I pay about 2/3 of all the bills, so we both agree that 2/3 of the equity would be mine, 1/3 hers, as we don't have joint bank accounts. I also make sure to pay a couple hundred over the minimum. This year I'm paying $1,300 rather than $1054, and I'm planning to pay at least that much more as time goes on. Using a mortgage calculator, this means I should pay it off in around 20 years, rather than 30.

My girlfriend has a little under $6k in credit card and medical debt (4 different cards/accounts), which she pays about $250/month on (more than minimums). She also has a car loan @ 1.99%, for another 4 years, remaining balance is about $18k, which is $305/month. 

I *THINK* I would like to refinance for $200k, giving us $80k in cash, giving her $26,700 to pay off her car loan, credit cards/medical debt, and have $3k left over in cash. I would have $53,300 to pay off my box truck (-33,000 = 20,300 balance), and the rest would go to my mom, leaving me with a single debt of under $14k, on one account, which is really just a home equity line on the property that my dad lived in, but he died a few years ago leaving it to me, so it's been rented out, and my mother is managing that, so any ""income"" from that property is hers. However, the equity is mine, as it's in my name. So really I'm OK with making minimum monthly payments on a 5% interest rate because eventually I'll be able to sell that property (or I'll be renting it myself and taking the income).

What I want to do: Because of the furniture delivery business, as described above, of which I complete the service mostly with my current pick up truck and trailer, and when weather is bad I use the box truck, or when I have multiple deliveries to do. Anyways, I've been thinking of selling the big box truck, and trading in the old truck for a newer truck with a V8, which can haul a pull behind enclosed trailer (to do deliveries in the rain). My truck is worth $5k, the one I'd want is worth $18k, and a trailer is $4k, leaving me with a new debt of $17k, roughly the same insurance costs, but a new ""truck payment"" of about $260/mo, but eliminating the need for the big box truck, which costs me $1150/mo (for payment and insurances), and it sits about 25 days a month because I use the pick up and trailer. 

On top of that, my least favorite part of my day to day life, is being on the clock at the store, mainly because of the temperature in the warehouse, and sweating all day long. What I think I'd rather do, is buy another vehicle (under $25k), and uber. I really do like driving around, and meeting new people is great, and could open more possibilities for me. I know a couple of people in my area, who average over $15/hr net income with uber. And the vehicle I would buy would qualify for uber select, which is worth double the standard uber fares. So it's easy to assume I'll make the same amount of money driving around town in a comfortable a/c car, making as much or more than my hourly pay at the store. This adds another $300/mo, maybe a little more on the insurance (grouped with my truck), but all in all, I'd rather drive around 11 hours a day, than spend 9 hours a day at the store. What I mean is, it's not about the hours I have to work, but I'd make sure to Uber enough to pay this car payment, and bring as much or more home when compared to the store hours. I work 4 days at the store, totaling 32 hours. I'd happily work 5 days a week driving for Uber to make it at least even out.

The way I figure it, if we refinance, and end up with enough cash to pay off my gf's debt (credit/medical/car), along with my box truck, and most of what I owe my mom, we'll reduce our combined monthly payments by about $1,500 a month, and our mortgage will go up about $300. I've also spent some time playing with a mortgage calculator, and figure that if we pay about another $275/mo above the minimum needed, we'll wipe out our mortgage in the same amount of time we would in our current path, which also eliminates a good chunk of the interest that would be paid if we continue down our current path (interest on the car loans, past debt, credit cards, medical dect, etc.).

CryptoCurrency,Can anyone explain me this?,"By poking for a while into the forex markets, I did understand that the trading between fiat currencies was to be done by pairs ALWAYS. If the play was the EURUSD, I would know when I would be long euro (short USD) and/or short euro (long USD). That is, for every dollar there was a certain amount of euros in exchange; a value that was determined by a global market, called forex. Long euros, I could spend them in Europe; long USD I could spend this in the USA and so on for every pair in the world.

What I see these days is that the BTC is traded vs the USD as many other c-coins, +850 of them so far; even if your trade let’s say a monero vs a dash, you would always, for now, use the dollar or euro as a frame of refence to consciously know how much money you really have at your disposal.

So my not-so-clear-issue(s): these days the federal reserve keeps printing money as if there was no end and because of this, too much money in the streets tends to reflect in an ever increase of cost services, goods and products, i.e. inflation; and yes plus the aggregate that there must be demand for those products, goods and services.

Now what if the fed keeps printing money AND starts buying a lot of bitcoins, and I mean a LOT. Perhaps they run out printed bills, but since they are the fed, they can print some more and voila they are owners of the 25M BTC’s. So now we all have again USD in the pockets and are worth next to nothing, correct?

Also what if no one pays anything with USD; only use the c-coins they in their wallets. The c-coins will still be created as transactions keep happening between buyers and sellers. Meanwhile de fed continues printing money devaluating the purchasing power of the c-coins, correct? In order to decouple the c-coins from all of the fiat currencies in circulation, we all humans on earth, would have to arrive to an agreement on what is the value of things in c-coins. Point in time at which definitively fiat will be a thing of the past, correct?

Would sure appreciate your comments to this. What will be the future if any of bills and coins.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Solo mortgage or joint VA mortgage with bad credit partner?,"Hello PF,

TL;DR: Solo mortgage or joint VA mortgage with bad credit partner?

I’ve racked up 22k in credit card debt over three years, with about half being rent before I moved in with my lovely fiancee. I missed the last few months of payments. My credit was pristine for eight years and even paid off a car, but now I’m done into the 600s at best. I’m unemployed, but receive $133.57 a month for military disability. My lovely fiancee earns $113,000 a year and wants to buy a starter house with a $70k down payment. Yes, the bay area housing market is bonkers. She has no debt and is content with me being a stay at home dad (we’re pregnant). 

As a veteran, I have a certificate of eligibility for the VA Home Loan. That means zero down payment, no PMI, and I believe a 0.1% or more lower interest rate. If we buy a house at the 3.875% interest we were offered, over thirty years that’s sixty thousand dollars more on a $550,000 loan. That’s my rough understanding. 

So until recently I was planning on trying to go bankrupt and let the statute of limitations unburden me. Could making the house mortgage in both our names save money, and how far would we have to go to relieve my debt? I know the exact answer depends on underwriters and others, but if you have any insights please share.

Bitcoin,Barriers to entry?,"I understand all of the benefits of Bitcoin.  My main concern is the almost non-existent barriers to entry.  Clearly the frontrunner, I understand that Bitcoin the ""preferred"" cryptocurrency for this reason.  The market has decided that this is the place invest given the limited use as a ubiquitous currency.  As it is currently being used - it is a simply a store of value..similar to gold.  The intrinsic value is not close to the market value at this time.  I have also been reading up on Ether, and whatever is coming after that.  I'm thinking about investing in both currencies.  

Can someone please explain why the barrier to entry issue does not bother current holders, miners, speculators?  There is no federal reserve influencing this ""currency"" like the fiat currencies of the world, but I don't necessarily see that as a pro.  Someone please sell me on cryptocurrency and disprove my issues here.. as I am bullish given the enormous potential.

personalfinance,Is this how interest rates work?,"This is how I understand bank lending practices, so please note I may be wrong. I just want to share my thoughts and confirm them with this subreddit.

Banks lend money to borrowers (mortgage for example) and charge interest.

Banks acquire this capital from either:

1) Allocating capital from customer bank deposits, most likely from some sort of repackaged GIC / bond they sold to depoisters.

2) Borrowing money from the Fed / Central Bank at the current interest rate. The Central Bank then prints off / creates money from thin-air (causing inflation) and issues the loan to the requesting bank. 

...

The bank will now offer loans at higher interest rates than what they paid with route 1. or 2. 

If the bank goes route 2 they are basically a monetary middle man and when interest rates go up so does their loan with the Central Bank forcing them to increase interest rates with active loans. 

Route 1 could be more lucrative since many people just leave money in their checking accounts and 0.05% interest saving accounts which the bank could loan out. The banks reserves will help mediate any arbitrary withdrawals from these checking / low interest saving accounts. 

Capital from GIC / bonds a bank sold to customers will be more secure because the buyers of these bonds lock in their money for a term to mature giving them an incentive to keep the money with the bank.  If interest rates from the Central Bank go up enough people may start liquidating these GIC / bonds and seeking more lucrative havens and forfeit their matury. It all depends on the length to maturity and the heat of the interest rates. The bank will be forced to offer higher yielding bonds to continue acquiring capital from buyers and thus higher interest rates on loans, ie. mortgages.

There's a lot of moving parts and hundreds of packaged bonds, loans, term-deals, fixed-rate mortgages, etc., but the sum of this activity will all equate to the banks bottom line.

Are my convictions correct?

EDIT: 

Next questions: 

I know Central Banks lower and raise interest rates to control the gears of the economy (higher rates to lower it and reduce borrowing, lower rates to increase it and promote borrowing). What determines the interest rate Central Banks charge and what do they do with the profits accrued?

What percent of money lent from the Central Bank is ""newly"" created / printed money? Are interest rates and inflation on-par?",finance

personalfinance,Developed a debt payoff plan and now I'm hitting a couple road blocks,"Hello everyone!

I've been following this subreddit for a while and have slowly built a plan to payoff my student loan debt, credit cards, and save an emergency fund. I'm also trying to get my credit on track after a bad month before the move dropped it by 100pts.


In January, I moved for a new job with great security and pay increase prospects. My starting salary is $44,000, and I'll be getting a $10,000 annual raise this upcoming January (I don't get that big of a raise every year, but I'm on an accelerated track for the first year). I also have retirement benefits and an employer matched annuity to which I donate 5%.


Here's a list of my debt in general terms:


**Credit card debt**

* Approximately $4000 @ around 21%


**Student Loans**

* $40,000 @ 5.5%
*  $15,000 @ 7.5%
* $2,500 @ 7.88%
* $4,000 @ 9.5%

* For now, my federal loans are not collecting interest, so I'm putting them aside for the moment (will explain later), but they add up to around $20,000.


**Car Loan**

* $3000 - no interest (it was a loan from my boyfriend) and I pay back what I can each month (right now about $150/month)


As of right now, my highest priority has been paying down the credit cards. I started with about $5500 this year, so I've already made a big dent. I have that debt split between 4 cards, and I make over the minimum payment on each, with an extra $300 going to the highest interest card. I'm set to pay them off early next year.


For the loans, I set up auto pay on all of them and have been making payments. Now, my job is paying for me to get my MBA (which is why my federal debt if deferred interest free right now - also a federal employee who is on track for loan forgiveness in 7 more years). Since I'll be in school half-time, I will get in school deferment on most of my loans, except 2 that have been rconsolidated. 


My plan is to take the money I would normally put to those deferred loans towards my credit card debt and get it paid off faster. After that, I expect my credit score to go up and with my salary increase in January I think I'll qualify for a good loan consolidation next year that will make all that mess more manageable.


After getting settled in, I also picked up some part time hours tutoring and have been using that money for an emergency fund. I put in about $100/month and am currently at $500.


At the same time, I've been working really hard to pull up my credit​ score. It dropped from 680 to 570 in November, and I already have it back up to 620/650 depending on the agency.


Okay, now for the roadblocks:

1. There is a delinquent medical bill that shows up on my Equifax (only, not on the other agency reports, which is why I didn't know about it!) from 3 years ago. I called my old insurance Co and they said that the procedure could have been covered by my insurance but it was improperly billed (long story short: I thought it was covered and moved overseas so I never knew about the bill, it's in collections now). I reported this to Equifax by saying that I was not liable for the charge, and they reported back that the account does belong to me so they won't remove it.

Can I still fight against it? I know it's in my name correctly, but my dispute was that I was not liable for the charge. How do I go about getting Equifax to drop this?


2. Now that I've started getting my finances in order, I've been hit another big blow: I just got diagnosed with cervical cancer. The good thing is that we caught it early and (hopefully) I just need a small surgery. The bad news is that in order to pay off my debt faster, I picked a really shitty health insurance. I can't change plans until November, and the surgery can't wait. I'm looking at $5000-6000 for my costs.

How do I fit this into my debt plan? Should I stick to what I'm doing now and work out a super low payment plan for the medical bills? I will also have about $1700 in my retirement annuity that I can borrow from to make a dent in it (all of the interest for that loan will go back into my retirement account, but I would lose whatever profit I stood to gain from keeping it in there). Any medical bill hacks that I'm not privy to?

personalfinance,"20, rising college junior working 2 jobs at large state school in need of financing $18,000 for a year of college, need ideas.","I'm a mathematics major with an emphasis in Computer Science at the University of Georgia with a 2.77 GPA. I'm a Georgia native, so I pay in-state tuition. I lost HOPE this past semester, and am looking into some options in order to further my education. Here's the gist of everything:

My parents sat me down as a high school senior and explained to me that they would not pay for any part of my college, and that I had to finance it myself. Their rationale is that since they didn't have any help financially from their parents, me not receiving any financial help from them will somehow make me appreciate the things I work toward in life. The only difference is that they went to community colleges while I go to a D1 college. I work two jobs during the summer and a different job during the school year, and I currently make more than my mother. The problem is that my dad, the primary source of income for our household, makes too much money in order for me to receive any more money through government loans. My parents also have my file as a dependent on my FAFSA in order to give them a tax break.

My Freshman and Sophomore Years were primarily financed through my HOPE scholarship and Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. However going into my Junior Year, and with the absence of HOPE, I will need to finance what my Federal Loan can't cover.

My federal loan covers $6,500 of the $24,904 I owe the school. Breaking down and looking at the expenses, there are some things I think I can take out. I was planning on living off campus next semester (rent is $325/month + utilities), so I can already take away Room ($4,000) and Board ($3,956) away from the total. That plus my federal loan leaves me with $10,448 or less left to finance. 

I've flitted around the ideas of transferring or becoming a transient student at the University of North Georgia. In order for me to get HOPE back, I would have to raise my GPA to a 3.0 by the end of my Junior year. Even taking a gap year to earn enough money to pay for one more year of school at UGA and attempt to raise my GPA to get HOPE is an option, albeit a last resort kind of option. I'm also looking into filing as an independent for FAFSA but I'm not entirely sure if that will work. 

Considering the above information, here is what I'm asking: What kind of financial guidance can you give me? Are there any obscure loans/grants/scholarships that I can qualify and apply for? How does the process of filing independently work? If there is any information or ideas you can share, it would be greatly appreciated. I need some sort of steady ground to walk on in this shaky moment of my life.

TL;DR I have to finance school on my own after losing HOPE and I need guidance/ideas on how to do so on top of a job.

**EDIT** I cannot take a gap year, as that would result in my loan payment plan to start, and I already can't pay for college, let alone start paying off loans.",finance

I've about $12k in credit card debt with a interest rate of about 23%. 

I was able to get approved for a loan for $9,750 to help consolidate that debt at an interest rate of 12.24% fixed over 7 years, leaving me with a payment of $173 (of which I can pay, at a minimum, double that per month comfortably.). My plan is to pay the minimum amount, until I can pay off the remaining $2,000 of debt, which I believe I should be able to do over the next 3-4 months. 

Overall, my goal is to get my credit card debt down to zero, so I can start saving money. I already have about $35k in retirement savings and contribute 7% to my 401k in excess of my employer's 3% contribution. I've another $17k in a roth IRA from another fidelity account.

personalfinance,My $26K Student Loan Repayment Success and Lessons Learned,"This week I completed repayment of my $26,000 student loan.  

I graduated in 2011 with $26K in loans and interest rates between 4.5% and 6.8%.  For almost two years I made my monthly payments under an Income-Based Repayment model thinking that I was making a dent in my loans, but not wanting to look too closely.  It was scary and confusing.  And of course I was telling myself that the job I got right out of college was only temporary, that any day I would get that awesome well-paying job and I could Really Turn My Attention to paying off my debts.  

Ah, hindsight.  

In March 2013 I finally kicked some sense into myself and decided to really look at my progress.  In those twenty-two months after graduation I had paid a total of $2,938.25 and my balance only went down by $1,415.54.  In other terms, for every $1.00 paid on average my debt went down by $0.48.  Yikes!  

Also, between my initial delay and a few skipped payments, the principal balance had increased.  The sad summary was that I was twenty-two months into repayment and I had only lowered my debt to $25,716.27 (recall the original borrow amount was $26,000).  At this rate I would never be able to crawl out from under this burden.  
It was time to change my repayment approach.  

At this point I went into full Excel wizard mode.  I later found out I had stumbled my way into the Avalanche Method.  Although there were still a few skipped payments along the way, I made sure to overpay as much as I could afford (while still saving for big expenses like a car and a wedding).  

And that brings me here, today, finally debt-free.  

[MY LOAN REPAYMENT CHART](http://imgur.com/a/55DMk)  

The blue line demonstrates how my debt decreased over time, and the green line represents how much I paid toward my loan cumulatively.  You can see during my First 22 Months (average payment $240/month) the blue line hardly lowered at all.  By increasing my monthly payments to an average of $400/month, I was able to cover the monthly interest and make progress on the principal.  

And at the start of 2017, when my debt was around $11K, I could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I increased my monthly payments substantially from an average of $400/month to an average of $2200/month.  No, I hadn’t gotten that awesome well-paying job, but I had my end goal in sight.  

Overall, I’ve paid a total of $33,060.23 in order to repay my original borrow amount of $26,000.  That means 27% of my payments went to feed the interest monster.  

**TL;DR**: Don’t put off loan repayment.  Don’t assume you’re going to get a better job.  Be sure you understand your repayment plan, and how much of your monthly payments is going toward interest versus principal.  Understand that if you are just paying the interest each month you are making zero progress on your debt.",finance

FAFSA and my financial aid package have been released for only 11,100. This summer I will be working around 60+ hours to make around 5,000 dollars at the end of summer, and I always work part time during the school year. I am financially independent from my parents and they can't help support my financial need. 

I also still need to find a place to live near campus's for the next school year and a way to pay for it. A cheaper rent with utilities in my area would cost about 600 each month. Most places also require a co-signer because I don't have rental history or a significant income to get approved for renting. My parents refuse to consign. 

Other expenses would be food, phone (100.00) (going down this summer) and internet (50.00)

Before winter term started I had a pell grant 1,000. The Oregon opportunity grant 700. And bridge to success 2,200. But now the university says my need isn't great enough for those anymore. Here is a break down of my loans I have accumulated and the loans for next year.

Next year:

$54k gross salary in a government job. My take home pay (I get paid monthly) is $2,997 after taxes, medical benefits, pension contribution (about $272/month), and employer sponsored Roth 401k 
contribution ($100/month, no employer match). 


**Credit Cards** - I do most of my spending on these simply for the cash back. I avoid floating and I pay every statement in full. 

DiscoverIT - $2k limit

Amazon Prime Rewards - $2.5k limit


**Debt:**

$18,955 in federal student loans. Mainly looking to reallocate budget in order to avalanche this down. Highest interest is about 5.4%.

$14,375 for 2016 Mazda 3. Bought new (which after reading this sub I regret). Took advantage of a 0% APR offer so there's no interest on loan.


**Budgeted Expenses**

$100 - share of phone bill that I give to my dad. He quoted me less but I give him $100 and let him keep the extra money (I know I shouldn't do this just because he's family but for now it's what's happening. I am under contract until March 2018, so I'll probably get my own plan then. I know $100/mo is too much for phone. 

$123 - Car insurance

$950 - Rent. Rent is actually variable for me since it includes water and stuff. It normally falls around $930ish. I will reallocate the leftover money to savings. 

$59 - electricity

$45 - internet

$11 - renters insurance

$125 - Dues for the archery club I'm in

$17 - Spotify premium family subscription for my family and girlfriend. 

$11 - 2 screen Netflix for my girlfriend and I

$203 - minimum student loan payment 

$288 - car loan payment 

$31 - gym 

$100 - gas (Based on $20/week estimate for 5 weeks). I definitely don't spend this much but I overbudgeted just to be safe. Any leftover money to savings

$250 - (based on $50/week estimate for 5 weeks). I am thinking of cutting this down to $150. I am currently in the process of having a healthy as possible lifestyle so I do not want to skimp on my grocery budget too much. I do most of my shopping at Harris Teeter and Aldi. 

**TOTAL BUDGETED EXPENSES: $2,313**

Now here lies the remaining question. I plan on putting $300 every month into savings (which is also my emergency fund, feel free to correct me if this is bad) which leaves me $384. Should I just allocate all of that into my student loans? Or should I split that up into loans and additional savings so I can raise my EF faster?

personalfinance,Parent Plus student loan options,"I attended college in 2005-2009. At the time, I took out student loans but was not able to get enough to cover the necessaries. My parents took out Parent Plus loans on my behalf with the understanding that I would at some point take them over.

By 2013 I was in a situation where I thought I could handle the burden of the Parent Plus loans. I asked my parents how much the payments were so I could send them the money each month. They said that they weren't sure off the top of their head because they were bundled together with my brother's loans, etc. They said they would get back to me. They didn't.

That scenario repeated a few more times. I kind of figured if they didn't seem worried about it so the situation was probably not a big deal.

I recently paid off the remainder of my personal student loans in a lump sum, and so I brought the topic up again. They said they would find a send the paperwork. I finally got it and... wow. It's bad.

Basically, at some point around 2013 (I think?) they ""consolidated/refinanced"" the loans in some terrible way for a longer term and higher interest rate (8 percent, 20 years). They wanted the monthly payment to be lower. They have been paying on them for roughly a decade now and have barely made a dent in the balance. 

Basically what it boils down to is they/I owe about $30k at about $300/mo. At that rate it will take another decade or so to pay them off, while paying an enormous amount of interest.

The short answer is I need to pay them off ASAP. With effort and sacrifice, I think I can do this in a 1.5-2 years. I don't need PF's help with that part. However, before I begin this in earnest, are there any options I should look at?

Is there loan forgiveness/mitigation/etc for Parent Plus loans? Any way to get this reduced? Anyone with input on this, it will be appreciated.

personalfinance,Seeking help in improving my Credit Score,"Hello, first off thanks for taking the time to read this if you do. A little back story, I messed my credit up in my early 20s since like most 20 year olds that's when I became truly financially responsible for myself. My current credit score is 652 and I would like to try to get it to a ""good"" credit score before the end of the year if I can. At the moment I am deployed, so I am coming into an influx of money that I am not used to having and I think this would be a great time to pay off some debts if I can. But I need guidance. So I'll make this into a bullet format so it is easier for you guys to reply to. 

1. I currently have a Newegg premier card (I got in 2013 and made all my purchases on in 2013) that is 2k in debt but not showing up on my credit report as an account when I look up on credit karma. Does this effect my credit score and if so why isn't it on my credit report? 

2. I have a closed card account on my credit report for the sum of 1.2k. This is damaging my credit score correct? If I pay the debt for this closed account will it improve my credit score? 

3. I have a personal loan for 1.2k from my bank that I pay 100$ on every month. Should I pay more to have it increase my credit score? Or if I pay it off in bulk will my credit go up a lot or slightly or not as much as if I continue to pay 100$ a month? 

4. I have an auto loan for 27.5k that I got in early 2016 from wells Fargo but my bank is navy federal. Should I refinance when I get back to the states? I pay 653$ a month which is a bit much, will it lower my payments for my truck a lot? Also will refinancing hurt or benefit my credit score and how so? 

I would like to get to a ""good"" credit score. I also aim to look to buy a house when I get back in the states in 2-3 months but idk if a 652 is good enough for a 180k-200k home. I am tired of renting and paying towards other people's assets. I'd prefer to pay towards my own asset 

Thanks for those who take the time to read and help. I was dumb in my early 20s and didn't know what I was exactly doing to my future. I'm trying to turn that around.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with excess loans?,"I'm starting graduate school in September for a MPH with plans to become either an epidemiologist  or program director in women's health.

My federal direct loan maximum is $33k a year and I currently plan on taking the max (focusing on the first year only for right now). My program is $27k the first year, which will leave me $6k loan dollars for rent.

My rent is $800 per month, not including utilities. I am going in with $5000 allocated specifically for rent and utilities, and plan on working part time to supplement income for food and other expenses. Transportation is already paid for.

With my own contribution and the leftover loan money, that should cover about 11 months of rent on a year lease. I have the potential to sublet my apartment for 3 months, and first month is already paid for, which would leave me either 8 months of rent or 11 if I do not sublet. (Edit: if I sublet, I will live at home rent free and most likely work to bring in another $4-5k).

I am working this summer and plan on bringing an extra $4-5k, and I'd like to use this before loan money, but I don't want to run the risk of not having enough money going in incase I can't find a job right away.

Is there a good way to go about the excess loan money? I know I can't return it, but should I keep it in my savings for future rent payments? Or make a payment on my loans in that amount?

I'm a bit stumped as to whether or not I can contribute money I make from a fellowship I have in graduate school towards a SO's IRA (she's yet to open it for this reason). From my understanding, I cannot contribute my earnings from my fellowship towards my own IRA because it is not considered an ""earned income"" and is reported on an 1099-MISC as opposed to a W-2. However, my wife works a job on the side while she's been in dental school and largely uses this money for odds and ends like eating out, paying the cable bill, etc. My question is is can I contribute a portion of my ""income"" from my fellowship toward an IRA for her ALTHOUGH I cannot do so for myself? I figure I can only contribute up to the amount she has earned throughout the year (~$3000) rather than the maximum of $5500 if you earn over that amount. Any help is much appreciated!

personalfinance,Student loan repayment options when my Dad and I are paying to the same account,"Hello everyone!

I am just about to finish my graduate program, and will begin to start paying off my graduate student loans. I took out loans in undergrad in my name, but my Dad is graciously paying those off. We probably should have done Parent-PLUS loans, but it is what it is now. So now all of my loans are in my name, and they are all in the same account, under the same borrower. Hence, it is all one lump sum. 

My husband and I want to pay off my graduate loans within five years, so we are planning to make large payments. My Dad will likely stick to a standard 10-year plan for his portion.

Here's the issue- The undergrad loans that my Dad is paying down have a higher interest rate than my graduate loans. When we start to make monthly payments, it will first pay down the interest, followed by the loan with the highest interest.

I owe $39,000 at 5.5% interest (5-year payment is $740/month)
My Dad owes $19,000 at 6.8% interest (10-year payment is $220)

We were simply going to use that calculated monthly payment for both of us, but with the amount automatically going towards the higher interest loan, things get murky.

Is there anything we can do to mitigate the mixing of funds? My loan provider allows you to designate ""excess"" funds over the minimum payment to a specific account, but that still creates issues because our standard minimum payment is $680 (meaning most of our payment would go towards his loans). If we switched to Income-based repayment it would decrease our monthly minimum payment to $270.

Any advice or if anyone has experience with this would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Thinking of going back to school just to take an internship. Is this a bad idea?,"Last year I graduated a semester earlier than anticipated and have since been living with my parents and working as a janitor despite having a BS in Film and Video Production.  I’ve begun to realize this was a horrible mistake as I lack much of the experience and portfolio pieces that my former classmates (now competitors) graduated with.  As a result, finding a job has been damn near impossible. I’ve tried pulling myself by my bootstraps and freelancing, but clients simply laugh at my inexperience and amateur reel.  My hometown is too economically and culturally depressed to offer any way to gain experience here and the closest economic bastions, such as the city where I went to school, are too far away to commute from my parent’s house to.  If I got a full time job in an unrelated field I would be able to afford to move out, but not be able to commit to an internship as a flexible schedule is a strict requirement for film/video work.  If I worked part time, I could intern, but if that internship is unpaid I would not be able to support myself.  Paid internships are too rare and competitive for them to be a realistic option.  I’m considering going back to school for one more semester so I can take a couple critical classes and get an unpaid internship.  I really want money coming INTO my bank account rather than spending more, but I am so miserable and demoralized that it feels like my only hope.  


I have been fortunate to only have federal loans and I currently owe $22.3k in debt with an interest rate of 4.1% (both of which are far below the national average).  If I went back to school full time for one more semester, I would owe the government an extra $5k (if I got approved).  This would include tuition, fees, and housing.  All other expenses I could afford If my current job transferred me to the city where my school is and kept my pay at $11/hr (what it is now).  If I did this, in a worst-case scenario situation, I will have gained nothing valuable and will be forced to move back home and start where I am now; only this time I owe $27.3k in debt which I am unlikely to pay off as a janitor (or similar low wage job).  In a best-case scenario, I would secure a job or paid internship after the semester and begin my career as a digital media professional and will have the means to pay off my debt.  The likelihood of the latter situation is still incredibly slim as I’ll only have 12 weeks to become worthy of a junior position or paid internship at a company.  On the other hand, I originally went to school prepared to graduate with at least $30k in debt anyway regardless of my career path.  


Ultimately, housing and maybe groceries are the only expenses I cannot afford with my current income, so if there is a way to cover those things while I intern and work part time, my crisis will be solved.  I don’t have any friends that would let me crash on their couch long term.  If you know of any solutions, please let me know.  I deeply appreciate your feedback.",finance
financialindependence,The final lap: optimizing benefits and deductions during your last year of work,"**Overview**

Hi everyone. I created this non-exhaustive list of some of the practical considerations to think about during the last year of your employment. This is mostly a compilation of the thoughts and strategies that I plan to eventually implement one day, and thought I would share them with the group. I don’t discuss severance because I am relatively new to working and do not have significant experience or knowledge of it. So take these with a grain of salt, but I think they should be applicable considerations to the majority on this sub. 


**Vesting and bonus payments**

Typically the best time to separate is after you receive a large bonus or vesting and there is not another bonus or vesting round in the near future. This minimizes the golden handcuff effect and makes sure that you are not leaving any significant supplemental compensation on the table. Check your bonus payout schedule and 401k vesting schedule to make sure you are aware of these dates. 

For those who started a new job and received a sign-on bonus, read the contract language to determine how much of your sign-on bonus must be paid back if you leave. Typically you will have to pay back a prorated portion of your bonus if you leave before 2-3 years. You will likely have to repay the full grossed-up amount which was a shock for a co-worker of mine. Basically if you get a $5,000 bonus and $3,000 of tax assistance and then leave, you will have to pay back the prorated portion on the full $8,000 not the $5,000. Typically companies with use your last paycheck to cover some of this and then request you pay back the difference.


**Paid time off**

Take a look at your company’s PTO policy. Some will pay out a lump sum of your banked PTO days up to a limit (i.e. 80 hours of PTO max). Some will not pay out any unused PTO. Make sure that you don’t have any PTO days go to waste. Be sure to take PTO to the extent that you will get credit for all you days accrued, whether this is in the form of actual PTO or a lump sum payout of PTO.

However, there are additional benefits of taking PTO instead of holding them, including 1) you don’t have to worry about when they will get paid back to you 2) it extends your official length of employment and 3) you will likely not get 401k matching if you take PTO days as a lump sum. To understand the benefit of #2, think about it in the context of vesting. Let’s say you are itching to leave and have two weeks of PTO saved, but are only one month from your bonus payment or next round of 401k vesting. Try to leave as little on the table: take the two weeks of PTO and work an additional two weeks to get that next round of vesting. I know this example is low hanging fruit and that you may have longer duration golden handcuffs. But generally, using your entire PTO bank before you leave seems like the optimal strategy.  


**Health insurance/ACA planning**

If you have a good health insurance plan, you may want to take this chance to use it for any known medical issues or checkups. While you may have the opportunity for a better plan under the ACA (you would need to [optimize AGI to get the largest subsidies](https://www.healthinsurance.org/affordable-care-act/subsidy-calculator/)), this is no guarantee. If you have no medical issues, then at least consider getting your annual checkup if it is fully covered as an annual benefit. 


**Dental insurance**

Some dental plans require that you wait at least 6 months in between semi-annual cleanings for the benefit to be covered. However, other plans will cover two routine cleaning visits per calendar year. If your plan is the latter type, take advantage of this by making sure you take your two dental cleanings in the calendar year that you leave. For example, if your 6 month check-up is in January and you plan to leave in March, consider setting up the additional “free” appointment before you leave in March. 


**Vision insurance**

Similarly, some vision insurance benefits may have a twelve month period between covered check-ups while others provide covered benefits based on calendar year. If you have coverage by calendar year, take advantage of your annual benefit before you leave to get an eye exam and/or glasses/contacts at a discounted cost. (Or if you are like me whose eyes don’t change much and don’t like getting poked in the eye, just get the glasses.)


**401k/HSA/IRA/Roth contributions**

You can front-load contributions to HSA, traditional 401k, and traditional IRA accounts to make sure that you max out (or get close to maxing out) during the calendar year that you leave. This has the benefit of lowing your AGI to allow you to either take advantage of ACA subsidies or pay a lower tax rate on income deferred from the prior year using the excess state tax withholding strategy below. 


**Excess state tax withholding**

If you are certain that you are going to leave during your next calendar year, consider artificially raising your state income tax withholding above what you would owe. This will allow you to take an itemized deduction on the excess withholding while you are at a higher marginal tax bracket and defer it to next calendar year via tax refund at a lower tax bracket. This strategy works best with high income earners who already itemize deductions so that they can get the full tax deferral of excess state tax withholding.

Note, that depending on how much excess you withhold, this could bump you out of optimal AGI for ACA subsidies. Once you leave, you may want to optimize your AGI for either ACA subsidies or to pay 0% LT capital gains tax. Whichever you chose, excess state tax withholding can help you get there, just make sure that the benefit you are getting from federal income tax deferral is still greater than any lost subsidy from a higher AGI. 


**TLDR**

- Generally best time to leave is after you have maxed out all tax-advantaged accounts and have received a large bonus or vesting
- Use up all of your PTO before you leave
- Take full advantage of your health, dental, and vision insurance benefits before you leave
- If you are less concerned about qualifying for ACA subsidies, consider excess state tax withholding in the calendar year prior to your calendar year of departure to defer income to a lower marginal tax rate

financialindependence,Since savings accounts have such low interest rates should a FIRE minded person bother opening one?,[removed],finance
Bitcoin,My experience buying bitcoin in an IRA,"Back in late February, I decided I would like to put some of my IRA balance into bitcoin.  I had followed GBTC for some time and noticed the premium was down to 10%.  I figured that if the ETF was approved the premium would go down but that would more than be made up by a likely big price rise.  If the ETF was denied, I figured the premium would go back up to the 30-50% range again and I would be insulated from a pullback.

In late April, early May when bitcoin was starting to rise over $1300 and the premium started going up, I looked into getting a self-directed IRA.  I wanted to exploit the (at the time) 30% NAV premium of GBTC and swap them for real bitcoin and profit from the premium difference.  I found 2 options.  BitcoinIRA and Broad Financial.

BitcoinIRA does a fair amount of advertising but they do not tell you the fees unless you contact them.  Doing a Google search makes it look like the only option.  I contacted them for more information on security and fees and this is what I received.  

The process and security protocols we go through are as follows:
 
&gt; 1.	Once the IRA is established with your new custodian, Kingdom Trust Co,  our IRA department will work with your existing custodian to transfer funds. This is a tax-deferred rollover.
&gt; 2.	We then purchase the Bitcoin through our liquidity partner, Genesis Trading. This is an off-the-exchange purchase to increase security.
&gt; 3.	The Bitcoin are then placed inside your IRA wallet with BitGo.
&gt; 4.	Three keys are generated and kept in cold storage. One at Kingdom Trust’s certified and insured depository. The second with BitGo’s certified and insured depository, and the third at Keytern.al Recovery Services.
&gt; 5.	To perform any transaction, two of those keys have to be taken out of cold storage and verified at the same time.
&gt; 6.	The IRA owner has viewing privileges of their BitGo wallet, and has access to the public wallet address to verify its bitcoin content at any time with blockchain.info or any other company.
&gt; 7.	In addition, BitcoinIRA carries a $1 million Consumer Protection insurance policy with Lloyds of London that protects you the consumer on the transactional side from any internal cases of fraud or theft.

Still no information on cost.  After asking again, here are the fees.

&gt; 20K to 100K 15%
&gt; 100K to 200K 13%
&gt; 200K + 11%
&gt; Annual custodial fee $100.

I was shocked by such huge fees.  I was not willing to part with over 11-15% to set this up, might as well keep GBTC since I purchased it with only a 10% premium.  I then contacted Broad Financial. And here is what I received.

&gt; Benefits of our Self-Directed IRA
&gt; •	A self-directed plan is a hedge against uncertainty through true diversification
&gt; •	Invest your retirement funds into all investment classes (real estate, private loans, gold &amp; silver, etc.)
&gt; •	Open a checking account for your Ultimate IRA® at any bank of your choosing
&gt; •	Place all investments by simply writing a check
&gt; •	Transfer/ roll-over your existing retirement funds into your Ultimate IRA®’s checking account
&gt; •	No transaction or asset-based fees
Fees
&gt; •	 $1,395 - Our one-time fee includes helping you set-up a new self-directed IRA, forming the LLC and the initial State filing fee, creating the customized operating agreement, obtaining a Federal ID Number, preparing all documents, and providing continued support. This can be paid upfront (and is tax deductible) or you can pay $495 upfront and pay the balance from your IRA once it is set-up.
&gt; •	Custodial Fees- Madison Trust Company
&gt; o   $100 - one-time fee which includes setting up the new IRA and funding your LLC
&gt; o   $196 - annually (paid quarterly), covers the annual IRS 5498 report (fixed fee - regardless of your account size, or the number of transactions you place within your IRA LLC).

On further questioning, they confirmed to me that I can decide how the bitcoin is stored.  If I want to put the keys on a Trezor, I can.  If I do not trust myself and want to use a coinbase multisig vault I can.  This was a huge issue for me.  I wanted to decide how the bitcoin was stored and Broad Financial allowed for all the options.  Interestingly, BitcoinIRA messaged me multiple times about how risky it is to control your own keys.  Maybe true for many people but IMO it is not risky if you take the right precautions and have family members you trust.  Not to mention paying many thousands for that service.  Personally, I have duplicated Trezors, one with me and one with my daughter stored in her safe.  I make her plug it in and check that she remembers the PIN and knows how to use it every 6 months.

So, I decided to go with Broad Financial.  There were some additional fees of about $200 because of how I wanted to setup the LLC.  Some people can avoid that depending on their employment situation.  My total cost, including expedite fees and wire fees, was under $2000.

It took about 1 week to get everything set up.  During this time, Bitcoin was going crazy.  I needed to open a trading account for my new LLC.  I submitted applications to GDAX, Gemini, and Kraken.  It has been about 3 weeks now, and none of those accounts is open yet.  I then submitted to Bitstamp 2 weeks ago and that is still in review.  I had my bank account for the new LLC open and an incoming wire but still no way to buy bitcoin.  I was getting really worried since I had my cash in limbo.  What if the price keeps going up?  I discovered itBit.  They were able to open my account within 3 days.  Just in time.  I was nervous because I sold all my GBTC and the funds were going through the legacy banking maze to get to me.  It takes about 2 weeks, IRA to IRA to LLC to exchange.  Fortunately, I was very lucky when I sold it.  It was on the day of the first push to $2800.  I sold GBTC at $1 below the highest it has been even up to at the time of this post at $564.  This represented a 120% premium over NAV.  Crazy.

I did get nervous I was going to get frozen out from completing this transfer.  It took 3 days for my bank to send the wire from my LLC to the itBit exchange.

No explanation for the delay, but I suspect they thought about denying it and it had to be approved by their compliance office.  itBit did tell me that they have had some customer bank accounts closed because of transactions with them.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to pay off my 13K+ auto loan?,"r/personalfinance, this is more of a sanity check.

My wife and I have a discretionary savings account into which we put any money we save at the end of each month. We currently have 10K in this account, and we're likely to save ~3K within the next couple months. The more I think about it, the more appealing I find the idea of using this money to pay off the auto loan (interest rate: 2.4%).


Does this make sense? Am I not seeing the full picture here? 

EDIT: 

Any money that goes into the discretionary account is in addition to the 15% of our combined monthly salary that goes into our mandatory savings account (which has ~40K right now, not counting our emergency fund). So I wouldn't be using up the bulk of my savings, and as long as my wife and I maintain our current combined income, we should be able to build up our fun savings in ~6 months. Hope that sheds some light on the situation :)",finance
gaming,I'm a gamer who recently got dumped,"As the title suggests, I'm a gamer who was recently dumped by their girlfriend.

As someone who was very much into gaming before we started dating, and then (softly) coerced into gaming less and less as time passed in the relationship, I started to value playing video games less and less.

My ex girlfriends friends were all creative people - artists, musicians, dancers, people who scoffed at video games as a waste of time or some inferior medium. A medium for sad people who were incapable of doing anything else.

After almost 2 years of this ideology, my belief system has been shaken. Now that she's dumped me, I became so afraid that due to my intense involvement in video games growing up, I had wasted my life doing something that so few ""cool"" or ""normal"" people related to. Like, if I approached someone on the street and asked about music, it'd probably be seen as normal. As for video games, I dunno. Would I be seen as weird?

I guess I'm just so insecure about my life decisions right now. Sure, sinking hours into runescape made me happy while I was doing it, but now my girlfriend has left me I feel like so much of what I did was worthless. 

But I don't want to feel this way. So much of my identity was tied to gaming. And I really want to be convinced that the decisions I made weren't made in vein. I just didn't know where else to turn.

investing,The reason for a drop in millennial spending isn't a generational change - it's an economic one.,"Bear (heh) with me here.  I was digging through some congress bills at work today when I stumbled upon something interesting - something *golden*.  Enlightenment, if you will.  [S.4232, 113th Congress, aka the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2432)

To put it briefly, the act was calling for changes to student loans, to allow borrowers to refinance unpaid debt and thereby alleviate the growing pressure of tuition on middle- and lower-class families.  

[Here's a brief .pdf that makes arguing points in support of the bill.](https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Warren%20Refinancing%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf).  

Ultimately, the bill was never passed - but the arguments for it remain.  

&gt; Key federal economic agencies like the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have weighed in on the dangers of exploding student debt. This debt is stopping a growing proportion of families from buying homes, saving for retirement, and making purchases that will keep our economy on the road to recovery

Sound familiar?  How many articles have come out asking about how and why millennials are ""killing"" major industries? (if you haven't kept up, [this marketwatch article makes for a nice recap](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-all-of-the-things-millennials-have-been-accused-of-killing-2017-05-22).)  It's easy to see that student loans put economic pressure on millennials, and perhaps change their spending habits in interesting ways.  

But besides small spending behavior changes, student loans are killing spending altogether. 

Let's take a look at [some recent data](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/).   

44,000,000 Americans with student loan debt. 
Average loan delinquency rate of 11.2%.  
$1,440,000,000,000 estimated total U.S.  student loan debt.

""In 2012, 71 percent of students graduating from four-year colleges had student loan debt:

    Represents 1.3 million students graduating with debt, increase from 1.1 million in 2008
    66 percent of graduates from public colleges had loans (average debt of $25,550)
    75 percent of graduates from private nonprofit colleges had loans (average debt of $32,300)
    88 percent of graduates from for-profit colleges had loans (average debt of $39,950)""

""...the average Class of 2016 graduate has $37,172 in student loan debt, up six percent from last year.""

Combined with inflation and an overall lack of wage increases, the real cost of college is growing almost exponentially. 

The ultimate effect?  Macroeconomic slowdown.  Let's break it down: 

- Tuition is rising.
- Wages for graduates have not grown in pace with tuition / inflation.
- Graduates are left with less money in their pockets to spend.
- The businesses that serve a younger audience begin to feel pressure; their usual customers can no longer afford their products / services. 
- These businesses then see declines in revenue, forcing them to slow operations and potentially lay off employees. 
- The cycle spirals. 

If the market is driven by money (and it is), then it's bound to happen.  Let's look back to our key players - the education industry, and student loan providers.  

Colleges and universities are in a wonderland of profitability - the public has committed itself to paying more and more every year for a service that we've decided is 'essential' to a successful life.  While other industries that market towards young people are suffering, the education industry has yet to feel the pain - colleges will be the last thing that the current rising generation gives up for economic reasons (since we bombard children with the idea that they will never be successful without a college degree, and everyone wants to make at least some money).  If motivated by money, colleges have no reason to lower tuition rates until a major economic failure (that disrupts loaners) forces them to do so. 

Loan providers, too, have little reason to change.  In 2014, the U.S. government stood to profit over $60,000,000,000 on loans from 2007-2012 alone (https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Warren%20Refinancing%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf).  That type of money isn't easy to give up, even for a country like the United States - and nobody is calling for them to do the right thing here.  They won't feel any reason to change until returns on defaulted loans drop to the point where no one purchases the outstanding debt.  As mentioned before, college (and therefore, student debt) will be the last thing the current generation gives up for economic reasons - meaning that by the time repayment plummets, other industries will have already been affected by several quarters (or more) of revenue loss due to lower spending by millennials.

personalfinance,Mortgage for 230K house,"Hi all,

I'm from Puerto Rico and looking for a house here. I came across a new development that I fell in love with. The houses costs from 190-230K. I currently make $57,000/yr.

I spoke to the developer and the house applies for a rural loan. I'd only have to pay for the closing costs. There are no property taxes here in PR and the interest rate offered for the Rural Mortgage varies from 3-3.25. I'm interested in the 230K ones as those have a considerable amount of extra space.

The maintenance costs would come out at $99/mo. My job is pretty stable and I've been getting offers for similar rates around, so job security isn't an issue AFAIK. Am I crazy for wanting a mortgage this big? I don't have student loans because I paid for college in cash (college here is $1K per semester) and the only debt I have is a car which I finish paying on November of this year. Can anyone tell me if I'm crazy for doing this? I've seen tons of houses but this one I fell in love with.

My expenses are:

$14/mo health insurance

$415/mo until November for car

$1,000/mo rent (literally live next to my job)

$350 or so per month on groceries

$150/mo electric bill

$24/mo water bill

$100/mo internet (I can get better prices though)

I really don't want to, but she is right that we are not really in a position to sit on potential cash when we have some shitty interest rates staring us in the face.

personalfinance,[Taxes] W-4 calculator for allowances and NJ W-4,"My parents claim me as a dependent, I am working for almost two months as an intern, I am making $3-4k. I don't have any deductibles. 

I used the IRS allowance calculator and was told I have 11 allowances. When I do the personal allowance worksheet on the W-4, I only get one allowance. Also, on many sites, they say if someone one claims you as a dependent, you should do zero allowances. So how many allowances do I write for the federal W-4? 

Also, the NJ W-4 asks you how many allowances you have, do I put the same number as the federal W-4? 

Am I able to write EXEMPT on my [NJ W-4](http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/current/njw4.pdf)?

personalfinance,Should I borrow from my TSP to pay off my Student Loans?,"Hi all, I have a question and would like some help.

I have two student loans 
a) Fedloan = $6500 @ 4.68%
b) University = $5,000 @ 10%

I am 26 and work for the federal government. I have enough in my TSP that I can withdraw a loan to pay the full amount of both balances. Would this be an unwise thing to do? It is attractive for two reasons:

1. The interest rate on the loan is 2.25% and is paid to my account.
2. I can continue to make contributions to my TSP while my loan is outstanding. 

I realize that I would be losing out on potential gains of having $11.5k on the market, but I feel like it is justified given the significant reduction in interest rates. Does this make sense to do? Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"Take advantage of the tools on Credit Karma, they seriously helped me out!","I had a 2001 Altima that was paid off and ran fine...until it didn't.

Because of stupid things in my early 20s my credit was pretty poor so when I got a ""new"" car I had an 11.49% interest rate. I've been slooowly rebuilding my credit over the last year and wanted to check into refinancing. 

I got with my local credit union and they would not touch it since my credit was under 620 so I figured I was stuck. 

I used the tools on credit karma for refinancing and they did a soft pull to match me with lenders. Capital One had a great offer where I'd have the same amount of monthly payments but only a 5.8% interest rate. This is going to save me $40/mo plus $400/yr in interest! They approved it within an hour and after submitting my proof of income and a conference call with my current lender the check is already in the mail.

I've also used their offers on secured and unsecured cards to bring my total available credit up to $1500 with 5% utilization. They really can help you start rebuilding.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my high interest loan as fast as possible or keep it to rebuild credit score?,"Quick Facts:

* Loan in question is a Sallie Mae student loan with a variable interest rate of 9.125% and a balance of $1,064. No missed payments.

* Monthly income is approximately $1000 - $1,230. 

* I have other federal student loans which are current and have interest rates around 4%, total balance is approximately $15,250. Account is current, some missed payments, not in collections. I am making a $175/mo. payment toward this debt.

* I missed multiple payments on 3 other credit cards which were sent to collections. I paid one in full, the other two have balances of $1916 and $3059. I have been making small monthly payments toward these debts. 

* As a result of above, my FICO score is 509. 

* I don't have a substantial emergency savings yet. Only $100.00

I'm looking to rebuild my credit score. Since the biggest hit to my credit is my payment history, I figure making more on time payments will give it a boost so I am only making the minimum payment of $50. Is this the best strategy?

personalfinance,Requesting critique of how I've set my finances and suggestions on where to make changes.,"Dear PF, I've been reading over the links, guides, and suggestion, and I'm pretty sure I've set myself on the right path. Below is what I'm working on to pay down my debts and save money for later in life (retirement/emergency fund).  I look forward to any suggestions; critiques; recommendations; and advice.  Personal Info (if relevant): 37 yrs old; Single; Male; 


Investments/Savings:

* 5% post tax to my Roth 401k, with my employer matching 4% (1:1 for the first 3%, 1:.5 for the next 2%).  This is currently at $1k as I was only eligible to start this year on Jan 1.  It is set for Cash Equivalent investment Objective, but I'm scheduling an appointment with the Financial Professional to discuss options (I'm still working on wrapping my head around the different investment types)
* $25/mo Emergency fund (this is really low for what I'd like to do, but it's what I can afford until I get my debts down/paid off).  Currently $0 as I need to use it, but I'm contributing to this again starting this month
* HSA with $61.96 balance.  Employer Contributions: $62.50/mo.  Personal Contribution: $0

Income after Saving/Investing/Taxes:

* Primary Job: $721.08 (this is goes to my local CU for fixed bill pay), $169.17 (this goes to a second credit union, covers variable expenses like Groceries and Gas)
* Second Job: $775 (this goes to my local CU, for fixed bills)


Loan Debts (ranked from highest emotional weight and interest rate to lowest):

* $2,156.   This is a debt in collections.  I'm currently making payments through August of $125/mo, and then ramping up to $300/mo afterwards (and using enough of my Xmas bonus to pay off).   Payoff Date: December 2017.  Interest rate: None.  Goal: To not have this heavy rock on my credit history anymore
* $2,255.22.   This is a Care Credit Card I needed for dental work last year (and this year, potentially).  Payments: $130/mo (the minimum is $77/mo).  Interest rate: 26.5%  Payoff Date:  Dec 2019 (current projection).   Goal: Payoff and keep the card open in case of medical emergencies.  Also as positive mark on credit history (both with timely payments and available credit)
* $25,643.35.  Navient Private Student Loan.  Payments: $300/mo (the amount due each month is variable, due to an APR and the number of days in month.  Usually between $206-$277 minimum).  Payoff date:  2030 at the current rate.  Goal:  Pay this off at a much higher aggressive rate once Collections debt and Care Credit paid off.
*  $704.62.  Credit Union credit card. Payment: $100/mo until paid in full.  Interest Rate: 1.9% until 5/18, then 17.5%.  Goal: Acquired to pay for car repairs.  Will pay off before interest goes up, then use it to pay for $40 in Entertainment/mo (which is paid off each month in full) to build good credit history.  This has higher interest, but less emotional weight.
* $20,090.68.  UNSubsidized Student loan.  Payments: Currently none, as I can't afford them with my other loans.   Interest: 5%.  Payoff: Unknown.  Plan to start making payments next year, once Collections debt is paid off.
* 14,382.70.  Subsidized Student loan.  Payments: Currently none, as I can't afford them with my other loans.   Interest: 5%.  Payoff: Unknown.  Plan to start making payments next year, once Collections debt is paid off.

personalfinance,Planning to buy a multi-unit home (3 units). Owner-Occupier or rent all three units?,"My wife and I are looking at purchasing our first house. We are looking at purchasing a multi-unit home for the potential to earn extra income. We live with her parents now and there is no rush to have us move out. 

Our long term plan is to use the income from this first house to help save for a second multi-unit in about 5 years.  Then again soon there after, until we're managing enough property that we can afford our ""forever home"" off of the income earned from our investment properties.

We've been told by banks that interest rates for mortgages on these kinds of property vary, in that owner-occupiers get a lower interest rate than investment mortgages and that there is a minimum time frame one must be an owner-occupier before they can move out to free up a unit for another tenant.

A lower interest rate sound appealing, but a thought occurred to me that it might not be the best path to take.  My thoughts are that, if we get the investment mortgage, even though it has a higher interest rate, our monthly mortgage payments won't be affected all that much.  We will free up the unit we would occupy and begin collecting rent as soon as we find a tenant, thus saving for our next down payment more quickly.  Simply put, the faster we can save for and acquire more property, the more quickly we can increase our income, and that the increased income will more than make up for the  higher overall costs of a higher interest rate.",finance
ethereum,[Discussion] Government could be wayyy more efficient if run on smart contracts.,"Heres an idea I was mulling around in my head if the USA wanted to make use of smart contracts.....

* The USA (or probably more accurately the federal reserve) could take half of what they normally print into USD and create a USD token on the blockchain as a baseline.
* The USA could buy up millions of .eth domains that correspond to a Social Security ID's or just a new format of ID's in general.
* These .eth domains could be distributed to the populace's private keys. These addresses can subscribe to a ""citizenship"" contract, which gives the address the right to hold a usable Passport, a Driver's licenses, and gives the address voting rights.
* Taxes would be taken out of the address, and employers would pay into the address.
* Food stamps could be a special token that can't be traded with most addresses, almost completely eliminating their abuse.
* These .eth addresses could hold property or car contracts, so ownership can be traced easily

While my research has focused on the association between food poisoning (gastroenteritis) and the disruption of gut flora, SIBO and the pathophysiology of IBS, our group here has researched links between the gut microbiome and diabetes and obesity to the role that the microbiome has affected our hormones.

stocks,JIM ROGERS: The worst crash in our lifetime is coming.,"http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-rogers-worst-crash-lifetime-coming-2017-6?IR=T
Legendary investor Jim Rogers sat down with Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget on this week's episode of The Bottom Line. Rogers predicts a market crash in the next few years. One that he says will rival anything he has seen in his lifetime. Following is a transcript of the video.

Blodget: One of the things I’ve always admired about you as an investor is that you don’t talk about what should be. You figure out what is going to be and then, you do that. So what is going to be with respect to the stock market? What’s going to happen?

Rogers: I learned very early in my investing careers: I better not invest in what I want. I better invest in what’s happening in the world. Otherwise, I’ll be broke. Dead broke.Well, what’s going to happen is it’s going to continue. Some stocks in America are turning into a bubble. The bubble’s gonna come. Then it’s gonna collapse and you should be very worried. But Henry, this is good for you. Because someone has to report it. So you have job security. You’re a lucky soul.

Blodget: Well, yeah, TV ratings do seem to go up during crashes but then they completely disappear when everyone is obliterated, so no one is hoping for that. So when is this going to happen?

Rogers: Later this year or next.  

Blodget: Later this year or next?

Rogers: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Write it down. 

Blodget: And what will trigger it?

Rogers: Well, it’s interesting because these things always start where we’re not looking. In 2007, Iceland went broke. People said, ‘Iceland? Is that a country? They have a market?’ And then Ireland went broke. And then Bear Stearns went broke. And Lehman Brothers went broke. They spiral like that. Always happens where we’re not looking. I don’t know. It could be an American pension plan that goes broke and many of them are broke, as you know. It could be some country we’re not watching. It could be all sorts of things. It could be war. Unlikely to be war but it’s going to be something. When you’re watching Business Insider and you see, ‘That’s so interesting. I didn’t know that company could go broke.’ It goes broke. Send me an email and then I’ll start watching.

Blodget: And how big a crash could we be looking at? 

Rogers: It’s going to be the worst in your lifetime.

Blodget: I’ve had some pretty big ones in my lifetime.  

Rogers: It’s going to be the biggest in my lifetime and I’m older than you. No, it’s going to be serious stuff. We’ve had financial problems in America -- let’s use America -- every four to seven years, since the beginning of the republic. Well, it’s been over eight since the last one. This is the longest or second longest in recorded history, so it’s coming. And the next time it comes -- you know, in 2008, we had a problem because of debt. Henry, the debt now -- that debt is nothing compared to what’s happening now. In 2008, the Chinese had a lot of money saved for a rainy day. It started raining. They started spending the money. Now, even the Chinese have debt and the debt is much higher. The federal reserves, the central bank in America, the balance sheet is up over five times, since 2008. It’s going to be the worst in your lifetime, my lifetime too. Be worried.

Blodget: I am worried.

Rogers: Good. Good.

Blodget:   Can anybody rescue us?

Rogers: They will try. What’s going to happen is they’re going to raise interest rates some more. Then when things start going really bad, people are going to call and say, ‘You must save me. It’s Western civilization. It’s going to collapse.’ And the Fed, who is made up of bureaucrats and politicians, will say, ‘Well, we better do something.’ And they’ll try but it won’t work. It’ll cause some rallies but it won’t work this time.  

Blodget: And we are in a situation where Western civilization already seems to be possibly collapsing, even with the market going up all the time. Often when you do have a financial calamity, you get huge turmoil in the political system. What happens politically if that happens? 

Rogers: Well, that’s why I moved to Asia. My children speak Mandarin because of what’s coming. You’re going to see governments fail. You’re going to see countries fail, this time around. Iceland failed last time. Other countries fail. You’re going to see more of that. You’re going to see parties disappear. You’re going to see institutions that have been around for a long time -- Lehman Brothers had been around over 150 years. Gone. Not even a memory for most people. You’re going to see a lot more of that next around, whether it’s museums or hospitals or universities or financial firms.",finance

We do not have any kind of debts at this time. We cleared our auto debt 2 years ago. So, I am trying to understand what would be best choice with our profile and also, clarify some questions. 

1. would local vendor be better or national one? As I understand, they would do a hard check on our credit history, so, how much would be this impact our credit history. Say, if we want to go with another lender, they would do another check.

2. I am a worry wart, so, I prefer to pay the home loan as quickly as possible. So, even if we take 15/30 year loan, can I prepay the loan in 5 years without any penalty?

3. The sample quote I received from a local lender has 3.125/3.625/4.00 interest rate for 15/20/30 years. Is this normal interest rate now?

personalfinance,My first time financing a car,"I've been reading this sub pretty obsessively lately, as my finances are finally starting to feel stable after years of struggle and I want to improve my weak credit. However my issue today is auto financing, which has come up suddenly due to an immediate need to replace a car on its last legs.

I know I'm not going to get an ideal interest rate with my credit, but I've been using a pre-qualifying program that doesn't use a hard pull, which allows me to see and tweak all the variables that go into the rate and the payment. I'm looking at used cars, around 3 years old in the $10,000 range. More than once I've seen advice to get a longer term loan with a lower payment, and pay extra as much as you can whenever you're able. This seems like a smart plan, but I have two concerns:

First, I want to be sure I won't be paying on a used car for 5 years. Second, it's looking like a longer loan term could increase my interest rate by as much as 1.5%. Am I worried about nothing? In my situation would it be better to get the shorter loan term?

personalfinance,Friendly Tip - Harvesting Capital Gains with no taxes!,"Hey guys! 

Thought I would share a tip that I learned in Federal Income Tax Law this past year (Law Student). Only applies to LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS. Held for over 1 year. 

As many of you may know, capital gains tax sucks. Here is something a lot of people do not know: If you make under $37,450 single or $74,900 married (Taxable income), you do not pay capital gains taxes. 0%. That's right. 

I recommend utilizing the heck out of this and doing some ""Capital Gains Harvesting"" with your appreciated stock if you can. 

Example: You are a married couple with a taxable income of 50k. You bought some stock years ago for 1k that has increased in value to 11k. You should sell that stock, creating 10k in income that should be subject to capital gains tax, and then rebuy the stock in a couple of days. Your income is under $74,900, so those 10k in gains you just realized are TAX FREE. This saved you approximately $1,500 if you would have had to pay taxes on them in the future. (10k x 15% = $1,500). Your basis in the stock is now 11k instead of 1k, meaning in the future you only have to pay taxes on the gain from 11k+. This is especially useful for people who know they are going to make more money in the future than they have now. 

This is also an excellent way to change from individual stocks that have done well to index funds without incurring taxable gains. 

Note: This is in regard to Federal Income Tax only. Different States have different Capital Gains Income Tax rates and rules. 

Here is an article about it from Boggleheads wiki: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_gain_harvesting",finance
personalfinance,Which is the smarter way to pay off my car payment?,"Quick backstory: I have an auto loan out currently around $12.5k with a terrible 12.9% interest rate. It's a 5 year loan but I'm paying it off more quickly so I can be done with it. My payment is $325/month but I pay ~$500/month to it and put extra money towards it as well (tax returns, birthday, etc). So I got the loan in January, and since then have made a bunch of payments online. For some of them I thought the money would just go towards principal but I'm now realizing that they were all going towards principal and interest. So now, I technically don't have a payment due until August, but of course I still pay it off more every month.

Because of this my $500 payments for June and July will be all principal (I figured out how to properly do this). In the long run, which way of paying off this auto loan is more effective? Should I

a.) Make a bunch of payments at a time and then spend the next couple months purely paying off principal or

b.) Just make my payment every month and apply $175 to the principal each month separately?

If there is a third way to do this that is better I of course would take that advice also. I'm just mortified by my interest but I don't think refinancing is an option as the moment and I want to pay off my loan a lot quicker than 5 years. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",finance

Late filer here.  I submitted an extension due to lots of out of country travel during the spring, couldn't get all the forms, etc.  Irresponsible, but I'm doing them now through TurboTax.

I finished grad school last year from an institution that offered me a full tuition scholarship.  My 1098 says I was awarded $17k in 2016 and paid $0 in tuition.  Obviously this doesn't reflect reality, as I never even handled that money.  It came from the school's grant and immediately was used to pay off the $17k tuition bill.  

I'm not really sure what to do, as suddenly losing $2.5k is a pretty big windfall for me, and I don't feel like it accurately reflects my income.

I've tried to do research on this, but it's not proving very fruitful.  I see a lot of ""don't report your 1098-t if you didn't pay any tuition out of pocket"" but that makes me very nervous.

Am I using the software incorrectly?  I have also tried adjusting the amount paid in box 2 of my 1098-t to reflect my scholarship amount, so it should equalize out to $0.  But that doesn't seem to affect my federal income tax owed at all.",finance

Ideally, I'd like a 7-10 year plan to drastically reduce my debt and to establish a retirement fund (an IRA? ugh, I feel clueless no matter how much I try and cram into my brain). I'm also interested in any tips or advice. 

This is kind've long but it's honestly the first time I've gathered most of this information in one place...

First, some positives:

I asked and recieved a raise going from $45,000 to $50,000 starting July 1st. 

I moved in with my boyfriend and his family changing my rent + utilities from $650 to $250. 

I currently have $5,273.57 in a Savings Acct, and $280.40 in my Checking Acct. 

I have about $1,300 in a 301 (b) thrift plan from my old job through Mutual America. I just haven't touched this for the past few years. 

I recently started Zoloft drastically cutting my ~medical expenses~ from 3-4 therapy visits a month to 1 ($85 instead of $350, total)

Some rough stuff:

Parent Plus student loan through Navient (Graduated/extended plan currently for 20 yrs?): $46,227.23 @ 7.75%

Refinanced student loan through SoFi/Mohela (20 years): $62,806.48 @ 6.54% 

Chase credit card: $3,454.07 @ 19.99% 

Personal loan through my bank (5 years): $4,971 @ 12.24%

I have two medical bills at $120 and $307 due next month that just came in. 

Some other things to note:

I do not drive, so I do not have a car payment or a gas payment. I had high hopes I would be able to learn and make it happen when I originally moved out of the city to my current location, so I took out a 5-year, $5,000 loan and purchased a car. I have since sold this car to my sister with monthly payments with about $1,100 left to be repaid.
 
I went to school for art and design communications, and currently work in a low-key non-profit communications setting. I have time and resources to work on my artwork during the day, so I keep my website up and running for that purpose to side hustle my prints and paintings... if someone ends up buying one. That being said, other low-key things I can do at my desk during the day to earn money are also welcome. 

I've been at my job for 2 years this fall and plan to start job-hunting then. I'd like to take some online classes through my work before I move on to another position. 

I smoke weed pretty regularly, I've found spending the $120 a month on it helps me save money because I don't spend that on going out (bars, shopping) and it inspires me to want to make artwork, read and watch TV - aka things that don't cost much money to do! This is definitely something I can cut down, though... and probably should. 

I have fantastic credit, I have never missed a payment but my debt to income ratio is a problem.

Monthly expenses:

Rent: $250

Navient: $307

SoFi: $485

Loan: $130

CC: $80

Health Insurance: $213

Website: $26

Therapy/medication: $85 

Weed: $120

Food: Probably around $100, I eat out maybe once every two weeks

I haven't been the best when it comes to my own personal finance the last few years as I've struggled to secure a salary, figure out my student loans, a place to live, deal with my own mental health and some unfortunate and unstable living spaces and family situations. 

I feel very lucky to be in such a better position than I have been and I am ready to stop being lazy and start to really figure this money stuff out. 

Get mean with me, whip me into shape, PLEASE. Any advice, tips, etc. are welcome. I really want to establish a solid plan to feel comfortable with my finances and comfortable with my life. I am ready to make a difference and I don't want to be scared anymore.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments already! I appreciate the guidance with paying off my debt, just curious as to what I should be doing about a retirement fund while paying off this debt....

personalfinance,Understanding Vehicle Purchasing and Ownership: A 101-level course,"*This article is written for potential inclusion into the PF wiki. Please provide feedback accordingly*

**Introduction**

Vehicle expenses, in aggregate, are the second-largest source of debt in the United States, to the tune of [1.2 trillion](https://qz.com/913093/car-loans-in-the-us-have-hit-record-levels-and-delinquencies-are-rising-fast-too/) dollars distributed over 110M auto loans outstanding in the US. In many households, automotive costs are the second-highest expense after housing itself. 

It's not a stretch to say that many households have ended up in dire financial straits due to a misunderstanding of the costs of vehicle ownership. As such, this article is broadly broken down into two categories:

- How can I determine what a vehicle will cost me?

and

- How can I determine how much vehicle I can afford?

**Understanding Total Cost of Ownership**

Most people understand that having and raising a child involves substantially more expense than just paying the hospital where you deliver your baby. Unfortunately, many people fail to realize that a vehicle is far more expensive than just writing a check to the dealership where you take possession of your car; much like a child, it will require care, feeding, and other mandatory expenditures. Vehicle TCO includes the following quantifiable financial metrics, each of which will be discussed in turn:

- Capital cost of the car

- Transactional cost of the purchase

- Insurance

- Fuel

- Recurring state-mandated registration / inspection costs

- Maintenance and replacement of consumable items

- Repair of unexpected failure

- Cost of finance

- Opportunity cost

There are also non-financial metrics, which include:

- Option cost

- Non-financial opportunity cost

######Capital cost of the car

This is the cost that gets the most attention. 

If you're paying cash, then the price is the price. If you are financing, then the capital cost will be amortized over multiple years of payments, incurring interest along the way. This will have a knock-on effect on other things (like insurance and opportunity cost). Many of the other costs incurred can correlate to this cost.

There are two very common pitfalls that should be made in analyzing vehicle capital costs. The first pitfall is looking at it from a monthly cash-flow perspective, which is exactly what many car sales places will try to lead you into doing. If you make $36,000 per year pre-tax, somebody telling you ""That'll be $18,000"" will cause you to immediately do the math in your head: ""Why, that's half a year's worth of work! It's 8 months of work once I factor taxes in!""

On the other hand, if the salesman tells you ""It'll only be $320 per month"", you might think: ""Eh, not so bad..."" However, that $320/month will stick around for 7 years - which is just shy of how long the median marriage lasts.

The second pitfall is to say ""Well, it holds its value."" This doesn't matter until you sell it. As long as you possess the asset and are using it for its intended purpose, its value is in providing that intended purpose. The residual value of the asset can only be realized at sales time, which will (presumably) leave you without a vehicle to drive. The residual value of the asset doesn't meaningfully impact how fast you can pay it off if you plan on retaining it, and so, while it should be considered as part of a long-term budget, it should *never* be considered as part of an affordability equation.

For the sake of this article, let's imagine that I'm considering buying a $20,000 car.

######Transactional cost of the purchase 

The transactional costs are all the things necessary to complete the purchase. This would include:

- Sales tax

- Safety/inspection/emissions testing (if applicable)

- Registration

In my state, I'd be charged 6.85% [sales tax](http://dmv.utah.gov/taxes-fees) when I go to register my car. Fortunately, my state has a cap on sales tax charged of $900 (from a calculated $1370), but this is not true across all states. On top of that, I have to pay a [Uniform age-based vehicle fee](http://dmv.utah.gov/taxes-fees/uniform-fees) of between $110 and $150. There's also the weight-based [registration fee](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title41/Chapter1a/41-1a-S1206.html) of about $43, and finally a couple miscellaneous fees totaling about $5.

My $20,000 vehicle has, at this point, incurred an additional $1100 in fees. This may be higher in some states - California, for example, can charge up to 7.5% sales tax, plus allow the county and municipality to charge a couple additional percentage points.

For the sake of keeping the math simple, let's just say my $20,000 vehicle is now at $21,100 in expenditures, including registration fees.

*To Calculate the transactional cost of the purchase, call your state DMV or look on their web site determine what these transactional costs will be*

######Insurance

Most states (New Hampshire exempted) mandate liability insurance. Liability insurance covers damage you cause to others while operating your vehicle. Some states (like California) permit you to post a surety bond to the state in place of carrying insurance. Note that liability insurance does nothing to protect you if you, say, leave your car out in a hail storm, or it gets burnt to the ground during a riot, or if you drive it into a ditch. Liability exists to make the other guy whole in the event you damage his property; that's it.

If you wish to cover contingencies, you'll need comprehensive insurance. This covers acts of god, vandalism, theft, etc. However, it directly correlates to the value of the car and your record as a driver. Terrible drivers with low deductibles (what you pay out of pocket on a comprehensive claim) and expensive cars will be the most expensive to insure; good drivers with high deductibles and cheap cars will be the cheapest to insure.

When you buy a car, comprehensive insurance is usually mandated by the lender if you're financing your car. In addition to this, gap insurance (which covers the difference between the amount owed on the vehicle and its actual value) may be required or desirable. Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all insurance (again, excepting a few states which do no-fault insurance like Michigan, where rates tend to just be universally terrible), but let's assume I'm an average car purchaser with an average cost for my age bracket (30-35, male, no driving offenses). My rates would be just a shade over a [$100/month, or about $1200/year](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance).

Assuming I anticipate keeping the car for 10 years and assuming also that I'm not calculating the NPV of future insurance payments *and* that I just pay the average each year, I'll have paid approximately $12,000 in insurance on my $20,000 car.

Those keeping track of the tab - my $20,000 car has now cost me $33,100 over 10 years.

*To Calculate insurance costs, contact at least 3 insurance providers and query about the cost of insurance on the make and model of car you're interested in. Ensure you get quotes for comprehensive insurance at various deductibles as well as different liability limits*

######Fuel

Fuel prices are variable, but let's assume what we've paid in the *last* 10 years for gas holds true for the next 10 years, and that I wish to drive 10,000 miles/year, or about 100,000 miles over my ownership of the vehicle. That comes out to about [$2.98 per gallon](https://www.statista.com/statistics/204740/retail-price-of-gasoline-in-the-united-states-since-1990/). Assuming Ive got a mid-size sedan that gets [27 MPG](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/37724.shtml), my annual fuel consumption will be about 370 gallons, yielding an annual fuel cost of about $1,100.

Over 10 years, that adds a cool $11,000 to my $20,000 vehicle. My $20,000 vehicle has now run a tab of $44,100 over my 10-year ownership.

*To calculate fuel prices, divide the cost of a gallon of gas by the rated combined MPG and multiple by your annual mileage*

######Recurring State-mandated safety/inspection/registration costs

Registration will likely run me $110 for most years and $150 in the initial couple years, plus my $50 for passenger vehicle and miscellaneous costs. Call it $200/year for the first two years then $150 for the last 8; that'll be $1600 over the life of my ownership.

Again, this will vary widely by state

Up to $45,700 for the example vehicle.

*Contact your state DMV or look on their web page for information about this as it varies widely by state*

######Maintenance and Replacement of Consumables

Stuff wears out. This includes oil, brakes, rotors, air filters, spark plugs, tires, etc.

The costs of this stuff will vary according to the vehicle, but bare minimum expect to spend at least $100 on basic vehicle maintenance (that's a $50 oil change with synthetic oil, $20 air and cabin filter, $20 in windshield wiper blades, that sort of thing). Over 100,000 miles, that's at least one or two sets of tires and another set or two of brakes. That's $1,100 in standard housekeeping stuff, and at least another $1,000 in brakes and tires. Tires run $500+ for a set. Other stuff will add up too - headlight bulbs, brake light bulbs, etc. Some of this you can DIY, but some you can't. I'd call it $240/year, or about $2400 over the lifetime of the vehicle.

Up to $48,100 for the example vehicle.

*To calculate maintenance costs, visit www.tirerack.com or a similar web site to see how much a set of tires will cost; do a Google search for annual maintenance costs for the vehicle otherwise. Most vehicles - even the blandest - have forums where the community will be happy to provide you with some information*

######Repair of unexpected failure

Maintenance and repair should always be broken out into separate costs. Maintenance items are predictable expenses; repairs are not. 

For example, replacing your tires - that's a maintenance item. Most tires will wear out between 30,000 and 50,000 miles depending on workload. On the other hand, a camshaft positioning sensor may last 200,000 miles, or it might fail at 75,000. This is *unpredictable.*

Repair by nature is unpredictable, but most vehicles should anticipate at least one major repair by 100,000 miles. Total maintenance/repair costs are about [$450/year on average](https://repairpal.com/cars/toyota/camry/2007) for a fairly reliable Toyota product, so it's fair to ballpark the repair prices in $200-$300 territory. Let's put it on the lower end of the spectrum, and call it $220/year.

It should be noted this covers items beyond mechanical fault, too. Somebody crack a windshield? That's a $200 hit. Broken headlight? Probably another $200.

In any case, my $20,000 vehicle is now up to $50,300 in total expenditures.

*Google for common problems for your vehicle and anticipated repair costs, or visit community forums for more info*

######Cost of finance

This is how much taking out a loan would cost over the lifetime of the loan. This is usually expressed by APR (which includes origination costs and other odds and ends and is more reflective than the straight interest rate). Interest can be anywhere from 0% or 0.9% for highly-qualified buyers going through dealer financing to 29% for subprime borrowers.

Some examples of the cost of money are below.

At 1.9%, a $20,000 loan will be $254/month and a total cost of $21,375 over a 7-year loan

At 6.9%, a $20,000 loan will be $301/month and a total cost of $25,274 over a 7-year loan

At 9.9%, a $20,000 loan will be $331/month and a total cost of $27,803 over a 7-year-loan

At 15.9%, a $20,000 loan will be $396/month and a total cost of  $33,273 over a 7-year loan

At 19.9%, a $20,000 loan will be $443/month and a total cost of $37,205 over a 7-year loan

Assuming I'm an okay-credit buyer and can get a 6.9% interest rate, the cost of money will be $5,274. We'll round it up slightly to $5300.

Adding that to the existing tab, my $20,000 vehicle is now up to $55,600

*Visit a car loan calculator like [this one](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/auto/auto-loan-calculator.aspx) to understand your total capital cost.* Never *use the monthly payment as the basis for determining affordability.*

######Opportunity Cost

This is tougher to suss out, because it depends on risk tolerance, alternative opportunities, and other such things.

Let's say I'm contemplating keeping my fully depreciated Toyota Camry (value: $2,000) vs. buying a CPO Camry. I assume my maintenance and repair expenses will be the same, and just toss the monthly payment into an index fund earning 7%. After 7 years of tossing money into said index fund rather than into a car payment, I walk away with $32,250 in the bank. So the opportunity cost would be about $12,250 for paying my loan vs. keeping my car and putting money into an index fund.

I can add this to the ""cost"" of my car if I wish to, but it's not money coming out of my pocket - it's money that never went into my pocket because I declined the opportunity to invest.

Opportunity cost depends largely on starting premises. If you're risk averse or have no vehicle, then the opportunity costs may favor buying something newer. When considering purchasing a vehicle, take into account opportunity costs (both financial and non-financial) carefully.

######Option Cost

An option cost, in finance, is the price you pay to exercise an option at some future date. For example, let's say I know I'll have need for 100 gallons of gasoline in a year. I pay a distributor 5 cents per gallon for the option to purchase gas for $2.50 per gallon in June 2018. If the spot price of gasoline is more than $2.55, I can exercise my option and come out ahead, as the 5 cents a gallon I paid for the option plus the $2.50 I paid for the gas itself is less than the current spot price. If the spot price is between $2.50 and $2.55, it's a wash - I'd have been better off not buying the option at all, but may as well exercise it since the option price is sunk. If the spot price is less than $2.50, there's no point in exercising my option.

In life, there are lots of non-fiscal options people deal with. Most have to do with their time and relationships, but it applies here too. *If* I decide to spend $600/month on a vehicle, my options in the future will be drastically more limited. It's a bad idea to get into the practice of asking oneself:

""Can I afford this car?""

Instead, it should be:

""Can I afford this car and &lt;X&gt;?""

Insert future life goals where X currently resides. For example:

""Can I afford this car and &lt;moving into my own apartment with no roommates&gt;?""

""Can I afford this car and &lt;having a child who will be inconvenient to get into and out of a two-door sports coupe&gt;?""

""Can I afford this car and &lt;begin saving for my child's college fund&gt;?""

######Non-financial opportunity cost

This gets into trickier terrain, but there are lots of things old vehicles do that newer ones cannot.

For example, say you need to help your friends move or haul old appliances or deliver pizzas. These are all things that favor older, fully-depreciated cars. Using a new BMW - with high insurance prices and low fuel economy - to deliver pizzas would be ludicrous, whereas it makes great financial sense to use a Tercel with 200,000 on the clock to deliver pizzas.

If purchasing a newer vehicle will take away from earning potential, ensure that the potential loss is accounted for accurately.

**The Upshot**

Occasionally, individuals will post saying something like ""I feel like I'm falling behind my peers. So-and-so has a new condo and I'm still struggling to get by!"" Invariably, the struggling individuals will have a budget riddled with vehicle-related expenses.

Let's look at an example, using the car above. I spend $56,000 over the course of 10 years and end up with an asset worth about $3,000.

My buddy, however, takes the 10-year-old car *his* parents hand him down and just drives the shit out of it. Rather than financing a new car, he takes the $301 and puts it into an index fund. After 7 years, he's got $32,250 in that account in the same month I pay off my $20,000 car.

More than that, he doesn't have to pay comprehensive. So his insurance costs go down by about $400/year. That's another $3,000 or so he can add to the pile at the end of 7 years.

He's handy and figures the two hours a year spent looking at Youtube videos and wrenching are well worth the effort; as such, he can halve his maintenance and repair costs. That's $250/year, or about another $3,000.

Registration will be marginally cheaper because the car's so old - saving about $50/year. Not a huge deal, but over 7 years, it's another $350 or so.

At the end of 7 years, my buddy has $40,000 in the bank. I have a recently-paid off mid-size sedan worth about $3,000-$4,000.

He can put a down payment on a $200,000 house or outright buy a small condo in many markets in the US. 

**Conclusions**

This isn't intended to be a broadside against new vehicle ownership. Instead, it's intended to help prospective vehicle purchasers understand that the biggest cost of ownership isn't the car itself - it's all the tag-along costs, that many young people do not budget for and that can prospectively lead them to regret. Many don't realize that the $301/month car payment is signing up for close to $60,000 in expenditures, but that's more or less what it boils down to.

personalfinance,"27 y/o non-traditional student, working full-time and a major car expense","Hello, PF!

As the title states, I'm a 27 year old, non-traditional student. I just started college this summer and am currently working toward a degree in environmental sciences.

When I started this journey, I knew there would be hiccups in regards to figuring out my work situation, paying for life, and finding ways to blend it all with going to school. Currently, I'm a part time student, and I'm working full time. I know that eventually I'm going to have to leave the place I'm currently working (not much flexibility when it comes to my schedule) and I'm trying to plan ahead as much as possible.

I'm fortunate to be making my hourly rate ($14), but my expenses are driving me up a wall. I was in a car accident last year that totalled my car and had to get a new one. I didn't have any credit at the time, and I didn't want to get a car that was going to fall apart on me, so I purchased a car with a loan, which has a 19% interest rate (it's awful, I know, which is why I'm here!). Because of the accident and where I live my car insurance is $270 a month and my car payment is $250. I pay an additional $50 to my car loan every month, because I want to pay this thing off!

My monthly income is about $1400, and with all of my expenses I have maybe $200 left over to put either into savings or to play with. Now that I'm in school, I'm starting to realize I'm going to need to cut back on my hours sooner than I had initially thought, but finding a job that's flexible enough and that will pay me roughly what I'm making now isn't going to be easy, I would more than likely have to start at the bottom somewhere new and work my way up from there. In addition, I don't want to go to school for 6 years just to get my bachelor's, I would like to get it done in 4.

The thing that's hindering me more than anything else is the car. I may be able to refinance it, but I worry that because of it's mileage (153,000) that no place would be willing to do that. I've contemplated trading it in, but I do like my car and I would rather keep it. My last option I've contemplated is taking out additional student loans to cover the cost, but I've heard mixed things about this and don't want to get screwed in the end.

&gt;• Last year I had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I had no tax liability, and

&gt;• This year I expect a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I expect to have no tax liability.

ethereum,ETH vs BTC as a store of wealth in a global recession?,"Wanted to open some dialogue up as to how people think ETH will be perceived as a store value during a global economic recession?

My background: I’m well educated on macro-economics and there are lots of indicators suggesting the USD will buckle imminently due to massive inflation in global housing, stocks and also U.S bonds. 

Quick summary on why I think a crash is imminent: If you look back at the history of ALL Fiat currency it’s a cyclical pattern of debasing, subsequent inflation and then a flock to precious metals when the fiat currency has perceived lack of value. The USD is no different and in recent years we have seen quantitative easing (vast lump sums of money printed into existence) implemented by the fed reserve. Initially QE was used to bail out the banks in 08, but recently it’s been required to stimulate a highly unstable and dependent banking system and by proxy, economy. This has sped up inflation exponentially to the extent that world trade deals are no longer being backed against the USD and nations are choosing to trade direct. This is very important as it shows 1. the lack of confidence markets have in the USD and 2. Nations see the opportunity of trading behind the U.S’ back greater than the political consequences. The USD is the lynchpin in global finance, virtually all other currencies are backed against it. If the USD goes down, 90% of nations fall with it.

There are many other indicators such as the hoarding of precious metals by nation states, the very recent downturn of the two biggest housing bubbles in the world (Australia and Canada). If you follow financial media, you’ll have read about the recent stake increase by George Soros who’s shorting U.S stocks + Buffets recent cashing up. I could go on &amp; on, the evidence is overwhelming….we’re due an imminent (within the year) global recession/crash.

Whether this will be a quick overnight crash or a drawn out recession is tough to gauge, but once it’s apparent the market will start to back the traditional safe havens (bonds/precious metals). The really worrying thing is that bonds are also grossly inflated right now &amp; once this is realised we’re in for a 100% definitive crash.
 
My initial thoughts on the impact on Crypto:
Crypto was specifically designed off the back on the 08 crisis and the market understand it’s a viable alternate currency system. We’ve already seen a transfer of wealth into crypto from past use cases of struggling economies (Cyprus/Greece). This is a very positive indicator for the health of the crypto during a fiat recession/crash.

I believe that if said recession happens, we will see very large gains in the top 10 coins. I think the vast majority of wealth coming in will be backed by an uneducated crypto market and they will subsequently default to Bitcoin. Rationale - the masses currently perceive it as the safer option as it’s a known media commodity and it has the reputation as digital gold. 

This same new market will perceive ETH as being reliant on world trade/business, and I’d infer the short term gains we make will not be as large as Bitcoin. But… we will make gains. BIG gains and over time, once this new market becomes crypto-educated we’ll see the wealth shift to eth. 

Would love some opinion on this. How do you see the crypto space playing out in the event of a recession/crash? Which coins do you think would thrive? Which coins will struggle? Investment strategies?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Managing money in graduate school,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I’m currently wrapping up my first year of a Biomedical Sciences PhD program and have around 33K of debt from my undergrad degree—all Federal unsubsidized and gaining interest at 6.9%. Although the loans are currently in deferment, I’m currently paying $300-500/month which covers the interest but doesn’t contribute to much towards the principal. As a result, my loan balance has remained static over the course of the past year. I’m lucky to receive a stipend of 33K/year but by the terms of my program, I’m not allowed to pick up any jobs to help supplement my income.

Does anyone have any tips on how I can re-manage my finances while in graduate school for the next 4-5 years? I’m determined not to take out any additional loans during this time.

#Follow Up

Hey guys some of you all may remember my post about 2 months ago from a concerned college student just trying to finish up school and do the right thing for once

Would just like to really thank this community for a lot of the advice and reality check I got in my post and from some really helpful/reassuring PMs, meant a lot, this is a great subreddit for sure

#What I Did

- Kept working pretty hard at my new job and have been putting in a lot of hours lately, got my pay bumped up by like $75 a week 

- Sold my boat :'(  got $500 under asking price ($3000)

- Sold 3 of my more expensive and VERY impractical firearms for $3700

- Got my 'deadbeat' roommate paying $150 a month in rent and he still pays utilities and landscaping 

- Reduced my food expenses to ~$100 a month through /r/EatCheapAnHealthy

- Paid off my debt to my CC's first (interest was killing me) ( $2200)

- Paid off my debt to the university ($5300 after interest and such)

- Sold my Mercedes, well actually traded it and got more than I paid for it in trade value (which was neat) picked up a 2015 Chrysler 300 with an extended warranty as I saw those MB maintenance bills coming and was not excited

#Money Spent During This Time

- Got my mom a VW Jetta as a congrats for finishing rehab and being clean for longer than I can recall her being before, since she didn't have a car. Got one of those 2014(?) diesels they're trying to give away ($129/mo)

- Bought an Xbox since I find myself sitting around all day with nothing to do now that its summer and I'm not working/hanging out with my ex-'coworkers' as much

#Overall

- Got my CC debt to $0.00 and pay off the entire balance as soon as I raise it above $100

- Went up to my bursar, applied, and subsequently received some scholorships through my school to get my tuition expense to $100 less than the maximum amount of federal loan money I can take out :)

Really just wanted to follow up and thank those that reassured me when I was losing my mind with stress that all will be ok and work out in the end, really just plan on working hard and finishing up school and trying to do something I can be proud of, as it turned out I wasn't as bad off as people around me and myself within my own head led me to believe

BUT

Would it be better if I paid my tuition as I go at work? Or would it be better if I took the federal loan money? 4.45% interest but none of it due until 6 months after I graduate

personalfinance,Help getting out from under a Parent PLUS loan (Where do we go from here?),"I'll try to be as thorough as possible while trying to maintain some brevity:

I just found out that my parents took out a Parent PLUS loan for me while I was going to school and they've been ignoring it for a long time. I realize that I'm not under any obligation to pay it myself legally, but it's gotten to the point where they're garnishing wages from my parents and it's causing huge hardship for them. Since I benefitted from it, I want to help dig them out of it.

Here are a few problems and questions I have about this:

1.  The initial loan was somewhere in the range of $20k-$25k. My parents ignored the statements thinking that I was already paying them because I don't think they fully understood that this was a Parent PLUS loan and not just co-signing for a direct loan for me. I know that doesn't matter and that they're still on the hook for it, but with fees and everything the amount of the loan has more than doubled. Even after $13k of garnishment, they still owe $40k on this loan. The interest rate caps out at 9% but, between interest and ""legal fees"", they're not really making their way out of it. Is there any recourse for getting these fees removed or getting the total loan amount back down to where it was before? I'm even willing to take my own loan out to pay it off for them but I can't get approved for more than ~$20k-$25k also.

2.  It has been suggested that they file for bankruptcy and try to get the bankruptcy court to discharge the loan or get a lawyer to negotiate on their behalf. I'm confused about this because several sites have mentioned that bankruptcy courts can assist but I was under the impression that bankruptcy courts can't discharge student loans, even if they're Parent PLUS.

3.  These guys have now started calling *me* every day and it's getting to be really annoying. I don't know how that works because I'm the one that the loan was for but, when they call, they're calling me at 5AM sometimes because my parents live on the east coast and I live on the west coast. I don't know if they think it's my parents' number or what, but it gets really annoying. They won't give me any info because I'm not my parents but they also won't stop calling so I'm not sure how to handle these calls.

What can we do here? I obviously want to help them pay this off or take it over so it's out of their hands but I think it's a little unreasonable for them to be completely overtaken by this loan, especially now that it's more than double the initial loan amount. Is there anything we can do here or are they just screwed and will be paying this forever instead of retiring someday?",finance
personalfinance,Parent Plus loan somehow more cost effective than better interest rate same term refi? Explain,"I have 4 Parent Plus loans totaling just under 50K from 4 years of undergrad after 1 year of payment on a 10 year plan. Each loan is roughly 7%. With 9 years to go and total monthly payment of $465 for all these loans combined.

Somehow my refinance options at a 10 year 5.2% fixed are monthly payments of $568, and the companies all think I'm paying around $581 a month currently. Have I gone insane? How could refinancing at a 9 year to 10 year plan, WITH a lower interest rate raise my payment almost $100 a month?",finance

personalfinance,Question about student loan/Public Service forgiveness,"Hi all.  I'd like to ask some questions about my student loans and see what you think. 

I have the following student loan debt (it's all federal), spread over 6 different loans:

- 1:  Balance $10,886.28, interest 4.41% fixed
- 2: Balance $5,456.22, interest 3.61% fixed
- 3: Balance $7,508.47, interest 3.61% fixed
- 4: Balance $4,433.73, interest 3.15% fixed
- 5: Balance $1,873.10, interest 6.55% fixed
- 6: Balance: $3,390.35, interest 3.15% fixed

Total student loan balance:  $33,577.00

I am in the public service loan forgiveness program.  I have 9 payments in, with 111 to go.
Last year, my monthly payment was $195 but this year it has risen to $315. 

I am in the Revised Pay as you Earn plan.  

I am wondering if I should just continue on this path and allow the remainder to be forgiven at the end, or if I should try to do something more aggressive.  I mean, I don't have a ton of room in my budget to throw to this but I guess I could figure it out (since I figured out how to cover the extra $120 per month).  It also says my payment is calculated based on my AGI, if I were to start contributing to an IRA would that reduce my AGI and therefore possibly reduce my payment?  Is that a smarter use of my money?  (I am already contributing to a 457b deferred compensation plan and I also have a state pension plan requiring a mandatory 3% contribution from every paycheck).

CryptoCurrency,"Digibyte is a scamcoin and a Ponzi meant to trap kids, while the devs and whales cash out.","Ok, disclaimer: I bought into Digibyte early, based on the hype. It was unreal, and too unavoidable. The developers and the official coin twitter account posting about Microsoft/Minecraft, retweeting all the minecraft posts, making it sound as if Microsoft itself were going to use DGB. 

It was set to rise spectacularly. Nothing could stop it. 

Fast forward some months into my ""hodl""ing the coin: 


- I find out that the developers have consistently lied about its plans. Half the items from its roadmap arent even real. The rest half are just FUD. [This is the developer's plans from last year](https://web.archive.org/web/20160820152102/https://invesd.org/interview-5-digibyte/). Not even 1% of that is realized till date. Some of them, on the face of it, are obvious hype tactics and lies.    


- The developers give ZERO DAMN about the outcome of the coin. [They develop embarrassing and incomplete websites](http://digusign.com/healthcare) (Scroll down to the quotes section). Despite over a dozen people asking them to get their act together, they have not bothered to even respond nor change this ridiculous website design for months now. Which investor would even look into a company which can't be bothered to fix the grammar on their website?     
The DiguSign product looks like its built by a 12 year old on MS Paint. Compared to market leaders in the e-sign space, this one absolutely blows donkeys! There are bugs and spelling mistakes everywhere in the product, yet the developer goes on record to inform the coin's ""believers"" that they expect several million dollars in revenue from DiguSign. What a joke! 

  

- DigiByte Gaming website was nothing but a cheap scam. People spent money on the site, didnt get their games. The developers  then gave the [excuse that they were DDOSd](https://twitter.com/DigiByteGaming/status/867525740777963520). People are still complaining about not getting their games for weeks. Has anyone ever heard of a website staying DDOSd for about 15 days now? Who the hell would DDOS a website that no one has even heard off? I can understand if a large exchange like Poloniex is DDOSed, but how many people even know about DigiByte Gaming website to DDos it? Another shameful damn lie. 
    


- The developers even got its users to participate in a [meme contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/comments/6dgrdn/announcement_meme_contest_for_digibyte_is_on_real/?ref=search_posts) Which of course, turned into a SCAM. The winner was supposed to be announced already, yet no one has been. People who worked for hours on these memes were [never paid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/comments/6gfajr/meme_contest_winner/). What is even worse is that these memes created for the contest were shared all over twitter by a thousand different bots, without any license or royalty of any kind. What a great way to build hype for a shitcoin, get users to do memes in the name of a fake competition, share the bloody hell out of these memes, and finally scam the winners. Hats off to these ""developers"".  
  


- There is constant FUD being posted everywhere by bots or trolls; Even after the tanking in the past 24 hours, the coin's twitter handle is posting more FUD about Playstation games on DigiByte. Immediately after the Citi debacle, it shared a ""Hold to Moon "" meme. Absolutely unbelievable. The [official twitter handle of Digibyte](https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin) is completely off the hook, retweeting every single ""HODL $DGB and MOON"" meme. 
For a comparison, the [official Ethereum handle](https://twitter.com/ethereumproject) has posted merely a dozen times since April, while this shitcoin's handle has retweets a dozen hype/fud spreading ""Lambo and Moon"" posts every single day.
  
  

Now, about how these scammers developers and those associated with this shitcoin make money:  
  

- By putting out games for cheap on the Digibyte gaming platform, they target kids who are into gaming and who are not really well versed with the realities and risks of alt coins. When kids actually buy into DGB, they get bombarded with memes and news stories about how DGB is the second coming of bitcoin. The developers strategy seems to be to build momentum, and get the kids to buy more DGB so that they can become millionaires in a year's time. *""Buy now or forget your Lambo"".*  
  
Kids who have invested into the coin, get lessons on how to HODL. All the kids who tried out DigiByte gaming by simply following the hype train were force fed fake expectations that they were going to get rich while HODLing the coin. 
  




- 9/10 posts on r/DigiByte are cringeworthy shitposts about Memes and lambos. Everyone over there thinks they are getting rich holding on to these  worthless coins. These shitposts are never ever removed, infact the mods over there arent even active. Wonder why? Because they are all part of the scam to get the average kid to HODL the coin, while they build fake hype around the coin, pump its value by a series of fake and misrepresenting tweets/news and then dump out at the top, and when dumping out they still get the kiddies to HODL. *""Dump now and forget about your lambos. Stay strong and we moon by December"".*        
Once the developers/mods have dumped and made their profits, they buy in again at a low price, build fake hype again, get the price up and then dump again. Rinse and repeat, and all the while the kiddie investor thinks they will make millionaires.





- After the CitiBank fiasco, the developer has already on record saying ""We made a lot of connections with Microsoft employees, with government officials. Meetings are schedules. Blah Blah Blah!!!  ""  

Spreading pure speculation, and pouring fuel over the hype train that is already in flames. There is more fake news from the DGB camp that the winners were *not* disclosed yesterday, they were just some participatory awards and the real winners will be announced next month. More lies. The engines for the next hype/pump train have already been set in motion.  


  

I think I am missing a few more obvious scam tactics adopted by this scamcoin. I dont know, there are just too many of them to remember and jot down. I hope they can be taken to task or even courts. At the very least, people who think of buying into this scam need to know about these tactics before putting a penny into this worthless coin. 

Thanks !",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Its a bubble for sure. But here are a few reasons as to why it wont pop.,"1. For every dollar put into BitCoin It will be shown on the whole and on average you end up getting back more than one dollar in value over time in excess of the true rate of inflation.

2. Bitcoin will continue to increase in value until it takes it place on the bottom of Exter's liquidity Pyramid. As sure as a rock is denser than water.

3. Bitcoin is more money like than any other money ever conceived.

4. Bitcoin will prove to be the ultimate hedge in the next economic crisis.

5. People who don't hold Bitcoin Will end up being employees for those that do. (He who holds the Digital Gold Makes the Rules.)

6. Bank Bail-ins destroy depositors wealth by forcing them to become share holders of a worthless asset.

7. Bank Bailouts don’t punish the bad actors, and destroy the wealth of the bag holding public.

8. The Central Banks are colluding to monetize their debts inflating away any hope of real savings.

9. Money is nothing more than a way to keep a record of who owes who. (Intrinsic value is unnecessary and irrelevant, The shared ledger is where the value comes from and is stored.)

10. You can only do 3 things with money Save it, spend it, or invest it. Since you can no longer save in fiat currencies, it is no longer money.

11. There is no way to save money in our current environment. Teaching your kids to put money in a savings account is idiotic.

12. Negative interest rates destroy the incentive to save.

13. Metcalfe's law and the network effect. (The Value Of a network is equal to the square of its nodes) and The network is growing exponentially.

14. In security Authentication is performed by something you have (A Token) something you Know (a Password) or something you are (A Finger Print) Bitcoin Transforms Money from a physical item to information. This is a really big fucking deal!

15. An item that is directly transferable does not need to be exchanged back thru the original exchange, This allows participants to directly negotiate and trade paper wins with out a haircut.

16. Exchange Traded Volume tells you nothing. Being more liquid than any other asset as the volume decreases in Bitcoin Terms it will continue to decrease as it is stuck in some kind of permanent backwardation relative to fiat (Bitcoin today is worth more than bitcoin tomorrow but its predicated on a skyrocketing base). The bid for fiat is being withdrawn at the rate that knowledge of what is actually happening spreads.

17. Bitcoin is Directly negotiable so it will trade outside of the exchanges as a proxy based on its spot price. This feed back loop will prove that the more valuable it becomes the more valuable it will become.

18. The Keys are pushed to the end points so as central key stores are hacked it will become more secure and more valuable. 

19. The price of Bitcoin Rising relative to other fiat currencies only validates its utility, it does not make it tempting to sell.

20. Currency Controls prevent the free flow of capital, devaluing the currency they are held in.

21. The paper derivative price of Gold has nothing to do with Physical Gold. Naked shorting allows the price to be contained for the foreseeable future.

22. Gold only Accounts for all of the miss allocation of capital every few hundred years, and only does so if everybody calls bullshit at the same time.

23. Gold bugs are correct in their positioning, but without the critical mass for the run on the bullion banks they will continue to be wrong about the timing.

24. Bitcoin is easily held directly so it holds the system to account in real time, this simple fact alone does make it better than gold.

25. The idea of a 3rd party holding Bitcoin on deposit in your name for any period of time is an oxy moron. (Show me the money….. send it)

26. When an exchange appears insolvent the price in fiat terms rises as the participants exit out the Back door VIA Bitcoin. (This is absurd, no other asset can even do this.)

27. Fractional Reserve is not possible long term in Bitcoin.

28. Only an Idiot would try to short Bitcoin. A bigger idiot will do it with leverage.

29. Bitcoin is 1000 times more rare than Gold.

30. Bitcoin is like a Swiss bank account for the every day common man.

31. The Inflation rate of Bitcoin is already less than any other currency on the planet and will continue to fall.

32. Bitcoin Mining forces sunk costs and risk to participate. No one Gets a Free Lunch and this creates a hard floor to the price in fiat terms, while increasing stability at the same time.

33. The predictable supply of Bitcoin will create stability over time.

34. The limited Quantity allows you to predict that it will be worth more over time.

35. Bitcoin Allows you to liquidate your assets in one country and take them with you to another.

36. The demand for real money will always outstrip the supply. What Appears to be a bubble will show itself as pure demand. 

37. The earlier you Get into Bitcoin The better off you will be.

38. Fools who get into Bitcoin as a speculation for more dollars will end up with as many dollars as needed and no motivation to exchange for more.

39. As Bitcoin Increases in value you can optionally pay your Tax Debts by converting a small amount and handing the worthless inflating promise back.

40. """".

41. The day where a critical mass demands to be paid in Bitcoin is coming. This will reverse Grisham's Law.

42. Bitcoin as the benchmark will provide much needed competition to fiat currencies.

43. Bitcoin long term will also incentivize capital investment into productive assets. People will only be willing to risk their savings or aquire debt for more production.

44. One Bitcoin is actually a insurance policy in this day and age you cannot afford not to have.

45. As a metaphor for evolution. Gold is like a Grizzly bear. The dollar is a 800lb gorilla. Bitcoin is a Tyrannosaurus Rex made of steel, that by the way is also invisible breeds like a virus, has a IQ 256 and is fully equipped with a grenade launcher.  If you introduce it to the environment what exactly do you think is going to happen. Makes it pretty obvious as to why the creator is hiding…… although any idiot with time can figure out who he is.

46. Bitcoin makes offshore accounts obsolete. (jaimewarlock)

47. Bitcoin makes it much harder to find and collect taxes on labor. (jaimewarlock)

48. Bitcoin allows a person to easily flee oppressive political systems with their assets. (jaimewarlock)

personalfinance,Make a dent in student loans or have an emergency fund?,"So I am about to graduate with my Masters in Teaching and am currently looking for a job, I currently have another job that is minimum wage and if I don't get a full time teaching position then I will apply for being a substitute. I am not worried about finding a job, there is a huge shortage of teachers and substitutes right now so that is not my problem. I took out loans with Navient and currently have 4 loans that total $27,434.49. One of the loans is a subsidized loan with an interest rate of 3.860% and I will begin accruing next week. The other loan is an unsubsidized loan for $23,896.83, has an interest of 5.840% and is currently accruing interest. 

My question is that I over estimated the amount of money I needed for my last loan and have placed it in my savings account, this is about $1,252.65 and is the only thing in my savings account. Should I use all of that to make a dent in my loan and save on interest or should I sit on it and keep making monthly payments on my loans? Would it earn me more credit if I use that savings to help pay off the monthly loans or just paying it off in bulk? 

I will add that I live with my significant other and a roommate, both of which have sizable savings accounts in the thousands of dollars, are aware of my financial situation, and are willing to help out if any emergency funding is necessary.

I recently got admitted into a top-tier PT MBA program. The total program cost over 3 years is ~120K. Currently, I have about 50K savings, across vanguard, fidelity, some cash and stocks etc. 

Now, over the next 3 years, I know I will PROBABLY earn enough to pay for the rest 70k, but I really don't want to pay all cash and consider a mix of cash and loans. I was looking at student loan options from the preferred lenders and fixed rates range from 5% to 10% and variable rates range from 3% to 10%. My credit score is ~800, and I will NOT be using a co-signer, so my assumption is I should be able to get loans in the ~5% range? Would that be a good assumption? If I consider keeping some money in vanguard and hope for a 7% ROI, I'd still be better off, and even if I dont make that much, I'd still not be spending all that at once.

Second, I am considering using 75% of my savings, so that I still have efund left, during the first year, and then take loans as I need along the following years. Has anyone does this?

personalfinance,Advice on how to get rid of two car loans?,"So my husband and I have two car loans. They're costing us around $890 a month (car payment + full coverage insurance). This is way too much for us to handle due to certain situations occurring.

We tried applying for an unsecured loan, one at my credit union and one at a bank. They denied us because I have too much debt and my credit score is 644. His credit score is 744 but he's an immigrant and has only been in the states for almost a year. 

The reason we want to go the personal loan route is because we want to pay off the auto loan, sell the car, and buy cheap, reliable vehicles and pay off majority of the personal loan that way while having cheap insurance. Then we can continue making monthly payments.  Are there any other routes we can go down to get rid of the car(s)? We don't think we can sell them for the full price because of all the mileage, and the interest rate hurting us after all this time of minimum payments.

Also will using websites like credit karma to find us pre-qualified personal loan options help? Or are those just basically scams or a really bad idea? 

One car I owe $8,000 on , but it's only worth like $2,000 according to KBB. The other car (husbands) we owe $12,000 but it's only worth $8,000 or something. :(

Also, I have zero debt except for a credit card that I pay off monthly. Monthly expenses are around $1100 (rent, phone, insurance, internet, etc...) My roommate is getting ready to move away and is wanting to sell the home he currently owns. 

He's been adamantly trying to sell me the home and up until now I have had some misgivings because I don't like mixing business with friendships. Right now he is trying to convince me to purchase the home for $140,000, and he originally purchased it about 2 years ago for $132,000. He's even gone as far as suggesting to sell it for $150,000 to me and then giving me $10,000 on the back end after closing, that way when I move to sell someone would be motivated to pay more then $150,000 for the home. I explained to him that I would still owe $150,000 and therefore he really isn't ""giving me"" anything, plus there is no guarantee in increased equity. Also, I don't know what the tax implications of that transaction would be. 

Overall, he has had to replace an AC unit and some other minor repairs on the home and his primary motivation is not wanting to lose money on the house, plus he just caught orders to another state so he wants to sell it quickly in order to finance a home in his new town. However, I also don't want to assume the cost of a home that a) I wasn't necessarily planning on buying and b)that isn't worth as much as I'm buying it for.

So right now my answer is no to purchasing the home, however I just found out I could assume a mortgage. He is Active Duty military with a VA loan and I am active duty as well, so I don't think the lender would have an issue plus his current interest rate is 2.99% whereas the current rate I would qualify for is somewhere around 3.7%-3.8%. Ultimately, I'm kind of open to the idea based on the possible savings, but I just don't want to get burned/lose a really good friend.

So after that longwinded explanation, does this sound like a good financial decision or should I just say no thanks and move on?

personalfinance,How to increase income,"Hi PF,

I've really got myself in a bind lately, just not making enough money to pay the bills and get by. 

Really there are only two options I have: cut expenses or increase income. We already live pretty frugally, and realistically I don't see why I should never be allowed to eat out, but a new car, or have nice things. I work hard for my money. I did everything I was supposed to, I worked hard, I got a degree, I did internships, I gained experience in real jobs, I negotiated salary, worked for extra income on the side, I steadily increased income throughout my career, I've done it all. 

Stuff just costs a lot. My family goes through $3000/mo very quickly. That's extremely reasonable for my area Imo. It covers housing, groceries, insurance, gas, utilities, and that's about it. We barely do anything fun ever. I'm always struggling to deal with little emergencies that pop up, I'm not saving enough for retirement, and it stresses me right out. 3k/mo take home is about a 52k gross salary around here. Assuming you'll want to make more than the bare minimum to live my life, you'll want to make more like 70k+ gross, but the majority of people just aren't making mad cash like that. It's really hard to earn that much through traditional methods. I'm fed up with it.

Am I going in here with too high of expectations or should it be around what I'm seeing on the offer? My credit score is around 680, I know 7% is decently high but I'm okay with it. Navy Fed put me at 13. Just want to make sure I don't waste my time.",finance

My expenses are low: no car payment, I live with my parents, and I have a decent paying job. I originally wanted to get an emergency fund of $25k, which I'm just reaching now. 

So with all that background out of the way, should I continue paying the minimum on my loans since the interest is pretty low, and instead continue saving money (not for anything in particular...just to have); or should I start doubling down on the loan repayments, with the intention of paying them off in 3 years instead of 7?",finance

I want to make sure I have appropriate expectations as to what I can afford.,"A little over 5 years ago I bought my first house, the one I'm living in now, with my then-fiancée (now-wife). Since then we've had a kid and our income has grown a ton, and we want to move into a larger place for our family. I'm trying to make some estimations now to see what kind of house we can afford in the area we want. There's also been a bunch of changes in my finances in the past 5 years that I have some questions about.

My current salary is $133k/yr, which works out to about $2830 take home biweekly. My wife is hourly, but gets takes home $1900 biweekly.

Additionally, I have stock in my company. I currently have about $130k in vested stock. As the stock vests, about half of it gets automatically sold to cover the taxes, so my understanding is that when I cash it out the taxes on it should be minimal (just on the growth since it vested I think?). Is my understanding of that correct? In one year from now I will have a bunch more stock vested. Assuming absolutely no change in price I'll have about $190k. (given the trends though, I expect it will most likely continue to rise, but I know this is not guaranteed). 

Also, when my grandmother died last year it turned out she had literally a million dollars stashed away. She grew up in the great depression and saved like crazy. Anyway, I got a tenth of that in cash. When a banker at my bank saw my account he suggested investing it in mutual funds, which seemed like a good deal. I invested a total of $120k in mutual funds about 2 months ago and I'm up about a thousand dollars so far. If I'm understanding the brokerage website correctly, the value of the funds themselves has gone up which accounts for about $500 of the growth, and I also got a $500 dividend. The money that I get out of this is being automatically reinvested in more mutual funds. In dividends alone, I expect to make 6k in a year. I'm not sure if the level of growth I saw in the first month is typical or not.

My current house I bought 5 years ago and I took out a loan of $380k at 3.375%. Today I still owe about $340k on it. Zillow estimates my house is worth about $690k today. I don't know how much stock to put into Zillow's estimate, but I do have a neighbor selling their house and they're asking for $725, so I feel like it's probably pretty close. If that estimate is accurate, if I sold the house I'd and paid off the loan with the money, I'd have $310k leftover, minus taxes on that amount. (which is a good question - what *are* the taxes on that?)

Finally, I have about 60k in cash. Of that 24k is my emergency fund that I don't touch which covers 6 months of expenses in case of a worst case scenario like we both lose our jobs or something. So effectively, I have 36k of money to spend. And that's today - I don't have any expensive hobbies or anything and tend to save a lot so this will probably be a lot more in a years time. At my current rate of saving, in a year I'll have about $90k to spend. Actually probably a less since I need to open a 529 college account for my kid and she's going to start going to day care at some point.

(And for what it's worth, besides my house and my wifes car, I have no outstanding debts.)

Is the rule for how much you should spend on mortgage still a third of your paycheck? That means I can afford about $3,300/month. And really rough estimates, if I add up the numbers above, it looks something like this:

| Source | Money |
| ------ | ----- |
| Stocks | $190k |
| Mutual Funds | $126k |
| House | $690k |
| Mortgate | $-340k |
| Cash | $90k |
| **Total** | $756k |

I don't know what interest rates are now... Assuming I got the exact same interst rate as before (bad assumption I'm sure), I think I could get a loan for a half million and pay $2200, plus taxes and insurance and stuff would bring my monthly payment to about 3400. Does that sound right? A half million, plus that 750k means I could spend about 1.25 million on a house. Does that sound at least in the ball park? Are there things I'm missing?",finance
personalfinance,Can I deduct the interest I pay on unsubsidized direct federal loans from my taxes?,"I had saved up nearly enough money and used grants and subsidized loans to pay for the majority of college, but now can't cover the last couple semesters. I've heard you can deduct the interest you pay on loans from taxes, but I'm not sure if all loans are that way.",finance
personalfinance,Semi-recent graduate looking for general debt/refinancing advice,"Hello, so quick run through of background info. I graduated from UConn with an Actuarial Science degree in December 2015. Due to a lack of internship experience, and impending student load payments, I pretty much accepted the first job I was offered (August 2016). 55K salary, had to move to NH. Associate financial analyst position. Basically accounting/budgeting stuff. Mechanically not much of a challenge for my degree, but definitely had/have a lot to learn about corporate environment and accounting and what not.


Edit: Guess I could add I passed 2 actuarial exams while in college.


Anyways, on to the debt. I graduated with about 70K in student loans. 40K federal (interest ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%. 4.62 average), and the rest personal cosigned by a relative averaging 8.24%. My federal ones are in ""graduated repayment"" (ie less now, increased every 2 years) since I set them up prior to getting offered the job. Personal are level. Once I got the job up here, and sign on bonus, I purchased a car. Loan is another 15K at 6%. 


So, down to the month by month. After deductions and 401K up to maximum matching are deducted I take home $791/week. So averages $3,400 per month. 


Expenses:


*$65 Cable


*$66 Cellphone


*$60 gym (Rock Climbing)


*$35 electric


*~$200 Food


*$263 Personal student loans


*$285 Federal student loans


*$271 Car payments


*$1140 Rent


*$150-$175 Misc (gas, rent insurance, pet stuff, ect)


Average monthly expenses: $2900


Average saved $500


Banked: $11K


So, most of these financial decisions were made over a year ago. Looking at them now and how things have panned out, I see the clear issues (especially after lurking around here for a few weeks). My rent is way more than I should be paying to live alone. Unfortunately I had to move to a new state on short notice, and gave up on finding a roomate after a few months, since I was able to pay the bills. Wish I kept looking for one. Then there's the car. After junker to junker I just wanted something that would be a long long long term car. So went for something new that wouldn't leave me negative in monthly payments. In hindsight, I should probably have gone for a 10K rather than 18K vehicle. (Although if my rent were halved, I'd be okay maybe). 


That's the gist of it though. My current job had a clause where if I left in the 1st year, I had to return my bonus (5K). So now that I'm approaching my 1 year, I've begun applying for positions back in CT. Problem is, I'm not going to find something before I have to resign my lease. Which means when I do find something, I'll likely have to take a hit to break the contract. Plus side is I will be able to live back with parents for 3-400, rather than $1,140. The other problem is that I can't really go roomate hunting when I could end up leaving at pretty much any time... don't want to screw someone over. I think I'm kind of just stuck with the high rent until I find a new job. So overall, I think I got slightly greedy, but not so bad that I can't make payments. Just enough that paying back debt is a lot slower than it needs to be. Not too worried about getting through it in the long run, but I'd appreciate any advice in the matter. The most obvious line I see is that I now have a year of credit history, it's time to see if I can get these interest rates dropped. They are pretty huge compared to most of what I see talked about on here. I'm just not sure the best way to go about it. Or how to in general. The personal student loans and the car loan are the biggies, but the federal I might have to leave as are due to the graduated payment plan. I use that if I consolidate. I don't know if I can get lower interest rate without making them non-federal anymore? Any advice would be appreciated, going to stop this wall of text now though!",finance

personalfinance,I need financial advice from PF after being in CC debt.,"Hey PF. Long time lurker here. I love you guys so much. You guys give out amazing advice. You guys helped me out on paying my debt. I never posted here before but I read almost every post about credit card debt and what should people do. So I've been bad financially bad obviously . I racked up $6500 of credit card debt. In a span of two years, I was in debt for 3000 and doubled that pretty much. I had a job that paid 22k yearly. Decided to leave that job and got hired as a customer service representative at the airport so I now make 50k yearly. Three months ago, I decided that I want to buy a car so I saved up money about 2k. I realized I had 6k in debt so I decided to pay that first before I buy a car because it would be strange for me to be in debt in cc and then be in loan debt so I didn't want that. I paid my credit cards in a about 15 weeks by working 60 hours of week and luckily I get a lot of over time so that helped me a lot. Paid the credit card that had high interest rates and it went well. I was also monitoring Credit Karma and I went from 580 to 700 but I don't really believe in Credit Karma as much because the scores seem too good to be true. Also, I have one account in collections of 72 dollars and I'm trying to figure out how to mark it as paid. Seems complicated but I want to take action. I also have one late missed payment and that's it.   

Okay so now, I want to buy a car. A new car like a 2016. I have a good amount saved up for a down payment of 3200 dollars. However, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Not sure if I'll get a good deal on interest rate due to my credit history. What do you guys think? Should I just avoid buying a new car? Also, I do have a car with 230k miles but it still runs strong. I was thinking of keep on driving it until it dies out.

I just opened a line of credit with an electronics store. I only accepted this route because my Credit Score is abysmal, and this was an option i had applied for over a year ago and i just came in to knowledge that i had been approved. I was approved for $2175 at a 15% interest rate, And i have $619 locked down now on a new tablet.(bought it because i needed something to build my credit, and i can use it for a college course ill be taking in august, and for personal use.)  

When i was speaking with the rep, she told me that she recommended paying it off in 3 months since for every month over 3 the total amount paid for it would skyrocket. All the way up to over $1200 if i went the full 12 months. However, i would like to build my credit as much as possible. I was also told that paying almost anything off prior to a 6 month period would do harm to your credit.(she said in this case she has had peoples score raise by as much as 40 points. I'm skeptical.).  

I was sure to only use 30%&gt; of my allocated amount, and i will have absolutely no problem paying it off at any point with my current job, not including savings.  

So, should i hold on for 6-8 months or just go ahead and pay it off as soon as 3 months and start a new line? Also how much could i reasonably expect my credit score to rise?

Credit Score: Currently 523  
Finance amount:$2175

personalfinance,Best of options to pay credit debt,"Its 8k of debt on one of those 0% for 15 months deals.

Option 1: transfer it to another one of those zero interest for 12-15 month cards, which i believe usually has a 3% fee or so. 

Option 2: get a loan from lending tree or a similar company. I got an estimate from them and the interest rate is 7.5-10% which seems pretty bad? Even my student loans are lower at 6%. 

Option 3: borrow from 403b. My employer allows me to borrow up to 45% once I am vested in November. So should have about 9k of funds i can access. This seems like the least costly, but then I would miss out on whatever interest that makes.... i also considered doing it for the rest of my student loan.

We already have 6 months of expenses in our savings account for emergencies so when we get above that threshold, we basically take every dollar and say ""20 cents goes to home improvements, 10 cents goes to fun, 40 cents goes to investments, and 30 cents goes to paying down mortgages.""

We have two properties with mortgages.
-Primary residence, 2.5 years into a 30 year mortgage so very early in the amortization schedule. 4.125% fixed rate
-Rental condo, my old bachelor pad that was too underwater when i got  married to offload.  12.5 years into a 30 year mortgage.  This one is an ARM that adjusts every year and is currently at 3.75%

We were going to put ~$10,000 towards paying down the principal of one of the two and were debating which one to prioritize.  Because they both recast (i think) would it make more sense to pay down the higher interest rate, earlier-in-life loan because we'll save more interest in the long run?  

On the other side there is the assurance that we would get of reducing our risk exposure on the ARM in the future if rates start climbing...

personalfinance,50K to Invest and/or Pay Down Debt. What should I do?,"TL;DR  My wife and I have extra cash and want your help in spending it.  Does it make more sense to invest or pay down our student loan debt?

My wife and I have a crippling amount of student loan debt between the two of us (~$320K), but we also make a good amount of money annually (~$300K gross) and have a nice amount of cash in various checkings and savings accounts (~$100K).  We are both 32 years old and are maxing out our 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions.  We are also obligated to pay $15K/year for the next four years into an investment vehicle called a traunch(?) which our financial advisor set us up with.  

I really want to invest our extra cash of $50K in rental properties because I feel getting a positive return/cap rate of between 7 and 10% is a better use of our money than paying off our expensive student loan debt with an interest rate of 6.5% (~$240K is at 6.5%).  My wife feels paying off her medical school debt is a better use of our money, but isn't pushing hard for that option because a lot of our cash came from real estate endeavors of mine prior to her and I getting together and I'm pretty dead set on investing it.  The real estate and stock markets are crazy right now and I feel both stocks and property are overbought and not as valuable as prices reflect.  
 
As far as I'm concerned, our three options are to invest in one or two rental properties with good returns, pay off the expensive student loan debt, and/or hold onto the cash until the stock and/or real estate markets eventually take a dump.

I've read the how to handle money wiki and see paying down debt takes a higher priority than even retirement investing so maybe we should reconsider our current allocation of resources.  Is there a break-even point that would make investing a better option than debt reduction in our case?

I apologize if this post is a bit scattered, but I want to explain my situation.

Tuition for the entire duration of the program is approx. $55K
I estimated $1100/month for rent and cost of living.  So total expenses are $94K.  

I currently have ~$9,000 in savings and a generous relative who is helping me out.  They said they would help me out each semester with roughly half of tuition.  So every 3-5 months they would write me a check for  $2k-$5K (some semesters are less than others).  

To my knowledge, it appears that every grad student receives the same fasfa award of the Federal Direct GR Unsub Loan of $10,250 each semester.  I was awarded $10,250 for both the Fall 2017 and Sprint 2018, totaling in $20,500.  

*The actual questions*

It looks like I'll be able to get through the first semester without taking out any loans (hooray!), but I'll need the loans for the Spring 2018 and Summer 2018 terms.  However, there is no award available for the Summer 2018 term and I don't want to take out a loan which immediately starts accruing interest when I'm good for that first semester.  I'll eventually need the $20,500 when the Spring 2018 starts, so I'm wondering if the $10,250 loan from Fall 2017 could ""roll over"" and I'll be able to accept it in the summer 2018 term?

How are fed subsidized loans dispersed?  Do I never see any of it and it goes directly to the school or would I receive a check?

How should I be spreading the money out?  Should I use the loan or relative's money for tuition or rent etc?  Is there a strategy to use here?

Where can I find the terms of the loan?  Things like how much of the payment goes to principle/interest, is it forgivable, how much of my income will go to future payments? I've also been trying to find the deadline of when I have to decide to accept or reject the award.

personalfinance,Can my parent give me a lump sum for my student loans without triggering a gift tax if he is my consigner?,"I graduated after many years of graduate school and I'm now working in the health field. Based on a agreement my parents and I made before starting undergrad, they would pay half my school costs, which now amounts to half my student loans. 

Instead of paying me month by month until half the loan is gone, my dad is considering getting a home equity loan and giving me a lump sum for his half (lower interest rates on the home equity loan than student Lon refinancing)

But we were wondering, would this lump sum trigger a gift tax, even if he is my consigner?  We have read that he might not be liable for gift tax, since is the consigner of my student loans. 

TL;DR: are consigners on student loans responsible for a gift tax if they make a lump sum payment (over the $28000 married gift tax threshold)?",finance
personalfinance,Managing high student loans after graduate school,"Hello, 
So this might end up being a lengthy post but I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am a current pharmacy student (2nd year). I was orphaned as a kid and put into the foster care system when I was 7 until I aged out at 16 years old. Throughout foster care, I learned nothing about managing finances including taking out loans, debt, interest, and planning for the future.

 When I aged out at 16 years old, I rented out my own apartment with a monthly state stipend of $500. I supplemented the rest of my income by working as a waiter and doing odd jobs. Eventually I saved enough to enroll in school. I was a bit of a fool and took out the maximum loans I could so that I could buy a car instead of walking to work, and the rest went to school and help with paying rent and the typical expenses. Throughout my undergrad I continued to work as much as I could but it was impacting my grades. Eventually I realized what I was doing wasn’t working out for me and so I cut down my classes while maintaining work. I started getting good grades and was motivated to plan for my future. Prior to my turn around, I was considering dropping out of school because things were just too difficult to balance.

 I eventually got in a great habit of doing well I decided to take the PCAT to apply to pharmacy school. I did great on the PCAT and was accepted to the schools I applied. I did well my first year and am about to start my second year. However, as I look into what life will be life after I graduate, I will graduate with about $260,000 in debt (private school and cost of attendance). I am working 20-30 hours a week during school to try to lower my debt. From the loan calculator it will look like I will pay $3200 a month for student loans, and lose about another $3200ish to taxes every month. This will leave me around $2500 a month. I know this may seem like a lot, but I invested a lot of time and money into getting this degree. I do not qualify for PAYE (pay as you earn) since I took out my first federal loan before 2007. I do qualify for the REPAYE however it will still be a relatively high monthly payment, with forgiveness after 25 years, and I still will have a HUGE balance forgiven that will be considered taxable income (possibly owe 80K in taxes). 

I am honestly considering dropping out and doing something with my Biology degree. I could save up for the future now instead of making essentially less in the future. What advice would you give? It is honestly depressing to think about so I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!",finance
Bitcoin,Sitting on few hundred BTC. Wut do,"I have a few hundred bitcoin from mining back when it was possible with a CPU and GPU. I never told anyone in my life that I really knew anything about bitcoin. The most I'd usually say is ""bitcoin is cool you should check it out."" Never said much back in the day because BTC was so new no one I knew would care. Now I don't say anything because  I feel like i could be a target of attack/theft/distant ""friends"" looking for handouts. Plus, my family doesn't know. So, to come out with ""I'm a millionaire"" over a random dinner may not go over well.

I mined, HODLed, moved them around between online BTC casinos, trading alts, experimenting with different wallets, etc. Now they just sit in a hardware wallet far removed any proof that blockchain analysis could show I really did mine them.

I have no e-mails, no old wallets, etc... nothing to prove this.

With the prices they are now, it's really bothering me that I am sitting a lot of money and afraid to use it. Wut do? I want to cash out 50% and HODL the rest. I will pay my taxes but what if I am investigated for laundering, being a drug kingpin, or whatever? I've done nothing wrong but I can't prove otherwise. At worst, the gov't will take my money.

Or, am I overthinking this?

Edit: Biggest thing I worry about is civil forfeiture. Basically the state/fed gov't just takes your money because they ""suspect"" that it's the proceeds of crime. Then, you can't get it back unless you prove it's not. Basically the state robbing you. I committed no crime but as I stated before, there isn't much to prove I didn't. So, if I had my money taken, it's gone. I want to keep some in crypto, but I don't want all my eggs in one basket. Would be nice to diversify and live off the interest.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Made $90K on cryptocurrencies - how should I diversify? 26 y/o urban male.,"My net worth has changed considerably in the past couple of years since graduating from college, and especially in the past few months thanks heavily to small investments I made in cryptocurrencies that have netted me 10s of thousands in unrealized gains:

**Net Worth Change Over Time:**

* 2014 = -$45K (student loans)
* Q1 2017 = $85K
* Q2 2017 = $170K

I am looking for any / all advice to re-balance and diversify my portfolio:

* 401(k) = $6.8K
* Roth IRA 1 (BRK.B) = $0.5K
* Roth IRA 2 (Betterment) = $26.0K
* Traditional IRA (Betterment) = $15.2K
* Investment in Small Startup = $1K
* HSA (Credit Union, 1% interest no fees) = $0.4K
* Betterment Investment Account = $0.9K
* Wealthfront Investment Account = $7.2K
* Wealthfront College 529 = $1.1K
* Robinhood Stock Picks = $5.7K
* **Bitcoin = $18.9K**
* **Ethereum = $65.1K**
* **Other Cryptocurrencies = $1.4K**
* Bank Accounts (~1% interest) = $14K
* Total Assets = $170K

I invested about $13K into those cryptocurrencies and they are worth about $85K now (that's after paying myself back about $5K to get just a little bit of liquidity). I'm bullish on the concept and technology, but want to diversify a bit for obvious reasons. My options and my thoughts:

* **Pay off debt?** I already paid off my student loans
* **Buy my house instead of rent?** My life is too unstable, I'm moving to Asia next year
* **Equities/Bonds?** Equities are at an all-time high, 1/3 of my networth is already in this place
* **Cash?** I have a visceral fear of holding more than 10% cash. Monetary policy erodes its value every year.
* **Gold/Silver?** I have thought about bullion, but I'm not sure on the long-term promise of gold anymore. It's very pre-information age. It would be likely buying barrels of salt right at the turn of the industrial revolution.
* **Small Businesses?** I'm not an accredited investor, and I don't really have access to good quality dealflow on this front.
* **PE/Hedge Funds** I am likely committing $25K into the fund I work for (doesn't require accredited status), but I can meet those capital calls from my W-2 income so this doesn't really solve the question of what do I do with my unrealized crypocurrency gains.
* **Put towards an MBA?** There are at least a dozen things I'd rather spend two years and $250K on that will yield better returns (like starting a business, which is the plan in a couple of years).
* **Health?** I have a personal trainer, classpass, cook most of my meals exclusively from organic Whole Foods produce and meat.

Am I missing anything? Almost everything I do in my life is based on crowd-sourced knowledge so any advice on rebalancing would be very helpful. I have no particular goal, I just want my future spouse and I to have a combined net worth of $500K in my mid 30s, and to be in a very good place before we bring a child into a increasingly scary, unstable and unequal world.",finance

Recently I was fired from Mcdonalds very quickly and easily. Personally this really hit me, I was so in shock as I had no clue what the reason was, my General Manager had told me that "" You goofed off too much and the managers complained about me"" the reason I got fired so quickly was because I was still on a 3 month work probation. I have no clue on how to go about this. This is my first job and I don't know how to go about this. As for finance I pay for my phone bill which is 35.4$ a month including tax and a bi-weekly gym membership at goodlife for 26.7$ on a one year contract (Began first week of June 2017).  My parents told me that they cant help me and I have to be independent, though they were sympathetic about me getting fired for a such a stupid reason. So my questions are, how and what would I have to do so I can get a new job, money is tight for my family and me getting a job is almost a need. Next, how should I deal with this? I am so emotionally stressed right now and panicking, this fire has reflected back on who I look like as a person greatly. Last, Any next steps? As a high school student with exams next week I am on the verge of losing my shit and leaving (other family and un finance related problems) any help is appreciated 

Edit: In my defence I received no warning,I worked my ass off, they gave me he most busiest shifts, they called me in almost everyday (off schedule), my managers arent giving me any real reason as to why I was fired. If you ask any single one of my co workers they know for fact that I never slack. So for those saying that I goofing off isn't a stupid reason, there^. But yes, I do understand more as to what I did and it was pretty stupid of me, but I do think they  have really over reacted on their part.

Edit: even my co workers admit that the management at the location is super messed up and there was a lot of drama that went on, im dont feel too bad about leaving those assholes but its the fact that being fired a month in from mcdonalds... what do I put on my resume or say to interviewers",finance

So as the title says, as I was browsing through my previous payroll statements, I noticed something was very off. I normally am asked to work anywhere between 4 and 12 hours of overtime per week, as the place I'm employed at, is usually understaffed or they have bad time-schedules.

No problem, it's more money for me... So I thought. When I looked over the overtime hours, for the 7th period that they wrote this up. It says ""OVERTIME HOURS - 1.97"" Which I thought was strange, since I worked 6 hours over-time during that period.

Then I go back and notice a lot of times it's half of the original time I stayed over, or simply it didn't exist.

I think it's either cause the supervisor on the floor or the management isn't reporting my overtime that they asked or something else that I don't know about.

personalfinance,Graduate School Abroad -- Only Option For Future?,"Hi /r/personalfinance:

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I need advice regarding going to graduate school abroad.

&amp;nbsp;

I just graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English while minoring in Middle Eastern studies. I studied abroad twice in Israel and Australia respectively, and I want a career with an international organization, where I will transit into the Department of State after I spend a good amount of time.

&amp;nbsp;

My undergraduate scores were not high enough to get me into a top-ranked program in America or the UK where I applied, but I got accepted into Australia's University of Sydney and the University of Melbourne's Master of International Relations program. Both schools are approved for federal aid in loans and grants, and if I go, I would start July 2018, essentially a year from now.

&amp;nbsp;

The details of these programs and going abroad include:

1. Two years as a full-time student.

2. International experience.

3. Tuition falls to $39,000 AUD per year, which would be about $50,000 USD total for the entire cost of attendance.

4. An extremely high cost of living in general, where both schools recommend a minimum $1200 USD per month for food, accommodation, etc.

5. An opportunity to become more marketable to potential employers, as getting a Masters in IR abroad in the international community would be better than getting it from a small, local private university.

6. Potential careers due to the lack of professional jobs in my area (see below).

7. Coursework or thesis-based option with specializations, internships apart of program curricula, mandatory foreign language requirements.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, I already have $30,000 in student debts from my undergraduate career, and I could defer them unto completion of graduate school. That would put me at $80,000 (not including interest) to pay back. That number does seem daunting, and I am not sure how to comprehend such a figure.

________________________________________________________________________________
A major source of conflict is that I am from the poorest county and poorest city in Virginia where the average household income is $30,000 and 29.8% of residential income falls below the poverty level. The nearest metropolitan area from here with decent salaries is 1.5 hours away, which would be far too much to commute on a daily basis.

&amp;nbsp;

The highest local offer I got is $10 full time an hour at a call center, which would net me $20,800 a year.  I also have a job with an overseas company where I work from home that pays $16 an hour at  10 hours a week which would net me $7600 within the next year.  I am living with my parents, meaning I can work my ass off and save it all, but I am not sure if this is the best choice for me as I could save this money for something else.

&amp;nbsp;

So I guess my questions are:  

1. Honestly, given my career prospects and my current living situation, is going to one of these schools abroad a decent and feasible option for me? I see $80,000 in student loans as something I would be paying off for who knows how long, however, it just might be the best option to grow as a young professional

2. Does a Masters in International Relations look good, especially one for an internationally acclaimed university? Melb and Sydney are ranked 33rd and 66th in the world, so they are some of the best schools in the world. 

3. Am I being too hopeful and naive at the age of 22 in going to graduate school abroad given the immense costs of it, knowing damn well it can all be for naught? Or it can be my way to find an international organization to become employed by, which I have no chance of in my current situation.

4. Should I save the money and pay off my current student loans, then perhaps revisit this option in the future?

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the long post, I just want all the advice I can get. What I do is going to set the course of my life so it is a big deal for me. I think I am about it, but I want outside advice.

dogecoin,Smart Contract Derivatives,"So first what is a derivative?  A derivative is a security with a price that is dependent upon or derived from one or more underlying assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. Its value is determined by fluctuations in the underlying asset. The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and market indexes. 

In the same way that a normal derivative is associated with a fiat currency imagine if it was possible to create tokens in a smart contract system that are associated with a cryptocurrency as an asset. So say we took dogecoin and then created an official token that represents it's value and any fluctuations in that value, that would be a dogecoin derivative. So the question is can't anyone make this token and the answer is no because of how it's perceived by the public. A true dogecoin derivative would be created by the community with the trust and faith that comes with the dogecoin brand. It would also open up the possibility for dogecoin to be both a currency and an investment at the same time so investor shibes are happy and merchant adoption shibes are happy. Imo it's win win. Will there be greed? Most likey but it won't happen in the realm of dogecoin adoption and development. No more investors begging for new developments to get short term gains, just go buy the dogecoin derivative. Everyone's happy.",cryptocurrency

Besides my credit score, I do  have several months of on-time rent payments and a paid off car loan in my history. With my current income, (and lack of other major financial responsibilities), I believe I should be able to put $1k towards the car monthly as a target, if not, at least $600-700.

personalfinance,Need advice on my student loans.,"TLDR: My parents are cutting me off for my 5th year of school. They've paid for (most) of my four years, with me only taking out the maximum FASFA allowed for each year. I need to pay for all of my tuition, room and board for my last two semesters. Where should I be getting a loan from?

I currently owe: $16,188.10, with $438.10 of that being accrued interest, to My Great Lakes at a ~4% interest rate.

I need to borrow: $31,410 for tuition, and ~$12,000 for rent/food.

This will leave me with about ~$60k in debt. I know if I take a decade to pay it off, it'll end up about $90k in total, but I think I can pay it off much much quicker. I am working but any money I make really only contributes to my food and living expenses. And I should be making about ~$72k starting salary after school if I land a good gig (graduating with a Computer Science degree, so that is probable). I know I should always plan for the worst though.

So my question here is... how can I go about this in the smartest way possible? And exactly where should I be getting this loan from? It seems that public loans max out @ ~10k. Is a credit union better than wells fargo? Etc.

I know I didn't make a great school choice, but it's too late to go back now. I don't regret going to the school I chose, because despite it's ridiculous cost, it's helped form me into the person I am now.

investing,Myth: Stocks are overvalued,"Fact: Stocks remain attractively valued.

....

When describing the equity markets today, it's quite popular to toss words around like ""bubble"", ""frothy"", ""over-extended"", and ""overvalued."" But when we step back and take an objective look at the two most important factors, earnings and interest rates, we arrive at a different conclusion.  

Everyone likes to talk about PE ratios, but not too much mention is made of interest rates.  Interest rates are just as important as earnings when we assess equity market valuations.  And one of the most popular benchmarks for interest rates is the current rate offered on the US 10-year Treasury Bond.  

In this 15-year [visual comparison](http://imgur.com/a/TqHBH) of the US 10yr rate vs. the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield, we can see that the premium between the two is currently larger today than it was during 2002 thru 2006 (which many consider to be a time of more ""normal"" markets).  That is, *given today's interest rate environment and the current earnings associated with the S&amp;P 500, stocks are actually less expensive today when compared to the pre-recession markets*.  

For this exercise, I broke out the last 15 years into three subsets of 5 years each .... One period (2002 thru 2006) to represent a pre-recession benchmark.  One period (2007 thru 2011) to represent the years that were most effected by the recession.  And one period (2012 thru 2016) to represent the years many consider to be ""frothy"" for the stock market--although, as we can quickly notice, the moves in SPY are absolutely justified.

Some items to notice ...

* The Earnings Yield Premium was positive for all 15 years

* The average Earnings Yield Premium for 2002 thru 2006 was: 1.38%

* The average Earnings Yield Premium during the recession-era was: 3.67%

* The current Earnings Yield Premium in 2017 is: 3.10% (meaning, given interest rates, stocks are cheaper today when compared to the pre-recession markets)

* Years when the Earnings Yield Premium was &gt; 5.00% (2008, 2011, 2012) turned out to be amazing buying opportunities 

* Multiple expansion on SPY since 2008 has been counterweighted by lower interest rates.  Thus, the Earnings Yield Premium hasn't changed much.

Finally, I provide three different scenarios with a range of SPY prices, SPY earnings and varying interest rates.  As can be seen, SPY can continue to grow in the coming year (with earnings expected to grow by double-digits in both 2017 and 2018) without reaching levels of overvaluation.  In all three scenarios, the Earnings Yield Premium does not reach the low levels (1.00 - 2.00%) we saw during the markets of '02 thru '06.  

**Conclusion:  It will take an explosion in interest rates (unlikely given inflation expectations), a massive rise in the price of SPY, or a combination of both in order to reach levels on SPY that would truly represent areas of overvaluation.  Given the two most important factors, stocks remain attractive.**

personalfinance,18 Year old Investment Questions,"Currently have 4000$ extra which I would like to invest. I'm planning on attending a university in the coming year. Currently I'd like to invest in a growth/income fund to supplement my current sources of income and have an extra source of monthly earinings when I enter college.

I understand most people would recommend saving for retirement as soon as possible, and I have that in mind for the near future, but as of now I want to create a secure source of additional revenue. Also from looking into funds like the 529 college plan, I didn't like how it negatively affected my chances of receiving federal aid and scholarships. 

So I would like to know what websites, funds, or procedures y'all would most recommend. Or give me insight into other ways I can use this cash to provide for the near future and supplement my current income.

personalfinance,First time car buyer and I need advice.,I'm 21 and within the past few months my credit rating has dropped down from the high 600s to around 540. I cant really put down anymore than $500. I moved to a different state in February and ive been employed since the first day I moved here. I just moved into  a new apartment with someone at the beginning of May and I pay $250 a month. I've also just taken on a new part time job at FedEX making around $200 a week so my income is around $1800. The most I can pay a month on a car would be around $300 and I'm looking for something 09' or newer. Am I qualified to get something for $500 down? Also does the downpayment cover other fees that the dealer may have or just towards the vehicle total?

personalfinance,Student also working full time job can't keep doing both. Looking into taking out loans for remainder of school (3 semesters). Looking for advice.,"Hey all. I've been working 40 hours a week these past two semesters while attending college for my bachelors in computer science. I'm also supporting my girlfriend who has some medical issues that prevent her from working a normal 8-5 and does freelance writing and has some income.

Working this much and taking 12 units of a really difficult degree is too much for me. This last semester, I failed all my classes this semester due to stress of providing for my girlfriend and myself and having little time to work on homework and having a large load in school.

My job just announced our whole building (100+ employees) is being laid off at the end of July. Everyone had meetings to tell who got job offers for the same job but in the bay area (where the operation is moving), and unfortunately, I wasn't offered a job. So I now have to find a new job.

My idea is that now that I don't have a job that I'm in and wanting to do school full time and focus on getting out sooner rather than later has me considering private student loans.

I am male, 25, live in california, and qualify for Federal Pell Grant, Cal Grant B, Cal Grant B Subsistence, and State University Grant. I was also offered Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans. After tuition is paid for, I usually receive around $1750. This is very useful but I can't live on rent of $930 monthly on this.

So I'm looking for advice for where, what companies, etc to get a private student loan from as I want to get finished with school quickly and not take 4 years for 2 years' worth like I did in community college due to working.

**TL:DR Full time work &amp; 3/4 time school no longer sustainable, about to be laid off work, want to focus on school full time. Receive financial aid but not enough to survive on. Looking for advice on recommended private loans companies or methods for remaining 3 or 4 semesters of school.**",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay estimated taxes from a $15k beneficiary IRA withdrawal by June 15? Or spread out across the year?,"Hi PFers! Long-time lurker and follower of this sub. I've created a throwaway just for this question - so please ignore my lack of history. 

I am currently single and employed with an job that withholds the standard amount for state and federal taxes. However, my father passed a couple of years ago and left a chunk of money to me via a Fidelity IRA. It was transferred into a beneficiary account so that I could control the stocks and make withdrawals. 

Earlier this year, at the end of March, I took a distribution of $15k. In order to take the distribution, I had to withold at least 10% for taxes - which I agreed to the 10%. Since this is additional income, am I required to pay the anticipated federal and state taxes by June 15 in lump sum (estimated at $3,000)? I understand that I can base my taxes owed on my 2016 filing but unfortunately I am making considerably less than 2016 and the $3,000 toward state and federal would be more cost efficient.

personalfinance,Does putting 20% or more down on a mortgage reduce my interest rate vs. putting less down?,"I thought this to be the case, but I've just had a lender today tell me that there will be no rate difference at all on a loan I am seeking if I put 20% (or more) down than if I put 10% down. Does this fluctuate? If so, what drives whether putting more down reduces the rate?",finance
personalfinance,"Went to re-finance our mortgage, house is worth more than we thought. Is it worth it to roll our other debts into the mortgage?","My wife and I make $60,000/yr (plus profit sharing, but we don't count on that so it's not included in our budget.)
All current debts are:
Mortgage $407/month 5.0% Interest Rate (~$56 Principle, ~$120 Interest, the rest into escrow for taxes and home insurance, $42k remaining)
Car Payment $232/Month 2.25% Interest Rate (owe 7k total, bought the car 6 months ago)
Student Loans $50/Month ($3200 remaining)
A credit card we pay off in full each month
Total Debt Payment = $689/Month.

We are currently on a 5/1 ARM loan at 5.0% (due to getting the house with a 20% down payment and 2 part time incomes at the time). We bought the house for 55K in August of '14.  We haven't had an appraisal done yet, but the loan guy had no qualms putting $80k tentatively into his system, and zillow had it at just over 103K.

We have excellent credit and were offered a 30, 20 or 15 year mortgage at 4%, 3.75% and 3.5% interest, respectively.

We have the opportunity to leverage our equity by increasing our mortgage by the exact amount to pay off our car and student loans (~10.5K).

There are lots of different combinations of mortgage lengths and taking the extra 10.5K or not, but the one that jumped out to my wife and I as the best option was the 15 year mortgage @ 3.5% interest, with the extra 10.5K for a mortgage of 55K (including closing costs of 2.4K) total. If we did that our monthly payment would be $579 ($110 less than our current total debt payment).  If we take this route and roll the extra $110/month into making extra payments on the principal of the loan (with no pre-payment penalties), we would outright own our home in around 9 years, not taking into account any pay raises or salary bumps by changing jobs in that time frame.

Pros: Turn our 30 year variable rate mortgage into a fixed rate 15 year.
Free up $110 cash flow per month (that we'll pump into the mortgage unless we need it for some reason)
Pay off our student loans and car, leaving the mortgage as our only debt.

Cons: Higher interest rate on the mortgage than the car payment.

personalfinance,Question about start of student loan repayment,"Hi folks,

My son just graduated from college (yay) with a manageable amount of student loan debt, including both federal and private loans. 

Question for you guys: 

When do loans need to begin being paid back? I was always under the impression that federal loans had to start being paid six months after graduation. 

However, all of the paperwork we have been receiving from both the federal and private loans says the repayments start in November 2018 - a year and a half after he graduated.

He's certainly in no giant hurry to have mandatory payments (although he is already hard at work paying them down), so we hesitate to contact them in case it's just a clerical error.

But we also don't want it to turn out to be a clerical error, and then they say he owes penalties or something.

Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Taking out small loans to invest as a way to build credit?,"I (24M) am considering taking out a series of small, short-term loans (~$1000 a month) and investing them in an index fund before paying them off again at the end of the month. My focus here wouldn't be to make any money on the investment, but rather to build a solid diversified credit history (I just got my first credit card). I am lucky enough to not have any student loans or a car payment, although this also means that I don't have any credit history. I have a decent job ($60k a year), no dependents, 10k invested and few expenses in a low COL city. 

My hope would be that the average capital gains would more or less cover the interest, and that whatever extra I spent would be peanuts compared to the interest rate savings. I'd like to buy a house at some point and have a business idea that would take a loan to get started (this is probably 3-6 years away while I flesh out the plans and save up some more money).

Is this a decent idea? Assuming I'm diligent about paying it off on time and have the financial flexibility to survive market downturns, would this be a good way to build credit?",finance

personalfinance,"$18,000 extra for debt repayment; pay off some of student loan or entire vehicle loan?","Hi all,

In the next few months I'll (well, we will) have an additional $18,000 for debt repayment.  If it makes any difference, this isn't gift money.  It's a combination of usual earnings, an extra paycheck month, some additional wiggle room in the budget after paying off a credit card, and $ we saved up for a vacation that we won't be going on due to scheduling conflicts.  And just to throw this out there: we already have an emergency fund, save for retirement, and are generally pretty careful financially.


This money would pay off all of our vehicle loan with several hundred to spare.  It could also pay off 8-9% of our total student loan balance.   I'm leaning toward paying the car off entirely, but am open to changing my mind.  


I'm pro-car loan at the moment for a few reasons.  First of all (and in no particular order), our loan is through a bank that we don't have any other dealings with and isn't very user-friendly.  Second, there is less than a 2% difference in the interest rates between the car and the student loan that we would be eliminating.  Third, the car is around 30K miles and we expect to own it for the foreseeable future.  I'll also add that paying off the car would allow us to live entirely on the smaller of our two incomes, which is a not insignificant benefit in our eyes not only because we could get by without touching our emergency fund if either of us lost our jobs, but also because it means an entire income would be freed up for debt repayment and savings.


What say you?  I should add that the individual with the larger student loan debt load (about 65%) is theoretically eligible for PSLF, but not for the next several years and it's not something that we rely too heavily on.",finance
personalfinance,Payoff student loans or save for first house?,"Hi PF, using a throwaway but I hope that won't dissuade you from commenting and providing advice!

I have about 25K in student loan debt. Current interest rate is 3.125% and I pay ~$200/month to pay down as quickly as possible.

personalfinance,"Somewhat Complex Situation - All Advice Welcome (Student Debt, Inheritance, etc.)","I really appreciate the opportunity to hear varied opinions on how everyone would approach this scenario. 

My Mother recently passed away and left me with the following:
* $151,000 in life insurance proceeds;
* $70,000 in a beneficiary IRA
* $10,000~ cash
* $80,000~ real estate equity (townhouse worth approx. $180,000 with about $100,000 in outstanding mortgage. Rental value is approx. $1500 per month.  Current mortgage interest rate is 4.8%)

My Assets: 
* $9,000 cash
* $20,000 in retirement funds ($15,000 in a Simple IRA, $5,000 in employer-sponsored 401(k)).

My Debts:
* $220,000 in federal student loans (currently paying $250/mo)
* $190,000 mortgage (approx. $1000/mo). Interest rate is 4.75%.

So, yeah.  There's a lot of moving parts here.  My student loans are obviously very high (law school).  Right now I make about $60k a year, however I expect that to continue to rise each year as my practice expands.  Because of my ""limited"" income and high debt, I'm on an income based repayment program, which is why my payments are so low.  Without such a repayment program, my payments would likely be somewhere around $2000 on a 10-year payment structure.

My initial thought is that renting her home would make the most sense.  I'm open to hearing suggestions otherwise.  There's certainly a sentimental aspect to that, which I won't deny.  It would be hard to sell her home.  

I'm not nailed down to anything with the insurance proceeds or beneficiary IRA.  My desire is to completely invest those funds for long-term growth.  I have a Merrill Lynch representative who handles our Firm's 401(k) accounts telling me to invest the insurance proceeds in a professionally managed account with his office. He is also recommending that I just transfer the beneficiary IRA funds to a bene IRA in my own name.  Again, open to all suggestions.  

I'm currently contributing 5% to my 401(k) with a 3% employer match.  I should probably be doing more, but I didn't really expect to receive any of the amounts that I did and I haven't changed anything since my Mom passed away in April.  While she was sick for some time, I didn't know anything about her life insurance.  It was a surprise. 

My student loans are a difficult situation for me to process.  On one hand, I know that I should pay those off as quickly as possible.  On the other, I don't want to use my Mom's money to pay those off, as I feel like she would desire that I do something else with it.  I would feel better paying those loans off on my own, as my income rises and I *hopefully* become more successful.  There's also the issue of the payments being so low at the moment that sinking large sums of cash into them, that otherwise can be invested, might not be advantageous.  In the unlikely event that I don't make enough to no longer qualify for income based repayment AND the plan still exists, I would qualify for loan forgiveness in approximately ~20 years.  The forgiven amount would still be a taxable event.  

That's a lot.  But I appreciate your thoughts and certainly don't take offense.  I'm open to all opinions as to how you would tackle this situation.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Hi new and question about reducing debt.,"Hi all. 

I'm working to eliminate all my debt and I'm almost there except for my car payment and about $4k in tax debt. I own a '14 f150 that I use for work and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to sell and down size to a cheaper, more practical work truck. I owe approx $18,400 and the truck is worth about $22,000 kbb trade in. My interest rate is a whopping 7% so I thought about a refi but unloading it all together just sounds more tempting.

Carmax offered to buy me out for 22k which would put about $3600 in my pocket. The only thing holding me back is at $18k I have so much truck which I wouldn't be able to obtain again if I got rid of it. 

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,I'm finally ready to settle my debt... Now what?,"I've been following this Subreddit for a while now and love how often the community helps those learning to better their financial freedom. Last year, my very recent ex-boyfriend of 3 years died in his sleep from a brain aneurysm and I couldn't work for about 3 months + struggled for a remaining 8. I stopped paying every bill I had and let everything go to collections. I had no other options at the time. It's now been a full year and I am finally back on my feet. Now what do I do? I was told to settle paying 10c on the $1 for all of my debt but I'm not sure how to negotiate that with each debt collector. I have roughly 15k in Credit Card debt. This is excluding the 51k I have in student loans at an almost 7% interest rate. Would very much appreciate any direction to take with this!

Looks like it was 100gwei on this transaction [0x40d2abb4e411ffd8e0ccb422f4fcacae3dc0967125fe5f6e6a45d48cc87e44e6](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x40d2abb4e411ffd8e0ccb422f4fcacae3dc0967125fe5f6e6a45d48cc87e44e6) which was confirming the transaction set up by [0x52dffab952f9b69a2c7fdab6b9e52ace98ec44559d8239688a5e88578b5c5e15](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x52dffab952f9b69a2c7fdab6b9e52ace98ec44559d8239688a5e88578b5c5e15)

~~Given how important it was to get this call off it seems like they could have afforded to go a bit higher... I mean don't get me wrong, 100gewi is a very high gas price, but this transaction ended up costing a mere 0.0083633 ETH, and ended up causing them to collect WAY more than was originally intended with the unlimited 1 hour window.~~ Who knows maybe there were other factors in this transaction not getting in time, but its pretty unfortunate the original terms weren't upheld.
 
Bit of a rocky start, but still really excited to see where this project goes and I wish the team the best!

personalfinance,Advice with tuition&amp;student loans. Please help!,"Hey all. 

I just finished my first year of undergrad with no debt, thankfully. I am also relatively new to reddit, so if you believe I am posting this in the wrong forum, please redirect me to the appropriate one. Thanks!

EDIT: one very important thing I neglected to mention was that I am an international student. I moved to the US 3 years ago. For this past academic year, I was not eligible for any type of federal aid or loans. My family unexpectedly got approved for permanent residency. I will be able to fill out my fafsa for the 2018-2019 academic year. 

I attend a prestigious private school where I pay around $26k a year. This may vary by $1k-4K based on what dorm I am placed in, student health insurance etc. Personal costs are around $2k per year. 

My father is the sole source of my family's income, and he is retiring in August. I will not be able to return to my institution for the 2017-2018 academic year, so I am taking two semesters off. With the money I save this year with the job I will be working, I can pay for one year of school at the same institution on my own with no financial assistance whatsoever. My problem is paying for the remaining two years. 

Scroll down to read the tldr as this post is quite long. 

With part time jobs etc I can pay around $11k-$15k per year in tuition. I have done this before so I know it's realistic. That leaves around $11-15k that I personally cannot pay. My family can contribute $6k max to my tuition. That leaves around $5k-$10k that I cannot pay. 

For reference for the following questions, with the income my father will have after retirement, we will be just below or right at national poverty line. How much money can I get from FAFSA, Pell grants and other domestic sources of aid? Maximum and realistic. I have absolutely no idea how federal funding works since this was not a concern of mine in high school as an international student. 

 Is it advisable for me at all to take out loans, and potentially be $20k+ in debt? I also want to go to law school after undergrad, which will accumulate hundreds of thousands of $ in debt, so I have that to worry about, along with the fear that if I don't do well in undergrad and law school, I will not be able to get a job that pays well enough for me to pay off my loans. 

Furthermore, I have no established credit history as an 18 year old student in undergrad. My parents do, but they are immovable on their personal policy of no loans. Try as I might, I cannot convince them to take out loans or co-sign loans  for my education as they are vehemently opposed to me being in debt. They will not budge. I recently just got a credit card and pay my bills on time, but of course that is not enough to establish a credit score, as my purchases mostly include food and small items of clothing. Can I take out federal loans under my name without having to rely on a cosigner? What will my cost of attendance be after federal aid? Is it advisable for me to take out loans, or should I avoid it like the plague, as my parent advise?

Some stuff to keep in mind when giving your advice: 
I was very, very fortunate to be able to attend the institution I do. I definitely did not do well enough in high school according to their standard, and got accepted for my slightly above average SAT score, extracurriculars and personal statement. For this reason, I am unwilling to drop out and go to community college then simply apply for readmission to the same institution, for fear of not being readmitted. I am also unwilling to transfer to another private institution even if it is away from home because transfer students tend not to get a lot of scholarships, and my grades aren't good enough to get me into a better institution. Even though it might seem ridiculously expensive, I was lucky to be paying that amount as an international student. I was depressed for the past few years, and going to that college was the only time I've felt truly happy in a long time. I have met some amazing people. I have improved greatly on a personal and academic level. I really thrived in the all-women environment. I am willing to do whatever it takes to go back. 

I also absolutely despise being at home with my parents. I have barely been here for a month and it already feels like it's been 5. I cannot stand it here, and I am falling back into my depressive state. It has been like this for years, and I finally thought it was going to be over. For these reasons, I am highly unwilling to transfer to a public school in my state. I would rather be in debt than do that. But of course, I would prefer not to be in debt. 

My school also places a huge emphasis on being a ""living-learning community,"" so moving off campus into a potentially cheaper apartment is not an option. And room&amp;board roughly turns out to be the same with the cost of living. 

Any advice would be appreciated, whether related to my questions or in response to other issues I have mentioned. I am desperate at this point. Please help.

2017-06-13 08:00:18.224 GMT


By Matthew Leising
(Bloomberg Markets) -- Summer colds are the worst, and Emin
Gün Sirer had caught a wicked bug from his 1-year-old son. So it
was with watering eyes and a stuffy nose that the associate
professor of computer science at Cornell found himself working
from his sickbed on Monday, June 13, 2016. Gün—everyone calls
him Gün—couldn’t tear himself away from his laptop. He had
another type of bug in his sights, a flaw in a line of computer
code he feared put $250 million at risk of being stolen.
It wasn’t just any code. It was the guts of the newest
breakthrough in software design related to blockchain, the novel
combination of decentralized computing and cryptography that
gave life to the virtual currency bitcoin in 2009. Since then,
the promise of blockchain to transform industries from finance
to health care has captured imaginations in corporate boardrooms
and governments alike. Yet what the Turkish-born professor was
exploring that Monday was the next leap forward from bitcoin,
what’s known as the ethereum blockchain.
Rather than moving bitcoin from one user to another, the
ethereum blockchain hosts fully functioning computer programs
called smart contracts—essentially agreements that enforce
themselves by means of code rather than courts. That means they
can automate the life cycle of bond payments, say, or ensure
that pharmaceutical companies can authenticate the sources of
their drugs. Yet smart contracts are also new and mostly
untested. Like all software, they are only as reliable as their
coding—and Gün was pretty sure he’d found a big problem.
In an email sent to one of his graduate students, Philip
Daian, at 7:30 p.m., Gün noted that the smart contract he was
looking at might have a problem—on line 666. (They say the devil
is in the details.) Gün feared the bug could allow a hacker to
make unlimited ATM-like withdrawals from the millions, even if
the attacker, who’d have needed to be an investor, had only $10
in his account.
This staggering amount of money lived inside a program
called a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. Dreamed
up less than a year earlier and governed by a smart contract,
the DAO was intended to democratize how ethereum projects are
funded. Thousands of dreamers and schemers and developers who
populate the cutting edge of computer science, most of them
young, had invested in the DAO. This was real money, a quarter
of a billion dollars, their money, meant to build a better
version of the world, and every cent was at risk.
Gün, who wears his dark hair short and looks a decade
younger than his 45 years, had already been tracking and
publicizing flaws in the DAO’s design. A few weeks earlier, on
May 27, along with two colleagues, he’d urged investors to stop
buying into the DAO until security issues could be fixed. It had
been too late, however, and the program went live the next day.
Smart contracts such as the DAO are built to be entirely reliant
on their code once released on the ethereum blockchain. That
meant the DAO code couldn’t be fixed. Other blockchain
experts—including Peter Vessenes, co-founder of the Bitcoin
Foundation—had also pointed out security flaws in the smart
contract, but Gün appears to be the first to pinpoint the flaw
that put the money in jeopardy. The problem was the code was so
new that no one knew what to ­expect—or even if there was
actually a problem in the first place.
Gün had his doubts, too. This wasn’t even his job. He does
this for fun. Daian didn’t think they’d found anything either.
Over email, he said, “We might be up the creek ;).” Later, when
Gün pointed to the error in line 666, Daian replied, “Don’t
think so.”
Gün says, “We don’t sound the alarm bell every time we find
a bug that seems suspicious.” Instead, he went to bed to try to
kill his cold—the one bug he knew to be real. “I was too
miserable to sort it out,” he says.
Four days later, Christoph Jentzsch lay on the floor of his
home office, taking deep breaths, trying not to panic.
It was Friday morning, and software developers all over the
Western world were waking up to the news that the DAO, which
Jentzsch had created, was being attacked. Gün had been right.
Jentzsch, who has dark hair and a perpetual five o’clock
shadow, lives with his family in the Mittweida region of
Germany, a rural spot not far from the Czech border. Mornings in
the Jentzsch household are a whirlwind as he and his wife get
their five children—age 2 to 9—fed and off to school. Yet today,
after his brother Simon woke him with a call that the DAO was
being hacked, Jentzsch had to ignore his familial duties.
“You’ve got the kids,” he told his wife. “I have an emergency.”
 
 
This is the story of one of the largest digital heists in
history. And while you may have heard last year that hackers
breached Swift, the bank-to-bank messaging system, and stole $81
million from Bangladesh’s central bank, the DAO attack is in a
different category altogether. It played out in front of anyone
who cared to watch and couldn’t be stopped. Just as the global
WannaCry ransomware attack in May laid bare weaknesses in
computer operating systems, the DAO hack exposed the early
frailties of smart-contract security and left many in the
community shaken because they hadn’t found the bug in time. The
aftermath would eventually pit good hackers against bad ones—the
white hats vs. the black hats—in the strange and futuristic-
sounding DAO Wars.
The roots of the DAO belong to an idea Jentzsch borrowed
from another internet-fueled phenomenon: crowdfunding. The 32-
year-old Jentzsch, a theoretical physicist by training, and a
few colleagues started Slock.it in 2015. As they considered how
to fund the company, Jentzsch approached it as many had—sell a
digital currency, effectively a token, to raise cash. But why
should each new startup have to program its own initial coin
offering? Jentzsch wondered. What if one huge fund ruled them
all?
He introduced his idea to the world at DevCon 1 in London
in November 2015. “What is the blockchain way of creating a
company?” Jentzsch asked his audience. “Of course, it has to be
a DAO.” It would work like this: Ether, a virtual currency like
bitcoin, would be used to fund and develop applications on the
ethereum blockchain—things such as making a music app similar to
iTunes or a ride-sharing service along the lines of Uber.
Investors would buy DAO tokens with their ether; the tokens
would allow them to vote to fund projects they liked. If the app
they backed made money, the token holder shared in the profit.
In the six months he spent creating the DAO, Jentzsch
thought it would raise $5 million. From April 30 to May 28, the
DAO crowdfunding pulled in $150 million. That’s when ether
traded just below $12. As the price of ether rose in the
following weeks to $20.75 the day before the attack, so too did
the value of the DAO, putting a $250 million target on this
thing Jentzsch had unknowingly brought into the world with a
fatal, original sin.
“Our hope was it would be the center of a decentralized
sharing economy,” says Jentzsch, who now regrets not capping the
amount raised. “For such a big experiment, it was way too
early.” In the weeks after the attack, Jentzsch and the rest of
the ethereum community would come to grips with their own crisis
that, writ small, echoed the bank bailouts and government
rescues of 2008. “It became too big to fail,” he says.
But why would anyone invest in the DAO in the first place?
It has something to do with the strain of digital libertarianism
at the heart of the ethereum community, much like the set of
beliefs that led to the birth of bitcoin. Think of bitcoin as
the first global currency whose use can’t be stopped by
governments or corporations; on top of that, bitcoin is almost
impossible to hack. Ethereum, then, is another level beyond.
It’s an uncensorable global computer. As amazing and
unprecedented as that is, it’s also a bit terrifying. Brought to
life, the DAO ended up staggering off the table and turning on
the community that wanted it so badly.
Accustomed to working into the night to stay in touch with
colleagues in North America, Jentzsch blows off steam by jogging
or kayaking on the nearby Zschopau River. Yet on that Friday
morning, he had the more pressing task of pulling himself up off
the floor and dealing with the attack. “I went into emergency
mode: Don’t try to save the DAO,” he says. “No, it’s over.”
 
 
It was far from over.
Several hours later and half a world away from the Jentzsch
household in Mittweida, Alex Van de Sande was waking up in his
apartment in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. The
baby-faced ethereum developer had been born in the small fishing
village of Santa Cruz Cabrália in the Bahia region of Brazil and
moved with his parents to Rio when he was about 3 years old.
These days he’s known as “avsa” on Reddit and Twitter. After
reaching for his phone to see why it was blowing up with Skype
messages, he turned to his wife and said, “Remember when I was
telling you about that huge unhackable pile of money?” She
nodded. “It’s been hacked,” he told her.
His first thought was to get his DAO tokens out. He owned
about 100,000 of them, valued at about $15,000 at the time. He’s
the lead designer of the Ethereum Wallet app, a program that
allows him and anyone else to interact with the blockchain. Van
de Sande scrambled to log in to it, but his password didn’t
work. It was glitching, and as he worked to fix it, his panic
subsided. He realized he shouldn’t be bailing on the DAO but
trying to save it. And to do that, he needed Griff.
Griff Green, who’s worked variously as a massage therapist
in Los Angeles and a community organizer in Seattle, is one of
only a handful of people in the world who holds a master’s
degree in digital currencies. He got it online, natch, from the
University of Nicosia. A self-described “dreamer,” the 32-year-
old is the closest thing Ethereumville has to a mayor. Green
knows everybody; in fact, he’d been the first to relay word of
the attack to Simon, Jentzsch’s brother and a co-founder of
Slock.it.
Green had been working for Slock.it for about six months by
then and woke up that morning in the house belonging to
Jentzsch’s mom in Mittweida. Jentzsch is one of nine children,
so his mother had a spare bedroom where she could put Green up
for a few days. Using his extensive contacts, Green started
identifying as many people as he could who were interacting with
the DAO—going so far as to ask strangers to send pictures or
scans of their IDs—in an attempt to sort friend from foe.
And then something strange happened: The attack stopped
working. In the six hours since the attack began, the thief had
managed to steal 30 percent of the DAO’s 12 million ether—which
that day equaled about $55 million. “We don’t even understand
why the guy had stopped,” says Van de Sande.
Now Green raced to protect the remaining 70 percent of the
DAO the attacker hadn’t stolen. Once Van de Sande got in touch
with Green in Germany, along with two or three others, the
foundation was laid for what would become known as the Robin
Hood group—white hat hackers who’d devise a bold good-guy plan
to drain the remaining DAO. To save the DAO, they’d have to
steal the remaining ether, then give it back to its rightful
owners.
And yet as they scrambled that Friday, qualms emerged
within the group. “What does it even mean to hack something?”
Van de Sande asks. No one knew if what they were about to do was
legal. Also, wouldn’t their hack look just as bad as the theft
they were trying to stop? Then there were the practical issues.
“Who pushes the button?” he remembers wondering. Doing so would
initiate their counterattack and alert the community. “Someone
has to push the button.”
The price of ether the night before the attack had hit an
all-time high of just above $20. News of the hack sent it
tumbling to $15 by the end of Friday, wiping out almost a half-
billion dollars in market value. At that price, the DAO still
held $125 million, and the Robin Hood group worried the attack
would resume. They might be the only line of defense if it did,
so Van de Sande agreed to use his DAO tokens to fuel their
counterattack, thereby becoming a public face of the group.
At this point, it might help to think of the DAO as the
spacecraft in Alien after Ripley initiates the self-destruct
sequence. To flee, she’s forced to use an escape pod. DAO
investors had to initiate a similar sequence to deploy escape
pods that would allow them to get their ether out of the DAO.
The code that dictated the escape pods’ behavior is where the
bug lived, so to steal the remaining DAO funds the Robin Hood
group would have to be in a pod to exploit the flaw—and because
of the way Jentzsch wrote the DAO, they had only a short window
of time and just a few pods to choose from.
A few minutes before launching the attack, Van de Sande
joked on the group’s Skype chat, “Let’s go rob a bank!” No one
laughed. “Not everyone really appreciated the humor,” he says.
In his Copacabana apartment, Van de Sande readied to push
the button on his laptop. Then, suddenly, he lost his internet
connection. His router was down. “I was like, What the f--- is
going on here?” he says. He had less than 30 minutes left to
execute the Robin Hood hack. He frantically called NET, his
Brazilian internet service provider, but couldn’t get past the
automated customer ­service experience. He says the robotic
voice told him, “We see there’s an internet issue in your
neighborhood.” The irony was not lost on him: Here he was trying
to steal millions of dollars from a robot but was being waylaid
by another robot.
“Then we missed,” he says. The window closed. He went from
the high of feeling like they were about to come to the rescue
of the vulnerable DAO to the crushing low of having their
international connection severed by NET’s breakdown. He took his
dog, Sapic—named after the one in Pedro Almodóvar’s All About My
Mother—for a walk, then crawled into bed, defeated.
The next morning was Saturday, and Van de Sande tried to
reconvene the Robin Hood group to infiltrate ­another escape
pod. But folks were busy and couldn’t get together. “We felt
like the worst hackers in history,” Van de Sande says. “We were
foiled by bad internet and family commitments.”
 
 
Who, exactly, were they at war with?
No one really knows, but there are some clues. One address
the attacker used is 0xF35e2cC8E6523d683eD44870f5B7c
C785051a77D. Got that? Like everything else in a blockchain, a
user’s address is an anonymous string of characters. But every
address leaves behind a history on the blockchain that’s open
for examination. Not that it makes sense to 99.9 percent of
humankind, but Green gets it.
To pull off his heist, the attacker needed to create a
contract that would interact with the DAO. He did so on June 15
and deployed it in the early morning hours two days later,
according to Green. Once activated, the attack contract started
sending about $4,000 worth of ether through the attacker’s
account every three or four minutes to drain the DAO.
But where did the original money to fund the attack come
from? To interact with the ethereum blockchain, every contract
must be funded by an amount of ether. This attack contract was
funded by two addresses, but tracing it further back becomes
tricky. That’s because the second address used an exchange
called ShapeShift to send 52 ether into its account on June 14.
ShapeShift doesn’t collect any information on its users and says
it turns one virtual currency, such as bitcoin, into another,
like ether, in less than 10 seconds. While there are valid
reasons for using ShapeShift, it’s also a great way to launder
digital assets and ­cover your tracks.
After the attack contract stopped working, the thief needed
to deploy it again, says Green. He tried but failed, and after a
few more transactions, the hack whimpered to an end. (One
possible reason the attack stopped, Green says, is that the
hacker’s tokens became corrupted, which means he had no way to
exploit the bug.)
We know this limited amount of one-sided information from
the blockchain’s public record. Digital asset exchanges see both
sides. An internal investigation by one such exchange concluded
that the DAO attacker was likely part of a group, not a lone
wolf, based in Switzerland, according to an executive there who
wouldn’t speak on the record or allow the company’s name to be
used. ­Exchanges are in the unique position of being able to
analyze the trading activity of their customers because they
know who they are, even if they’re anonymous on the blockchain.
The executive says the exchange shared the analysis with the
Boston office of the FBI, though there’s been no further contact
since October of last year.
Cornell’s Gün says he also spoke to the Boston office of
the FBI—and to agents in the New York office and to the New York
State Attorney General’s Office. “It’s very difficult to
coordinate an attack of this kind without leaving breadcrumbs
behind,” Gün says. He encouraged the FBI to look at the ethereum
testnet, where programmers can run their code in a safe
environment to work out kinks. The attacker wouldn’t just launch
such a complicated hack without testing it, Gün says he told
federal officials, and the feds might be able to get clues to
his identity there. Gün says he also pointed them to addresses
linked to the attacker, such as the one described above, that
were listed by his grad student Daian on his blog. (The FBI
declined to comment.)
“I’m absolutely amazed. Why has no one traced this back and
found out who did it?” asks Stephan Tual, the third co-founder
of Slock.it. “It still bugs me to this day, because what that
person has done is incredibly unethical.”
 
 
On Tuesday, four days after the initial attack, the hacker
returned and somehow resumed the heist.
The Robin Hood group had feared this moment would come and
was ready. Early Sunday morning they’d finally managed to
convene online and successfully infiltrate an escape pod, but
had held off their counterattack. Now they had no choice.
One strike against the group was their distance from one
another—one in Rio, others scattered about Europe. (Some of the
group’s members didn’t want to be identified for this story.) It
was important that they coordinate their activities because,
like in Charlie’s Angels, they all had different specialties:
Green the community organizer, Van de Sande the public face,
others who wrote the Robin Hood group attack contracts. So Van
de Sande needed to be walked through the step-by-step hacking
process they were about to unleash, because that wasn’t his area
of expertise.
“I’ll be honest, I was excited,” Green says. “This is the
craziest thing that’s ever happened to me. This is the craziest
thing that’s almost ever happened to anyone.”
Whether it was legal remains an unanswered question.
“You literally have cyber ninjas warring on the
blockchain,” says Vessenes, the programming expert. “What
they’re doing is almost certainly illegal, but they’re claiming
it’s for the greater good.”
And now it was Van de Sande’s job to let the community know
that the Robin Hood group counterattack was benign. He took to
Twitter, where he wrote “DAO IS BEING SECURELY DRAINED. DO NOT
PANIC.”
A nod to the classic Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, his
plea to not panic was met with all the snark and real-life
concern Twitter can handle. “NOTHING SAYS DO NOT PANIC LIKE ALL
CAPS,” one user responded. “#RealLife is more exciting than
#MrRobot !!” tweeted another. Yet as the Robin Hood group attack
gained steam, they noticed something strange and worrisome—the
attacker was with them in every escape pod.
“We escaped the mother ship, but now we’re alone in space
with the alien we were trying to escape,” says Van de Sande.
This was a big problem. Because of how Jentzsch wrote his code,
the Robin Hood group would have to wait several weeks before
they could secure the ether they recovered. Yet if the attacker
was in that escape pod with the group, he could just follow
them—what’s known as a stalking attack. If the hacker stalked
the Robin Hood group, the ether wasn’t really safe after all.
“The game only ends when one of these parties doesn’t show
up to fight,” Van de Sande says. This, in essence, is the heart
of the DAO Wars, the never-ending battle that would have to be
waged to keep the recovered ether safe. If only there were a way
to reverse the theft once and for all.
 
 
What happened next is one of the strangest and most contentious
episodes in blockchain’s early history.
The morning of July 20 dawned cool and clear in Ithaca,
N.Y., the home of Cornell. A weeklong ethereum boot camp on
campus had brought developers and programmers from all over the
world to town. The mood was anxious, but not because the
workshops were about to begin. This was the day the ethereum
community would decide to rewrite the past.
The weeks since the DAO hack had been filled with
acrimonious debate as developers, coders, investors, and other
community members considered their options to undo the theft. As
the Robin Hood group battled the attacker mostly in private, a
public debate was raging. The white hat hackers weren’t the only
ones trying to save the DAO. Jentzsch worked almost around the
clock, fielding hundreds of requests from DAO investors on what
they should do. Vitalik Buterin, 23, who created the ethereum
blockchain before he was 20, became a focal point as he led the
community through their options.
In short, what they could do was change the ethereum
blockchain to fix the DAO, but only if they got a majority of
computers running the network to agree to a software update.
Pull that off, and it’s as though the attack never happened.
This is known as a hard fork. The decision stirred such
strong reactions that it remains controversial a year later,
both within the ethereum community and with bitcoin users who
insist a blockchain’s history is never to be tampered with. In
an interview in October, Buterin was unapologetic about pushing
for the change.
“Some bitcoin users see the hard fork as in some ways
violating their most fundamental values,” said Buterin, who
didn’t respond to requests to speak specifically about this
story. “I personally think these fundamental values, pushed to
such extremes, are silly.” Within the ethereum community, at
least, Buterin’s views won the day, and computer nodes all over
the world accepted the fork. Contained in block 1,920,000, the
fix to the DAO was simple and did only one thing—if you had
ether invested in it, you could now get it out.
But why hadn’t the attacker made off with his money? It had
been more than a month. The same code that exposed the DAO to
the theft, in the end, enabled the ether to be returned.
Everything to do with the DAO is a parameter: rules, if-then
statements, and more rules that are all finalized before the
program is set loose. One of these parameters stated that anyone
wanting to get their ether out of the DAO had to wait a certain
amount of time—27 days after the initial request, then another
seven days.
This fail-safe, written by Jentzsch, applied to the
attacker as well. So even though somebody had effectively robbed
a bank, he then had to wait 34 days before crossing the street
to make his getaway. While he was waiting, the money was stolen
back. A month after the original heist, the ether thief now had
nothing to show for his caper.
Back on the Cornell campus, ethereum boot camp attendees
celebrated. The next day, Gün brought Champagne to the session
he was teaching. He’d pasted makeshift labels on the Chandon
bottles with a picture of the utensil that said,
“Congratulations on the successful fork.”
Then something else unexpected happened. The original
ethereum blockchain, the one with the DAO attack in it, kept
growing. Imagine a hard fork is a branch of a tree that sprouts
in a different direction at the end of the main limb. The end of
that limb is supposed to wither after a hard fork, but here it
continued to grow as a small group of users continued to process
transactions on that version of the blockchain. Instead of
dying, this became a second form of ethereum, quickly dubbed
ethereum classic, complete with a digital currency that now had
value. Even in the ­science fiction world of blockchain, this
was an unprecedented turn of events. It meant the DAO attacker
suddenly had about 3.6 million ethereum classic coins in his DAO
account, known as the DarkDAO, which were slowly gaining in
value. The Robin Hood group held about 8.4 million, because in
this parallel universe they still controlled 70 percent of the
DAO funds they had recovered.
The Robin Hood group couldn’t believe it. “We did
everything to avoid this, but now we’re being dragged back into
this fight,” Van de Sande says.
Now, the bitcoin supporters who viewed the hard fork as a
violation of the core values of blockchain could back up their
belief by buying ethereum classic. That’s exactly what
entrepreneur Barry Silbert, a heavyweight in bitcoin circles,
did. “Keep in mind, the original chain is ethereum classic,” he
says. “The fork is ethereum.” Putting his money where his mouth
is, Silbert’s firm, Grayscale Investments, recently issued an
investment thesis outlining the benefits to ethereum classic
over ethereum. A section heading sums up the rationale: “The DAO
and the Death of Principles.”
Alexis Roussel, co-founder of Bity.com, a digital currency
broker in Switzerland, still marvels at the aftereffects of the
hard fork and the wild world of the blockchain. “This is
something that doesn’t happen in traditional finance,” he says.
“If something happens with Apple, you don’t suddenly have a
clone of Apple.”
 
 
It’s been about a year since the DAO attack, enough time to take
stock of what went wrong.
Van de Sande is eager to move on. “It was really just a
blip,” he says. “We are ready to move past it and leave the DAO
story behind us.”
Green, who’s organizing an ethereum conference at this
summer’s Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, has kept a
sense of humor about it. “The Robin Hood group was just a s---
show,” he says with a laugh. “I hope the movie portrays it
better than it actually was.”
As for the bug itself, apparently many smart people looked
at the code before Gün but missed one major flaw. The order of
commands in the code allowed DAO token holders to withdraw any
profit they’d made from their investments. It reads
“withdrawRewardFor(msg.sender)” and adds, almost improbably, a
note to anyone reading the code that says, “be nice, and get his
rewards.” That’s line 667—let’s call it “The Neighbor of the
Beast Bug.” If the withdraw line had come after these lines:
 
totalSupply -= balances[msg.sender];
balances[msg.sender] = 0;
paidOut[msg.sender] = 0;
return true;
 
the attack wouldn’t have been possible, Jentzsch says. But if
the code had been in the correct order, the reward parameter
wouldn’t have worked. As for the note, this line of code was
meant to allow investors to withdraw any profit—“Reward”—their
investments had earned. Instead it became one of the biggest
backdoors in hacking history. It would have been better to not
pay rewards during the split function from the DAO, what we’ve
been referring to here as the escape pods, according to
Jentzsch. Another decision he made when he had no idea of the
bug shows how quirky and unforgiving code can be. “If the
capital ‘T’ in line 666 had been a small ‘t,’ that would also
have prevented the hack,” he says.
Jentzsch has many regrets but insists no one was aware of
the specific problems in lines 666-667 (other observers had
pointed to flaws in other lines, just not here). Had more people
looked, “it would have made no difference at all,” he says. “If
you don’t know what to look for in a security audit, you won’t
find it.”
Even Gün, who had it in his grasp, let it go. “I still
missed it,” he says. Green’s emotions are still raw related to
Gün. “I actually got really pissed at him about this,” Green
says. “He started bragging about how he found the bug.” He adds
that it was “very irresponsible of him to not tell anyone of his
inkling.” Still, Green “respects the hell out of Gün” and says
they’ve since made amends.
Asked to recount that night last June as he lay sick in
bed, Gün says, “I came away from this thinking there’s
potentially an issue.” But he’d consulted Daian, his grad
student (“whom I trust”). Daian had said it’s “not exploitable.”
Gün says that had he been certain of the danger, “I would have
told people.”
In a blog post that explained the mechanics of the DAO
heist Daian published the night of the attack, he gave a
shoutout to his professor in the acknowledgments. “Gün, we were
so damn close—sorry it wasn’t quite enough this time :),” Daian
wrote.
As for the attacker (whoever he or she or they are) and the
ethereum classic booty, Gün says, “Great, wonderful, he should
cash out.” The hard fork proved it wasn’t just the DAO that
needed to be fixed, but the ethereum blockchain itself. He says:
“The fault lies somewhere on the system side as well.”
But the fear that smart contracts are too clever by half
and that by extension so is the ethereum blockchain
itself—prevalent in the days following the DAO attack—has
dissipated. At least that’s the market’s verdict, judging by the
price of ether. After the attack, it traded from $10 to $12 for
about nine months. Then in March it took off; it’s valued at
$341.19 as of June 12. (That would have valued the DAO at $4.1
billion, but let’s not even go there.)
Ethereum classic has risen as well, and it now trades for
$18.71. Both versions of ether remain viable, in other words.
The thief holds one; the revisionists, the other. Going forward,
the choice is really: Whom would you rather believe?
Since the hard fork, the attacker ended up making off with
his ethereum classic. That means he got away with about $67.4
million, assuming the stash hasn’t been sold. Not too shabby,

personalfinance,Plan to transfer schools due to expenses. Worth it?,"I'm currently going to a private college in which it costs 13,000 a semester. 
I originally went to a state college for Mechanical Engineering Technology and was getting money back from federal grants and what not. But that's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to become a Mechanical Engineer not MET. So I found the nearest school near me that offered ME, 10 minutes away, but was very costly and I didn't want to go on the train so city college wasn't an option. A year later I have a good internship for my field in the city and realized trains aren't that bad. So now I'm more than eager to go to city college which is literally half of what I have to pay currently for school.
If this internship ends, currently it states in the contract that this is at will, and I go to city college I will still be able to go to school. 
If this internship ends while going to the private college I will have to take out more loans. 

I know the obvious answer is to transfer to city college for money savings, but I just want some advice here what I should tell my parents. 
They are old school so education is EVERYTHING to them and they are already upset that I lost a year from transferring once already. Not sure if I'm losing any time but transferring again yet, but finding out next week. 
My father is very dominant over my mother and he takes care of all the money and he's very bad at managing it. He keeps telling me he will take care of the loans but I really don't trust him with any sorts of finance issues.

What can I tell him to make him accept that transferring would be better? 
I want to transfer because of the money. My sister went to a private college and is in 100k of debt, just for her BS, I do not want be there there. I'm currently near 15-20k in debt and don't want it to build. I just don't want to disappoint my parents but I want to look out for my future as well.

personalfinance,Had to drop out of college and in confusing debt mess.,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I live in the Midwest and due to a chain of bad decision making and bad luck I'm in a bit of a debt pickle. 

I was paying my college tuition by working for the college and using my stipend to cover the bulk of my tuition cost while working nights as an Uber driver in addition to working an internship in a nearby city.  Against better judgement I had to put my textbooks on my credit card while I awaited for my FAFSA for the semester to be approved however it never got approved and by the time it was denied I was two weeks into the semester and it was going to cost me more to drop out than to stay in because I would have lost my stipend if I dropped out. 

Fast forward a few months and the semester burned me out I fell behind in my academics and then had a major concussion just before the end of my semester and had to take Is in my classes and take of work for 4 weeks. 

I work 40 hours a week at my internship and take home around $340 a week on average. 

I currently owe my University directly $1,600 from medical bills, excess tuition costs that my stipend didn't cover and about $300 of it is in late payment fees. 
I have $1,200 (25% April) in credit card debt from putting living costs and textbooks on to it during the semester
Owe $2,900 on my car (6%apr) and pay $150 per month for insurance
Have $460 from medical bills at a debt collector that is already on my credit history. 
Have $3,500 in federal student loans from my previous semester that are about to go into repayments. 
Phone bill is around $60 per month. 
Rent is $400 a month
I don't have any health insurance​ and I live in this country alone so don't have any parents health insurance to go under or place to move to for free rent. 

I mostly just pay my rent, car repayments, minimum balance on the credit, card, phone bill, and food ect right now. I try to live as frugal as I can and don't ever eat out. My car is getting to 200,000 miles and is not really suitable for Uber driving anymore. 

My internship ends at the end of the month and lease the end of next month. Due to bad credit rating (610 plus derogatory mark) and not having anyone to co-sign on loans, I'm at a loss as to how best to deal with this debt and how to find somewhere new to live. I understand the amount really isn't that much but it really feels it right now.

ethereum,"A message to Bancor critics concerned about the rapid growth of Ethereum who make statements such as ""We deserve a crash"" - includes an Economics lesson","I'm not linking the user or the post, but in this sub a user made the statement, ""We deserve a crash. This is abhorrent."" First of all, depressions (price crashes) happen when people stop spending and hoard their currency; so long as currency flows, it helps stimulate and grow the economy wherever it flows to. In times of severe economic stagnation and crises, the economy can be stimulated by literally burying money and paying people to dig it back up. *There's nothing wrong with large sums of money changing hands*, and it is actually better for the economy for this to happen than for large sums of money to be stuffed in the mattresses of a few wealthy individuals or to inflate the price of a *scarce physical asset*. For example, driving up the price of a single Van Gogh to $10 trillion would be insane because there's likely no one else who has the money to buy it from you at that price. But as *currencies*, especially virtual currencies, are fungible and exchangeable and divisible and **liquid**, this concern does not apply. The only big risk of, say, the Yen skyrocketing in value relative to other currencies in a short period would be if holders of Yen couldn't spend that money fast enough, if they couldn't keep that currency flowing, and would end up hoarding it or stuffing it in mattresses because they can't or won't buy anything with it.

Statements such as ""We deserve a crash"", when believed and repeated, are what cause panics and depressions. And remember, there's always someone looking to profit from decreased prices by shorting the very asset they criticize. Negativity becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Second, compared to a lot of Silicon Valley investments, $150 million to Bancor is quite conservative, no matter how buggy it is. Bancor having 0.5% of Ethereum in existence is pretty meaningless when you factor in the massive amount of Ethereum that will come into existence soon with the literally 1 million+ GPUs that are joining pools just this month. The market doesn't have a problem with Facebook, et al, dropping $1 billion on Whatsapp, Twitch, Snapchat, etc., and the potential payoff for Ethereum ventures is much larger. Technical analyses that suggest that P/E ratios for such ventures are 'too high' simply are not pertinent short and medium term in a post-2008 world where Central Banks are desperately trying to keep currency from stagnation that would result in a severe depression.

This is a new industry, talent and skills are in very limited supply, so people with talent and skills can command a very high price. Investors know that Ethereum isn't the ultimate final solution for cryptocurrencies, they know this is an iterative development process, and the best way to increase the talent and skills in this field is by flushing it with cash to attract, train, and retain new talent. Investors who fund Ethereum ventures will be best positioned, have the best relationships and talent stack and knowledge to capitalize on the next wave of development, which will be in the magnitude of $Trillions. Even if Ethereum totally vaporizes, it will be worth it for many investors as the learning experience will make the next wave that much better. In other words, that cliche ""Failure is success"" really does apply here, so long as you are an investor with a diverse portfolio who doesn't bankrupt himself betting on Ethereum. And don't get me wrong here, there will certainly be a good number of Ethereum ventures that are massively profitable for current investors, but there will also be failures, but overall this will be worth it for the industry.

Third, to critics who are concerned of possible SEC regulation: have you paid any attention to this administration at all? *The Trump administration will not pile restrictive regulations on crypto.* Even if there is some massive crash that puts a regulation-happy Democratic administration back in power, it will still take a long time for regulators to learn about this field and what needs to be done and what can be done. This is new territory, and we're looking at at least a decade of Wild West before anything can or will be done at all on the regulatory side. And the severe Dodd-Frank banking regulations implemented after the 2008 crash are what spurred the development of Crypto in the first place. *Capital will always want to be as free as it can be*, and if Capital has to spend a lot of Capital to be more free then it will. 

So long as interests rates are low and regulations are costly and prohibitive, there's not much to lose by transferring wealth from banks to crypto. In fact, central banks set low interest rates specifically to motivate wealthy investors to spend that money on something, anything, to stimulate the economy or else see their stored valued inflated away. You take the risk and spend the money, or your wealth is naturally redistributed by inflation, because, again, it is better for the central banks and the economy as a whole for currency to flow than to pool and stagnate. So long as currency flows, employees stay employed, keeping their work and social skills (and resumes) fresh and learning new ones as they go; when currency stagnates, employees are laid off and sit at home while their skills deteriorate, waiting for stagnant capital to get around to spending it again. In other words, the societal and economic cost of shutting down and restarting operations tends to exceed the cost of running a loss in the short-term.

Even at current high prices, the market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum barely breaks $100 Billion. According to the Panama Papers and various other analyses and investigations, there are *tens of trillions* of dollars stashed in offshore tax havens. Crypto currencies are a way for that wealth to be quietly repatriated, to flow once more in developed economies, without suffering a heavy tax or regulatory burden. Long-term is all upside, but to get there the space needs a ton of capital in the short-term. Even if Bancor turns to vapor, which I highly doubt, we will learn a lot about what we need to do better next time, *and that knowledge is* **priceless**.",cryptocurrency

But with the interest rate going from the current 19% all the way down to 6.99% or 8.99% (depending on what my credit qualifies me for), my same payments will make MUCH larger dents in the principal.  

So, to my question: My Fico shows me 716, according to Capital One's free FICO score.  My Vantage 3.0 score gives me 716 through Transunion, and 727 through Equifax (as presented by Credit Karma).  I know that anything about 700 is considered ""good"".  But I've heard that 720 is sort of the ""target"" good score.  

Would I be better off holding off one month on this lower interest loan?  My credit utilization is at 13%.  I could have that near zero in a month or so.  Credit Karma estimates that would provide me with a Transunion Vantage 3.0 score of 732.

Is there any major chance that a score that much higher might qualify me for the lower of the two rates?",finance
investing,Myth: /r/investing won't believe shitty buzzfeed-like analysis of stock market returns.,"Inspired by [this amazing analysis!](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6gunbv/myth_stocks_are_overvalued/) 


The analysis grabs your attention with an amazing ""fact"", as clear as daylight

&gt; Fact: Stocks remain attractively valued. 


He then proceeds with some other facts: 


&gt; Everyone likes to talk about PE ratios, but not too much mention is made of interest rates. Interest rates are just as important as earnings when we assess equity market valuations. And one of the most popular benchmarks for interest rates is the current rate offered on the US 10-year Treasury Bond.
In this 15-year visual comparison of the US 10yr rate vs. the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield, we can see that the premium between the two is currently larger today than it was during 2002 thru 2006 (which many consider to be a time of more ""normal"" markets). That is, given today's interest rate environment and the current earnings associated with the S&amp;P 500, stocks are actually less expensive today when compared to the pre-recession markets.

and rambles about stocks being ""less expensive"" because the equity yield premium was 3%. As a ""proof"" he gives **1-y return** for 3 data points ... and correlates them with their respective **10-y equity premiums**. Makes *perfect* sense.


I found it funny and decided to test the theory in practice. I calculated the 10-y equity premiums (10-y bond yields - trailing year equity yield) using data from [this website](http://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year), and plotted it against the S&amp;P 500 10-y inflation adjusted return (dividends reinvested) for the period 1970-2017. 


[Here is the result:](http://imgur.com/a/vAyFL). The 10-y equity premiums has a 5% correlation, less then an alphabetical selection of stocks. Shiller P/E (and also the inverse, the yield) has a 56% correlation, which is still flawed, but at least exists.

personalfinance,Struggling to understand my tax situation and stressing way more than I should,"Hi PF. I consider myself pretty good with money, but sometimes I stress a little more than needed.

I've got a good job offer on the table right now and with another interview today, hopefully a better offer. Regardless of the outcome, I will be going from a Contracted position to a W-4'd salaried position, should be making notably more (33% raise or so) and I am stressing about my taxes. By all means this is nothing but positive and I'll be paying 7% less in taxes by getting half my FICA stuff covered as well. But of course I'm still worried.

A few things I'm concerned about

I already have a good bit saved up during when I was contracted. Doing my napkin math and such it seems like I'm close to the amount I should be at. How can I make sure a bunch extra isn't withheld from this new job? I've heard that sometimes a lot extra will be withheld because the IRS thinks you have to ""catch up"" - I don't need to catch up as I've been witholding on my own. I've been making estimated tax payments, but only small amounts because apparently due to taking this contract this year and being W-4 last year, my burden is different? Either way, I've got the money. 

Is there a good way for me to be able to predict my tax burden? I've seen the IRS withholding calculator but I must be using it wrong because I'm struggling to get it working in my specific scenario? (Is this calc FICA and Federal taxes or just federal? It's hard to get the numbers this calculator wants since I don't get paystubs (nothing getting withheld anyways))

Should I really claim 2? What do you guys do?

Honestly I'm not worried if I end up owing $2,000, I can make that work. I've gone months on ramen before, I can do another month. I just want to know what to expect because this situation seems complicated and nothing seems to make it clear for me. I can't budget for something when I don't know what the hell to expect. Right now I'm choosing death over the taxes part

personalfinance,Paying off mortgage fast,"Hello PF!

My wife and I are about to purchase our first apartment, and are really excited! Loans and everything related to the purchase, we have organized, but I was looking for input on advantages/disadvantages to paying off the mortgage more quickly than required.

To give some context: we live in a country where interest rates are high (10-11% annual for a 15-year mortgage) and where you can deduct up to 40% of your gross income into accounts available to be used for the monthly payment or paying down principal without any penalty.

Using relatively conservative calculations (assuming annual bonus and any increased income due to raise or other factors not used to pay the apartment), we could pay off the 15-year mortgage fully in 5 years, which would reduce our monthly expenses by 60% or more. We would also save a pretty penny in interest expenses long-term and the reduced tax rate during those 5 years.

The obvious drawback is we would be contributing less to local retirement accounts, although would almost certainly still be able to contribute the maximum to my Vanguard Roth IRA (I am a U.S. citizen, she is not).

We spoke about it, and are thinking of going the aggressive route to pay off quickly. Am I missing anything in this analysis we should have in mind before going in this direction?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Panic... PSLF and Accruing Interest,"The basics:

Graduated from law school last year, have a good job now making just about $63k working for the government. Have about $101,200 in student loan debt.

Got the government job earlier this year, applied for PSLF program, was ""accepted"" - in that tentative way - loans were transferred to Fedloan Servicing. 

My income based repayment plan gives me a monthly payment of $350. 

Since my loans were transferred a month or so ago, I've been keeping an eye on the interest and called today to find out how much is accruing monthly.

This is where the panic comes in.

Interest is about $20 a DAY, around $600 a month. My monthly payments aren't even coming close to covering the ACCRUING interest, never mind starting in on the back owed interest. 

I am no where near convinced that the PSLF program will remain as is for another 9 years and 10 months. I'm terrified that I'm going to be making these monthly payments and after ten years, be on the hook for significantly more than I ever borrowed in the first place.

Obviously if I start paying an extra $300 a month, that's going to seriously slow down my emergency fund savings (just getting off the ground) or any long term house down payment dreams. But the risk that I'll owe upwards of $120k ten years from now and no guarantee that program will be there is terrifying. 


**tl/dr - Am I better off making my minimum monthly payments and trusting in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, or should I be paying at least as much interest that's accruing monthly, almost doubling my monthly payment?**

Thanks so much for any insight. Very terrible feeling after that realization.

I have to make a life decision and hope you can help me :-) I want to buy property and I am unsure weather to include my money in shares for buying a house or to go on full bank credit.

**Circumstances:**

I am 29 year old, living in germany. I graduated from university (master degree, economic computer science) in 2015. Since february 2016 I am working in a 2 billion revenue company as SAP inhouse consultant doing 45.000 EUR Gross (50.500 $) + 5.000 EUR Bonus + Traveling Expenses. I think from November 2017 on I'll get around 65.000 EUR anually (73.000$). 45.000 EUR in germany is around 2300 EUR Net per month (2.600 $). My contract is permanent. I have low interest (0.75%) students debts about 11.000 EUR (12300 $).

I have 25.000 EUR (28.000$) in shares (Alibaba, Amazon, SAP, Robotic ETF) and crypto currencies - adding about 1,2k every month from my income.

My girlfriend is 27 and graduaded in mathematics and religion as a teacher. We are in a relation since 6 years. She works as a substitute teacher doing 1900 EUR (2100$) monthly. Her contract runs until october 2018 - we assume no problems in her getting a new job as a substitute teacher or even as full teacher (then doing 2800 EUR / 3000$ monthly). She has low interest (0.75%) students debts about 15.000 EUR (17000$).

**Property/ Bank Credit:**

We have the chance to buy the house (buidling year 1997) of my parents (Living space 196 m²/ 2100 sqf, Land area 399 m²/ 2300 sqf) for 220.000 EUR (246.500$). The house is very beautiful and was rennovated in 2014 - we love is. Many high quality furnitures are involved like 2 kitchen, couches, chairs...

From bank we need 230.000 to come up with all upcoming costs.
* 50.000 EUR will be fixed interest rate for 10 years at around 1.45% (state supported credit).
* 110.000 EUR will be fixed interest rate for 30 years at around 2.75%.
* 80.000 EUR will be fixed interest rate for 10 years at around 2.7%.

Monthly rate will be 960 EUR / 1100 Dollar.

**Question:**

Although I have no clue about how to finance property I have good knowledge and a natural talent in making money with shares. I feel like I am able to excel the credit interest rate with investing in shares by far. What do you think - from a rational point of view - is it anyways wisely to sell all shares (25.000 EUR) in order to reduce the overall credit amount for the house (monthly payrate stays same) and thus get a better interest rate and finish paying of the house faster? I don't get the math straight whats more likely to be better for me/us.

I just want to get some opinions on if I'm doing this all the right way. I live with my boyfriend who makes 3x what I do, so I pay a flat rate to him which covers my share of rent/utilities/etc. I do have a long commute to work, which is unavoidable for the time being.

Gross income: $3233/Month

TSP Roth: $330/Month (roughly 15% of my base pay), Currently @ $2400

Private Roth: $150/Month, Currently @$3300

Private student loan: $3900 owed @ 5% variable, paying $242/Month ($80 above minimum, and being military, the interest rate can't go above 6%)

Federal student loan: $7500 owed @ 4.5% fixed, paying $120/Month ($25 above minimum)

Credit card: $6200 owed at 0% for the next 12 months, paying $300/Month ($250 above minimum)

Rent/Utilities: $350/Month (roughly one-third of total bills)

Gas: ~$300/Month


Questions: I'd really like to get that credit card debt knocked out... should I withdrawal from my IRA's to pay that down? I know there's some mixed opinions floating around on this method.... Or should decrease my IRA contributions to focus on my credit card since it is 0% interest for the next year? Any advice or guidance is appreciated!

personalfinance,I need a savings account I cant touch,"Basically. I come from a family with bad financial know-how. I am trying to be better but its not working. I can put money away and still get by just fine... And I can keep to a budget if I have no choice. 

So i want to save for my future starting now. About 10k to start. I need a place to save it where I can put it back and not touch it. Hell i could probably save that in two or three years if I could get some control. I don't really have massive expenses compared to my income. I am just absolute shit at remaining mindful about what I am doing and spending.

Its not a wedding I am saving for or a vacation... But it needs to be in that vein where I can access it when i reach my goal and its time to do this thing.

Help?

Edit:: 

State of my finances is.... Well based on hourly x 2080. Subtracted taxes with the logic of ""Say I max out my tax bracket state and federal"". And got ss, med and local tax. Subracted rent, util, car and ins. Wrote in zeroing out the cc and paying one overdue bill (been working on both).... Anyway after all that I have 12k a year I don't really need. 

I don't mention food or gas because my shift diff covers that without taking me into the next tax bracket. 

So yeah. I have 12k a year left over and am still living paycheck to paycheck. Its really just tiny amounts of overspending each paycheck but I have á really hard time being mindful of it.",finance
personalfinance,Best way to utilize my money for graduate school (CAN),"hi guy,
I will be attending a 1 year masters program at Queens university, in Ontario Canada in September. The cost of the program is about 12,000 not including books. OSAP ( a student ontario loan program) has giving me 9 thousand in grant money and about 11 thousand in loan money. The 11 thousand in loan money will have a 1% interest rate after 6 months of graduating (before that nothing.) The grant money is money I do not have to repay.

After figuring out the numbers, after I pay for tuition I am left with about 600$ a month, I have a car payment and insurance which cost about 400$ a month, so with OSAP alone I am left with 200$ a month to pay for rent, cell phone and ect. Obviously this isn't enough so I met with my bank today and they said I would be approved for a student line of credit of 45 thousand, at 4.7 percent interest on what I use. I would only pay interest payments while in school and one year after school, after that 1% of my line of credit would be added to my monthly payments.

I am trying to figure out the best way to use all my financial resources while ending up with the least amount of debt. For example should I use my student line of credit to pay for school and use my grant money to pay the interest payments while in school? any advice would be beneficial.

I don't plan on working while in school because I need to maintain a certain average to stay in the program, but like I said its only a one year program so i hope to be making money shortly after.
Sorry this is so long

personalfinance,22 years old and I want a down payment for a house in 5 years.,"**Background:**

22 years old

Graduated college in May 2016

Currently living with parents

Make $61,000 a year with a 3%-7% bonus

Contributing 7% of salary to 401k

Around $9,000 in checking account

Have $3,000 in a personal investment account

$14,000 in student loan debt (~ 3.74% interest rate)

Credit score ~ 720



**Current Situation:**

Paying $1,750 towards the student loans.  On pace to be debt free by January 2018.

Keeping a rather large balance in checking for personal reasons.  Have an old car that is running rough and mentally prefer to have a larger than necessary cushion in case something comes up.  I will dip into this in December 2017 to pay off the last of my loans.

Currently contributing around $300 - $500 to personal investment account.  With the interest rates on the student loans being so low and as a finance guy with an interest in the market, I prefer to invest this rather than contribute more towards the loans.

Once debt is paid off, I plan to be moving to a high cost of living city in the Spring of 2018.  Rent will be around $1,200.



**Future Situation/Questions:**

What is the best way to plan or begin saving for a sizeable down payment on a house?  

Should I forecast my future expected after-tax income and expenses to get a rough estimate of how much I could save a year towards a down payment?

On Friday, June 2nd, 2017, the Non-Farm Employment Change was released. This is the official net number of U.S. jobs that were created in the month of May. It was expected at 181K  but came in at 138K, quite a drop. This number has the possibility of affecting future interest rate decisions by the Fed. It is still expected that the Fed will increase rates during their June meeting but future hikes could now be put on hold because of this number. The job participation rate also decreased, another negative factor for future rate hikes. This all indicated at least a temporary fall in the U.S. dollar. I coupled some of this weak dollar info with the fact that the markets seem to be anticipating the ECB to be changing their policy in turning off their printing presses soon, this indicated a stronger Euro. I placed a long EUR/USD trade for 12 pips, far shorter than it actually went. If I had noticed the info in the participation rate dropping earlier, I would have stayed in longer.

personalfinance,"How much would I need in monthly income to cover at least as much as I get currently through Medicare/Medicaid/Disability/SSI/FoodStamps? And should I keep Medicare, or buy something else?","I hate being on Disability and being relegated to poverty just so that I can see the doctors I need to see. (Even being on Federal Disability, many doctors who take Medicare won't take you as a patient if you are also poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, because they can't legally demand payment for the 20% that Medicare doesn't cover.) I'd like to try and figure out exactly what my baseline goal would be to no longer be dependent on poverty to get full comprehensive medical coverage. 

I do not receive any housing subsidies, and pay my own rent outright.

If I manage to generate more than $600 of monthly earned income regularly and am no longer eligible for Disability, I will retain Medicare for roughly 8 years. After that, I will have to option to buy it outright. Medicaid, however, might disappear as soon as I am working again, and I'd have to buy a good Medigap plan to cover what Medicaid used to. (I'd like to ignore the notion of free Medicare for the time being, and figure out how much I'll need in the long term.)

My current monthly income is as follows:

$704  - Social Security

$138  - SSI

$180  - Food stamps


This is not enough to survive on, clearly.

The SSA.gov and Medicare.gov sites have different information, but lets round up and assume that the cost for buying medical coverage myself would be roughly:

Medicare Part A = $450

Medicare Part B = $150


This brings me to needing a minimum of $1,622 to cover my existing costs.

However, Medicare only covers 80% of my medical costs, so I'd still have to buy a Medigap plan to cover the 20% that remains. Straight Medicare is taken by most of the specialists I need to see in NYC (I need spinal fusion and other surgeries).

There's also Medicare Part C, or a Medicare Advantage Plan, which is a private company handling what is generally covered by Medicare A and B. I'm not sure if that would be smarter in the long run or not.

There's also the question of taxes, which I am currently too poor to pay. If I were making income, I'd have to pay income tax, I'm assuming, which I'd have to factor in.

Are there any elements I am not factoring in? Are there any cost saving measures that I'm not aware of that I could employ? 

I'm hoping to put together a life plan to get out of this situation, but I cannot put my medical coverage in jeopardy whatsoever.

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans with 401k loan - Dumb?,"Hello Personal Finance! Long time lurker, first time poster. I have what is hopefully a simple question. 

I have 5 remaining student loans with Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) with a total remaining balance of ~$12,600. The interest rate ranges from 4.25% to 6.55%. 

Would it be silly to take a loan from my 401k @ 4.0% to pay off the student loans? This way the interest is being reinvested instead of paid to Navient. I would borrow ~10,000 and use money from my savings account to cover the remaining. I would still have an emergency fund as well so no worries there. 

The benefits I see are a lower interest rate, quicker time to payoff (current estimate is 2025, new would be 5 years sooner).

personalfinance,Debt confusion: snowball vs avalanche clarification,"I am a little confused about the best debt pay down strategy is. From what I read, there is really little difference, but I just want to make sure of this point:

Say you have one balance at a high interest rate, but say the balance is low (such as 1000 at 6%) and another debt with a much higher balance and lower interest rate, (14000 at 3.5%).

In this case, lowest balance (snowball) and highest interest (avalanche) would both say pay the first debt. However, is there a case you would pay down the second one first, since the amount of interest on such a high balance accrues in a much larger amount? 

If the balances are roughly the same with different interest rates, I can see how the strategy comes into play. However with such unequal balances I feel like a much larger balance, even with a low interest rate, could actually surpass a low balance/high interest rate accrual. 

I would like clarification because I am having a hard time figuring out how to work it out myself. Side note, if I were to practice this in excel or mathematically by hand, what formulas do I use? I have a hard time understanding compound interest (daily vs APY). Like is a rate is 3.5% compounded daily, what does that mean?",finance

Bitcoin,Bitsquare will support UASF Bitcoin not BitMainCoin,"Today **Bitmain** release a [**blog post**](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/uahf-contingency-plan-uasf-bip148/) about their plans how to deal with a UASF fork. Here is another good summary of Jimmay Song: https://medium.com/@jimmysong/examining-bitmains-press-release-6b47b0646f15

This announcement of Bitmain is **great news for Bitcoin** as it removes a lot of uncertainty and give a lot of support for the UASF side. So Bitmain has become the biggest supporters for UASF by making it easier for those who would have preferred a more cautious and conservative approach (supporters of BIP149 like me) to get a more clear position.

Why? Because the hard-fork which will very likely happen and the included features like 8 MB blocks (or even unlimited block size) as well as the heavily Bitcoin Unlimited influenced road map is a very drastic divergence from the current version of Bitcoin. Not to talk about the unhealthy influence of a monopolistic ASIC and mining company who have proofed many times how damaging they are for Bitcoin (ASICBOOST, Antbleed, empty blocks, blocking SegWit,...).

As it is a hard fork it is also much more clear which of both coins (if both should survive) **will be considered the real Bitcoin and which one the Altcoin**.
Theoretically the unchanged Bitcoin chain might be a valid alternative as well (and the real Bitcoin), but it can be assumed it will not get sufficient support to survive and would be vulnerable to the wipe-out risk as well as replay attacks.

**So that reduces the choices to 2 options:**
- Bitmain Coin (Hardfork with 8MB blocks and BU road map)
- UASF Bitcoin (original Bitcoin with enforced SegWit activation)

Should be an easy choice for most readers. 
SegWit itself has an overwhelming support. Only the way and strategy how to activate it was not supported so widely. That is now out of question as not supporting UASF means to support Bitmain. You cannot be neutral or passive.

There is another important factor. 
The hard fork will require software updates much more extensive than the UASF version bit change. Beside risks, that will mean that all agnostic, neutral and passive users or companies will likely go with UASF as he least disruptive, expensive and risky option.
Same is true for SPV wallets. **BitcoinJ** which is used for Bitsquare has a check for the block size and **will reject the Bitmain chain**. So we have less troubles with a potential mess of mixed chains.

Thought there are still many other **open problems and risks**.
We can expect that Bitmain will use its hash power to attack the UASF chain if they feel need for that. 
This might lead to all kind of unpleasant situations like long confirmation times, unclear amount of confirmations to be considered safe, very volatile tx fees and more. It is also not clear which forms of attacks can occur and how to protect users from those (e.g. Bitmain could silently mine on UASF and then make huge re-orgs, invalidating a lot of blocks and if the Fiat/Altcoin side has been settled it would lead to a BTC buyer who has lost his BTC. For an exchange that means undefined and uncontrollable risks (also on the legal side). 
Beside the risks there would be likely a huge effort for support and arbitration which would kick us back with our road map. 

For all those reasons **we need to halt trading on Bitsquare** by revoking the 2 arbitrator nodes (both are run by me). Users cannot take an offer or create an offer if there is no arbitrator available. 

**But no worry we have an exit strategy!**

With the next release we will support [**multiple base currencies**](https://forum.bitsquare.io/t/network-of-exchanges-other-altcoins-as-base-currency/2117). So the user can choose which base currency or market he or she wants to use. Currently it is only Bitcoin, then it will be **Bitcoin**, **Litecoin** and **Doge**. **Dash** is planned as well but requires more effort. Namecoin still has not P2SH but will added as soon that is implemented. All the other interesting coins which are very different to Bitcoin cannot be added soon as it requires a lot of development effort, but it is planned for the future to extend it to those as well.
We started with those which caused the least effort and Litecoin has sufficient liquidity and hash power to be considered a realistic alternative.

By using another coin as base currency Bitsquare is not dependent on what is going on the Bitcoin block chain anymore and all the problems which might arise from the fork sceanrios are out of system, similar to the banking system or other altcoins. The selection of Bitcoin will be possible but arbitrator will only start to register once the situation is settled and can be considered safe again. Might be in 1 week, might be in 3 months, who knows...
 
So people can **trade both the UASF Bitcoin and the BitMainCoin against LTC or DOGE in Bitsquare**.
The traders are responsible for themselves how to deal with any possible risk and problems when sending the Bitcoin. It is just another altcoin and the selected base currency (LTC or DOGE) is the currency which provides the security by utilizing features like MultiSig. Bitsquare does not know anything about the Bitcoin network in such a case.

There is the question **how to name those competing chains**.
I would suggest to keep the ticker **BTC** for the **UASF Bitcoin** and use the UASF in brackets as post fix to make it more explicit (e.g. BTC -Bitcoin (UASF).
For the Bitmain coin I would suggest either BMC or BUC (Bitcoin Unlimited Coin). 
Be assured the selection for the ticker BUC has nothing to do with the many bugs the Bitcoin Unlimited devs have produced in the past. ;-)

Ready now to add the UASF prefix to the [Bitsquare twitter handle](https://twitter.com/bitsquare_).

personalfinance,Received a very generous post college graduation gift and unsure how to best use it,"I've read a few posts about how to handle receiving money but was hoping to get some more specific advice. My wonderful great aunt recently gifted me 10,000 dollars as a post-graduation gift and I am unsure how to best save or invest this money in a responsible way.

 I am lucky and have a relatively small amount of student debt as compared to my peers ($12,000 in federal debt, so not too bad of an interest rate) and a car loan (need my car for commuting to my new job that is not accessible by public transportation so selling is not an option) that is $10,000 for the next 5 years. 

I will be starting to work full time in July and have already budgeted for both payments so I could easily continue to do that without putting money towards either of these loans, but also know it might be best to pay these off while I have the means? Or would it be best to be putting this money in savings/investing (my Aunt told me to think about an IRA but I don't know much about how those work).

personalfinance,"CP2000 Bill from IRS for $8,865 on $20,971 eBay sales from 2015. I claimed $11,775 (actual profit) as income on my 1040, so I'm not sure how to dispute this double-dipping bill. Help?","Long-time lurker, never thought I'd post in Personal Finance (or Reddit) at all, but I'm in a bit of a pickle and I've always respected the advice I've seen given here, so here we go.

For all of 2015, I was unemployed, so I sold a lot of my stuff on eBay to pay the rent, bills, etc. I kept a spreadsheet of all the sales and made sure to track any expenses related to the sales (fees, shipping costs, material costs, equipment costs) so that when tax time came I could accurately report what I made. The vast majority of items sold were things I had been given or purchased through the previous 7 years at my job, although there were a few items (5 I can recall) purchased specifically during the year to resell at a profit, on which I made less than $1,000 in profit.

I can get more detailed if needed, but when all was said and done, I made $11,775 in profit which I reported in my 2015 1040 on line 21 as ""Other Income"" and more specifically, HobbyIncome. I had some capital gains and dividends, bringing my total income on line 22 as $13,688. After taking the standard deduction of $6300 and following the rest of the instructions on lines 41 and 42, my line 43 ""Taxable Income"" was $3,388 and I ended up paying $149 in federal taxes. 

This seemed like a low amount, but as I hadn't made much for the year and the tax software I used (eSmart Tax Free File Edition) indicated a low risk for being audited, I went about my merry way.

Until the hammer dropped yesterday when I received a CP2000 Notice from the IRS indicating I owed $8,865 due to changes they were suggesting for my 2015 return. Paypal filed a 1099-k reporting my gross income as $20,971 for the year, which the IRS updated my return to include, thus changing my taxable income from $3,388 to $22,045. This changed the tax I would have owed from $149 to $7185 and with penalties and interest, the IRS is now saying I owe $8,865.

This seems absolutely crazy to me. I reported the income I made from my eBay sales, but it seems clear that the IRS thinks I didn't report that money at all. The updated bill also has that I'm being charged a ""self-employment tax"" (line 57) of $4,627, which seems ludicrous for having sold a bunch of personal possessions on eBay.

I intend to dispute this by sending back the Response form along with a signed statement and documentation supporting my claim, but I'm really looking for help on the best way to do this. Do I need to consult an accountant or tax specialist? Would documentation would actually help?

Any advice at all would be appreciated and I'll make sure to monitor this post closely so I can update with any other info you folks might think would help. 

Thanks in advance and sorry if I'm posting ""wrong"" or anything, first timer on Reddit.",finance

investing,Myth: Treasury Bonds will NOT protect against equity drawdowns going forward,"Fact: Treasury Bonds are the ultimate safe-haven asset 

.... 

There's been a lot of talk lately about the viability of Treasury Bonds, and whether or not these instruments will provide the typical protection they've offered in the past during equity meltdowns.  Just as we see in the stock market, there is no shortage of Treasury bears who are convinced the Treasury bubble is real and that investors need to get ""creative"" re: fixed income going forward, in order to generate similar returns in balanced portfolios and/or protect against future equity drawdowns.  As we dive into the data, this couldn't be further from the truth ...

In the past [90 calendar years](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html), there have been:

* 24 years stocks (as measured by the S&amp;P 500) lost value

* 15 years bonds (as measured by the US 10yr) lost value

* 53 years stocks and bonds both gained value

* 3 years stocks and bonds both lost value (!) 

The immediate item to notice here is the overwhelmingly strong negative correlation between stocks and bonds over the last century ... ~ 4% of calendar years show negative returns between both asset classes.  This is tremendous long-term negative correlation, which is mainly driven by institutional money flows and not likely to change going forward.  

But the Treasury bears will immediately point to the fact that we are coming off of a ZIRP environment for only the 2nd time in the last 100 years, and that all bets are off .... this again, is a myth .... let's take a look at the only other time we've been in this interest rate environment:

The only other time in modern history the Fed brought interest rates to zero was following the Great Depression.  The fed funds rate was at or near zero for roughly ~ 15 years following the Depression (1933-1948).  Following the Great Depression and during this multi-decade period of rising interest rates, the worst 5-year period for Treasury bonds was from 1955 thru 1959 (Treasury bonds provided a negative return in 4 of these 5 years).  Here are the US 10yr Treasury Bond returns, and the associated S&amp;P 500 returns, for those 5 years:

1955: US 10YR T-BOND -1.34%; S&amp;P 500 32.60%

1956: US 10YR T-BOND -2.26%; S&amp;P 500 7.44%

1957: US 10YR T-BOND  6.8%; S&amp;P 500 -10.46%

1958: US 10YR T-BOND -2.10%; S&amp;P 500 43.72%

1959: US 10YR T-BOND -2.65%; S&amp;P 500 12.06%

First thing we notice?  *During the worst 5-year period in modern history for US Treasury Bonds, a period where 80% of calendar years were associated with negative returns, the Treasury market STILL provided upside protection during the one single year equities experienced a drawdown.*  This is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the current interest rate environment DOES NOT MATTER.  The negative correlation is perpetual and on a year-by-year basis is extraordinarily strong.  

Furthermore:  A balanced 60/40 portfolio returned ~ 9% CAGR during 1955 thru 1959--meaning even though treasuries shit the bed in terms of total return, stocks picked it up on their end and investors with a typical balanced portfolio (you know the types of portfolios that people are told today won't work?) did *just fine* during the worst era ever for Treasury bonds.

I received this comment in my post the other day that was so widely loved by this sub, and I hope the person doesn't mind me using it here.  The commenter said:

&gt; If that's the case, how should the fact that we are coming off a 30 year bond bull market affect the assumption?

&gt; If it is fair to assume bonds no longer are the obvious alternative investment (but perhaps they are), wouldn't that throw a wrench in using interest rates in any calculation of market value? 

There is certainly no shortage of Treasury bears who like to point to this as the ultimate crushing blow to anyone suggesting Treasuries (and specifically, long term treasuries) still hold a valuable place in a portfolio of financial assets.  But the SAME EXACT message was being presented to us prior to 2008.  There had been a 25+ year bull market in bonds leading up to 2008, yet when equities shit the bed having their worst year in over half a century, here is what the Treasury market did:

SHY (1-3 year): 6.6%

IEF (7-10 year): 17.9%

TLH (10-20 year): 20.1%

TLT (20-30 year): 33.8%

Again, defying all odds and analyst predictions, the Treasury market came to the rescue during a complete and epic meltdown in the equity market. And anyone exposed to the Treasury market during 2008 certainly had an easier time riding out the economic shit storm that ensued (side note to anyone trying to call tops in the equity market: bull markets do not die of old age).   

Finally, here is the latest correlation data [between stocks and bonds](https://imgur.com/a/h3AKv) over the last 6 months .... Rates are at generational lows and equities are smashing nominal record highs with every passing day .... yet the negative correlation persists!  This 100-year trend of negative correlation is unlikely to change anytime in the foreseeable future.  So stop allocating capital based on the idea that it *might*.

**Conclusion:**

**Will the real total returns associated with Treasury bonds suck going forward?  Almost definitely.**

**Will Treasury bonds still provide the best protection against equity drawdowns going forward?  Almost definitely.**   

**Do we need to get creative to ensure our risk-adjusted returns don't suck going forward?  Almost definitely not.**",finance

The appointment was yesterday, and they claim that on their end, I made 31k and had 3.6 k withheld, while my W-2 from my employer shows I made 33k with 3.9k fed taxes withheld. I thought my tax agent just screwed it up, so they gave me a 1040x to refile. I met with my tax agent today and redownload my W-2. It does show me making 33k with 3.9 withheld, so she said she can't refile and to call my employer and request a new W-2. I called my payroll department and they said do not file a 1040x, the information on your W-2 is 100% correct. What they think happened is the IRS pulled my income information before my last paycheck of the year was deposited. How do I tell this to the IRS and claim my refund?",finance

So. Backstory. Was raised on credit card ""horror stories"" growing up so never got them when I was old enough to apply. Went to college. Accrued some loans (not much, by most people's measurements, but still up there). Where I really messed up was not paying them, until I went active duty and was able to get them deferred. However, they still went as negative statements on my credit report, and I'm waiting for them to update. 

Basically, I started out with no credit, sunk into the negative so to speak, and never knew to open up alternate lines of credit to help mitigate the damage I eventually ended up doing. 

Now I'm at the point where my car, that I own, is pretty much done. My credit score (which is sitting comfortably in the 400s) pretty much won't get me a loan anywhere. So, to those that are more knowledgable, what are my best options? Save up the cash and buy another used car? Not the best, but at least completely owned? Take a less than ideal interest rate, and while I would pay out the nose, at least take steps towards rebuilding my credit? Or another option? 

Would appreciate any helpful advice. Yeah, I know I was irresponsible, partly from ignorance and partly from laziness. But I would like the chance to hopefully start repairing that. Plus it sucks not being able to drive.",finance

And another short term loan, +  overall housing costs/other tuition fees + interest (I am unsure of %) = $8,555 by the end of the semester. The aid from FAFSA didn't even end up going through until that December. I ended up only receiving unsubsidized loans, no grants or anything due to my father's income. I tried scholarships with no luck. I was too scared to pull out so much money being that I was young and didn't even have a job at the time. 

Long story short I attended school for a semester without paying a dime. I applied to several jobs while in school knowing that I would eventually have to pay back this money. My parents were apparently under the impression I was getting some kind of free ride and were of no help at all, even after my dad pushed me to go to college throughout my high school career. I'm not angry with them or myself, it was a long time ago and I don't believe my family's intention was to get me ~$9,000 in debt fresh out of high school. I realize what I basically did was steal, and obviously I regret it. But again, it is what it is so please no judgements.

The 2 loans were taken out in the fall of 2013, which ended up going into default in Jan. of 2014. Consequently, the school assigned (assigned, not sold) it to a debt collection agency whom I did speak with when they first called in the beginning of 2015. They told me I owe ~$11,000 with the collection fees. Being that I had no idea how to talk to the DCA, I set up payments for $100/mo with them (I was making $10/hr at the time). When I got home, my parents freaked out and said I made a mistake- my stepmom ended up calling and cancelling the payments, demanded they send something in the mail validating the debt. I don't remember receiving anything in the mail from them after that, nor have I spoken to one again. I got a few things in the mail from the school, a few emails over the past 3+ years. Other than that, nothing. 

After finally moving out late 2015, I've done my own research about my situation and, yes, I've been procrastinating for too long. From what I understand, this is debt owed to the university, not a federal student loan- meaning it falls under the statute of limitations which is 4 years in texas. 

Recently, I noticed the collection accounts were wiped off my credit bringing it up from a 525 to 700. Sometime later I also received an email from the school stating if I don't pay the past due balance of $8,555 in full by the next 30 days, they will send it back to collections. I believe this is the second time they've sent a letter like this. I'm 22 with no college education, working as a server roughly making $14/hr, living on my own, I just didn't have the money. I called the school yesterday and they said they assigned it to another debt collections office and I would have to go through them to make payments (it hasn't affected my credit yet). 

My boyfriend suggested I send a debt validation letter to the DCA to dispute it but upon further research i'm not sure that's a good idea: 
http://www.avoidbk.com/debt-validation-letter/ 
I even called the bursar office again and they straight up told me they could provide proof of validation meaning disputing it is out of the question.

As you read in the title, my ultimate goal is to go back to school. They are withholding my transcript, rightfully so, preventing me to go back. I'm also trying to avoid making small payments to this debt for god knows how long- I don't really know how much I can even afford. Here are my expenses each month if that helps anyone:

Rent: $625

Electric: $50-60

Renter's insurance: $15.77

Car insurance: $255.86

Phone bill: $70

Credit card payment (gas): ~$100-200

- Any ideas on how I should settle with the debt collection office? 
- Is my best option just to set up a budget for myself and call them to set up a monthly payment plan (the money would only go about 8% towards the actual principle of the loan!!)? 
- Or should I continue what I've been doing and wait it out until it the statute of limitation runs out (which should be beginning of 2018) in hopes of the school waiving it off? (doubtful, I just don't know)
- Is there ANY way I would be able to start over and go back to school? I read that majority of schools report to this thing called the National Student Clearhouse, meaning any other school would have my record being a student back in 2013 at SHSU and ask for my transcript, which obviously I cannot get.

Any ideas of steps I should take to get this huge mountain of shit off my back once and for all, would be great. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Why I am NOT paying off my student loans as fast as I can,"Hello Reddit PF, I notice a lot of posts on here celebrating and talking about paying off student loans as quickly as possible. 

I wanted to present a counter argument to this mindset.

Since graduating and starting work about 2 years ago, I am not paying off my 25k in student loan debt at roughly 4% beyond the monthly minimums. 

Why? a couple reasons

1) Tax deductions on student loan interest
Not only that, but you might also be eligible for a tax deduction on your student loans. You may be able to reduce your taxable income by up to $2,500 depending on your eligibility. Added up over time, that can help make your interest less expensive.

2) Return on my investment has been greater than the interest rate of my loans

Your first consideration is whether or not you can get a better return through investing than you can if you pay down your student loan debt.

My rate of return on the money I have invested, rather than applying it to my student loan principle has pretty much corresponded with the SP 500 over the last 2 years (almost 15%). Obviously this doesn't hold true always, but it has been a far better financial decision that accelerating my loan payments.

3) Time value of money, and starting early ; compounding interest

Many sacrifice their savings early on to apply this money to their loans. this chart is an interesting analysis and a good example of the power of starting savings early, and compounding interest

I used to work in an agency that allowed me to contribute to the Federal Reserve SmartBenefits program or TSP.  SmartBenefits had a bit of a better return than TSP, so I went with SmartBenefits (contributing just enough to get employer contributions).

personalfinance,$11k~ In Credit Card Debt That Should Be Student Loan Debt,"Hi All

I recently completed my undergraduate degree. I received a large scholarship, worked all throughout undergrad, and spent my money wisely so I ended up graduating with less than $20k in debt all in subsidized federal loans. 

My senior year I made the decision that I was going to quit my job to focus on the law school admissions process. My parents agreed to help me out by covering the difference. Long story short, my parents fell on difficult financial times, and while they most likely still could cover my educational costs, I felt horrible asking for financial help and ended up putting basically all of my living expenses for the year on three different credit cards. I know this was beyond stupid and in hindsight I should have continued working. In addition to my living expenses, I also spent rather recklessly as there were things in college I wanted to experience such as going on spring break and graduation trips. All in all I have $11k worth of credit card debt.

Credit Card 1: $9500
Credit Card 2: $1300
Credit Card 3: $200

I also owe about $1000 to my undergraduate institution that I'll have to pay to get my diploma.

Since the day after graduating, I've been working full time. I pull in around $700 a week after taxes. I moved back home, pack my lunch everyday, and my only expense right now is $15 a week for commuting costs. I begin law school in August at which point my income will stop. Law school will be funded through scholarships and federal loans which I'm putting off applying for until I figure out my credit card debt. My spending is completely under control and the stress and anxiety of my current financial situation will definitely help to keep it that way for fear of worsening my situation.

My main question is, would it be posibble to secure a student loan for my undergraduate expenses to pay down the cards even though I've already graduated. I'm devoting all of my assets to paying down the cards but the interest, mostly on credit card 1, is really beating me up. Alos, will this debt affect my ability to secure federal loans for law school? I signed a lease for next year in the town I'm attend school in and really am at the point of no return.

Any advice on how to pay down this debt, or transition it to manageable debt that won't accumulate interest while I'm in law school, is greatly appreciated.",finance
CryptoMarkets,What are your plans at August 1st?,"The soft fork of Bitcoin and coming soon after ETH hard fork, what are your opinions on it? Will it split? What you are going to do with your coins?


I would share my thoughts.

At the first ETH hard fork in 2016 it was very highly doubtful that it will split, and here we go, ETC.

Bitcoin will split for sure. Taking that it is a soft fork and people **have to decide** to choose sides and not a hard fork (when you really don't have to switch anything, even know that some kind of update is happening). Then going back to the past ETH hard fork which is better than a soft fork and still it splitted up even so. Therefore it is almost impossible that they won't split. But the real question is - how will it come out, there is even a possibility that Bitcoin will die (I mean, in terms - it will not be the main currency of all cryptos anymore).

Then who will replace him? My bets are on:

**Monero** - because anonymity (you can't track it by blockchain, by whatever, it's impossible to track if you not intentionally sign your name on it) and dark markets (this is the bitcoin first idea, and what it was used for, dark markets have to function, crash, not crash, trading can't stop for a month or longer, it can't stop even for an hour! it's too large). Furthermore it's the biggest, most stable (among the crashes, even this one happening now) and probably the first currency from all other ""anonymity"" currencies. (I use quotation marks because all cryptos are supposed to be anonymous in theory, so it's like anonymity among the anonymous world.) There are like 4 or 6 this kind of cryptocurrencies on the market now and only Monero stands in top 5 to 12 of all crypto since 2015, you can check this in internet archive if you don't believe me.

**Ripple-Cripple and Bancor** - because all that corporations, banks stuff that use and control this currency. Actually banks and corporations control everything not just the currency they made, jews (I don't even know now if it's just a meme or true fact) ruled gold, then money and now they are into crypto (Bancor can create when and how much tokens they want, it's literally new Federal Reserve System which control all the money now - [to those that don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUhJTxK5mA), and of course they are in ""Those who are the biggest."" team arealdy, I mean market caps top list (Ripple is third, just behind ETH and BTC). But if I may share my opinion of this - they might become main crypto, but I would never invest in it, sell my soul for bunch of shekels. Moreover they are both centralized, they will control your money. This is total opposition to Monero and whole idea of cryptocurrency. You can say that I'm some stupid idealist but I will never sell my (already limited) freedom for any money.

**IOTA** - it is basically very new on exchanges, so it's hard to predict how the charts will go, but it is on totally new technology, different than blockchain, so people during this forks may be like ""if BTC and ETH system failed then choose this new one"", they have Miicrosoft and Ubuntu support, no fees, plans to take it into real life and it's like normie currency that people would use, besides that they already big too, they **started** at 6 top currency market cap (1.7 billion $) and someone had to put that money into this, and they did it in only 2 years! But really what important is is that it wasn't even easy to find and more - to buy before lunch on bitfinex exchange, you had to use some kind of slack channels, like weird complicated stuff, people (and not just regular people I will say it again, they had to have knowledge and be into crypto hard, like total insiders) has to believe in this, and 4chan's /biz/ don't shill it, so it's a good sign - that it isn't just some big whales pump dump (actually with that market cap, official support of microsoft and other companies like that it's impossible).

CryptoCurrency,How I see the next decade or two panning out...,"Initially I wrote this as a note on my phone for myself, however I decided to share my thoughts to gauge opinion, consensus and opinions to understand different perspectives of the same coin. 

My gripe is the regulation which is influenced by large institutions, that aim to abuse measures put in place as 'protection', for reasons of self-interest and power.    
The less the SEC and other globally recognised regulators interfere, the better. Regulation is what turns Bitcoin from a disruptive force threatening change to the status quo, to a monopolised information database, controlled by a state in collusion with corporations. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
Consider that most of this money flowing into crypto isn't from average people but mostly finance sector entities and workers.    
We're seeing 1,500,000+ BTC trade volumes (all crypto combined) on a daily basis, $3,000,000,000+ a day for crypto is absolute insanity. I don't see this lasting much longer unless buying pressure supports altcoins from bitcoins drop in value. If it's successful, we'll see the rise of alts (vs BTC) in their own Bitcoin bubble sequence; money flowing out of Bitcoin into alts will create this buying pressure to be successful. 

Regulation would hinder this and integration into institutional leverage and algorithmic trading would allow for the monopolisation of wealth into the hands of the few.    
Capital flight will become increasingly prevalent with untraceable blockchains, ultimately sending ripples through the global economy, causing a massive recession, which furthers the transfer of wealth into a cycle leading toward depression.     

I'm understanding that this is a vast movement with vague detail, I'll elaborate further for clarity: 
More measures such as an increase in austerity (spending cuts &amp; tax increase), interest rates, inflation (money printing, more supply, lower value, increased prices for goods), increased debt from increased prices and interest rates, quantitative easing and negative yields on bonds.     
Cumulative stress coupled with increased debt and sovereign default risk could spell disaster for a runaway economy, resulting in a flashback to 1929. 

There are two paths for Bitcoin, it saves itself or it dies, letting a better evolution come forward and take over.     
We'll see many iterations before the tipping point comes. Bitcoin has life in it for a few years; regulation wouldn't be of use, they need time to develop tech to track blockchains and laws to go alongside it.      
Additionally, financiers aren't stupid, they see the massive gain potential for wealth by keeping crypto unregulated. These same people are either part of or interlinked to governments around the world. Milking the cash cow before slaughtering it.      
Once infrastructure and audiences have caught up, be ready to sell; mass adoption will be the event horizon for a massive transfer of wealth.       
In terms of liability, people will become victims, this is around the time regulation and tech are likely to be used against the freedom of the internet(s) and cryptography. 

My personal lifespan for this hypothesis would be 10 years of a rapid journeying or until we reach a tech barrier.     
I would ideally prefer to see blockchain technology advance society through a revolution of productivity and self-sufficiency. 
Automation of mass industry, via AI and robotics, combined with 100% renewable energy and highly efficient and high capacity batteries, could be enough to create a balanced ecosystem... until the robots become sentient and wipe us out or we do that ourselves.

*My interpretation:* I agree with his analysis. I think that whether or not we enter a recession and bear market depends specifically on if we get Trump corporate tax cuts, and I think there are a group of people who believe this will happen, and there is another group that is hoping that Trump is impeached. Markets are as partisan right now as the government. Complacency is high because of index investing, low unemployment, and Trump's ""great things are only two weeks away, great things..."" mantra.

For the time being, as long as default rates stay relatively low, no one will have a good reason to sell stocks, and the game of hot potato between stocks and bonds will continue. In the meantime think the fed is forcing Congress' hand to lower taxes by increasing rates but I don't think politicians realize how dire the situation is. It's one thing for the market to crash since the market is only a symptom of the economy as a whole, but if wages don't go up, while borrowing costs do go up given that consumer debt is at it's all time high, things could get bad. Corporations will have higher borrowing costs, along with pressure to increase stagnating wages, corporate margins are going to go way down without some way to make up the difference, and right now, markets are counting on a tax cut.

The big problem is that one way or another, either bonds will crash or stocks will crash. If we get our tax cut and rates keep going up, bond are going to crash like hell. If we don't get our tax cut and Trump is impeached, the stock market is going to implode. *It's my opinion that the upside of either scenario is already bought into the market, the downside is not. Bids set the market price, not asks.* Pick your poison.

My issue is: I'm planning on putting a lot towards my loans in the first 12 months as I'm staying home for a year or so and managed to find a good paying job out of school. I was thinking the best course of action would be to attack the 4.6% unsubbed loan first since that one has the highest interest rate and has already begun accruing interest. But after that, should I start paying off the 4.6% subbed loan or should I move on to the next unsubbed loan which is accruing interest at a 4.3% rate?

personalfinance,"No credit, need 1k Loan to survive the Summer","I am a college student who has recently moved out. My parents, nor does any immediate family capable of helping me financially life within 500 miles of me. Previously had $4500 in savings to last through the summer (More specifically September-October) and supplement any expenses not satisfied by my current job as a delivery driver where I am making roughly $1200-1400. My living bare minimum living expenses are ballpark $1250.

My savings was,again, meant to supplement my lack of income until my Fall semester started. At that time I would be using Federal Student Loans to further supplement my income. Unfortunately, my vehicle transmission gave out shortly into the summer and required a complete rebuild of it. I was unable to get any financing for this rebuild, because I have no credit history, and ultimately was forced to pay cash. This totaled $3500 after parts, labor, and rental car. IN BEFORE, Parents would not co-sign for any newer vehicle as an alternative. Honestly, the situation is entirely my fault for not pursuing building my credit earlier in life.

Anyways, although there was probably a better way of handling the situation, I panicked because my vehicle is my sole source of income and I needed it ASAP. I am now left with $800 to my name and work is notoriously slower in the summer because a majority of the college kids are away. This brings my expected monthly earning down to $900-1100 throughout the summer. Keep in mind again my minimum expenses are roughly $1250. If NOTHING goes wrong, sure I'll make it to the fall semester and collect my student loans,  but that's just not how life works haha. I would be forever grateful if anyone can recommend some lower interest loan, or some credit card that I've neglected to apply to. It seems all the credit cards I'm eligible for are severely handicapped. Again, any advice here is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my situation.

EDIT* There is little I can do to bring down my expenses, except to cut my already frugal grocery budget a bit. Work schedule also changes to often to get second job. Consistently get 30-32 hours, but am heavily reliant on commission upon completed deliveries as well as tips.

To reiterate, THERE IS LITTLE I CAN DO TO BRING DOWN EXPENSES.... these include My rent, Electricity, Water, Health Insurance, Phone, Car Insurance, Wifi, Gas, Groceries. I only drive at work as a delivery driver, all my expenses on a contractual bases are more costly to cancel than otherwise, my grocery budget is already at a near minimum, could maybe shave off 5-10 bucks a month on that.",finance

personalfinance,"[Employment] Assigned additional responsibilities as a college student, but pay will remain the same. Want to negotiate additional pay, but have no leverage. Options?","Background: I've been working in the IT department of my college (currently a rising senior) since my freshman year. I have grown from a trainee to the head consultant, but recently, there has been a shift to merge the IT helpdesk with the circulation desk of the library. This will result in the employees of both the IT desk and the circulation desk (both staffed by students) to be cross-trained in the others' responsibilities. Normally, that's cool and all, but there will be no bump in pay with the additional rise in responsibilities. I want to negotiate more pay for not only myself, but all other student workers who will be affected by this change, but we have no leverage, since if we all left (or at least threatened to do so), we'd simply be told to ""go ahead,"" as there are many students who will gladly take the positions. And if we do actually leave on principle, then we'd be out of a job. 

I currently run the photography club, which is a paying position in and of itself, but nowhere near as stable as my current position at the IT helpdesk. One option I have is to devote the free time I would have from quitting my IT job towards advancing the photography club, as well as my own personal photography business, but that might not take off, as I will be taking several high-level math courses to fulfill the final year of my studies. But if I stay, I know I'd be miserable and I know that I should be making more money, because I'd effectively be doing two jobs. The merger itself was done simply to cut costs for the higher-ups, without any consideration for the actual student workers. If I (and the others students affected by this) stay, then it will simply validate the merger, and we'll all be given more responsibilties and additional stress without any additional compensation. 

I was wondering what courses of action I would be able to take in order to negiotiate for more pay as a result of having additional responsbilities, even though I'm just a student, and the department wouldn't care a single wit if I left? Thank you.",finance

I moved with my company, got a raise, and now live somewhere where my money stretches a lot further. One thing I’ve done in this past year is saved a lot more, through my savings account and retirement fund, and also put a lot more money towards my student loan debts. Right now I just feel like I’m not putting my ‘extra’ money to the best use, and I was hoping y’all could help me out:
 
My retirement account at work has options for both pre-tax and Roth elections. I had been doing mostly Roth elections (as that seemed to make the most sense from what I had read up), but I found out when I filed my taxes this past year about the limit for student loan interest deduction. After $80K (which I eclipsed after moving bonus + quarterly bonuses), you only get to deduct a small amount instead of the usual $2.5k. A suggestion from a friend was to up my pre-tax elections, which would make it so that my taxable income was below that threshold. Is this the best way to go? As much as I’d like that deductible, I don’t know if it’s worth it in the long term.
 
With my loans, I refinanced so that there is one payment a month/better interest rates. I have a 7-year loan with the new place, and am tempted to move some of the money that right now I am investing in my retirement fund to put extra payments down on this debt. Even though I’ve been doing really well and have already shaved about 1.5 years off my total payoff time, I HATE having that debt over my head. But does it make sense to not have that money in a retirement fund or savings account as opposed to lessening my debt?

I also have recently financed an engagement ring which I am paying off in $400/month installments while I have no interest rate on the loan (until February 2018 and then whatever remaining balance incurs a 25% interest rate until the loan is payed off) and I have roughly $2,200 left on that loan.

As of three weeks ago we notice a strong foul earthy smell coming out of a corner in our house. The smell is so potent that we having crack windows in the house and we are concerned about our son's safety. We called a mold specialist to come and check it out. Sure enough, mold is present throughout the entire crawlspace and is growing in the insulation which are damp for some reason.

The total cost estimate for the treatment and replacing of insulation and floor plastic barrier has come up to be $6965. We made a claim with the insurance company who refuse to cover the cost because they cannot find the cause of the mold. So now my wife and I are stuck trying to either A.) Make monthly payments towards the total in exchange for small repairs done at a time or B.) Get a home line of equity credit to cover the cost [~7.43% interest rate]. Are these really the two best options that we should be looking at or is there something else that we can do?

Now we don't have a savings to pay off this kind of emergency due to us depleting our savings to pay off the rest of my wife's student loans and helping pay for a major surgery that she had a few weeks ago.

personalfinance,"Student loan company had wrong contact information, and now my loan payment is approaching 60 days late payment - affecting my credit score. What are my options? [xpost from r/legaladvice]","Hi all. 

I recently got an email from Credit Karma saying my credit score was significantly affected by a late payment. 

When I logged on to check out what was going on, I learned that I had an outstanding student loan that was quickly approaching 60 days late payment. 

I was immediately confused because I currently pay on two of my student loans (one private, one a plus loan in my mother's name), and have the rest of my federal loans in deference thanks to IBR. 

I reached out to my mom to see if anyone had tried to contact her since we've used her information for loans before.

She said she doesn't answer calls from numbers she doesn't know, so she wouldn't know if the company had reached out to her or not, but that she did know that no one left her a voicemail regarding the loans. 

She also gave me several letters that the company had sent me, but that she did not open because they were addressed to me. These turned out to be late payment notices. 

Upon finally logging on to the company's payment portal, I find out that all of the contact information they had was for my mother and not for me even though the loan was in my name. 

The only reason I can think of for the company to have her information instead of mine would be that she had to put in an application for a Plus loan and be denied in order for me to receive the Perkins loan. 

But even then, the Perkins loan would be my responsibility, so I don't understand why they would have pulled her info instead of mine. My contact information for the university the loans are from has my information listed and is current. There is a possibility they pulled her information from my FASFA application, but I'm not totally sure. 

Do I have any legal/other grounds to convince the company to drop the late payments from my record due to the situation? I am fully willing and able to make the account current, and to work with them as needed to make this happen. Or should I just accept the situation for what it is, pay up, and move on?

I can reach out to the company and see if they have records of other forms of attempted contact if needed. 

For context, I live in North Carolina. These loans are Federal Perkins Loans, and prior to this situation, my credit score was over 700, with no late payments on my record.

Details in comments.,"Hello, I am a 20 year old college student who just recently graduated from community college with an Associates in Business. To this point I have been able to successfully avoid student loans due to some merit-based scholarships I received and the fact that community college is much cheaper as compared to a 4-year university. I am now transferring to a private 4-year university to obtain a bachelor's degree and have come to the realization that I will need to take out some student loans. I come from a middle class family so I received $0 from the government via FAFSA and was only allowed to take out very small subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans, somewhere around 6k per year. My out of pocket expenses are still going to be around 20k per year and roughly 26k including the federal loans. So my question is where do I go to obtain student loans?

personalfinance,Paying off CC debt via Roth 401k loan?,"Hi all,

Hoping you could provide some advice for me as I didn't see much in terms of search. 

So let's lay out the facts first. I have a pretty decent amount of credit card debt. Roughly $12k. All cards have a ridiculous interest rate (most over 20%). I know that I should've never gotten in this scenario in the first place, but you can't change the past and most of it was from college. Total monthly payments are just over $300. 

On my Roth 401k, I have enough balance to take out a loan on it over a Max of five years (which I would max out). The interest rate on the Roth is 4%. My monthly payment would be $232. 

I've seen many posts on the internet suggesting to not touch retirement funds. I get that I may take a slight hit on any interest earned but it seems like I would still net positive to get rid of my insane interest rates and balances. 

To me, it is essentially a consolidation in a five year loan at 4%. Am I thinking about this incorrectly? Overall it would lower my monthly payments AND lower the total amount I would have to pay if I kept it all on the cards. 

In addition it would reduce my credit utilization to 0 rather than &gt;90%. 

Thoughts? I can provide more info if needed. 

Thanks!

This past year homes went up 12% in value on average, and I do not see them going back down anytime soon.

Our existing plan is to have enough for 20% down on a $200,000 home in 2 years, and around this time I will also have my student loans paid off.  We currently have enough for 10% down, half of which comes from a gift from my parents. We have been saving a lot in the last year but most of it has been going towards our emergency fund which is why we are still 2 years away from the 20% payment. 

We recently have been considering buying a house now instead of later. We've done the math and we can afford it even with PMI, but my biggest concerns are the costs that come with being home owners. My SO and I are able to save up $1000 a month easily between the two of us that can cover these costs, but in order to buy this house at 10% down we would have to dip into our emergency fund, which would leave it with only 3 months of expenses if we were to buy in the next few months.

My worst nightmare is that in 2 years the houses we like and can currently afford will be worth $250,000, mortgage interest rates will be higher, and we will have to buy less house, in a worse area in order to stay in our budget. Is this a completely unreasonable fear? We really want to be home owners as we want to build up equity, we want a yard for our dog, and we plan to start a family in the next 5 years or so.

My main conflict is deciding whether I should take this as is, or pay a few cards down a bit to raise my credit score and then re-apply for a debt consolidation loan. Can anyone help me here? Any input is greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,My college does not participate in student loan programs. Help me find a way to pay for school,"(throwaway acct)
So earlier this year (around march) I was accepted into an allied health program at a community college in California. It is a 2 year associates degree and starts august, and it is 3 hrs from my home so I need to relocate.

Since I have been fully employed making $50k+/year for the past 12 years, federal student aid is out of reach for me. Luckily since it is a community college the Board of Governors Waiver (BOG) can cover much of the tuition. The big question mark for me is how to pay for housing. According to the school, they recommend that students do not work while attending. So no additional income. I do have some scholarship applications that will hopefully be approved, was also approved for federal work study, and have about $8-9k in savings.

I was told by the fin.aid office that the school does not do federal student loans (bummer), so I approached this new journey with the intent to apply for a private student loan. 

FFWD to today, I tried applying at a number of student loan websites, and none of them show my school in their listings. 

So now I need new options to pay for housing for 2 years.

I do own a home and have about $100-120k in equity. I am currently renting it out (I live with GF) and receive about $140 extra pocket cash through rental income.

I have found a place that will rent me a room for $650 and includes utilities. My plan was to get a loan to pay for rent, and use my rental income for groceries, and tap my savings when necessary. i am also anticipating Federal grants the 2nd year as I will have a year of unemployment under my belt.

I have looked at HELOC loans and Equity Loans, Cash out-refis, but I cant decide which is the best move. Are there other options?
Is there such thing as an equity loan that will defer payments while Im in school and unemployed? Can I even get any of those equity loans while living elsewhere?

let me know if you need more info. I have 6 weeks to come up with the cash and I already told my employer that Im leaving. Please help!!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Something I'd like to see,"I'd like to see a coin that decentralizes credit issuance. This coin should leverage existing infrastructure for building trust and take full advantage of current KYC infrastructure (credit score, FICO, etc) while also integrating new reputation/identity systems (e.g., UPort). I'd like to see it be able to hit your IRL credit score while also taking advantage of whatever the fuck Aragon is supposed to be doing. There could be tiered authentication, each step getting you a lower interest rate. I'd like to see the latest in credit score appraisal (e.g., looking at your degree, job history, facebook profile, social graph, etc) such as we see from companies like UpStart. Places like LendingClub and Upstart already issue you loans without really going after people who default. 

The end goal is a replacement for my credit card. Instead of going to coinbase to withdraw money from my line of credit, I should have a service that lets me leverage and build my existing standing. Fuck that 3.5% coinbase fee for using my credit card!

""The Fed has bought treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds to inject liquidity into the markets.

Today, the Fed promised to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities. Yellen plans to let those bonds expire when they come due.

personalfinance,"Student loan balance: $0. Thank you PF for all of your help, and please accept my personal contribution.","**Edit:** Several people requested access to the spreadsheet. You shouldn't need to request access. You should be able to `File &gt; Make a copy...`. Please PM me if you are unable to do so.

I was raised in a family where finances were not ever discussed other than the fact that we did or did not have it. My father was an optimistic entrepreneur who struck gold, time and time again on many of his business ventures, but always found a way to blow through his riches with little to show for it. Factor in my mother who was a hoarder and you had the perfect formula for disaster. I won't stroll too deep down memory lane, but long story short, I never completed my college degree and decided to go straight into the workforce instead.

Seven years ago, I was laid off from a job that was ""paying the bills"" with no degree to fall back on. I made the decision to go back to school and about two years into my degree, I was caught in a financial bind, worrying about how I was going to take care of next semester's tuition. Fortunately for me, I had an amazing aunt, uncle, sister, and BIL who helped cover my expenses. After that incident, I swore to myself that as soon as I graduated, I would take charge of my own finances and do everything in my power to avoid going down the same path as my parents.

I've been a long-time lurker and have read countless personal stories shared on this subreddit throughout the years. Even if the situation didn't apply to my own life, I took the time to sympathize with what others are going through in the event that I too may one day endure the same hardship. I silently cheered behind the scenes along with each success story shared. This sub is a daily read for me and became my source of encouragement towards living a debt-free life.

Today, I get to share my own success story. I made a plan after graduating to aggressively pay off my student loans and have been blessed enough to have the means to do. I have made the final payment on my student loans. From $22,601.14 to $0 in 27 months.

Along with the good news, I wanted to give back to the community that has been so helpful all these years. I created a spreadsheet to track my various finances and I'm hoping that it will help others as well.

**Personal Finance Template:** 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RjHE3ATePYUoE1WZpb9wmR2h7VfJ45_IQC1Jutr4wlY/edit?usp=sharing

It may seem like there is a lot going on, but I will try my best to describe each tab in-depth to make it seem less scary.

**Student Loans:** My student loans were broken down into different groups (A, B, C, D) at different interest rates. I wanted to calculate the total interest over the life of each loan based on a set payment amount, so I made a rough amortization chart.

&gt; **F2:** Enter your interest rate.  
&gt; **H2:** Enter your desired monthly payment.  
&gt; **M2:** Enter your loan balance.

I wanted to find the sweet spot for what I felt comfortable paying while also trying to minimize the total accrued interest as best as I could, so I played around with various numbers for `H2`.

As an example, I entered $200 in `H2`. Now I am searching for the row where the value in `column M` is negative. This happens in `M30`.

That means that if I make a monthly payment of $200 (`H2`), I would pay it off in 30 months (`G32`) and accrue $281.64 of total interest (`K32`).

I repeated the same process for $56.57 (the recommended minimum payment from my student loan provider), $150, $175, and $250 and then made a chart in `O1:R6` (http://i.imgur.com/C2yuvQG.png).

I calculated the savings based on how much **less** interest I would pay over the life of the loan if I paid more than the minimum payment. This became such a big motivator for me to continue to make aggressive payments that I decided to add it to the **Summary** tab.

**Summary:** This tab is exactly what it sounds like; it is a summary of all of my finances so that I can get a snapshot view of where my money is, along with my net worth, average credit score, and student loan ""savings"".

&gt; **B2:** I update this formula once a month. Currently the formula is `='2017.06'!$Q$200`, pointing to the `2017.06` spreadsheet.. When June ends, I will simply update the formula to point to `='2017.07'!$Q$200`.  
&gt; **B10:** This is also updated monthly. Next month, I would change the formula from `='Credit Score'!$F$20` to `='Credit Score'!$F$21`.

**2017.04, 2017.05, 2017.06:** This is where the bulk of the work comes in.

&gt; **A:** Enter the date of the posted transaction. If the transaction is still pending, leave the date blank until it has posted.  
&gt; **B:** Enter the merchant for the transaction. This column uses the **Merchants** tab for data validation. To add a new merchant, simply add another entry in column **A** of the **Merchants** tab.  
&gt; **C:** Enter the category for the transaction. This simply helps categorize your spending. Use the **Categories** tab for data validation.  
&gt; **D:** Enter all credit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
&gt; **E:** Enter all debit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
&gt; **F:J**: I have four credit cards that I use in rotation. Enter all credit card transactions under the corresponding column (adjust columns as needed).  
&gt; **K:** This column shows the current balance of your bank account.  
&gt; **L:P:** These columns shows the current balance of each of your credit cards.  
&gt; **Q:** I call this column the ""reality check"". It shows your true balance: the cash you have in your bank account minus all of the debts across your credit cards.
&gt; **S:T:** This gives you a breakdown of where you are spending your money. It is another helpful way to keep your spending in check and should help you budget.

It might seem like a lot of work, but it has become routine enough for me that it takes me no more than 10 minutes in the morning.

My routine:  

1. Log into Charles Schwab.
2. Enter pending transactions (columns **B:J**).
3. Enter dates for previously pending transactions (column **A**).
4. Repeat 1-3 for Citi, Discover, Amex, Capital One.
5. Select the columns that are out of order, then click `Data &gt; Sort sheet by Column A, A -&gt; Z`.

Let's go through an example. 

In tab `2017.06`, I have the following pending transactions: http://i.imgur.com/XK1V89r.png

After logging into my accounts, I found that these transactions are all posted now, so I have entered the dates of the posted transactions in column `A`: http://i.imgur.com/wcry4GH.png

My transactions are out of order, which will happen often with pending transactions, so now I have to sort them.

I select columns `A53:J39` up to posted date `6/11`: http://i.imgur.com/b9rjTTP.png

Then click `Data &gt; Sort sheet by Column A, A -&gt; Z`: http://i.imgur.com/uIb4kk7.png

My transactions are now sorted! http://i.imgur.com/Qw7FW9R.png

That is pretty much all I do for daily transactions, though there are two things I want to make note of.

&gt; **Paying credit card bills:** When paying a credit card bill, I enter a debit in column `E` as well as a credit in the corresponding credit card column.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, I paid my Citi credit card bill on 6/2/2017 in the amount of $143. This is what that transaction looks like: http://i.imgur.com/FlTk8Bl.png

&gt; **Look-ahead:** Often times, I will enter transactions that have not happened yet further down the spreadsheet. For example, if I know I have a credit card bill due later this month, or a rent payment, or an incoming paycheck, I will enter it in order to ""look ahead"" of my finances. This teaches me discipline in how I am spending my current balance while making sure that I am preparing for upcoming expenses.
&gt; 
&gt; An example of this can be seen in rows `90:91`: http://i.imgur.com/O5nhlRW.png
&gt; 
&gt; I know that I have a credit card bill due on 7/3, and I also have another paycheck coming on 6/30. Entering both of these transactions allows me to gauge how prepared I am when that time comes.

At the end of the month, I simply right-click `2017.06` and click `Duplicate`, renaming the new spreadsheet to `2017.07`. I also make sure that all of the formulas in `D2:J2` correctly point to the previous month.

&gt; **D2:** Change `='2017.05'!K200` to `='2017.06'!K200`  
&gt; **F2:** Change `='2017.05'!L200` to `='2017.06'!L200`  
&gt; **G2:** Change `='2017.05'!M200` to `='2017.06'!M200`  
&gt; **H2:** Change `='2017.05'!N200` to `='2017.06'!N200`  
&gt; **I2:** Change `='2017.05'!O200` to `='2017.06'!O200`  
&gt; **J2:** Change `='2017.05'!P200` to `='2017.06'!P200`

**Ally Savings [1.00% APY]**: This tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**Stocks Owned:** I use this tab to keep track of the current stocks that I own.

&gt; **A:** Enter the stock ticker.  
&gt; **B:** Enter the purchase date.  
&gt; **C:** Enter the number of shares purchased.  
&gt; **D:** Enter the purchase price.

Rows `25:37` helps me track when I should sell the stock and what my net gain/loss would be.

&gt; **C26:** Enter the number of shares purchased.  
&gt; **D26:** Enter the purchase price.

The chart will show you what the sell price would be for a `10.00% - 65.00%` gross profit.

**Stocks Sold:** This just helps me keep track of my stocks sold over the years. I copy and paste the values directly from **Stocks Owned** when I choose to sell.

**401k:** This tab tracks all of my 401k transactions.

&gt; **C:** Enter the money contributed for the month.  
&gt; **D:** Enter the amount of gain/loss for the month.

Columns `G:I` will give you the year-to-date statistics, but it is pretty barebones at the moment.

**HSA:** This tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**HSA [Investment]:** This tab follows a similar structure as the **401k** tab.

**Credit Score:** This tab keeps track of my monthly free credit estimates offered by my credit cards. Columns `H:I` tracks roughly what date a new credit score is available. It's interesting to see how your credit score is affected month to month based on various factors. For instance, my credit utilization was high from 09/2016 - 12/2016 due to the holidays and various trips. My credit took a dip for that period and then has been slightly rising since.

personalfinance,"(Planning) (Investing) Starting a family, serious planning/investing advice would be extremely helpful!","TLDR at bottom!

Alright friends of reddit, I'm gonna lay out the situation first, questions will follow.
My girlfriend (21ys) and I(23 yrs) learned about a month and a half ago that she was pregnant. We are now 11 weeks along, and find out the gender this coming week!
We met and both work as waiters in a restaurant, each averaging between $450-650 dollars per week, *all in cash*. We each have roughly $200-250 per week in bills, mandatory savings, or other unavoidable expenses. We are very good at sharing money, we live and work together so we're hardly ever apart and it is simply convenient. Despite this, we have no shared bank accounts/credit cards.
Since the day I learned of the pregnancy, I started a fund to buy a ring. I'm gonna marry this smoking hot, intelligent woman and spend the rest of my life with her. I'm set in my position on that, so for the purposes of this post just consider it to be a given that within the next year we will be legally married.

There are really two questions, or rather issues, that I seek advice on.
*First, I want us to begin the process of combining finances formally, in preparation for both the baby and the impending engagement/marriage. So what I'm looking for is the best bank account (what type of account, which bank, etc.) that will allow both of us unfettered access to our information as well as the ability to deposit, withdraw, and spend as necessary. We currently bank in two separate institutions, myself at BB&amp;T and my lovely dime piece at Bank of America.
           
           **1. Should we just use one of our existing accounts and simply add another user?**
           **2. Is there a specific bank/account type that would be the most beneficial for this goal or situation?**

That was the easy part. (at least it looks like that to me!)

I would also like to start planning for the baby's future, both for expected and unexpected expenses. I'll just go ahead and get some of the ugly stuff out of the way - my credit score is just over 700, with a short and simple history (utilities/Macy's card used once, paying fraternity bills, that's about it.) Hers is sitting around 540, with a relatively much larger and longer history (multiple credit cards, phone bills, etc.) She currently has 2 credit cards, limits of around $700 on each, and I have been trying to convince her to stop using them unless absolutely necessary (every week she improves in this regard) I am a student, about to finish my undergrad degree this next spring. I have a 167 LSAT score, and am finishing up my applications to several law schools in the state that I live in (GA). I'll more than likely be accepted to the schools I want to go to, but any scholarships are still an uncertain prospect. I'm carrying about 28k in student loans thus far (co-signed with my parents, bless their hearts for being so amazingly generous). She has no degree, only a few college course credits to her name, and is about to start a 6 week nursing assistant certification (can't remember exactly, something to that end).
There will come a time within the next 3 years that I am in school, realistically making 2k per month maximum, and she will be at home or best case earning roughly the same. While our infant/toddler does God knows what costing Lord knows how much. My worst case scenario is that I pick up about 100k total in student loan debt (all private, by the way, none federal), and come out with a law degree into a job with 60k per year. Unless the forces of nature unite and turn the world against me, that is worst case. There are plenty of scenarios that play out with this new family in a much more secure financial position.
*With that being said, how can I begin to set up some sort of investment fund for the future of this baby? I honestly have no idea what to do in this arena at all, and my situation makes me feel only more unsure. 
          
           **1. An investment account?**
           **2. A simple savings account?**
           **3. Help! I have no idea what to do!**

TL;DR
Girlfriend is pregnant. Going to be engaged soon, married after baby is born (due in January).
What is the best way/thing(s) we can do to combine finances in preparation for both of these events? - banks, account types, etc.
We have what I personally would consider limited financial resources and flexibility right now, and things will only get tighter in that regard for a couple of years at least before they get better.
How can I/we begin to invest firstly in our childs future, with a second priority for our own future? - investment account, simple savings account, etc.

And finally, if there are any glaring holes, observations, interesting points, or advice that is not specific to my questions *yet still does relate to my situation, please express that! 
I am an open book and a patient and willing ear.

personalfinance,Student loan interest on the rise?,"Hello PF, 

This is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile so I apologize for any mistakes. 

I am looking for a little information on how student loan interest is calculated because I went to pay them monthly payment for the two student loans I have left yesterday and I noticed they both jumped to 3% interest. 
One was 2.12% and the other was 2.25% interest previously. I called Navient (Formerly Sallie Mae) and asked why the jump after years of it not really changing? She first said well in Q1 they changed to 2.5% and 2.25% and now that Q2 ended they jumped to 3%. She then said Wall Street determined the prices and not Navient. 

Knowing that I'm dealing with Sallie Mae and already feeling like I'm being screwed is this true? If it is then are we in for a consistent rise in interest? Is there a point I should cut bait and do something with a bank instead of Navient?

Thank you for your help in advance!

Bitcoin,"The year is 2068, a massive solar storm has decimated all electronic devices on Earth. Jack is the first person to turn a miner on after the storm.","I didn't know I would become a millionaire, of course I couldn't mine by myself, but the chain had been offline for days. When enough mining power came back on, sure the Digital Federal Reserve managed to get the first block after the storm.

I mean, no one expects anything less... By law they're the only entity allow d to have more than 50% of the mining power. But with the amount of time before that block happened, the difficulty took a nose dive.

So as soon as that was done, guys like me started to pull waaaaay more blocks than we should have with our little community pools. I'm not sure how long those hacker terrorist guys were planning what happened next, but I assure you, every block we mined was legitimate.

The D-Reapers, not sure why they chose that name, apparently a reference to an old kid's show... They realised they could finally get a hard fork going to take the power back. The government had been running this chain for too long. Allegedly a lot of the original guys that made the chain were supporting the group, though none of them openly claimed to be members. That lawyer guy from Duke, that guy from Florida feeding the homeless, even some doofus that used to post about ""going to the moon"". Some say even that Satoshi Nakamoto himself was backing the D-Reapers.

So what happened? Well, at first, celebration. All us small pools were just psyched that we were going to be rich, you know? Then someone noticed that the DFR was cutting in and out. They weren't consistently online. Then DFR went offline completely. 

All the local pools started to get social media hits from the D-Reapers. They wanted us to run their custom update that would hard fork the government chain. Doing what they asked... Would, well, could get anybody charged with treason... Which is what all the people on the pool pages posted back to the D-Reaper guys.

Next thing the D-Reaper guys did was just reply back that they understand. An hour later they posted again, ""What did it finally take, to get the US to fight for independence? Click here to read a first hand account about how the revolutionary army began."" Everyone wanted to see what the hell they were going on about.

So of course even though there were maybe only a few hundred or few thousand of us, we almost all clicked it.

Really? What happened?

There was a brief message on the screen, but it flashed off really quickly. Next thing we know, the government chain was hardforked.

I guess it was like a forced conscription? Absolutely sir, all pools maintain their innocence on the matter. It was a hack, a script, a virus, whatever you'd like to call it. It's not our fault that any of this happened.

Have any of you received any charges of treason? No. It was against our will sir.

So, you all have become rich, and subvert d the government, and it was against your will?

That is our story pal, we're sticking to it.

""We understand.""

Jack's mouth hung open, did this CDNBC interviewer just hint that he was a D-Reaper?!?! Right here?!?! Could this old bag even be Satoshi Nakamoto himself?!?!?!

The interviewer got a smug smile on his face. And began to speak again:

""I'm just amazed at it, you know? People used to say the sun could burn out before you ever hacked a private key..."" (The interviewer paused here and blinked twice at Jack.) ""And look here, the sun did the opposite of burn out, and now the whole damn chain isn't in the hands of the government anymore. Wow...""

""Yeah... It is pretty amazing...""

""Well we have to go now, my gum is all out of flavour."" The interviewer blinked twice at Jack again. He took a piece of paper out of his pocket, spit the gum in it, and tossed it in the trash bin in the room before leaving with the camera team.

Jack and his friends ran over to the bin.

""No way.""

On the balled up paper, aside from a small blue wad of what might have been 5 gum...

personalfinance,Should I refinance my home?,"Wife and I just bought our first home last November. Purchase price $390k, put 10% down 9n 15 yr loan at 2.625%.

Thinking I'd want to pay it off as quickly as possible, we got a 15 year loan with what seems like a great interest rate. We also only paid 10% down so we'd have a nice chunk of cash left over for minor renovations and an emergency fund, but that means a PMI. 

Now, I'm wondering if it would make sense to refinance, for a few reasons. Since our interest rate is low, it might make sense to not rush paying the loan off. Maybe make smaller payments with a 30 year loan and invest the extra money, or use it 9n renovations etc? I might also be willing to pay some more money down now and avoid paying the PMI. I'm also thinking that if interest rates start going up again soon this won't be an option anymore, so I should consider doing this sooner rather than later. 

So, my question is, does this make sense? Is it too soon or maybe too costly to refinance? 

I'm happy to share more details if needed.",finance

personalfinance,Question: Anyone experienced with Signature One and the Federal Liberty Debt Program?,"Been lurking for a while, figured I would ask for some help finally. 

I have about 50k in debt between a previous loan and a ton of credit cards. Accumulated from college, living off of them, when buying a home I couldn't touch my bank account, yada yada. 

I've been looking into debt consolidation options since my bills outweigh my income at the moment. While not the route I want to go (I would love to just pay them off myself every month) I need to find a fix that can help me break even every month income and bill wise, and allow me to begin saving up money and paying off the one debt more quickly and so forth than managing so many.

I have been checking my options for unsecured loans and debt consolidation and the only offer that has had any real bite or progress is from Signature One. While I initially called and asked for a debt consolidation loan, unsecured, 5 years give or take, I have been met with the Federal Liberty Debt Program (I may be off a word or two)

Essentially, as it was explained, I would pay 928 a month to knock out all of my debt over the course of 48 months. They actually negotiate the debt with the creditors, ask me to stop payments and stop contact with them even if they call or send letters, and over the 48 months my payment of 928 that goes into a federal trust account is dispersed and paid to the creditors at lower, negotiated principles. 

I wasn't born yesterday but I want to believe this may be legitimate. There's no upfront fees or anything from what I can tell, they ""get paid when it's done"" and it's possible the negotiations may shorten the 48 month payment time span. What worries is this sounds too easy or too good to be true. I'm essentially paying 30k over 4 years to pay off 50k...

Questions for everyone here; does this sound legitimate? Has anyone had experience with this program or something similar (even something they recommend?)  Anyone know any banks or finance institutions that would offer more flexible options?

personalfinance,Locking in rate sheets with multiple mortgage lenders,"I am in a bit of a weird situation, and I am hoping that the good folks here on /r/personalfinance can lend me some advice.

My wife and I recently had an offer accepted on a new construction townhouse. We had locked in a rate sheet from a lender for 30 days, and that rate sheet expires today. Unfortunately, due to some local government paperwork, we cannot close yet - and it may be a few more weeks before we can close.

Our current lender has given us three options:

1. Extend the rate sheet for another 30 days, at a rate of 0.5% of the loan.
2. Let the rate sheet expire. If we close within 30 days, we have to pay 0.02% of the loan per day. We will be stuck with whatever the current rate sheet is.
3. Let the rate sheet expire. If we close after 30 days, no additional fees but we are stuck with whatever the current rate sheet is.

We expect to be able to close within 30 days, although it is entirely possible (although less likely) that it could take more than 30 days.

We have sent in an application with a new lender and expect to hear back from them today. What would be the repercussions, if any, for locking in a rate sheet with multiple lenders? If this is not possible (or legal), we will let our current rate sheet expire and go with the new lender. We really want to avoid paying unnecessary fees.

Does that still apply if they are paying off debt I owe (they are not cosigners on the loans, they're solely in my name) as well?

personalfinance,Out of financial aid options and don't know what else to do,"I am conveying this story on behalf of a friend who is in some
dire straits with finishing her undergraduate studies:

&amp;nbsp;

She is 27 years old and is currently seeking to finish her undergraduate degree at a small, private pre-medical/biological sciences school in California. She was adopted as a baby but has no family or familial support as her adoptive family was physically and emotionally abusive, and stole her identity on several occasions; although she didn't seek legal recourse, she is considering pressing charges on the latest instance. She does not have good credit but only because she does not have much credit history—she did not know how to build credit and received bad advice.

&amp;nbsp;

After high school, she enrolled at Everest College to receive a diploma in dental assisting. Due to fraudulent intimations of employment statistics, Everest College and the Corinthian College system has been forced out of business. She was unable to find work as a dental assistant and so enrolled in her current university—despite the high cost, her boyfriend at the time threatened to kick her out of the house if she did not just enroll instead of applying elsewhere or at public universities. Her current school says they don't accept grants and can't afford to fund Perkins loans so she has been reliant on Stafford loans to this point. Following a period of personal tragedy and hardship, during which her GPA suffered considerably, she decided to take this past spring semester off, hoping to save some money and put herself back together. Although she was able to come back to center somewhat, she wasn't able to save as much as she wanted or needs.

&amp;nbsp;

She just spoke to her school's financial aid department in preparation for fall but was told she has exhausted her Stafford loan eligibility. As a lawyer, I have looked into the legality of the school's practice of charging per unit like a community college but at an exorbitant amount. This practice means that a full time student taking 20 units still pays per unit even if the full time student unit load is only 13 units—a practice that renders it impossible to finish the degree program with just Stafford Loans because one cannot load their schedule to graduate early to save money (what I did at UCSB). In addition to refusing to offer Perkins loans, they also do not offer any scholarships. 

&amp;nbsp;

She is looking into private loans but her credit score is only around 630 and, since she has no family, she doesn't have anybody to cosign. There may be a lender out there who would take her on without a cosigner but I imagine the interest rates offered would be off the charts. She works 50+ hours a week at two jobs but is barely able to keep her head above water due to the high cost of living. Her financial aid department—who unthinkably in the past have just insisted she get a third or fourth job—suggested she seek to transfer to another school to finish out her studies but the Cal States do not offer enrollment to transfers until Fall 2018 and she'll have difficulty getting a spot anyway as her transfer GPA is only around 2.6—a fact that compounds the difficulty of obtaining other scholarships as well.

&amp;nbsp;

She has put in a request to the Department of Education for debt relief in light of a DoE program pertaining to the fraudulent practices of Everest and other Corinthian college schools but has not heard back, and this process will likely take a while. When the academic director at her current school returns from vacation, she is going to request that the school accept her final classes' credit from a community college towards her bachelors degree but the school is shady, and who knows whether they'd go for it.

&amp;nbsp;

Other than looking at private lenders and for outside scholarships, I'm at a loss for what other options may be available to her. There is a grant program for former foster youth, but at 27 she's too old to utilize it. Does anyone on here know of any other options she could pursue or have any ideas about how she might be able to obtain her degree relatively soon without dooming her future with a 200% apr loan?

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you.

Bitcoin,How Governments could end Bitcoin,"I was just explaining Bitcoin to a friend and how it the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins so it is deflationary by nature... 

At last check, Bitcoin's total market cap was $41 billion, now granted, any significantly large purchase would bid up the price per coin but couldn't several anti-Bitcoin governments conspire to just 'zero out the float'? Float being the amount of coins available to the public. They could keep acquiring coins and when the price gets to high, shutdown Coinbase or DDoS Kraken.. to drive it back down and buy up more of the supply. Not sure if anyone has ever addressed it, I know it's a bit 'out there' of a thought but it's still possible. The US Federal Reserve printed $4.4 trillion dollars with impunity, for $40 billion+ (however they structure buying w/ appreciation) they can finally end their witch hunt for the 'black market' users of Bitcoin. 

Obviously some other Altcoin would then be used but it would definitely be a shot across the bow of the cryptocurrency market.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,The IRS is looking,"The IRS has taken an interest in Bitcoin for various reasons. First, Bitcoin is largely unmonitored and stands apart from the traditional structure of U.S. banking with 1099 forms and regular reporting. There is a huge mass of Bitcoin value that is relatively unknown to the IRS, and gains in value are essentially hidden from the IRS, and the IRS doesn't like that.(They always assume you are hiding something) In addition, Bitcoin has a large potential for tax non-compliance, both because its very nature is quasi anonymous, and because Bitcoin holdings give rise to significant IRS reporting (the ""FBAR"" form, IRS Form 8938, IRS Form 8949, capital gains taxes, etc.) and many fellow owners don't heed (or even know) the reporting requirements.

In November 2016, the IRS obtained a federal court authorization to issue a ""John Doe"" summons to Coinbase, Inc. The IRS has in the past successfully used the ""John Doe"" summons to obtain information from financial institutions (e.g., UBS, HSBC and Cayman Islands banks) for a broad class of U.S. taxpayers who are not individually named but whom the IRS has reason to believe may have utilized the financial institution to improperly evade tax. The John Doe summons upon Coinbase seeks records from 2013 through 2015 for any Coinbase user with a US address, telephone number, e-mail domain, etc., and all records related to disbursement of funds to any user. A recently filed Affidavit by an IRS agent in the Coinbase enforcement litigation revealed that in 2015, only 802 taxpayers revealed Bitcoin information to the IRS on Form 8949, which is the form applicable to capital gains and losses. Other virtual currency platforms, such as Localbitcoins, Kraken and ItBit may receive similar summonses for transactions with Bitcoins and other virtual currencies like Ethereum and Litecoin.

Bitcoin's quasi-anonymity feeds its non-compliance, and there are many opportunities to run afoul of tax law and IRS requirements, intentionally or inadvertently. One issue is the failure to report income with respect to Bitcoin. In 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21 describing how various income recognition and other US tax principles apply to virtual currency transactions. In that Notice, the IRS clarified that virtual currencies are ""property"" subject to income tax, capital gains tax, etc. This means that if Bitcoin is sold for a profit, that profit is income and is subject to capital gains tax. The income is reportable on IRS Form 8949 which is then attached to Schedule D of Form 1040. If you exchange your Bitcoin for goods or services, that too is a taxable event, as the IRS considers you to have earned income on the value of the good or service, less your cost basis in the Bitcoin (i.e., your Bitcoin purchase price).

If you are audited by the IRS regarding Bitcoin, you may have to show multiple cost bases for multiple transactions. Proper record keeping with respect to Bitcoin is essential. The IRS regularly takes the position that your cost basis in your Bitcoin is zero, and you would pay tax on the full value of the Bitcoin on the date of the transaction, unless you can provide records of your purchases of Bitcoin.

In addition to income tax issues on Bitcoin income, there are reporting issues irrespective of income. Because a Bitcoin wallet would be considered by the IRS to constitute an ""account"", if you hold your Bitcoins in foreign wallets or on foreign Bitcoin exchanges, then foreign account reporting requirements are triggered, including the FBAR (FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts) and IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets). If you invested in a foreign fund that invested in Bitcoin, the IRS may consider the fund to be a ""PFIC"" (Passive Foreign Investment Company), which has its own tax methodology, and IRS Form 8621 would be due. Penalties for non-reporting foreign accounts are significant, including potentially 50% of the value of the account.

Clearly, the IRS has an increased interest in Bitcoin which necessitates proper compliance with respect to Bitcoin assets. The IRS offers opportunities to come into compliance before the IRS obtains information about unreported assets (virtual or actual) and income, including via a pre-emptive voluntary disclosure (offshore or domestic) of digital currency income and accounts.

personalfinance,Broke College Student seeking Private Loan Advice,"Hey guys, first time posting here and I was just wondering if I could get some advice in taking out private student loans.

Im already 20k(subsidisized and unsubsidized) in debt  from federal loans and Im very worried about what kind of position I would be in financially.

personalfinance,"28, quit my job to pursue other interests, sold some investments, need some piece of mind.","Hey guys,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I would like some collective advice on life in general. I don't really have any adult figure in my life that has any grasp on their finances, and I don't trust anyone's financial advice in my life because it is usually chalked full of misinformation and some bull****. 

Anyway, I have recently make a ""big"" divest from cryptocurrency land and am looking to reallocatethese funds, but am also looking for a bit of advice all-up with my financials. I guess let me start by laying out some numbers on what I am holding, what I am currently doing, and what I was sort of planning on doing.

About me: US citizen, Late 20's, just quit my job (105k/y) to pursue a lifelong dream of living overseas, and think I am financially smarter than I am. I think I just have more luck than brains, though, as you will see from my portfolio.

Currently I am sitting on:

* $95,000 cash (depending on how taxes go, $6,000 or so of this will end up being a tax obligation for my bitcoin sale. I sold some of them overseas as an overseas resident and will pay taxes on them here too (I think? still looking into this) so I might need some advice on what this means for my tax obligation in both countries, or if it could be classified simply as a remittance?)

* $50,000 (at the time of this writing, anyway, haha) crypto currency. 18 Bitcoin and about 2 Bitcoin worth of alts (Ethereum, and some others). 

* $36,000 stocks - Split between mostly VTI, and some, what we'll just call ""Snowflake Wallstreet/Millineal darling"" stocks. I could elaborate, but that is not important.

* $13,000 401k, mostly left it in my old company stock because the military industrial complex isn't going anywhere. I probably should have contributed way more of my salary to this, as the company did a 50% match up to 4%-5%.

* $12,000 MTG playing cards calculated below TCG Low (I'm content with this investment, as I've had these cards a long time, but they are the only asset other than some fancy clothes that I have that are worth anything. My car is shit, the rest of my belongings could be cleared out in about a $1000 moving sale.

From what I have gathered lurking in this sub on my other account, people with a portfolio like mine is literally vomit inducing and anyone who suggests a portfolio like mine or has a large amount of money tied up in cryptocurrency or magic cards is a complete imbecile, but to be honest, they have outperformed any other high risk investment I was looking into at the time, and the volatility of the crypto market has taught me a lot of discipline in trading and how to profit (4 years ago, as you probably could imagine, I ended up giving back a lot of my profits after the big run-up and crash, because I was an inexperienced investor, ignored warning signs, and was just too damn greedy.

Currently I am taking year off work, possibly more, living in a foreign country pursuing a life-long dream of mine. During this time I probably won't have any job that matters financially (maybe bartending to improve my language skills and meet friends, for example), and am living pretty cheaply while I am here (rent is $600 a month, for example). Finances have been giving me anxiety because this is the first time in a while I've quit a job and said ""ok, well I have to be OK with going without a job for a year or more, and I don't want to spend all my time day trading cryptocurrency or Options contracts. I feel as though I am getting better at them, and they've taught me a lot about markets in general, but I need to force myself to step away from money, something that has been at the center of my universe the past decade or so (My Grandfather would be proud), and focus on myself (exercise, reading more books, making friends, and trying to keep my stress and anxiety levels in check while I go through this transition.)

Here are some things I am considering doing with the $95,000 so far:

* Opening a ROTH IRA, dumping max in for the year, and next year so that will be -$11,000 (Probably just going to open one with my Stockbroker?)
* Putting another $20,000 in index funds. So far I have slowly adding a few thousand everytime something crazy happens in the world that causes markets to poop themselves (My last addition to this was after Brexit, for example).
* I will need about $25,000 for rent, tuition, and expenses for the next year, which is giving me a generous budget to travel to surrounding countries between classes, provided I don't eventually work part time gigs here, which could give me back around half of that, I'd imagine.
* I have been looking into some other high risk funds, but haven't really given anything too much thought, but will probably look to allocate 10k across the market in some way.

So that leaves me with around $40,000 that I don't know what to do with.

Another point of anxiety is that I left a field that is booming right now. People are being offered ridiculous salaries that have my knowledge (One person just left our company for a large competitor who offered to double their salary). I have had similar offers and the opportunist in me is thinking I chose to pursue my lifelong dream at the wrong time, and that if I went back to work, I have a $140,000 p/y offer on the table for me (almost 40% increase...).

To wrap up, I'm debt free, in my 20's, single, and am by and large an idiot with trust issues when it comes to my money, but I would love any insight to my situation. I am finally realizing that although I have been extremely lucky with investments as an adult, and an extremely tenacious saver when I had a bad salary (the past couple years have been pathetic for my savings, and I was slowly addressing lifestyle creep at the tail end of when I was working.) I still don't feel very financially literate, on a macro level, but I imagine it is a lifelong struggle, I don't know.

Lastly: I'm assuming no one here is offering formal financial advice, aren't financial planners, so save yourself the disclaimer and just know that this would be the equivalent of me asking you ""If you had like 50k, how would you invest it?"" type of question.

Footnote: If you are going to bash my investment choices, or the fact that I am still holding large amounts of crypto, while I respect your opinion, and may sell that down myself over the coming months, I am not looking to be badgered on that. Please respect that choice. I am by no means advocating that anyone go put all your money in that stuff (especially now). I just made a bad decision chasing bad money with good, and 4 years later it somehow paid off. Also, don't worry about telling me the whole ""you shouldn't be looking for real financial advice from people on the internet"" routine, I know what I'm doing. I'm a big boy (sort of... I mean, I'm kinda tall?). Anyway, Thanks everyone and sorry for the long post. Somehow writing this out has made me feel a lot better today...

Edit: Formatting (Proper Bullet Points). Edit 2: I'm American, cuz that matters!

EDIT 3: 

Alright guys, so I've made a few changes to my allocations:

-Sold 5 Bitcoin (14k)

So that leaves me with $110,000 to allocate. Here is my draft on what I plan to do Monday:

-30k to my Foreign Bank Account to live off of for the next year, pay tuition, and travel to neighboring countries.
-$10k VTIAX (The suggestions in the wiki and other folks have lead me to believe I need some international exposure in my portfolio. Done.)
-$10.36k VTSAX or VTI (whichever my recent MSFT dividend payments fit into better, they seem identical for my purposes).
-10k VBTLX - is there an advantage to particular Bonds rather than a low fee index? I want to start investing in them slowly with a plan to have much of my stock positions in terms of Net Worth % transitioned to bonds.
-10k Bitcoin taxes - I realize that I probably won't have to pay that much, since these are old coins, but I want to be conservative come tax time.
-10k Ethereum &amp; other cryptos - Let's just call this the ""high risk"" category.
-$5,500

-This leaves me with 30k in my US account and 30k in my foreign account. Though I am looking at higher interest rate savings accounts, I am not sure if I should try and allocate those funds to their fullest potential, although another 10k in bonds does sound a little attractive...

Hello,

I am not entirely sure if this is the right place for it, and if it isn't feel free to remove this, but on April 1st of this year I placed an order from the Blizzard Gear Store (based in the US). I have done this before and am aware they use FedEx who there is often a considerable invoice for. After a while, I received the usual letters and eventually (admittedly with a bit of delay) I paid the invoice of £18.38 on May 16th. Now I've started receiving letters from FedEx regarding an invoice of £18.70 that needs to be paid. I haven't placed an order that I can think of, I've checked Blizzard and my emails along with my online bank account and aside from an Amazon order (Which is only of approximately £40 itself anyway) I can't find any orders I have placed from any site.

I know this is minor in terms of money but as a 17 year old hoping to go to university later this year, I'd rather cut back on unnecessary payments (and paying for things I haven't bought). 

As their final notice arrived on a Saturday, I am unable to actually pay the amount to them until Monday, which is naturally wonderful. I have sent them an invoice inquiry but that could take up to 10 days to sort, and the letter states that ""immediate payment"" must be received. 

Forgive me if this is seemingly obvious to sort, but this is fairly new to me and it sounds fairly urgent.

Greetings /pf!

So I've started back at my local community college for a degree in IT, cybersecurity specifically, and I am absolutely loving it. But I would like to take advantage of my deferment period to pay down my existing loans as much as I can. 

They're all federal. I borrowed ~$80,000 over the course of a BA and 2 MAs. All humanities. Yeah, I know. Since then, $13,000 of interest has capitalized, because my IBR payments have not covered the interest. 

Here's what a month looks like right now: 

Monthly gross income: $3,000


BILLS

Taxes: $600

mortgage: $485

health + dental: $120

utilities: $100 average but quite variable

cell phone: $50

internet: $45

car insurance: $45

Adobe CC: $50

Netflix: $10


EXPENSES

groceries: $175-$200

cats: $50

gasoline: $20

housewares, supplies, etc: $30


FRIVOLITIES

eating out: $25

running: $20 for one event/month

movies: $10


DEBTS

Student loans: $93,000 :(((((

Mortgage: $63,000


ASSETS

Inherited IRA: $55,000

SEP IRA: $10,000

Checking + Savings: $6,000


Now here are some strategies I'm entertaining:

Strat 1: Be as frugal as absolutely possible and send every $$ I can to Great Lakes. I'm thinking I can swing at least $600/month, maybe more? Also, find some ways to increase the income. 

Strat 2: Do strat 1, but also make a few pulls from my inherited IRA to take as much out of the unsubsidized portion ($30,000) as I possibly can. 

Strat 3: Take one BIG pull from the IRA to get rid of the unsubbed loans, then just save save save through school. 

Strat 4: something I haven't thought of yet, lol.

Ultimately, I WANT to pay these back. I don't want to go the forgiveness road. I don't think I could forgive [i]myself[/i], lol. And I'm freaking embarrassed that I borrowed so much money for what has turned out to be not a great investment. 

So I guess what I'm asking is two-fold:

1. Are there ways I can save money that I'm not seeing? Or ways to increase my income that are do-able, given that I currently work about 30/hours a week and am in a pretty intensive IT program? I feel like I'm burning the candle at both ends already, honestly. 

2. Is one of my ideas better than the others? Or, is there a better re-payment strat I've not thought of?",finance

personalfinance,Nursing School or Pay Down Debt?,"All together, my husband and I have about $28k in credit card/personal load debt in addition to $16,000 in student loans that I accumulated with my B.A. We've paid off two credit cards totaling $2,600 since January.

I make 35K at a nonprofit with unstable funding, and he makes anywhere between 32-35K a year with his growing business. At the end of next year, he's projected to make about 50K.

I decided that I would like to go into nursing, with the eventual goal of becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner. However, I'm not sure if it'll be smarter to pay off ALL of our debt first and then enter an accelerated BSN program, or to just go ahead and work on prerequisites and enter a program while paying down debt and working (projected to get into school spring of '19 if I started now). I'd have to stop working once in a program, however. I'd also have to take out more federal loans to complete the 4 prerequisite courses, which would add another 10k to my student loan debt, plus another 35-40k for the accelerated BSN program itself. 

In my mind, our earnings will be boosted to 90-100k once I finish school and we can aggressively pay down the newly accumulated debt. But, I want to be sure that I'm not being a starry eyed loon!",finance

I am a lawyer making about $100,000/year. My wife is a social worker making $60,000/year.

We have a five-month-old baby (our first), and will likely have another kid or two over the next few years.

We rent an apartment in New York City, although we are considering moving somewhere cheaper in the next few years. We would love to buy a home at some point, but I'm not expecting to be able to afford it for a while.

We have about $40,000 in savings and $30,000 in retirement investments between the two of us.

I get $300,000 for myself and $50,000 for my wife in group life insurance from my current job, but obviously I may not be in this job forever, especially if we move out of state.

Also, I have about $120,000 in student loan debt from law school, which I am paying off at a standard 10-year rate, with about 7 years remaining. And I get a decent amount of loan repayment assistance from my law school. My wife has about $75,000 in student loan debt and is planning for PSLF and currently only pays about $375/month in loan payments. All loans are Federal (so I believe cancellable upon death). 

We are both in good health, not over weight, no heart issues and don't smoke (although we never exercise).

How much coverage should I get for myself? For my wife? What length term? And which insurance carrier? How much should we expect to pay?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to get a personal loan in this situation?,"Summary: Medical debts and a desire to move to a more affordable place have me considering taking out a personal loan, possibly considering CC debt consolidation as well

Debts-

* Medical- 2K
* Credit Card- 2K
* Car note and student loans but those are under control

I currently make about 55K USD/yr in a HCOL, take home after retirement is around 3000 per month.

Currently I spend 1300/mo on rent/utilities, which was doable within my budget before my medical bills and switching jobs. My new job pays slightly less right now but will pay much more in 1-2 years. I had a minor surgery done which as of now I owe about 2K. 

My budget is so tight that I don't know how I'll pay it down in the short term so I'm thinking about moving to a more affordable place (I also spend about 2.5hrs a day commuting so I want to move closer to work for my personal sanity) as well as cutting back on some other areas

In order to move most places require 1st month/last month and a security deposit which given my current situation I'm unable to do. I'm thinking about taking out a personal loan of about $3000 to cover medical + moving, or $5000 to cover medical + moving + credit cards. 

By moving I would shave 60-90+ minutes off of my commute as well as free up ~$300/mo. I would also probably save an additional $75/mo on gas, so by moving I could save almost $400/mo which is how I would repay the loan

I also have 2 credit cards both with a $2500 limit on each (I try to keep the limits low as I'm still young and learning to better control my finances, I know a higher limit is better because of credit utilization rates but I don't trust myself that much yet). 

I'm approved for a $5000 loan, 3 years @ 18% interest, $172/mo. (My current interest rates on my CC's are around 22% but I've never paid interest on them yet) I plan on paying down the loan sooner than that, but those are the terms

Again, with the 5K loan I would consolidate all medical and credit card debts plus move into a new place that would shave 60-90+ minutes off my commute. By moving I would be freeing up an extra $400/mo which I could use to pay off the loan faster.

To me it makes the most sense to go with the $5000 loan, consolidate, move to a cheaper place and aggressively pay off the loan. Please let me know what you think, thanks",finance

personalfinance,Wife just accepted a job offer. I'm trying to rework our entire financial plan and need someone to check my math.,"My wife just graduated college last month and accepted a job offer on Friday. She's going to be a teacher, which forced me to learn all about pensions and to brush up on 457s and 403(b)s. I'm trying to figure out what a full year of our current earnings is going to look like in 2018 and beyond. I'm trying to aggressively save now that I've wiped out my student loans and basically want to max out every tax-advantaged vehicle available to us.  

I have a 401k available, while she has both a 403b and 457 along with a pension that takes 14.5% of her pay pre-tax. She does not pay into social security at all.  

Here are the numbers, with some slight rounding:  

Item|Me|Wife
:--|:--|:--
Gross|62,640|43,300
FICA+Medicare|4,791|628
Pension|0|6,282
401(k)|18,000|0
403(b)|0|18,000
457|0|18,000
Traditional IRA|4031|0
ROTH IRA|1469|0
FED|1447|0
State|1600|0 

**FICA**: I'm taking out 7.65% for myself, and only the medicare portion for her, 1.45%  
**Pension**: 14.5% out of her paycheck, pre-tax.  
**401(k)**: $18,000 for me + 1% employer contribution, reduces tax burden.  
**457**: $18,000 for her + 0.52% + $50/mo. employer contribution, reduces tax burden.  
**403(b)**: $18,000 for her, reduces tax burden.  
**T. IRA**: $4,031 to Traditional IRA. IRA deduction caps out at $99,000, so only $4,031 is eligible to reduce tax burden further.  
**ROTH IRA**: $1,600 to max out the $5,500 limit.   
**FED**: Assuming standard deduction and 2xPersonal Exemption  
**State**: State tax

I don't have any money going into my wife's IRA(s) because she runs out of money from her salary once the 403b, 457 and pension are filled up. I figure since those vehicles fully reduce our tax burden, the IRA actually takes a backseat in this scenario.  

Once you factor all retirement contributions and taxes, we should be left with $31,700/year or $2,640/month. Our COL expenses come in at $1,500 which leaves $1,140 each month of flexible spending that can go into a brokerage account or be used on whatever.  We will be putting away $59,500 into retirement accounts per year, and another $6,320 into her pension annually. 

The idea is that we'll have the 401k, 403b and T. IRA as our pre-tax pool, the ROTH and 457 will be accessible as soon as we retire along with any brokerage funds. The pension is in a weird spot because she can get a refund for her full contribution and roll it over into an IRA, or she can keep it there until we hit regular retirement age. I haven't done the math yet on what option would be best because it will depend on too many factors that aren't set in stone for us right now.  

I know this is really long-winded and I apologize. I've been crunching these numbers over and over again and I would really appreciate it if someone could double-check my math. Thank you in advance for even making it this far down the post!",finance
personalfinance,Pay Off or Save Up?,"I am being laid off in early September. I don't have a lot of savings, but am working hard over the next few months to save up as much as I can, which conservatively would be around $3500. I will likely be getting the full benefit from CA's unemployment, which is about $450 a week. I also have A LOT of credit card debt (around $14,500, I know, stupid mistakes and a poor understanding for the better part of my life). My monthly fixed expenses, including minimum credit card payments, are around $2000. So, I'll be using up every last dollar from unemployment every month while I job hunt.

The question is: Do I...

A) Pay off two of the lowest credit card balances (approx $3000) in September, and live solely off unemployment with no savings?

B) Continue paying the minimum on everything and have savings as a back up in case something goes wrong with unemployment?

C) Crack into the 401k (which stops being fed once the job is gone), which has about $5000 in it, and add that into savings, pay off the low credits, and live off unemployment?

D) A mystery option I hadn't considered?

personalfinance,Just filed taxes for the past 6 years. Are there late fees if I'm supposed to get a refund?,"Hello friends!  Thank you for taking the time to look at this dumbass question from myself, a dumbass.

For one reason or another, I didn't file taxes for the past 6 years.  It was dumb, I know, but I figured that I was going to be owed a refund each year, and it wasn't a huge deal.  Well, I just got around to filing said taxes and, as expected, I am due for a refund for each year.

I know the state level will be different, but, in regards to federal taxes, what kind of late fees or penalties am I looking at?  There's plenty of info out on the internet about late fees when you owe money to the IRS, but nothing about if the IRS owes you.  I could wait see what happens, but I'd like to be prepared for if the IRS comes knocking asking for more money.

Thank you in advance for help!",finance

personalfinance,i need advice. my debt worries literally give me seizures,"30 yo divorced male here. I dont want to get into specifics but I have a tech related degree from a very good school and i have no trouble finding well paying jobs - which really makes this more embarrassing hence the throwaway 

a few years ago my s/o left me, my job was stressing/pressuringme to epic levels and i started having seizures. i hit a depression and kind of gave up and just started stupidly spending money on anything i thought would make me happy. opened a bunch of credit cards, maxed them (like an idiot) and now im struggling to pay it down even making close to 6 figures.

several ambulance rides, mris, specialist visits, etc have also racked up a decent amount of medical debt despite having insurance. epilepsy sucks.

i do want to say im no longer doing the stupid shit financially that i was 1-2 years ago and i just want to start making some progress on paying these down because i worry non stop about it.

heres my basic monthly income/debt amounts.
cc's : 18k (interest is molesting me i feel like i can never pay them down atthis point)
student loans: 10k / 200 a month
mortgage/insurance/prop tax: 820 / month
internets: 50/ month
utilities:200ish/mo avgd over the year

i paid my medical bills immediately which may have been a mistake.

food im very frugal about and i use public transit to get to work and back.
no car payment or insurance i dont drive because of... epilepsy! i even sold my dream car... wrx... (for more than i bought it) because i knew it was financially dumb to have an expensive car and not be able to drive 9 months a year. After i sold it i bought a modest car (old outback) that i have no payment on and i can do every repair myself because i essentially took apart everything but the engine on my wrx (engineering is in my genetics) and all subarus are similar and easier to work on when they arent turbocharged with 375 hp.

if youre still reading, i admire you.

SO. bottom line. these credit card debts are murdering me. i hope anyone reading this can learn from my mistakes.

oh yes most importantly my income, 2600 bi weekly after taxes.

i own my home. ive never missed a mortgage payment. i have missed a couple cc payments and i know my credit score is provably shit im too scared to check it. 

please, all of you brilliant people here in personalfinance guide me to getting out of this cc debt hell hole. do i consolidate with one of those scammy looking services? do i call and tell them about my lifethreatening epilepsy and try to get s better interest rate? this shit stresses me out and gives me so much anxiety that it has caused me several grand mal seizures. but i know i can get through this im passed  the point of stupid spending now i need to know the best way to get out of it.

personalfinance,"Need some advice, RE: Personal loan or nah?","Alrighty. Hey guys I'm new to this sub and was told to ask here for some advice. 

I'm 25, single, take home about $2500 a month. I'm not the most financially responsible and have recently found myself in a -little- bit of a hole. I'm beginning to have difficulties paying my half of rent ($800) and while my roommate has been understanding, we both know that having to short my half by $100-300 isn't sustainable. I've been using a combination of budgeting apps, Albert, Clarity, and Mint to help me be more responsible but I can't seem to get ahead far enough before the next rainy day comes along. 

So far this year, I've had about $6k in unexpected bills which decimated both my credit card limits and meager savings. Looking at all my debts and bills and such, Albert's ""financial health"" breakdown suggested taking out a small personal loan. I was considering taking out a loan of $3000 to pay off some of my credit cards, catch up on the handful of bills I'm in a cycle of paying late, and possibly build a little bit of a cushion. None of my cards are terribly high in terms of credit limit, a combined line of ~$4000, but all are near or at max. One is fairly new, $2500 (still have about 12 months of no interest,) one is $1000, the other is $450.

Problem is, my credit is in the very low 600s and I can't seem to find a decent interest rate. The lowest I've managed to find is about 65%. Payments are affordable, they're lower than my card payments + interest fees monthly. 

My question is probably obvious, but is a personal loan worthwhile? If so, what should I pay down first? I'm trying to stop the bleeding before I nickel and dime myself into a substantial hole, but am afraid that taking out a loan will only make things worse in 6-8 months. Help please!",finance

gaming,"I just started my latest and greatest Fallout 3 campaign, The Wrath of Pistol Pete!","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Eaton

Pistol Pete, born Frank Eaton, was an expert marksman, Marshal, and blacksmith.

&gt;Eaton was born in 1860 in Hartford, Connecticut, and at the age of eight, he moved with his family to Twin Mound, Kansas.

&gt;When Eaton was eight years old, his father, a vigilante, was shot in cold blood by six former Confederates, who during the war had served with the Quantrill Raiders. The six men, from the Campsey and the Ferber clans, rode with the southerners who after the war called themselves ""Regulators"". In 1868, Mose Beaman, his father's friend, said to Frank, ""My boy, may an old man's curse rest upon you, if you do not try to avenge your father"". That same year, Mose taught him to handle a gun.

&gt;At the age of fifteen, before setting off on his mission to avenge his father's death, he decided to visit Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, a cavalry fort, to learn more about how to handle a gun. Although too young to join the army, he outshot everyone at the fort and competed with the cavalry's best marksmen, beating them every time. After many competitions, the fort's commanding officer, Colonel Copinger, gave Frank a marksmanship badge and a new nickname. From that day forward, Frank would be known as ""Pistol Pete.""

&gt;During his teen years, Eaton was reputed to be faster on the draw than Buffalo Bill. From his first days as a lawman, he was said to ""pack the fastest guns in the Indian Territory."" By the end of his career, Eaton would allegedly have eleven notches on his gun.

&gt;Frank Eaton lived the life of a true cowboy. He usually carried a loaded .45 Colt and often said ""I'd rather have a pocket full of rocks than an empty gun."" He was also known to throw a coin in the air, draw and shoot it before it hit the ground. The common saying in the mid-western United States, ""hotter than Pete's pistol,"" traces back to Eaton's shooting skills, along with his legendary pursuit of his father's killers.

That's what you need to know.

After reading about Pete, I decided to dust off my Fallout 3 disk and create the greatest cowboy in the Capital Wasteland.

His starting SPECIAL skills were assigned symbolically.

5 Strength (about average)  
6 Perception, because of his good aim.  
6 Endurance, because he spent years training.  
6 Charisma, because of his reputation.  
6 Intelligence, because lawmen need to be smart.  
10 Agility, because of his speed and effectiveness with a pistol.  
1 Luck, because he doesn't need luck.

Tagged skills were assigned based on usefulness. Barter, Medicine, and Small Guns.

During and after the escape from Vault 101, I only used the 10mm pistol Amata gave me (she represents Mose Beaman) and sold every other weapon that wasn't a lead-bullet pistol.

After arriving at Megaton, I talked to Lucas Simms and Mr. Burke, then got Burke to kill Simms. I took the sheriff's hat and duster, then sold Burke's shit to Moira. I dropped the sheriff stuff in the bomb water to rinse it off, then put it on. For the rest of the game, this is the only set I'll wear, no matter the circumstances. I sold every apparel item that wasn't sheriff stuff.

When my character is strong enough, I'm going to find the Regulator HQ and kill them all. Because of the events that transpire during the main story, the Enclave are my father's killers, so I'll kill all of them, too.

For the rest of the game, I'll only use pistols (10mm, .32, and .44) to maintain the Pistol Pete name, though I'll stick to the .44 when killing important enemies. When out of ammo, I either use brass knuckles or frag grenades, because they're like rocks (refer to the above statement about a pocket full of rocks)

The first skill I'm maxing out is Small Guns, because Pete was an expert marksman. After that, I'm doing Medicine (to survive tough battles; the duster and hat have shitty DR) and Sneak (Sneak Crits are the best)

It's really fun so far. With Small Guns at 100, the 10mm pistol is OP (it two-shots most Raiders), though the .44 will be excellent on larger foes.",technology

Through state and school grants, I have been awarded the full cost of tuition plus $3,000 with the option of taking $8200 in federal loans ($4500 subsidized) for this year. 

I plan to continue to work a modest amount in order  to pay for the majority of my living costs. My SO is also able to cover a larger portion of expenses if I find that I need to cut down on work more significantly than I planned. Thus, I am fairly certain that I will not require the full amount in order to cover the costs of attendance. 

I am strongly considering the idea of accepting the full amount for this year and next with the intention of putting away half or more to contribute to grad school costs, since a large portion of the grants I am receiving will only be available to me during undergrad. In this scenario, I would plan on making monthly payments on the unsubsidized loans to cover at least the interest they would accrue while I finish school. I am hoping this might make it possible to avoid PLUS loans and a larger balance when all is said and done. 

If I were to save a portion of my loans, I would also opt to move that money into my SO's account when the time came to file for FAFSA, so that they would not impact my EFC for the following year.

The cost of tuition is roughly around 4,600 each term or 13,800 for the entire year. Books cost about 300 each term but I normally find them used or buy from friends if possible. FAFSA and my financial aid package have been released for only 11,100. This summer I will be working around 60+ hours to make around 5,000 dollars at the end of summer, and I always work part time during the school year. I am financially independent from my parents and they can't help support my financial need. 

I also still need to find a place to live near campus's for the next school year and a way to pay for it. A cheaper rent with utilities in my area would cost about 600 each month. Most places also require a co-signer because I don't have rental history or a significant income to get approved for renting. My parents refuse to consign. 

Other expenses would be food, phone (100.00) (going down this summer) and internet (50.00)

Before winter term started I had a pell grant 1,000. The Oregon opportunity grant 700. And bridge to success 2,200. But now the university says my need isn't great enough for those anymore. Here is a break down of my loans I have accumulated and the loans for next year.

personalfinance,Will I regret paying off this mortgage early?,"Hey folks,

Posting this via a throaway for obvious reasons. I'm trying to decide whether or not I should pay off my mortgage and I'm at an impasse. You folks seem like you know what's going on, so if anyone's got any advice I'm all ears.

Some background: 

* Mid-30s, gainfully employed 
* $200k/year salary plus RSUs - total is in the $600k/year range IF I sell any of the stock 
* $1.3m-ish spread across retirement and taxable accounts - call it 30% retirement 70% taxable 
* Boston area 
* Original price of condo $450k, estimated value currently in the $550-$600k range 
* $350k left on the mortgage
* 4.25% interest rate on the load with 3 years left on a 5/3 ARM. Yes, yes, I know; cause of this has since been fixed. If I stay in the house I'll clearly be refinancing.
* On track to semi-retire within 5 years

I recently cashed out a bunch of RSUs, which brought me from $700k up to the $1.3m. That cash is just sitting in my brokerage account waiting for me to do something with it, and while my original plan was to just plow it straight into my standard ETFs the numbers here are significant enough to give me pause. What's really eating at me is that this market we're in feels like it's almost peaked, and I'd hate if I were to make a significant purchase only to have it drop significantly over the next few months. And then that makes me think that the prudent thing to do is just pay off this mortgage and get the guaranteed return while I wait for this economic circus to sort itself out.

The flip side of this is that the condo I'm in right now is in no way my forever home, and my plan had always been to sell it or rent it out within 5 years - and I'm torn on which of those I'll wind up doing. If things go according to plan I'll be able to semi-retire within 5 years, and then I'm out of city life and into something much more my speed (i.e. quieter and more rural). But that also depends on the market doing well, my company doing well, etc. Uncertainty all around.

personalfinance,Addicting additional Authorized Users,"Im not huge into credit cards but have had the same Chase Freedom card for the last decade. It is in great standing but only has an $1800 limit. It is my only card. I have been denied an additonal raise on the card (unless I upgrade to the unlimited), but am reluctant to upgrade it because I will lose the great interest rate attached (4%).

My wife has two cards, through Capital One, with a combined $12k limit, but has only had them for 3-4 years.

Is there any added benefit to adding one another as an additional user on one another's credit cards? We are planning on buying a second home soon and have read that having more years and a higher limit can lead to a better credit score. Is this true?

personalfinance,(27M) Help me get on track for the future!,"I'll try to lay out my current situation as i'm basically trying to come up with an overall plan for getting on track for the future. I currently make $16.20/hr which is gross around $33,700/yr. Sometimes I can get overtime which puts my total monthly net income at around $1900-$2k/month (this is after 401k, health insurance, dental, and taxes)

Expenses:

Auto loan - $294/mo. (min payment) Owe $11,095.74 at 9.55% APR - Have been paying $350/mo.

Car Insurance - $195.16/mo.

Cell phone - $100/mo. (can expense $40/mo. through work, so effectively $60/mo.)

Internet - $76/mo. (only pay this to help my folks, so I do not have to pay rent)

Eating out/groceries/etc - $300/mo. (based on the higher months - sometimes this is much less)

Gas - $60/mo.


Checking: $900
Savings: $3,000

I am currently contributing 6% to my 401k and company matches 3%.  

Basically - should I bolster my emergency fund even more before aggressively paying my car loan off faster (due to the high interest rate) or a combination of both?  My short term goal is to get my car paid off.  How much can I afford to save/pay?  Should I put more into my 401k?  I only started contributing in March of 2017, so there is very little in the account currently.  I am 27 years old.

My intermediate goal is to purchase a house (is 2-3 years possible?).  House would be in the $90k-$120k range.

Long term goal - Retire extremely comfortably, never have to worry about money until retirement.  I am not interested in retiring early, and I may continue to work a few years past 65 as I enjoy it.

I have $2,000 in the bank right now.

1) What's my best course of action here?  I know the math behind leasing can be terrible, but would it make sense in my scenario? $0 down and the ease of minimal negotiation make it tempting... I've never had to buy my own car before and leasing sounds easy.  Is taking out ANOTHER loan to buy a used car a better option?  I'm also currently uninsured, so I need to take this cost into account.


2) I'm nervous my inward cash flow isn't enough to get the ball rolling on student loan payments as fast as I'd like.  Between rent/utilities/food/car/insurance it doesn't seem like I'll be left with much surplus cash to pay off the loans.  Is this manageable?

-No debt except for 14 months left on a car payment (190/month, for 2013 Corolla)

-Credit score above 800

-Expected gross income after graduation projected to be minimum of 70k/yearly



I was lucky enough not to have any student loans from my first time in college, and so am trying to navigate my options. I am looking at borrowing about $30,000 total at maximum over the course of 2 years. I project that I will need $15,000 the first year, followed by potentially less than that the second year. But, safe to say $30,000 would be the most I would need.



So, my question involves my options regarding loans. I am eligible for 18k a year in federal government unsubsidized loans. I only need 15k, so I would get 7,500 disbursed to me (minus fees) at the beginning of each semester. The current rate is 6% on these loans, and naturally I have come to the conclusion that this is probably the best option with regards to the protections provided (not having to pay back the loan if I pass away, etc.) 



Is there any way in which private loans from a bank would make more sense? My credit score is pretty good, and I am interested in shopping around before making any quick decisions. In quickly thinking over this, I have thought about the option of getting a private loan and buying life insurance to cover it in case something should happen. (Just an example of one way to make up for the added benefits of the government loans available.)



Second, regardless of which route I go with getting the money, what option would be best for a bank account that accrues interest? Is it worth any extra hassle to make this happen? I would be getting 7,500 at the beginning of each semester and would need it roughly at the rate 1,500 a month. So, there would be large amount (to me) of money sitting in the bank for most of the semester.",finance

personalfinance,"Do you agree with this article that it is better to invest in a Roth IRA for your child's college fund, rather than a 529?","Copied from: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3-reasons-to-use-a-roth-ira-to-save-for-college-2015-03-25

For some time now, the cost of a college degree has been rising at perilously high rates. For many, the dream of one day going to college remains just that ... a dream.

With college tuition and associated costs rising so dramatically, it's no surprise that people are looking for new and creative ways to save for these expenses. One such alternative method involves the use of Roth IRAs over more traditional college savings vehicles, such as 529 plans and Coverdell education savings accounts.

It might seem unusual using a retirement account to save for education expenses when there are plans specifically designed for that purpose. Nevertheless, here are three reasons why it may not be as crazy as you think:

**1. Roth IRAs aren't included as an asset on the Fafsa Form**

When a child goes to college, if they want to receive student aid, the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (Fafsa) is pretty much a must. There are well over 100 questions on the Fafsa form, many of which are financial in nature and designed to help calculate what's known as the expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC is essentially the amount that Uncle Sam thinks a person should pay for their own education and it is calculated, in part, based on the assets of a student and their parents.

When reporting assets on the Fafsa form, most assets, including 529 plans, are included in the calculation. That means by doing the ""right"" thing and diligently saving for a child's education in a 529 plan — a plan expressly designed for that purpose — parents can end up increasing their EFC, reducing or eliminating the amount of financial aid their child would otherwise qualify for. That doesn't seem fair, but don't blame me. I don't make the rules.

On the other hand, Roth IRAs — along with other retirement accounts — aren't considered assets when determining a family's EFC. There's no cap to that amount either, so you may actually be able to accumulate significant sums in a Roth IRA and still qualify for student aid for a child.

**2. Roth IRAs are more flexible**

As noted above, 529 plans are expressly designed for use to pay for qualified higher education expenses, like college tuition. To encourage you to contribute money to such an account, Congress created special tax breaks. As long as 529 plan distributions are used to pay qualified higher education expenses, distributions are 100% tax free (in some states, you may also be entitled to a state income tax deduction). So, for example, if you contribute $5,000 to a 529 plan and it grows to $20,000 by the time your child goes to college, the full $20,000 can be distributed tax and penalty free (provided it's used to pay qualifying expenses).

That all sounds great — and it is — but if for some reason the funds in the 529 plan aren't used for qualifying expenses, the distributions can go from being tax free to being quite pricey. In addition to being subject to income tax, any gains are assessed a 10% penalty. True, a 529 plan set up for one child's benefit can be transferred for the benefit of another qualifying family member, but such a person doesn't always exist.

For obvious reasons, parents are often encouraged to start saving for college as early as possible. How are you supposed to know for sure though, if your five-year-old child (or, perhaps, grandchild) is going to go to college? Or what if — and I dare to even say it — they get a scholarship?

If, however, instead of saving money in a 529 plan, you saved the same money in a Roth IRA (you could still earmark some or all of it in your own way for education) and no longer needed those funds for education, it's an easy and tax-efficient transition to use those funds in retirement. If you actually did need to use the funds to pay for a child's college expenses, the Roth IRA may even provide the same tax efficiencies as a 529 plan. Which brings us to our third point ...

**3. Roth IRAs may provide the same tax-free treatment for distributions**

The primary purpose of contributing funds to a 529 plan is to be able to enjoy tax-free distributions for education purposes, but a Roth IRA often provides the exact same tax benefits. If you are over 59 ½ at the time you take distributions from your Roth IRA and you've had any Roth IRA for five years or longer, then anything you take out of your Roth IRAs will be 100% tax and penalty free. That's true whether you use the funds for education-related expenses or for any other purpose. With shifts in societal trends and more people waiting to get married and have children, it is increasingly common for education-related expenses to be incurred after the five years/59 ½ requirements are met.

Even if you're not 59 ½ (or haven't met the required holding period) at the time education-related expenses need to be paid, you may still be able to take funds out of your Roth IRA tax and penalty free. Roth IRA contributions can be distributed at any age, and at any time, 100% tax and penalty free. So, for instance, if you contribute $5,000 a year to a Roth IRA for the next 10 years before your child goes to college (and take no distributions in the interim), at the very worst, you'd be able to take $50,000 tax and penalty free from your Roth IRA.

In addition to Roth IRA contributions, amounts converted to a Roth IRA may also be able to be distributed tax and penalty free. Even if you're under 59 ½, Roth IRA conversions can be withdrawn tax and penalty free as long as the conversion took place five years ago or longer. So, for example, if you convert $100,000 to a Roth IRA today at age 50 and need to take that $100,000 out in six years to meet education expenses, the entire amount will be tax and penalty free. Here's what's even better... If you wait until you're 59 ½, any gains you earned on that $100,000 while it was in your Roth IRA will also be able to come out tax and penalty free. That's a pretty sweet deal.

So as you can see, there's more than a few reasons to consider a Roth IRA as a savings vehicle for a child's education. That said, everybody's situation is different and you should always evaluate all of your options to see what's best for you and your family.",finance

Hello, I am a worker on base that is a dependent to a retired vet. 

I was planning on saving up for a laptop for school but for the employees on base we are going to receive 20% off on all items for about a week as employee appreciation... The catch is if I use a military star card. (10% off for all other forms of payment)

Here might be the red flags for those out there who know a lot more than I. 

**I have never owned a credit card before**

**I will not be able to pay the laptop off in full**

&amp;


**I am only intending to get this card for the laptop.**

Lets go to point 1, I have never owned a credit card. I have a debit card, but never had to deal with a credit card. This is a credit card, to those familiar with the star card that you are only allowed to use on military installations. It has a 10.24% apr and once I lose access to the base (23 yo) I will be unable to purchase anything with it. I am not aware the consequences of owning a credit card and not being able to spend it. (there is no monthly fee)

2nd, I unfortunately do not have the funds. as a result a laptop that I could save up for at 600 USD would be seen as serviceable, but the laptop that I would be getting for 720 USD would be a future proofed laptop that will last a much longer time. 

720 USD is because of the 20% off for employees and then a 10% off on first day of purchases with the card, which is what I intend to use the card for. 

Now if I do 200 Dollars of each paycheck, then i'd still have around 320 USD after the first month, with the 10.24% apr which I have no idea on how it will work. Customer service told me that interest is based on remaining balance, not starting balance. 

I do plan on paying off the card ASAP but in moderation. 

3rd, I only want to use the card for this purchase. I am not aware of any consequence of owning a credit card and not spending it. If I need to I can use it for gas (5 cents off gas) or 10% off at the food court but besides that I do not want to trap myself into paying off credit card bills every paycheck instead of buying things with debit. 

So I guess this is where I need help, you have seen my selfish reasons to get a credit card and potentially change/ruin my life, but i'd like your input on this situation.

Will I be making a huge mistake to get a credit card for one item? 

Will I be making a mistake in owning a credit card and never spending any of the balance on it?

Will I be hurting my credit by not using it?

Thank you for your advice.

btc,"The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was also a ""Compromise"".","After the crash of 1907, the Republicans of the day wanted to instate a blatant central bank run by Wall St bankers, this was known as the Aldrich Plan http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/essays/general/a-brief-history-of-central-banking/aldrich-plan-(1910).php

&gt; Senator Nelson Aldrich, Frank Vanderlip of National City (Citibank), Henry Davison of Morgan Bank, and Paul Warburg of the Kuhn, Loeb Investment House met secretly at Jekyll Island, a resort island off the coast of Georgia, to discuss and formulate banking reform, including plans for a form of central banking. The meeting was held in secret because the participants knew that any plan they generated would be rejected automatically in the House of Representatives if it were associated with Wall Street.

This plan didn't exactly come to fruition, as the Democrats took back over the majority of Congress they instead passed the [Federal Reserve Act of 1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System). 

&gt; Noted in a paper by the American Institute of Economic Research:
In its final form, the Federal Reserve Act represented a compromise among three political groups. Most Republicans (and the Wall Street bankers) favored the Aldrich Plan that came out of Jekyll Island. Progressive Democrats demanded a reserve system and currency supply owned and controlled by the Government in order to counter the ""money trust"" and destroy the existing concentration of credit resources in Wall Street. Conservative Democrats proposed a decentralized reserve system, owned and controlled privately but free of Wall Street domination. No group got exactly what it wanted. But the Aldrich plan more nearly represented the compromise position between the two Democrat extremes, and it was closest to the final legislation passed.[6]

Essentially, the bankers got what they wanted, a privately run central bank, under the guise of a compromise.

personalfinance,Student loan problem help (US/UK),"[Cross-posted from r/studentloans.]

Posting this on behalf of a friend. He has about $65K of student loan debt, split between several private and several federal (Stafford) loans. He's been on forbearances and deferments (not sure which kinds; economic hardship and temporary hardship, I think) until now, but the last one expired in January. He reapplied, of course, but the company's various paperwork screw-ups meant that he didn't receive a conclusive verdict until now. They denied him.

For the past six months, he's been paying the private loans (because they don't go into forbearance/deferment). He hasn't paid the federal ones because the loan company told him that the forbearance/deferment would be backdated to his application date. He's been in touch with them at least weekly since January, while the loans got deeper into ""delinquency,"" but they constantly reassured him that they were processing his applications and not to worry about the delinquency because it would vanish when things were sorted out. Long story short, the combination of their screw-ups and the ultimate outcome means that he's now six months delinquent on his federal loans, it's not going away, and he owes them $1400 he doesn't have.

His monthly payments are now $500 a month instead of the $250 they were with the forbearance/deferment. That's too much for him to afford, but that's not as bad as the delinquency and the overdue amount owed.
Of note: he is a US citizen and went to school in the US. All of his student loans are US-based. However, he now lives in the UK. Part of his financial difficulty comes from the fact that all of the forbearance and deferment options count gross income, but the tax rates and cost of living are higher in the UK than in the US.

Do you guys have any suggestions as to how he can address this? Any financial options he hasn't explored? (He's looked into consolidating both in the US and in the UK, but although it probably presents a better long-term picture, the monthly payments are too high for him to sustain.)",finance

We also have a $45,000 mortgage at 4.19% for some land we were going to build on. Plans changed but we still have the land to pay for unfortunately. It's worth $90,000 and have 2.5 years left on it paying $1,800 per month. 

Total position is something like:
-$73,000 in student loans
-$45,000 in mortgage
$23,000 in cash
$30,000 in retirement accounts

Monthly income = $8,400 
spending = $5,400 including food, rent, utilities, student loan debt, mortgage, transport. 

We save an additional $1,400 per month and the rest we have for discretionary spending. Anything not spent is put into a savings account. 

There is so much information in starting to second guess everything and my partner thinks I'm obsessed...what does personal finance think is the sensible option?",finance

personalfinance,"[REPOST]To anyone aware of the Military Star Card, do you think it would be good for a one and done deal, &amp; would it be alright for me to have a credit card for a facility I won't be able to access in 3 years?","**IF I WAS CONFUSING IN ANY WAY PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WILL ELABORATE MORE/CLARIFY**

Hello, I am a worker on base that is a dependent to a retired vet. 

I was planning on saving up for a laptop for school but for the employees on base we are going to receive 20% off on all items for about a week as employee appreciation... The catch is if I use a military star card. (10% off for all other forms of payment)

Here might be the red flags for those out there who know a lot more than I. 

**I have never owned a credit card before**

**I will not be able to pay the laptop off in full**

&amp;


**I am only intending to get this card for the laptop.**

Lets go to point 1, I have never owned a credit card. I have a debit card, but never had to deal with a credit card. This is a credit card, to those familiar with the star card that you are only allowed to use on military installations. It has a 10.24% apr and once I lose access to the base (23 yo) I will be unable to purchase anything with it. I am not aware the consequences of owning a credit card and not being able to spend it. (there is no monthly fee)

2nd, I unfortunately do not have the funds. as a result a laptop that I could save up for at 600 USD would be seen as serviceable, but the laptop that I would be getting for 720 USD would be a future proofed laptop that will last a much longer time. 

720 USD is because of the 20% off for employees and then a 10% off on first day of purchases with the card, which is what I intend to use the card for. 

Now if I do 200 Dollars of each paycheck, then i'd still have around 320 USD after the first month, with the 10.24% apr which I have no idea on how it will work. Customer service told me that interest is based on remaining balance, not starting balance. 

I do plan on paying off the card ASAP but in moderation. 

3rd, I only want to use the card for this purchase. I am not aware of any consequence of owning a credit card and not spending it. If I need to I can use it for gas (5 cents off gas) or 10% off at the food court but besides that I do not want to trap myself into paying off credit card bills every paycheck instead of buying things with debit. 

So I guess this is where I need help, you have seen my selfish reasons to get a credit card and potentially change/ruin my life, but i'd like your input on this situation.

Will I be making a huge mistake to get a credit card for one item? 

Will I be making a mistake in owning a credit card and never spending any of the balance on it?

Will I be hurting my credit by not using it?

Thank you for your advice.

The bankers clamored as loudly as they could that they were against the federal reserve bill because of a minor clause in it. The papers printed that the big banks were against it. So the public opinion was that ""if the big banks don't want this bill, we should probably vote for it"".

personalfinance,Family member wants to pay off my student loan,"As the title states I have a family member who recently expressed they would like to pay off my loans.  I have 35k in subsidized and unsubsidized student loans from the federal US government. This particular family member has a very high salary, as does their partner. They stated they want to take the burden off of my shoulders and that one day, if possible, I could repay them somehow. Is this a good idea to take them up on? I'm not really sure how to go about paying back 35k to a family member, when I would only be able to give about 1k a year in cash. I'm a teacher and I will never make much money. There is the option for the public service loan forgiveness program, but it requires I teach for 10 years straight and make income based payments for those 10 years. Also I can't miss a single payment or the ten years start over again.  I hate teaching. I don't want to teach for ten years of my life and regret feeling imprisoned and upset with my life for ten years straight. I would still be getting interest piled on for ten years too.

CryptoCurrency,Understanding Cryptocurrencies,"I wrote this bit and I think it's generally applicable to most cryptocurrencies, although I just now noticed that not all cryptocurrencies have mining.  I originally submitted it to /r/burstcoin and someone suggested submitting it here.

What is cryptocurrency and how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is money that exists only on computer hard drives. Here is how it works. First of all there is a thing called a ""blockchain"". A blockchain is a simple idea of a list of cryptocoins or coins and their owners. In an example blockchain Coin 1 is owned by Jim, Coin 2 is owned by me, etc. The interesting thing is if anyone wants to they can get their own copy of the blockchain and if they have a computer on the internet, they can run programs that keep updating the blockchain and keep it current. If Jim gives me his coin 1 then the blockchain is updated by showing the transaction date and the new owner for coin 1. The blockchain shows the full history of ownership of each coin.

People are allowed to use their computers to mine new coins. People that do this are called miners. Mining works sort of like a lottery but your chances of winning coins increases when you have more computer resources. People with smaller computers form mining pools and they share the coins they have won with the pool members. Miners are important because not only does every miner maintain a current copy of the blockchain but they also record each new transaction and also maintain proper rules for the transactions. For example Jim can't give me coin #1 and then a second later try to give the same coin to Sally.

Who controls a cryptocurrency?

There is no central computer, just a group of interested individuals consisting of miners and coin owners. This is a key point. By contrast, the dollar is controlled by the U.S. government/Federal Reserve. The government can decide if and when to print new notes. When new notes are printed the overall value of the dollar becomes diluted and each note loses some value. Cryptocurrencies are always adding a small and predictable number of coins each day but the number is not enough to upset the value of each coin. Because only a certain and predictable number of new coins are created each day we know that someone can't cause the vaue of cryptocurrencies to drop by flooding the market with phony coins.

What controls the value of a cryptocurrency?

With cryptocurrency the value of a coin determined by market forces. The value of a coin depends on the demand for the coin and how much somone will pay. The prices tend to be volatile, going up and down over time. Cryptocurrencies use the same common system that stocks and commodities use. Basically we look at the list of people wanting to buy versus the list of people wanting to sell. If the list of people wanting to buy is greater than the people wanting to sell then the price goes up. If the sellers exceed the buyers then the price goes down and if the sellers equal the buyers then the price remains flat or unchanged.

What about cheating and fraud?

Cryptocurrency is immune from most forms of cheating. How can we know this? Because cryptocurrency is protected by strong crptography. That means that I can't create a transaction update that says that coin #10 was just created and I own it. It also means that I can't send out a transaction update that says that Jim gives me coin #1, only Jim can.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Canadian Resident Attending SFU this Fall – Need Help Budgeting,"Hello r/personalfinance! This fall, I will be attending the Canadian post-secondary institution, Simon Fraser University. 

Financially, I could be worse. Thanks to my father being employed at the university, my tuition is waived. Unfortunately, he is an ass. I honestly don't know whether I will be getting any money from him. Since I was young, he has been putting money into an account, I'm assuming savings, and **NOT** an RESP, for my education. RESP stands for Registered Education Savings Plan, meaning the account would be registered in my name, and I alone would be able to withdraw money. Since it is not in an RESP, he is able to do as he pleases with the money. Add this with the fact that he's generally not a good person, and you end up with potentially no money coming from him. I've been trying to follow up with him on this, but due to me not living with him and rarely contacting him anymore (my parents are divorced and I live with my mom), it's proven difficult.

On the upside, I have roughly CAD$3,700 from the RESP my mom set up for me. Add this to around CAD$1,000 of my own, and that's all I really have. I'm not currently sure whether or not I will be pursuing a graduate degree, so for all intents and purposes I will be budgeting for a bachelors.

Based on SFU's [website](https://www.sfu.ca/students/financialaid/costs/canadian-2017-18.html), I would be paying CAD$405 in fees, and CAD$1,020 in books and supplies for 3 semesters (one year). I will be living with my mother and commuting to the school to keep costs down. Multiply this total by 4, and you get a cost of CAD$5,700 for my degree, which is in all honesty not bad. This does not include food, miscellaneous expenses etc. but I can live frugally if need be. 

In regards to loans, here is SFU's [page](https://www.sfu.ca/students/financialaid/undergrad/loans/bc-res-full-time.html) on it, but it is run through [Student Aid BC](https://studentaidbc.ca/). It says on the website that I do not have to start paying my loans until after I have stopped attending schooling for 6 months, which is a relief. I'm not sure how interest rates fully work, but the BC portion of the loan is just prime (2.7%), whereas the federal portion is prime + 2.5% (5.2%). I will probably be scheduling a meeting with a financial adviser to get a better grasp of how loans work. 

I could be misguided with my plan, but essentially, I want to take out loans periodically to cover the costs of supplies as well as fees. I will then use my money on hand to pay against the principle over the course of my education, whilst also covering other costs, ie. the laptop I will be needing. Is this a good idea? or would I be better suited using my cash on hand to pay for what I can, and then relying on loans for the remainder? Is there a third, or fourth option I'm missing?

Here is the summation of my questions: 

* Is my plan sound? Are there better alternatives?
* Are there benefits to a large loan vs. smaller ones? ie. CAD$1,500 as opposed to CAD$500, CAD$500, CAD$500.
* How should I allocate my money so that it is used optimally? 
* I am looking at a ~CAD$1,600 laptop for my education, would this be financially insane? 
* Tips for keeping costs down?
* General life advice? 
* Good food recipes on the cheap? Lol

Thanks for any and all help that anyone can provide!

**tl;dr** Canadian attending SFU, tuition waived, have CAD$4,700 on hand, supplies + fees for 4 years = CAD$5,700, need student loans, most efficient way to use what I have?

personalfinance,"I might need to buy a car soon, I'm in my last year of professional school so my only income is loan money... please critique my financial strategy.","Hi everyone,

For the purpose of this post, please note that by ""new car"" I do not mean a new model, I mean ""new to me"".

Rationale for buying a different car:

I have a 2003 Grand Am that has 200k miles, AC doesn't work, blinkers work when I jiggle the emergency light buttons just right, tires are very worn and terrible in anything but dry roads (and no ABS), check engine light always on because of gas cap, etc etc. Mostly just quality of life/drive things. However, recently two things have started happening that make me concerned for the life of the car (and possibly mine I guess): 1. Sometimes on the highway in the middle of gears, the car still start ""stuttering"" a bit (only has happened from 60-75mph). I always just let off the gas, drop a few MPH, then continue on my way without any immediate follow-up problem. 2. Turning the key to turn the car on has gotten trickier and trickier, I have to hit just the right spot with the key and then it will turn on. I'm concerned that the ""sweet spot"" will turn into ""the car won't turn on"". 

My first question is, is this reason enough to buy a car? 

Financial questions:

I just started my last year of dental school, planning on going into the workforce June 2018. Getting a job outside of school is not an option until then. My student loans clock in at 5.31% APR. My credit union has a 36mo term auto lease for 2.49% APR. I was thinking that if my confidence shrinks in my car enough that I want to buy a new one that I would finance the car through the credit union and pay the minimum monthly payment with my student loan money until I start working (June 2018, prolly will be making 100k/yr). 

Now which car? I didn't know what to budget but I have calculated that if I get a 10k auto loan at 2.49%, the cost of borrowing (total loan cost-car cost) would be about $400. I am struggling on if I should spend that amount of money for a car that could realistically last me 10+ years, or is it more feasible in my long term financial strategy to spend $4k and probably have to replace the car in 3-5 years (but maybe not, who knows?) I'm not sure how to calculate the cost of paying the monthly payments with my student loan money... I have found $10K cars online that have from 45-60k miles and I would be planning on driving it until it's in the condition of my current car (10+ years). 

I guess I feel strange spending money I know I don't have for a car more than a beer at the bar, a night out with my girlfriend, etc. But I need a vehicle, and I would like a dependable one. Is it a terrible financial decision to spend 8-10k on a car in my current situation, or does it balance out that I have time (hopefully!) to thoroughly select the best value and hope that it will last me more than a decade?

personalfinance,Going back to school as an adult,"Hello /r/pf,

I'm a single 32 year old man. I have a very healthy chunk of investments relative to my age, partially in retirement accounts, and partially in taxable accounts. I make over $100k a year and save around 60% of my take home pay. No debt. I don't own a home, just a tiny 10 year old car (paid in cash). I know I'm ahead of the curve here, and I have good prospects in my current working field, but I've been recently thinking about a more long-term plan for my life, and I think I would rather pivot into a new, much less lucrative field that would be more personally rewarding.

Specifically I would like to look at options to become a counselor or therapist. I don't have a background in psychology and to make this transition I would need to earn an MS/MA in counseling or social work. The MS/MA would be a two year program, although I may need to take some undergraduate prerequisites first. After the masters I'd need to do a sort of residency in a clinic for a few years to earn my certification before I could practice on my own. I don't know anyone who has done this before, so I'm not aware of what options there are for adults who are transitioning to a new field. I never had student loans before, as my undergraduate costs were covered by a scholarship. I'm guessing I don't qualify for federal student loans, especially given my current income.

How would you recommend I save for this? I know there is 529 plan for college savings, but would that apply in my case? Can you take 529 money across state lines? Are there any other loan programs or options that I may be unaware of that could help?

Secondly, assuming I did decide to go forward with this plan, what would be a realistic timeline to transition from my current path to the new one?

A lot of people approach this as, well, 8$*365 = 2,900 $, and they make 30,000/year, so the result is 9.7% of their income! A lot of money, but maybe they like coffee a lot. However, I think think it's worth doing a bit more basic budgeting to show the real impact.

Taxes and deductions (Fed, State, Local, 401k, NO medical): How about 30% for this category? Maybe they get something back (# of dependents) but let's cover the bases. Forget medical because that's much too variable. 30k/yr *.7 = 21k. Now that coffee takes up 13.9% of their income. Bigger chunk, but hey, coffee is king.

What about other fixed expenses? Rent? Utilities? Cell phone? Car? Insurance? Loans? This next step is very personal, much like health insurance it can vary a ton, but my budget (including 600$/mo in rent and no car) is 1,000$/mo. So let's use 12k/yr in fixed costs. 9k left over to spend. The coffee is 32.2% of their free money. 1 out of every 3 dollars they spend freely goes to coffee. Ouch.

So what's the point? Well... the point is have a basic budget. Know what you make, what your taxes are, what your fixed costs are every month, and be realistic about your spending habits. If you want to spend 8$/ day on anything, make your own choice, but know the real costs. Personally, I wouldn't spend this much on coffee. But I understand there are other benefits to a choice like this that are personal. Coffee at Starbucks with your coworkers or family/friends? That's a social benefit you shouldn't ignore; it's worth a lot more than money. So yeah, substitute coffee for any vice you might have, and consider the real cost to you.

personalfinance,"I started saving $100+/month by shopping at a more expensive supermarket (aka the importance of always price-checking everything and not blindly trusting ""discount"" stores)","DISCLAIMER: I know this sounds like r/hailcorporate but I'm not advocating for everyone shopping at Whole Foods -- just reminding everyone to not make my mistake, and check out ALL of the local supermarkets in your area, *not just the discount ones*. The discount ones often aren't much cheaper at all, except when it comes to junk food.


I don't own a car, so like a lot of you folks I'm restricted to what supermarkets are on my bus route. There are three: Metro, Loblaws, and Whole Foods (ranked in order of expensiveness). I used to go to the ""discount"" supermarket, a Metro subsidiary, and I usually spent about $75-$100 a week for my boyfriend and I. I just assumed I was getting the best price because it was the ""discount"" grocer, so I bought all of my groceries there. Eventually I got fed up with at least 50% of my produce being rotten when I cut into it -- the Metro's produce was always either already half-moldy, or would be moldy in a day or two, and *it was expensive, too* Like $2-$2.50 for a bell pepper expensive. The produce at Loblaws was slightly better, but I still cut into rotten fruit too often for my liking, and it was more expensive -- I was spending $100-$150 a week for BF and I there.


One day I happened to go into Whole Foods (for the first time) just to get a soda. I noticed that like 80% of the store was absurdly overpriced, true to ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation, but the produce... was actually cheaper than at Loblaws and Metro? Anyway, I did a price test, to see how much a big homemade pot of salsa would cost with fresh ingredients from each chain. (Keep in mind I'm Canadian, our groceries cost more in general, plus I live in a Northern city that is especially expensive). About 8 cups of tomatoes, 1 cup jalapeno, 2.5 cups onions, 1.5 cups green peppers, garlic, canned tomatoes, lime juice, and some odds and sods like salt, sugar &amp; vinegar. At Loblaws, it cost me around $40. At Metro, it was $30. At Whole Foods, it was $20. For produce, Whole Foods was the winner -- despite being the fancy rich yuppie store. 



Anyway, I learned to always pay attention to where I'm buying what. I now shop at Whole Foods for my produce and proteins, and Loblaws or Metro for my prepared/processed foods (because anything with packaging is $$$ overpriced at WF). This gets me the best deal for all of my items. I find I usually just shop at Whole Foods now, because I hate doing two trips, so I end up eating healthier and only spending $50 a week for groceries for my boyfriend and I.



A side benefit: doing my main shop at a more expensive ""healthy"" supermarket helped me cut down on junk food &amp; impulse purchases. I'm inclined to buy a jumbo bag of Lays chips for $1.99 at Loblaws... not so much when it's a $6 bag of avocado oil chips. Similarly, I'll try that $2.99 Crystal Pepsi but I'm not paying $5 for a gd Yerba Mate.",finance
personalfinance,"Quit job, starting grad school- what to do with 401k?","Aloha! I've done some research on this thread (and other resources) but I'm still at a loss on what to do with my 401k, hope you guys can help! I'm in my late 20's and going back to school for my masters (MS in Nurse Anesthesia). I worked as an RN for 4 years and finally paid off all my credit card debt, car paid off, and a good chunk of my undergrad school loans. My ultimate goal before starting grad school was to pay off all debt, but to my surprise I got accepted into a grad school program. Anyway, I have $20k in my 401k from the job that I just quit (had to quit, advised not to work while in an intense program like this). I am maxing out on school loans ($65k), but I'm worried about the first year and how I will be making it financially.  The $65k loan is disbursed every 3 times (Fall, Spring, and Summer) but because tuition is so high and I'm taking way more units in Fall and Spring than Summer, I am only left with $2k in financial aid after tuition during Fall and another $2k after Spring tuition. Obviously making $4k stretch until Summer's disbursement (probably May or June) is not ideal, and since I am taking out the maximum amount of school loans, I'm in a rut! I've exhausted savings to pay off a huge mound of CC debt, so I am thinking my best options are either to: take out a personal loan (maybe a $10k loan at an interest rate of ~10%) or cash out my 401k from my previous employer. The cons of withdrawing my 401k seem awful, so if you think I shouldn't do that, should I roll it over into an IRA? Thanks for your help in advance, PF friends!

Other info that may be helpful:
-Offsetting school for another year or so isn't an option. I worked too hard to get into this program. Plus, I don't think it makes sense financially (will be going from an income of $100k to $175k). 
-My gross income for this year will be about $30k since I quit and won't be working again until after graduation (January 2020)
-Spoke to my schools financial aid office, they suggested personal loan or I can appeal the cost of attendance and see if I can get more money, but the problem with that is I don't need more than I am getting for the year, the problem is that the money is evenly disbursed and I am in troubleeeee since a good chunk of the money won't come until summer next year",finance
personalfinance,"Just got my first full-time job, should I max my Roth IRA or employer matched 401(k) first?","I'm sorry if this question is asked a lot, but I've read a bunch of discussions online and none have presented a concise answer to me.

I'm making $54,000 a year so that puts me in the 25% federal tax bracket and my state income tax rate is 7%. I'm required to contribute 9% to my 401(k) each paycheck and I'm budgeting to max my Roth IRA. My dad always told me it's best to contribute to the Roth first since I'm expected to make more money later in life with a better job and will be taxed at a higher rate. I'm 23 and work in IT so it's expected.

Is this sound logic given my current tax rates and 401(k) mandatory contributions? When should I max Roth then 401(k)? When should I do the opposite? I understand that 401(k) reduces taxable income now but does it make a significant difference at my rates?

I'm on track to put $7,500/year into my 401(k) with my contribution and employer match of 5%, then the $5,500 into the Roth IRA. With the current balance in the Roth, I'll be looking at a $10k balance at the end of the calendar year.

I realize that this does not include essentials like living expenses and groceries... those are covered by my fianceé as that's what we've agreed.

I really want to say that I've been doing OK... but I believe that I would by lying to my fianceé, myself, and Reddit.

personalfinance,One last collection remains on all three of my reports. How best to tackle it?,"I've been fighting to get some things removed from my credit report since January.

I found a locked topic on myficoscore forums that basically had some info from a user there, claiming that the recovery company that had two items on my record lost the ability to report to CRAs. So if you dispute it, it gets dropped off. Well, TransUnion was the last one to have this on my record according to CreditKarma.

The debt was being reported as a 1100 dollar charge and another separate one for 68 bucks. Same collection agency.

I called TransUnion last week because I had put in a dispute through CreditKarma for the 1100 dollar debt about 30 days ago and CreditKarma was showing no movement on my dispute. The lady I spoke with started a new dispute on the 1100 dollar debt over the phone.

I woke up to an email this morning that Expiran had an update on my dispute (yes I put in a dispute manually with them as well). Seems Experian dropped both the 1100 and 68 dollar charge completely off my record. Check CreditKarma this evening, same for TransUnion. 

So, now I am facing the last tiny bit of debt and I want to crush this bastard.

I have a 550 dollar debt from an apartment complex 4 years back. It's with ProCollect. I want to try to do a PFD but I have never done something like this. Does anyone have some helpful tips on how I can initiate a PFD request?

personalfinance,"Working two jobs, getting ready to buy my first house, getting by just fine but not having much/any savings at the end of the month. How much should I be saving and how much should I be using to pay off debts? Buying a house with no major savings is stressing me out.","Long post, so I apologize in advance and thank anyone who makes it through.  Just trying to figure out a budget for me and my fiancee to use when we strike out on our own, to prepare for our future.  

Little backstory, we both have some pretty serious medical issues that can make finding/keeping work hard, and I just happened to luck into two work-from-home (mostly) jobs that I'm good at.  My girlfriend works where she can (Freelance editor/copywriter) but has no consistent income to speak of.

Ignoring the fact that working 70+ hour weeks is awful and probably not sustainable for 30 years, for the past 8 months I've got two jobs paying about $45,000 each.  One of them, however, is a 1099 so I have to take my own taxes out and it also means that at the end of the year I'll end up owing (rough math) about $26,000 in taxes.  Not super high cost of living in my area, but medical expenses and only having me for income does limit things.

I also have been living it up for years, trying to make up for a lot of crappy ones by travelling and eating out and partying and buying nice things, didn't ring up a ton of debt but also didn't save anything even though I've made decent money and had very little expenses for a long time (5 years).  My fiancee has had a lot of debts but we've been slowly paying them off.

Right now, I owe $13,000 on my car and she has about $1000 left on hers (been paying hers off since it has the highest interest rate).  About $1000 left in no interest financing on a TV.  And then she has about $40,000 in student loans that we haven't put a dent in.  That's the total of our debt right now.

Monthly expenses right now are:

       $450 for medication
       $1000 for food/groceries/toiletries (we eat out a ton, we're working on driving that down but not having a real kitchen makes it hard)
       $270 for my car
       $260 for her car
       $190 for car insurance (both)
       $80 for cell phones
       $60 for gas
       $60 for car maintenance (saving for periodic oil changes, car washes, etc.)
       $60 for home entertainment (Netflix, Google Play Music, Usenet, gaming, etc.)
       $100 for going out (movies, events, etc.)
       $40 for gym
       $40 for hobbies (drumsticks, etc.)

       Total: $2,610/month

This is the first real budget we sat down and wrote out instead of winging it.  It doesn't include things that we are bad at gauging (intermittent expenses like haircuts, clothing, etc.) and our eating out/going out/buying crap expenses have been out of hand recently so we're trying to reign that in and this is what we think we can stick to.

Oh, and it doesn't include health insurance which I get now through my Dad's work due to my condition but won't when I finally move out.  Not sure on the numbers for her health insurance exactly either but of course the ACA might not even be there so those numbers are anyone's guess a few months down the line.

As for income:

    $4000 for 1099 job
    $430 x 2 for my biweekly checks from the other job

What's being withheld/saved:
 
    $1000 that I take out and put into savings for taxes from 1099 check
    $941 x 2 federal withholding from 2nd job
    $75 x2 state withholding from 2nd job
    $281 x 2 for Roth 401k from 2nd job
    $56 x 2 for some kind of investing that I'm not super clear on with second job

With all the extra money we're either spending it on fun stuff/living it up, or more recently we've been using it to pay off my computer, her car, all the outstanding things we've been checking off the list for the past few months.

However, we still have those big looming student loan debts out there that we are ignoring.  She's been able to defer payments for the past couple of years because she hasn't made much money, but it's just growing out there.

We've got a few thousand in savings and right now we're looking at some $160,000-$175,000 range houses and just guessing at what it will take when all is said and done at hopefully around $1200-$1500/month.  We're REALLY ready to get out, so while it's probably best advice to stay here and pay down all debts and get a huge nest egg before moving out we're gonna buy anyway.

Now, ideally, I'd like to find a way to keep my expenses low enough that we can get by if I lose one of my two jobs, since it's hard to replace either of them with something flexible enough to let me keep the other.  I think we could do it with $1000 in house expenses, but not with any savings left over at all and not with paying down her student loan debt.

Just looking for some insight on our budget.  Obviously our expenses will go down as we can cook more when we have a house, and her car payment will go down.  She also pays a lot in car insurance which I'm hoping maybe we can get down.  I work from home so I don't put much mileage on my car but do need it.

I feel like we need to be saving more because with our health issues there will likely come a time when I have to cut way down on work, and she basically can't work at all until her health issues get sorted out which is taking months and has no real end in sight.  We've got some looming settlement money from an auto accident, but I don't like factoring that into my calculations.

I also feel like we should be trying to pay down the student loan debt.  It sucks that we've got all this outstanding debt from an English degree that's not giving us any return but it is what it is, maybe somewhere down the line it will help.  For now, though, it's just a big shadow hanging over us.

Am I crazy for looking at houses?  Can anyone come up with a better budget or tell me things to adjust that will allow us to move out, save up for retirement, and also pay off our debts?  There's potential for me to move up at one company and maybe make more there than both jobs combined some day, but if not I'm hoping to have these two jobs for at least another few years if the stress doesn't kill me.  Hopefully that's enough to put a dent in a mortgage and those loans, but I'm just not sure where to start.

I suck with finances and this is our first real attempt at putting numbers on paper for a budget, so I'd love some advice.  Honestly just typing all this out has helped sort things in my head a little and seeing the numbers in black and white makes things seem more manageable, but I'd love some outside perspective from some of you guys who definitely have your shit together so we can get our shit together too.

I still consider myself a rookie when it comes to finances. I came from a fairly poor family and this is the first time I've actually been able to save and invest.

So a little about my current situation. I currently work an hourly position that pays $26.50 an hour, so around $55,000 a year, but I do get a decent amount of overtime, usually 10 hours per week. My paychecks typically are between $1400 and $1,800 biweekly depending on overtime. My employer offers a 401k that matches 3%, and allows me to make both traditional and Roth contributions. I am currently contributing 12% of my income to traditional 401k and 6% to Roth. This only takes out of my base pay so my overtime does not incease contributions. This comes out to about $10000 per year. I also max out my contributions to my HSA so another $3500 per year. I have $5000 in my savings account that I treat as an emergency fund. The saving account has a 0.1% APY. 

As for my debts, I have just started paying off my student loans which is down to $29,500. The interest rates on the loans range from 3.4% to 4.6%. I have two credit cards but I pay them off every month so I don't have a problem there. Mostly just use them for the cash back rewards. My monthly bills and spending averages around $1000-$1200, this does not include student loans. I am living at home with my mom right now, but I help pay bills and buy groceries. I am looking to get an apartment or rent a house within the next year or so. Other than that I don't see any major expenses coming up soon. 

So I would like advise in a few areas. Should I put most/all of my spare money into paying off student loans, or should I maybe increase contributions to my 401k? Increase savings? As for the 401k, does it make sense to do both traditional and Roth contributions? Which would be more beneficial? I am also wondering about moving my saving/ emergency fund to another account that makes more interest. If you have any recommendations as to where to move my emergency fund, feel free to share. Any other advise that you think would be beneficial in my situation would be greatly appreciated.",finance
Bitcoin,Getting into bitcoin. need it for a certain something. Can someone help me out?,"I need to get into bitcoin for its anonymity. I plan on playing online poker, and i am located in washington. Which is illegal to do in washington state. and thus, need bitcoin for its anonymity. no one has been ever indicted or anything, since feds doesnt bother going after u for this, but since its still illegal on paper, would rather be safe than sorry.

So i was wondering if someone can give me some input and answer my questions.

1. how anonymous is bitcoin? i need to use it to deposit/withdraw to the site. is there any way for people to track my location?
2. how safe is bitcoin? is it ""lose proof""? what i mean by this is if my account gets hacked, or if i forget my login details, am i just screwed and its gone forever? or can i call in and get my log in ID and/or PSW back?
3. are there big fees in depositing/withdrawing bitcoin? I heard there was, and i read there was. but i am not so 100% sure WHEN it has fees.
4. does it really matter which wallet to use? I was thinking coinbase",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Graduated college, Parents $350k in debt and they want my help / Parent Plus loan refi?","Hi Everyone,

I'm looking for more info on options with Parent Plus loans. I've explained my specific situation below.

Background info: only child, dad owns his own business, mom helps him (she was previously a personal banker)

I went to a 4-year university out of state and accrued some amount of student loans. Personally, I have $28k in federal subsidized/unsubsidized loans that I have consolidated for an average interest rate, and lower monthly payment. My mom took out a Parent Plus loan for each year of college amounting to around $40k per year. She has been paying on the first loan since I started school in 2012, but deferred the rest. Initially, she used some of the money that I got back from overpayment to the school (when I lived off-campus) to repay on the first loan; however, most of that money eventually disappeared into my dad's new truck, camper, and Polaris. Now that I have been out for a year, payments on these loans are ridiculously high- $2000 per month. I have been giving her $500 per month, plus paying on my own loans. My dad doesn't really help out with the loan payments, so it's just my mom and I. At this point, I'm at a deficit every month, with no money leftover to save/build an emergency fund. *Note: I have no money saved from jobs prior to my ""job out of college"" because my parents never would allow me to work while I was in school. I worked a little throughout college, but only enough for food/gas.*

My main ask is what can I do to make Parent Plus loans manageable? My mom looked into consolidation, but immediately turned it down, because she said they would make my dad co-sign, which he can't do because he owns his own business (it would tie up too much of his credit). Refinancing is another option, but also potentially requires a co-signer with a loss of the government benefits.

tldr; I can't afford to pay $500/month on my mom's Parent Plus loan, and she can't afford the remaining $1500/month. My dad co-signing is out of the question as he owns his own business. Options?

Any help/suggestions are appreciated. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Should I Refi to pay off credit debt and PMI?,"I have approx $30k credit card and student loan debt. About 50/50 each. It's manageable and I could probably have it paid off in the next 2-3 years while still living comfortably. I also have the wife's car at about $30k financed with a good APR. 2.9 I think. 

My question is a guy at work said I should refi so that I can stop paying interest on debt and start using it as more of a tax write off. I bought my house for $207k. It's currently worth around $400k. Is this a good idea? My interest rate on house is 3.5%

The thought is get out of my $200/month PMI and start making my money work for me. Even if the interest rate for the house jumps up around 1% or less. I can use the extra money monthly I'm not spending on debt on the principal of new loan.

What are some thoughts about this? And yes I know I can't accuse any more debt otherwise it was pointless, thanks for any info!

Edit: student loans are 6%

Edit 2: What if I just take out a HELOC at 4.2% and pay down what I owe to current mortgage to bring my loan to value under 80%? It'll take about $20k. So I'll pay .75% more on$20k as opposed to a whole new loan. I'll save myself the closing costs and keep a good lender at a good 3.5% rate. Then my PMI goes away and it those payments become tax deductible. Does this sound reasonable? Or is it silly to take out a loan to pay off PMI?",finance

personalfinance,Employer Match $$ Status in Roth 401k / Should I Cash Out Said 401k?,"Two part question for Personal Finance.  

1)  I have about $17,000 in a Roth 401k from a previous job that had a level of employer matching (technically ""profit sharing,"" but employer-provided value nonetheless).  In the case of cashing this out, would the employer-provided value be considered a contribution (and thus not subject to the early withdrawal penalties), or are all non-personal contributions considered earnings?

2)  Assuming the more favorable situation (employer contributions are still contributions), should I consider cashing that account out, including the penalties, to pay down either A) a similar amount of 9.9% credit card debt or B) a mix of said CC debt and student loans ranging from 5-7.5%, however many would be fully paid off increasing monthly flexibility?

For other parameters, I am 29, making ~$90,000 a year, currently contribute 10% to Roth 401k, but have little to no savings (~1 month's emergency fund) due largely to trying to hack away aggressively at ~$30k in Student Loans and less aggressively at ~$10k in car (refi'd to 3% on that though so less worried).  

I do have some budgetary changes to improve my ability to hack away more quickly at the CC debt as well, but I'm at least pleased that it is stable (basically paying what I spend on it monthly, just annoyed by the ~$100/mo interest or so).  I'm also acutely aware that I'm approaching a potential home-buying phase in my life, and I see some value in axing the high debt:credit ratio I currently have as a result (the card with the $17k is my only one), and I figure not only could I help with the clear out, but it would also open some flexibility to gain benefit from a second card with a good sign-up return bonus (I have a solid credit score despite the high D:C ratio.)

If I had to really assess, the minimal emergency flexibility probably worries me the most. 

Wondering what people's thoughts on this one might be?   My assessment of the chart would be that it says to keep that money invested, but since it's not being added to the return isn't going to be an overwhelming impact on my retirement portfolio (~$40k in current job R401k).  I also am really interested in dumping this CC debt if possible.  The student loans as well, but I recognize that some of their interest rates are very manageable (same w/ car) on the current strategy. 

Basically I'm struggling over whether the potential penalty (and reduction of retirement fund) is worth the stability gained from clearing the CC debt up front, and wanted some outside opinion.",finance

But now that it's so big, do you think it can keep it up? Bearing in mind it is entering markets, like AI, that are huge in relation to Amazon's current size and therefor could offer similar growth as it has had in the past 10 years. If Amazon wasn't entering these markets, and just sticking with ecommerce,    I would expect its growth to slow down considerably.

Are we just looking at 20-30% gains going forward or what? I understand that's not to be sniffed at, but there are much smaller quality companies in hyper-growth mode at the moment (and therefor potentially better places to invest money).

I am just starting to doubt my investment thesis in Amazon, which was hinged on putting what little money I have in quality companies offering the highest growth possible. I am starting to think there may be better places to put my cash.

Have you guys considered AMZN might start slowing down?",finance

technology,Got this response from Sen. Marco Rubio (FL) about my Net Neutrality email/call...,"Dear Mr. TearsDontFall,
 
Thank you for taking the time to express your thoughts regarding the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) internet regulations commonly referred to as ""net neutrality."" Understanding your views helps me better represent Florida in the United States Senate, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.
 
Since its inception, the internet has flourished with minimal government involvement and has revolutionized our ability to communicate and conduct commerce. It provides businesses with the ability to compete in the global marketplace and is an engine of economic growth. Continued development of the internet and modern telecommunications, free of excessive and overly burdensome government regulations, is key to American innovation.
 
On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted 3-2 to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications utility under Title II of the Communications Act. The 332-page regulation was called “net neutrality,” referencing the concept of preventing internet service providers (ISPs) from creating “fast lanes” and “slow lanes” for different content. **This regulation effectively transferred power from ISPs to the federal government, and threatened to overregulate the Internet in a way that would make it more expensive for consumers, less innovative and less competitive.** 
 
On April 26, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to roll back the 2015 regulation. Chairman Pai is committed to an open and transparent process. As he explained, “two years ago, the FCC hid the Title II Order from the American people until after it had been adopted. Only certain special interest groups were given special access able to make major changes to it. The FCC had to pass the 313-page Order before the public was allowed to see what was in it. The process over the coming months will be open and transparent with a nearly three month open comment period. You may agree or disagree with the proposal, but you’ll be able to see exactly what it is.” On May 18, 2017 the FCC voted to make the NPRM official. The comment period will stay open until August 16th, at which point the commission will issue a final decision. 
 
I believe modernizing the 1996 Communications Act should be a top priority for Congress, and would clarify the FCC's role in the modern communications landscape. **Congress must create level regulatory playing field that protects consumers and encourages innovation.**
 
It is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United States Senator. I will keep your thoughts in mind as I consider these issues and continue working to ensure America remains a safe and prosperous nation.

 
Sincerely,

Marco Rubio

United States Senator

* See bold lines above... He is saying that government regulation on not allowing ISP's to control what we have access to, would make it more expensive (probably told this by his stream of donations from Spectrum) and didn't he vote FOR the repeal so ISP's could make slow and fast lanes?

personalfinance,Going back to school while still carrying a loan balance?,"My SO (28) wants to go back to school to pursue a BSN. She currently has about 25k in student loans.

Background: She got an associates degree at a for profit school several years ago for surgical technology. She recently got a new job making $33/hour (approx 68k/year), a big pay bump from her previous posisiton. Her finances were a disaster until recently (late payments on all bills, repossession, etc). After helping her work out some repayment schedules and plan of attack, she's finally current on all her bills.

Right now her big monthly commitments are something like the below:

$500 rent/utilities
$350 car payment (Yes, I know, payments end Feb 2018)
$200 federal student loan (25k @ ~6.25%)
$150 car insurance
$99 cell phone 
$50 private student loan (~4k @ 0%)

She's also putting 10% into her 401k to get her company match and about $600 a month into her savings for an emergency fund.

I know there's room for improvement but we're working on it slowly. I've tried to get her to take bigger steps but she's resistant to too much change at once so she's making small improvements slowly. She started cleaning up her finances last year.

She wants to go back to school to get a BSN. There are some programs that allow you to get the pre requisites through a nearby community college first. I suggested paying off the loans first before we think about school but she doesn't want to wait that long. 

So, what's a good course of action? Is going back to school a good ROI?

personalfinance,Can I afford a car? Please help.,"Hi r/personalfinance, I need some help deciding on a car purchase.

I currently own a 2004 Hyundai with 209,000 miles. It broke down this weekend and needs $1500 in work to be minimally drivable again, not counting the approximately minimum $300 it needs to hopefully pass state safety inspection in 2 months. 

I net $2000/month at my main job and have a second job that nets me an additional $600 or so a month. 

My current expenses should be $2098/month (including putting $400/month in savings and paying $250-350 on a credit card debt I'm trying to pay off in 18 months). They currently are closer to $2400-2500 because I have bad habits of eating out all the time, buying stuff I don't need because Feelings, generally being irresponsible, etc (I've been actively trying to get that under control).

I have to quit my second job if I don't have a car to get there. I've already missed 2 shifts due to the car thing.

I was preapproved for a car loan (soft pull) with a 3% interest rate through one of the big banks. I applied at my credit union for a loan that would be a 1.84% interest rate. 

I'm looking at newer used cars (a 2015 Honda Fit EX listed at $16,000 w/36,000 miles and a 2016 Honda Fit base with 17,000 miles listed at $15,000). Also at the lot is a 2012 with 57000 miles for $10000 (but I don't really fit in it, because I'm super tall and the pre-2015s aren't super comfortable for me). I was going to put $1500 down and finance the rest. I'd like to pay ~$200/month but I keep seeing that it's not totally feasible. 

I'm so lost and this whole process has been extremely stressful. My family and friends all have strong opinions about what I should do (and none of them agree) and when I look at the numbers I feel like I don't have enough cushion.",finance
personalfinance,Ideal HSA investment allocation?,"So I have a high-deductible health plan, and I take advantage of the HSA by contributing the maximum $6,750 between payroll deductions and the premium pass-through. I contribute to the match plus another 2% for my TSP (the feds' 401(k)-equivalent) -and max out contributions for Roth IRAs for my wife and me, and I should have access to a defined benefit pension, though I am not counting on that because it is a goal of this current administration to significantly curtail it. 

My goal is not to treat the HSA as a retirement account; I do want to draw from it to pay for medical expenses as they occur. My current strategy is to always keep $3,000 in cash in my HSA account, as that is the deductible amount. Any excess money I transfer to a brokerage account, that allows the money to be invested in ETFs for no commission.

Given my coinsurance rate is pretty low once I hit that $3,000 deductible (it's 5%), I don't *expect* to have to liquidate any of my positions.

btc,If Segwit activates it will represent a failure of Bitcoin to respond to and defend against outside threats from businesses and governments. Bitcoin will no longer be special.,"Segwit2x is a trojan horse. You think a hard fork will happen? Nope. Not after Segwit. Agreement or no agreement, they will change their minds and the propaganda ministers at r/bitcoin will say/do anything to make sure new users will be force-fed their off-chain ideology.

The activation of Segwit is a failure of Bitcoin because it proves that a well funded adversary can intentionally cripple Bitcoin. Bitcoin's decentralized on-chain functionality will eventually become controlled by corporations and a few wealthy individuals running permissioned channels and LN hubs (middlemen Bitcoin was designed to prevent and replace).

The business leaders who voted for this in person should feel ashamed of themselves, both for being easily duped by underestimating the small-blockers and by giving in so easily when BU has a commanding hashpower lead over Segwit. Pathetic.

Meanwhile, other cryptos are blowing past Bitcoin in usability. After the crash you guys will wake up and realize that the first mover advantage is just about gone.

Last, the network is supposed to upgrade via hard-forks. It's the cleanest way to make Bitcoin better. Someone disagrees? Hashpower. It's really simple. Economic majority wins and can't be held back by a tiny fringe minority no matter how big their megaphone is.

To those who signed the Segwit2x agreement, you're going to get fooled twice: first at the roundtable in hong kong when a 2x hard fork was promised alongside Segwit but never happened (signed by Blockstream's President!), and now once no hard-fork happens after Segwit gets activated.

personalfinance,"Student Loans, other than highest interest/avalanche how should I prioritize given additional variables?","Hello. Having just completed my degree, I have a number of student loans to pay; looking through discussions here, I agree that for me the avalanche / choose highest interest rate first method would be most appropriate, but that alone doesn't make clear which of of the loans I have should be prioritized first. May I have assistance reasoning what the ideal ordering of my loans would be? I have combined the loan chart provided to me with an extra interest rate column:

http://imgur.com/a/3tTPz

I am sure that this is repeat information, but just for the sake of clarity:
The three types of loans I have are ""subsidized,"" ""unsubsidized,"" and ""Perkins."" The first two have a grace period of 6 months, whereas Perkins has a grace period of 9 months. The unsubsidized loans are accruing now, whereas some of the other loans have higher interest rates but will accrue after the grace period.

Some of the loans that aren't accruing have higher interest rates, but because the ubsubsidized loans are accruing now, I am not sure whether I should work to eliminate those first until the grace periods end. Then again, once those grace periods end the higher interest and larger amount loans begin to accrue. (How does the loan principal affect the decision?) 
I have approximately $6,000 to put towards any pool of loans as well, so I need to think about this. I could eliminate two of the ubsubsidized loans with the highest interest or pre-contribute towards one of the Perkins loans or #8, which is the highest interest, almost highest amount.

I would appreciate your thoughts on the subject.

personalfinance,Bought a truck that I probably can't afford but don't know how to move forward,"OK so I bought a truck about 2.5 years ago (2013 F150 XLT, Supercab, 4wd, 38K mi, &amp; 100k mi extended warranty) and I absolutely love it but I don't know if I can afford it anymore. Before I bought the truck I was doing fine financially but now I can't seem to get ahead and have found myself in debt. 


My current debt/income situation is:
 $3800/mo income after taxes
~$25k in student loans which I make a $500/mo payment (interest rates range from 3.5 to 7%) I'm about 4 years in and should be done in about 5
I just moved into a newer cheaper apartment so rent/utilities are about $560/mo 
~$9000 in credit card debt at a 14% apr
Car insurance $110/mo
I still owe ~$25k on my truck at a 3.5% interest rate 

A little more information about my situation. I just got out of a shitty relationship which was pretty one sided. My ex had a bunch of of dietary restrictions and I ended up buying most if not all of the groceries etc (organic stuff is really expensive in ak). Also my ex bought a house and I stupidly put a lot of money into helping her remodel it (hence the cc debt). On top of that the break up was really shitty so I left with basically nothing and have had to repurchase all of my stuff (furniture, cooking stuff etc).


I think I need to sell my truck but I know I'm going to take a hit if I do. The kbb value of the truck is around $22k. If I do sell my truck I will need to buy another vehicle. I live in Alaska and there's not really a reliable public transportation system. Im fine with driving a shuttle beater if it gives me back my financial stability. 


I look back at the last couple of years and don't know how I got here but I have accepted that something needs to change. I also don't really have a set budget and know that I need to work on that. Any thoughts or recommendations.

Bought a truck I probably can't afford. Need to get out from it but still need a vehicle.",finance
personalfinance,"I need help deciding what to do, should I get a 10k dollar loan to go back to school or should I just keep saving?","I am a 20 year old and when I got out of high school, I went to an out-of-state college paid with a combination of scholarships, federal loans and mostly, the Parent Plus loan. After the first year in college, my mom’s situation changed and she no longer qualified for the loan. I ended up leaving school with about 40 credits and owing  12k
Because I owe the school, they will not release my transcripts. It’s been a little over a year since that happened.  I have been working as a cashier part-time, I live with my grandmother, and I have been saving as much as possible. I don’t have a car and I walk 20 minutes to work.  I have been paying a little every month to the collection agency that has my school debt. My federal loans are on a payment by income plan so my current payments are 0$ because I make so little. I want to go back to school to get a degree in graphic design. My basic plan is to start with community college to at least get a A. A. and then transfer to another university. 

-I make an average of $600 a month
-I have saved $2.7k
-I have about 1.5k from investments I haven't cashed out.
-My parents said they will each give me $500 to go toward a car when I get one.
-I have 1k dollar scholarship that can go towards community college. I also plan to apply to more when I decide if I am going or not.

My expenses include:
-120$ a month to my grandmother
-50$ phone bill (my parents just randomly told me I need to pay for this one day)
-$203 to the collection agency (I have about $10,650) left to pay before I can go to school again.
-$40-60 a month on groceries (I try to spend as little as possible) 
Whatever is left goes into savings. 

My question and worries are numerous and I just wanted your help to guide me into a better position to handle this situation. If get a loan to cover the rest of the $10.65k and go back to school (in-state this time) and I get more scholarships, this time will I be okay financially? I really want to go back and get a degree so that I can have a better job, make more money, meet people, and all the reasons why everyone typically wants to go to college. However I am worried that I won’t be able to afford it. I need to get a car so that I can drive to the community college from where I live and be able to get a better paying job. The community college tuition is about 4k a year. When I get a car, my insurance is sure to be high because of my young age, and not to mention maintenance? If I get the loan, it will take a long time to pay it back, but if I don’t get the loan I will continue to be stuck where I am and it will probably take even longer because I’d be making so little. I have tried to get another job but without a car, degree, or experience in any other job besides retail it is almost impossible. I am just paralyzed about moving forward at all. The uncertainty of what I should do has been all I’ve been thinking about. Please any advice or thoughts would be helpful. Please don’t be too mean to me…

personalfinance,"95k salary with roughly 80k debt, trying to make sure my budget is appropriate","**About me**

24 (soon to be 25) year old, just moved to NYC with my first ""real"" job. I make 95,000 (gross) with the possibility of a 5k bonus at the end of this year, and next year. $0 in savings, no money invested anywhere, big heap of debt.

[Income/Debt list](http://imgur.com/a/rr7pw)

**Explanation of debts**

I went to App Academy(a/A), they bill me (interest free) on the first of every month from July-November. I had a car in California, I currently owe $8,600, and I am trying to break even on it/make a little on it, though I would be willing to take a small loss since I can just pay it off.

Unfortunately, I don't know my interest rates for any of my loans. I know the Credit cards are the highest, and the educational loans are low. A lot of this debt is split with my father, but it belongs to me and I am taking it all over now. 

**My plan**

I recently got my first paycheck, and started to flesh out my budget. I have been doing research on this sub, as well as thinking about what would be most realistic for me.

I want to contribute 10% of my salary to my 401k. I know that Personal Finance says that the ROI on paying off debt is higher. However, I will be living very Spartan for a while, and I know that once the debt isn't hanging over me I will feel relief, and then I will want to spend and treat myself, rather than saving it. So it seems wiser to take longer to pay off the debt, but come out with a more robust savings.

I am planning on living in a 30k range, I currently pay $800 for rent, $140 for commuting, $500 for food, and then I have another few hundred for misc costs (utils, emergencies, etc). I am also planning on keeping about $1500 in my account for emergencies. I am going to be tracking my costs (any recommendations on apps/methods?)

**Other Considerations**

I have a gf who lives in California. We are planning on seeing each other once a month. She was nice enough to offer to do all of the trips out here. I am going to pay for 1/3rd to 1/2 of her travel costs. I am factoring this into my 30k costs per year.

I also have 2 weddings, one in September in Texas, one in June in Hawaii. I have my car/hotel for Texas, but not anything for the Hawaii wedding.

**The hard numbers**

After costs I will have about 24,000 to throw at debt. Which means it'll take me about 3 years to pay off the debt. If I didn't contribute to my 401k, I would save about 4 months, and have nothing saved.

**The ask**

This is my first time doing anything like this, and it is a large undertaking. I don't know what I don't know, and any advice or other considerations I should make would be great to consider. This method would allow me to have 13k in my 401k, and would only cost me 4 months. But I think it would be easier psychologically to do this over paying off sooner, and then trying to heavily contribute to savings.

Part of me wants to cut my costs down farther. If I didn't contribute to my 401k, and lived at 20k per year, I could pay off all debts in 2 years instead of 3. However, that would mean making large sacrifices, and I would have nothing in savings.

personalfinance,"My long term logic says to buy this Civic, my short term says no. What am I missing?","Hello Personal Finance, 

I currently drive a 2011 Dodge Avenger with 64k miles. My dad financed the car for me, buying it for $13,645 in Oct, 2014 at an interest rate of 4.35%. I've been taking over payments for the past year now that i'm done with the majority of my schooling. I owe $6910 on the car to finish paying it off. KBB values the car at $5,343. 


I have an opportunity to buy a 2013 Honda Civic EX with 49k miles. The current price is $13,995 but I'm hoping to get it a bit cheaper since I know the owner of the dealership I'd be buying from. I also have 736 credit score which I know is much higher than my dad's at the time of him getting my car. 


My biggest issue is that I drive a lot. I go 45 miles to work one way. My fiance lives 160 miles away. Assuming I don't visit her on the weekend I easily drive 500 miles a week. I've spent $1325 in gas from Jan-May so far this year. I've calculated the mpg for my avenger multiple times throughout the year and am getting 22.3mpg with that mostly being highway miles.  The Civic claims to get up to 28 city/39 highway which sounds way better. If gas doesn't get any lower this would save me $900 a year alone just from my commute to work and back. 


So should I get the civic?",finance
personalfinance,"Federal Employee seeking retirement planning advice [FERS, TSP, SS]","I’m a 42-year-old federal employee (with a little over 20 years) and need some clarification on retirement planning for a somewhat early retirement at 57. 

As you may be aware, there are 3 sources of retirement income for a federal employee. 1) Pension (FERS), 2) TSP, and 3) Social Security. I am working on saving in a taxable account, but that is currently negligible. Once our house is paid off in 2 years, I am planning on increasing my TSP and taxable retirement savings. I am currently saving 10% and that’s the number reflected in the estimate below.

Using the retirement tools available to me, the rounded estimates of income are:

* FERS Annuity (age 57, full survivor benefit):  $25,000 
* Social Security (age 67):  $40,000 
* Thrift Savings Plan Balance (age 57):  $550,000 

I’m not planning on taking social security until age 67, so I will have 10 years without that income. Am I correct in thinking that my TSP balance can be used more heavily in those first 10 years and then scaled back once social security kicks in? I might be looking at this wrong, but simply adding the FERS and Social Security together gives me a comfortable $65,000 a year. The TSP balance should be able to cover those 10 years without an issue.

I’ve tried to look at the websites of the 3 sources of retirement income (and searched several subreddits) and all I’ve discovered for sure is retirement is complicated. This approach seems too simple of an answer. What am I missing?",finance

My Sallie Mae loans make up 16k of my debt. The interest rates are 11.625%, 11.125%, and 9.750%.
After looking around on here it seems that these are a bit high. People were suggesting to others that they refinance. I dug a little deeper and found out I could refinance with sofi and get a 6% interest rate while lowering my payments by $200 but would be paying for 15 years. I figured I could still make the same large payments Sallie Mae was forcing me to pay but if money was tight I could pay the minimum Sofi was offering.

I currently make an average of about $7.5k a month. About 15-25% of that can be cash. Sometimes slightly more. My monthly bills hover around $2k, the rent and car payments taking up most of it combining for $1500 of it. A lot of my money goes towards food, it's absolutely terrible, I haven't even tried to keep track of it because of how scared I am to see the whole picture. My car is financed and I have a great interest rate at around 2.1%, I have a pretty good credit score of 745. I have about 70k in savings, small percentage of it is in cash, and 15k loaned out (which I already stopped doing) to some friends. My job does not offer any retirement plans and I don't have much on that front. I also make money through self employment, which bites me with taxes at the end of the year with my 1099. I don't make more than 30k through it. 

I am frugal with some things and not so much with others. I am in a new relationship and I am looking to have some fun traveling and experiencing the world with her. We are making plans to travel to different places although that itself is also a challenge, due to my crazy work schedule. I am nervous about how much this is going to affect my finances as well, although she is very helpful and always throws down equally on the trips with me. But of course, I know traveling with her will be very pleasing and worthwhile.

After graduating and my 6 month deferrment period, I started with $30,267.64 in student debt, and I was a typical student in that it hadn't really hit me  until I started paying it back that it was going to suck.  I started doing more research, specifically here on /r/personalfinance, and decided that I wanted to be debt free as soon as possible.  Based on my circumstances, I decided on the avalanch method.  I had a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized loans at interest rates from 6.55% down to 3.15%.  I realize that the market could yield better returns than aggressively paying the low interest loans, however I thought that it would be better mentally and for my cash flow to just 'be done with them', so I decided to finish them off as well.  I have during this year, also opened up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and invested in their target retirement fund for 2055 just as a simple way of getting started for retirement saving (I'm currently 25 years old).

Although I made several large payments, you can see the drastic dip in the chart I posted.  This was due to me saving far too much in my first year as a 1099 worker for taxes, leaving me with a very large chunk (even after some unnecessary expenses, thanks /r/motorcycles) that I dedicated towards paying loans.  After that, it became addicting to see the individual loans zero out on myfedloan.  Every time I felt comfortable with my extra cash, I would pay large chunks towards the highest interest loan(s).  If there were 2 or more loans at the same interest rate, I still abided by the avalanch method by focusing on them, but I would pay towards the smallest remaining balance for the relief of seeing another 0 and knowing there was one less loan to worry about.

Other information people might want to know based on seeing other threads, I do not live at home nor did I get any type of windfall to accomplish this.  I save an extrordinary amount of money by renting a room in a house with roommates rather than having my own apartment.  I currently make about $65k per year, which has been increasing in the past few months since I work in sales.  Anyway, I know this has been a somewhat rambling post, but I just felt the need to share since I would not have done this if I hadn't stumbled across this community and wanted to thank everyone here for their contributions.",finance

personalfinance,Vehicle loan advice,"Hello everyone, this is my first post in the subreddit and I'm hoping that I can find the answers I'm looking for. So, right now I own a 99 Jeep Wrangler and have had it for 3 years or so. I'm 21 years old and bought the Jeep once I got out of boot camp for the Navy. I didn't have bad credit, but rather no credit, so I got a pretty poor interest rate. I have advanced a couple times since I have been in the Navy, have been making great progress on paying off my credit card, and have decided that I would like to buy a new vehicle. The last time I checked, my credit score was around a 650, which I know isn't great. I don't know anything about how it works when buying a new vehicle, so I guess what I'd like to know is if anyone could give me an estimate on what price of vehicle I could be looking at, or what kind of interest I can expect to be offered on my loan. I think the max I'd be willing to pay a month would be around $400. I have $2000 right now that I can put towards the down payment, plus another $3000 or so once I sell my current vehicle (this would be what I would have left after selling and paying off the remainder of my current vehicle loan). I'm sorry if this is a stupid question , just trying to get a bit more info on what I should be looking for or expecting. If people feel that my credit is too low to be getting a new vehicle then I would like to know if I should just wait till my credit improves more. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance guys.",finance

Some parameters I guess might be helpful.. We enjoy open-world games with the element of clearing dungeons for loot. The game obviously needs to be co-op or multiplayer.

personalfinance,"30 y.o. recently married and just landed 31k/year job. Want to make sure I have a good plan, and in need of advice.","Hello PF! I have been lurking for a while and I think that I am on the right track, but I wanted to run it by you guys to make sure that I am going down the right path. I am also stuck with a little problem that I was hoping to get some insight on.
Earlier this month I completed my Degree and landed my first career level job since I separated from the military in 2010.  I own my vehicle outright and often commute to work by walking.
I have created a decent budget based off the sidebar materials, it has helped me over the past year to save what little I can while I pay down my debts/monthly expenses. I make $31k/year now and my wife (no income) and I share the following debt:
$3.5k in cc debt (~60% credit utilization) both cards in Wife’s name
$2.5k signature loan for wedding in Wife’s name
$9k old charge off debt from military separation in my name
$12k student loan debt in my name

I currently have saved:
2.5k emergency fund (2.5 months’ rent/bills)
$500 Acorns Investment Fund

I am currently putting away:
$25/month into emergency fund – planning to increase to $100/month after CC paid down
$25/month into Acorns fund – planning in increasing to $100/month after signature loan paid down
$25/month into a Health Savings Account (minimum allowed, will increase after all debts paid)
15%/monthly income to 401k (Maxed out and 11% is matched by employer)

My problem and plan of action:
There are two major impediments I am looking at. My Credit Score/History and the old government charge off. I was involuntarily separated from the military due to medical reasons, and since I was separated before 50% of my re-enlistment time had gone by, they claimed that I did not meet the time requirement and needed to pay back my re-enlistment bonus.
When I was separated I was suffering from PTSD and had a really hard time adjusting to civilian life, which ultimately resulted in me filing bankruptcy after trying and failing to find good reliable work while dealing with my personal issues. The bankruptcy was filed in 2012 and my credit has slowly recovered since, but is still hanging pretty low at 670 due to the charge off and lack of open accounts.

I am much healthier now and I have been working to repair my credit and build the foundation of my future life. My plan is to pay down the CC’s to ~30% utilization and then use them for gas/monthly subscriptions like Netflix etc. to keep the spending active. Then split the old minimum payments for the CC’s with high balance (~$150) in two: half going to emergency fund, half going into principle of Signature loan, rolling it all into savings (Acorns and Emergency Fund) after the loan is paid down. In August I will start the minimum repayment on my student loans (Federal Stafford) and apply for the early forgiveness as I am now employed by as a state employee at a community college, and pay until it is gone or until I meet the forgiveness requirements of 10 years.
I want to buy a house, with the budget I can afford something in the $95-150k range which is possible when looking at Manufactured Homes and a piece of land (I have researched this quite thoroughly) in my local area.  I want to do this a soon as possible as it is a huge goal for me and I really would like to start a family within 5 years, and get out from under the thumb of renting. I am really tired of paying rent and dealing with landlords. I understand the costs of homeownership and they are worth losing the benefits of renting in my situation, especially if it means a family home for my future children. I bounced from apartment to apartment as a kid and it took its toll on me, I will not subject my own kids to that.
So I stand at a cross roads.
I am not sure if it would be better to ride out the storm and wait for the charge off to drop off my credit report, which I do not believe it ever will because I owe Uncle Sam, or follow the second route and contact FedDebt and re-ignite the payback. I am afraid to contact them though, because the last time I did (at the time of my separation) they were demanding payment in full, or at least 30% upfront to establish a payback plan. At the time I was making literally nothing and had no nest egg to draw on, so I hid from the debt. 
Well I am tired of hiding from it, but the fear remains that they will ask for the amount in full, which I cannot afford. They might also ask for the 30% which will kill all of my emergency fund. IF I cannot handle these payments then contacting them could restart the clock on the debt drop-off, and maybe send the debt collectors back after me.
Any help or constructive criticisms of my plan would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Can someone help me understand these ""Charge offs""? (Student Loans)","I just recently signed up for CreditKarma.  I am attempting to clear up my credit history for the sake of future me.

Long story short, I decided going to school and then didn't finish due to medical issues.  It has been more than 7 years since I got these loans. 

When I go into my accounts it states I have 4 accounts that need attention. (These are medical bills that I plan on taking care of in the next week or so.)

Other then those I have 5 US DEPT OF EDUCATION accounts ranging from 650$ - 3400$.  These all state ""Student loan permanently assigned to government""

I also have 2 accounts from COLLEGE FOUNDATION INC totaling in at a whopping 0$.  (One was purchased by another lender and one is stating it is ""Closed"")

I also have 5 FEDLOAN SERVICING that are all stating 0$ and closed as well.  

Lastly, I have a VERIZON that is 7 years and Charged off as bad debt/Profit and loss write-off

Here are the ""Closed"" Dates.
http://imgur.com/a/jGZip

My question are... 

1. Are these hurting my credit score?

2. Some of these are opened more than 7 years ago with no activity since then, as I literally couldn't afford to do anything and now I am trying to fix it, Can I do something to get these taken off my credit history? 
I would assume from what I have read elsewhere they ""should"" fall off after 7 years, but I am so lost I don't even know where to look and if that is even correct.

3. Since I haven't had any good activity on my credit in years I assume my best bet is to open a Secured Credit Card and put at least 200$ towards that.  Am I correct in assuming this?

4.  Is there something else I should be doing as well?  I know I will be taking care of those medical bills before they get out of hand soon.

Below are my assumptions.  If people could challenge them for an upcoming offer, I'd really appreciate it.

personalfinance,R7 on Credit Report but needing do attempt to get a payment plan set up for laptop that requires credit check? Help?,"Okay, so I currently paying off what was originally $3000 in credit card debit with RBC (from a $2500 card). I was hospitalized for a long time and so that's how the card went over  the limit (through late payment fees and interest fees, etc.) I used the card to pay for food and shelter costs while away at university when there was an unexpectedly change in financial situation (wasn't just a careless millennial buying designer clothing like everyone assumes). 

Anyways, I've managed to get on a payment program called the Hardship Program in which (for the next 6 months, starting as of 2 months ago) the interest rate is cut almost in half, as is the minimum monthly payment. The over-limit fee for the 6 month period is waved as well. In the past 2 months I've managed to pay off my debt to the point in which I only have $1050 left to pay off. Going onto the Hardship Program put my Credit Report with an R7 rating. I'm not that knowledgeable about credit scores and related stuff, but I know that's pretty bad. 

So here's my situation. My laptop suddenly died on me. It wasn't my fault, just some internal glitch apparently that can't be repaired and my warranty is expired. My only option is to purchase a new/refurbished one. I don't have the cash to pay for one in it's entirety upfront, so I'd have to apply for a payment plan at a store. Every single store requires a credit check in order to approve/reject you for a payment plan. Now, I'm wondering if I'll even be approved at all anywhere with my R7 rating? I literally need to replace my laptop in order to keep getting work. I do photography and videography. I'm trained and certified to edit using programs only compatible with Macs. If I don't have a laptop of my own with the software I won't be hired for any more jobs throughout the summer and thus my payments on the credit card itself will slow to a possible halt...I don't know what to do. Seriously this is my only option so please don't lecture me in the comments or tell me to ""get a job at McDonalds"". I'd just really appreciate some honest advice on whether on R7 rating will make it impossible for me to get approved for credit for a MacBook at a computer store like Jump+ (a certified Apple retailer) or not.

Issue is since then I haven't received any letter or call regarding the form. I called Fedloan around 2 weeks ago and was told they received it but it was processing. Since then nothing.

People who have sent in this form, how long did it take for you to receive some sort of word back that it was received and approved? My supervisor recently PCS'd and so I don't know if I should just fill out another form and send it in signed by the XPO.
Lastly, just from your opinion; do you think PSLF is worth it/safe? I'm hoping for it to still be here in 10 years but of course you never know. Do you think people will get grandfathered in or congress would just give the big finger and cancel it altogether?

* habit of paying recurring bills(larger ones) on time w/o stress. They include: 2 student loans, 1 credit card, phone bill, internet and rent  ***
* emergency fund ***
* a savings ***
* a car
* apartment  
  
The three asterisks indicate after some of the bullet points are to indicate the extremity of particular point.  
  
**Bills**:  
  
Student Loans:  
  
* **Loan 1** : Balance - $7,886.44; Min payment per month - $55.50; Past Due - $222.00; Interest rate: 14.06%**  
  
* **Loan 2** : Balance - $2,537.78; Min payment per month - $55.00; Past Due - $100.00; Interest rate: 6.8%**  
  
  
Credit card:  
  
Balance - $606.39; Credit Limit - $450; Min payment per month - $47; Past due - $0; Payment due: $17 on 6/21/17; Interest rate: 26.99%  
  
  
Phone Bill: Usually $75/month. This month its $85.  
  
  
Rent: $300/month  
  
  
Internet: ~$30/month. Note: My roommate has been covering all of the internet cost for the past few months but I want/need to get back on paying my part.  
  
  
Amazon Prime: ~$10/month  
  
PS+: ~$10/month  
  
Adobe CC: ~$10/month  
  
Bus fare: ~$1.75 per ride, twice a day = $3.5, five days a week = $17.5, four weeks in a month = $70. (Note: bus fare is required for me, it sometimes is a bit less, if i get rides, sometimes more if i have to do other stuff)

Groceries(weekly): ~$50  
  
Fast food(weekly): ~$10-$20, depending
 
  
Sorry if any of this is confusing, I'm trying to be as concise and informative as possible. As far as my credit card, I am over its limit but have been paying on it each month and have knocked it down tremendously. I'm now going to go into my income.
  
  
I work in a pizza place and it being the summer we are pretty dead and its rather difficult for me to get my ~35 hours like I was. I did have hand surgery a little over a month ago(May 9th) and had to cut back since I couldn't do some stuff but since summer is here now we aren't seemingly busy enough for my normal hours so now I'm struggling even more now.  
  
Hours per week currently: ~25-30  
pay rate: $10/hour  
pay frequency: bi-weekly (get paid this week as of this post)  
  
This week's paycheck should be around ~$450-$500. It could be less and my rent of $300 is due this week.
  
I don't have any other income at the moment, though, as an artist/entertainer I want to make money that way, so I would be self-employed but thats for way down the line.
  
  
I hope this is enough info for you all, if not, please ask! I hope the formatting is correct as well! Took me long enough since I'm not used to all of the markdown. I will say, I know its pretty much my fault I'm in the situation I am in, but I really am trying. I used to be a lot worse, but when you aren't taught anything in school or by your parents, and have to learn yourself, its no wonder, right? Hell, I've only been moved out about 2 years and was essentially forced  and would have been homeless if it werent for my friend / current roommate!  
  
I know some of the things listed above I can definitely cut out. For example: the fast food, though I used to spend a lot more! I recently changed my diet and spend a lot less on food, though its still hard because my kitchen situation is messed up at the moment(roommate/owner of house started remodel on kitchen but...stopped so its frustrating to prep food, etc). The Amazon Prime, I do use regularly for things I need so I dont' want to ditch that, especially since i'm carless and get free shipping. The PS+ I don't always use, so I could ditch that if need be. There are other small things I could cut out, such as my soda intake. I spend a few dollars a day on soda that I could use for bus fare for example.  
  
I will say, as I mentioned above about self-employment, I want do definitely do that, but before I get to that point, if i ever get there, it wont matter if I can't manage my finances in my current state. No matter how much money I make, unless I was some millionaire all of a sudden and just pay all of my debt off and was able to start fresh immediately.
  
So yeah, I hope this is all you need! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Auto Loan for 24-36 Months to Save Money,"Hi, I have a quick question regarding the practicality of refinancing my auto loan with Ford Motor Credit.

I bought this car May of 2017. I agreed to 4.95% APR for 60 months in order to receive copious Ford rebates. 

My current payoff is $13,561, and my monthly payment is $292. I think I can easily pay this off in 24 months, 36 months at worst. 

Is it worth it to ditch Ford Motor Credit if I'm paying off a relatively small balance at such an accelerated rate? I have been putting $2,000 per month to the car, but plan to slow down to $1,000 or less. I will have to shop the refinance rate, but again, would it really be worth the hard pull of credit just to get a 2-3% interest rate? 

Lastly, I know every lender is different, but do lenders generally charge for refinancing? 

Thanks in advance",finance
personalfinance,Looking for a sanity check on handling student loans.,"I took out the maximum federal loans I could get, my parents took out Parent Plus loans to cover the difference so I didn't have to look for private loans. 

I'm currently employed as an engineer at a major electronics company making 60k, and I accepted a job offer with a government contractor that will pay me 80k. It'll be a few months before I can start due to bureaucracy, but I signed the job offer and peed in a cup already so it's my job. I just have to wait until they call me so they can arrange the relocation.

My parents have talked to me about taking over the Parent loans, and I'm fine with doing that since the loans were to pay for my school. They have long standing financial issues because my dad has his own business but lacks business savvy, which I'm less fine with. It wasn't doing great before the recession, it did awful during the recession, and it's only in the past couple of years where it's gotten better but that doesn't really make up for the huge hole they're in. They don't want to tell me honestly what their total financial picture looks like, because I'm just a dumb kid that can't understand things. They have said that freeing up cash flow from the parent loans would help them out a bit, and I think it's fair to at least take over the student loans, though to be sure I'd greatly prefer if they weren't in this situation in the first place.

My understanding is that they cannot transfer the loan to me directly. I would need to refinance the loan such that I take out a new loan to pay off the existing loans in their name, then I'd be paying on the new loan. I think I'd still get the ability to deduct interest even on a private refinance, but I'm not sure. I'd only do this after getting settled at the new job, since I'd need to relocate and get a couple of pay stubs to verify my income. Is there anything I'm missing? This won't happen for a few months, but I want to have an idea what it will look like while I wait.

For context, I'm 26 and they are both 61, so they're at the age where they're considering taking social security early but neither thinks they'll be able to fully retire (they don't tell me how much they have, but from the way they talk it's not enough). I don't want to badmouth my parents because they did what they thought was best being immigrants to America and all, but they are way in the hole debt wise on credit cards (they've never told me the full amount, but it's over 100k and dad complains about needing 8k a month just to stay afloat) and they still haven't paid off the house yet. My dad can earn like 20k a month if he gets work, or he can earn 0 a month if he gets no work. My mom makes like 55k as an admin manager at a health care provider. 

My own finances are fine. I net about 1k after expenses in a normal month and sometimes more if I don't indulge, I have 20k in the bank right now, a 10k car loan (new car back in 2015, but it was a 2014 leftover model which was fine for me), 22k student loans, and 11k in traditional IRA (might reclassify once I start new job, not sure). According to my student account at my old school, they took out 25k in Parent loans for me, so that may be added on to my own liability but I'm not worried about it since I could probably knock out all of my debt within a year of starting my new job (I live cheaply, and the job is in an even cheaper city).",finance
personalfinance,"32 Years Old, need help figuring out a reasonable budget on 58k (gross), between usable liquid, saving for a house, and retirement","**Current situation**: I work for the state, and have the following financial benefits:

&amp;nbsp;

6% of my gross income is redirected into a 401k (pre-tax) as part of a retirement plan.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of my career, after working for 30 years, I'll have a pension equal to 45% of the top 3, highest earning, consecutive years of employment. This assumes there's still a pension 30 years from now.

&amp;nbsp;

This pension does not conflict with social security, therefore I would be eligible for SS benefits. This again assumes social security is around in 30 years.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Now for the numbers.**


Non-retirement accounts


*Savings Account: $30k - includes $18k in emergency savings.


*Stocks: 22k, going up and down, currently up.

&amp;nbsp;

Retirement Accounts:


*Post-Tax: Roth IRA and 401B: $20k, averaging around 10% growth/year


*Pre-Tax: 4k


*Whole Life (post-tax): $10k, averaging around 6 - 6.5% dividends/year

&amp;nbsp;

Debt: $0

&amp;nbsp;

Take home pay (post tax): $3500


Average Monthly expenses: $2000 - can drop down to about $1500/month, but I'd have to do more digging to figure out what's causing it to be so high.


Net income: $1500/month

&amp;nbsp;

Current distribution of net income:


$400/month into whole life insurance


$458/month into Roth IRA


$642/month into 401B - note: 401B is like a 401k, but post tax like a Roth.


$290/month into pre-tax retirement (the 6% of my salary. This is required, and is separate from the take home pay)  

&amp;nbsp;


Additionally, I'm set to get an increase of about $2000/year raises/cost of living adjustments until I max out the pay grade for my position, which will take about 6 years to do.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Goal**


I would like to be able to afford a house (Currently averaging $250-350k in my area for a decent neighborhood, less for a fixer-upper which I have no interest in). However, this is competing with my internal need to throw money towards my retirement early to get that snowball effect going otherwise known as compound interest. That said, I also have a pension and the 6% of my salary taken off the top that already goes to my retirement. I recognize I'm putting too much of my salary away, but I feel like I'm behind for my age.

&amp;nbsp;

How should I be balancing things, without compromising my retirement, but still being able to save towards some near-term goals such as a house and vacations? Is a house even feasible with my income? Additionally, should I forego the idea of a 20% down payment given that interest rates are going up and housing prices continue to climb by double digits each year? If I do a lower% down payment, I'd be able to afford a house much more quickly (with some additional risk factors, of course such as the additional insurance).

&amp;nbsp;

My apologies if I'm asking for help to too many things at the same time, and likely coming across as both vague and indirect about what I'm asking help for so please forgive me on that.

MachineLearning,[D] RNNs are not really Turing Complete in any practical way,"## Are RNNs Turing Complete?

I watched a talk about *RNNs* where the speaker claims that RNNs are not really *Turing Complete* (TC) because, according to him, the input is fed to the RNNs in a forced order and so the net can't control the tape. The speaker suggests that we would need Reinforcement Learning (to control the tape) to make RNNs Turing Complete.

This claim baffled me for several reasons. Mainly:

1. An RNN where we can ""control"" the order in which the input is presented to it is *NOT* an RNN.
2. Who says the tape must be external to the RNNs as the speaker seems to suggest?
3. If someone proved that RNNs are TC, then surely they managed to do it without *augmenting* RNNs in any way.

The speaker is pointing out the fact that expressibility != learnability, which is true for every sufficiently complex model, in practice. The problem is that his arguments are flawed.

I looked around and eventually stumbled on [a paper](http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1992_Siegelmann_COLT.pdf) which proves that RNNs are indeed Turing Complete.

I skimmed through the paper and I spotted the *trick* pretty quickly.

The first thing I thought while watching the talk is that an RNN could memorize the input some way and then maintain an *internal tape*, thus invalidating the claim of the speaker. This would make the RNN Turing Complete in theory, but not in practice since the input/output vectors are usually ""small"" and making them ""large"" would be quite problematic.

Indeed, the paper seems to use the same idea. We have *Finite State Automata* (FSA) which have a finite number of states and can only remember the state they're in. Then we have *Push Down (Finite State) Automata* (PDA) which also have an infinite stack and, finally, *Turing Machines* (TM) which have an infinite tape.

The problem with the stack is that it limits the order in which one can access memory and so PDA are less powerful than TMs. It turns out, however, that if we allow the automaton to have *two stacks*, then it's as powerful as a TM. Moreover, these stacks need only contain *binary digits*.

Therefore, we just need to prove that for each PDA there exists an RNN with can emulate that PDA. We don't need to worry about learning. We just need to prove that there are some weights which do the trick.

The trick used in the paper is to encode each stack as a *rational number*. These kinds of encodings are very common in proofs about cardinality. The authors decide to encode a 0 as 1 and a 1 as 3 to simplify the update operations. So, a stack with the elements s1, s2, s3, ..., sn can be encoded as

    q(s) = sum_{i=1}^n (2 si + 1)/(4^i)

For instance, if s = 01101, then q(s) = 0.13313, written in base 4. The push and pop operations are easy:

    push(q, v) = q/4 + (2v + 1)/4 = q/4 + v/2 + 1/4
    pop(q, v) = 4q - 2v - 1

Note that we need to know the element we're about to pop (v), but that's not a problem. Note that q is a rational number, so the RNN just need to have rational weights.

The input/output vectors will have 3 elements:

1. state
2. first stack
3. second stack

That's it. The paper dives into many other technical details but I think this is the gist of it. This is essentially my idea of maintaining an *internal tape*.

## Are RNNs *really* Turing Complete?

We claim that real computers are TC even though they have finite memory because we can imagine adding extra memory when needed. The problem with RNNs is that we can't make input/output vectors bigger when needed because that would also make RNNs slower.

Therefore, I'm claiming that RNNs are not *really* TC for practical purposes. Now I'm going to look into Neural Differentiable Computers which, hopefully, solve this problem. I think the only way to achieve practical Turing Completeness is to be smart about effective computations.",technology
personalfinance,Student Loan Cosigner Names and Refinancing,"Hello r/personalfinance!

A little backstory to the issue I'm running into. My wife and I got married a little over a year ago, right out of college. I was fortunate enough to have no student loans, but she had quite a lot. They are from 3 different companies: Sallie Mae, My Fed Loans, and Mohella. The first two have my wife's name on them with her father co-signing, and Mohella is just under her father. The high interest rate ones (Sallie Mae and Mohella) are starting to take a toll on us and we would like to refinance. However, we're unsure if we can refinance all of them at the same time since they are under different names.

This is what we would like to do: 

* 1.  Get all loans under my wife's name with me as a co-signer
* 2. Refinance loans through SoFi or similar company
* 3. Pay off loans at a lower monthly rate

So here are my questions that I have for you fine people:

* What is the order in which we should tackle this?
* How do we even go about getting the names switched?
* What are some resources we can use to refinance and pay down our loans?

If you need any additional information I would be happy to share. Thank you for any help you might have!",finance

Once I turn 18 I plan on applying for a credit card to start building my credit(Paying the balance in full each month, plan on no debt). I also want to open up a online savings account with ally so my money can accumulate some interest, it's not much with a 1.05% interest rate but better than having it sit in the checkings gaining me $0 like it is now.

Question 1: between the two of us we make a little over $100k annually. We are currently both contributing to our 401(k)s just to take advantage of the match. At our age, i know 5% contributions are ok...but that will need to increase over time. What's the best rule of thumb to gradually increase your contributions over time to have a comfortable retirement?

Question 2: We recently bought a home. It was too good to pass up and we determined that we could definitely afford it. The interest rate was too good to ignore and its almost the same price as throwing money down the rent pit in my area. I know associated expenses (especially initially) will be higher, but we have planned accordingly. I have lived in my state for my whole life, so at this point i doubt i'm going anywhere. After the down payment, we are in the process of stocking our rainy day fund to where we want to be. This number is the amount of money we will need to live for 6 months..assuming we are both out of work. Ideally that never happens, but gotta plan ahead. Anyway once we reach that goal in November, we will have extra money that will no longer need to go into savings. Do we increase 401(k) contributions, pay the mortgage off quicker, or invest in other options (like index funds).

I was thinking we could just do all 3, but i really wanted opinions on the money we save from paying the mortgage off early. Alternatively, the money we would potentially earn by just eating that interest and sticking to regular payments could earn more in other investments. However,  that's not definitive and is based on market performance. 

Help me out here could use advice please. Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,"22 Years old, $17K in the bank, and $20K of student loans left. Should I invest the money or pay the debt?","Good Morning all, 

My current situation: 22 years old, living in charlotte, working for a financial advisor, have very cheap rent, living with my sister ($400/month). This past year after college I have been working and saving at least half of my earned income. I have around $17k in personal savings and have knocked my loan down from 28K to 20K. I am about to make another massive repayment of about 10K to the loan but I am getting cold feet, and wondering if it may be better to maybe invest some of the money into the market or continue saving.

Thoughts? I am most likely going to just dump it into the loan at the moment, I've just never had this much cash before in my life...

Edit 1: 
So I have 4 groups of loan (A,B,C,D) 

Group A: Outstanding Balance = $4.4K
Group A Interest Rate = 6.8%


Group B: Outstanding Balance = $5.2K
Group B Interest Rate = 3.8%


Group C: Outstanding Balance = $5.1K
Group C Interest Rate = 4.6%


Group D: Outstanding Balance = $5.6K
Group D Interest Rate = 4.2%

Edit 2: Thanks for the great advice everyone! It seems the consensus is to establish an emergency fund, pay Group A and C off as quickly as possible, and then focus on Group C and D. Then once its all paid start putting money into the market... I'm thinking 100% vested in Blockbuster. should be a guaranteed 7% return. (kidding?)

A while back a read an article on CNN Money that just happen to pop up on my iPhone.  It was an article about the couple in their 30's who were planning on retiring by the time they hit 40.  It made mention FIRE - which I was completely unaware of - and how changing your lifestyle can help you to become ""financially independent.""  Then I started to think - well shit I make a decent amount of money but I havent really started to save anything.  I signed up for Mint.com and started tracking my expenses only to find that my spouse and I pretty much send everything we make and don't really save all that much.  I started to get frustrated thinking that I can never retire early with the lifestyle that we live and sat down to discuss a budget with my wife - as we mostly keep our finances separate (not for any particular reason, but just because it was always ""easier"" not to discuss them).  I think that we have been in the mentality that we would just start earning more and could save later...

A little on our background - 

Me.
-28, attorney, and gross about $80k/yr w/ modest bonuses (last year was $5k - hopefully similar or greater this year).  
-$17k in Vanguard mutual funds
-$1350 in Roth IRA (just started this a month ago - planning on maxing out every year w/ $100/wk contributions) (put it into a Target Retirement Fund).  
-$20k in savings 
-house w/ FMV of $160-170k // $117k mortgage w/ PMI - question below // we plan to save up and purchase a bigger house later and use this for passive rental income as the rental income will more than cover mortgage 
-no CC debt (pay them off every month just to accumulate points and cash back on gas (PENFED has 5% cash back card on gas) 
-$250k+/- in student loans (currently not paying on...) 
-car - $400/mo will be paid off in February 
 

Wife. 
-27, nurse, gross about $40k/yr (searching for new jobs paying around $50-60k w/ growth potential, as she is kind of in a dead-end position for the time-being). 
-employer retirement w/ 3% match - has around $15-20k in retirement (we are still pulling her finances together)
-$21k in CC debt 
-car - lease for $500/mo - planning to purchase it thereafter w/ expected loan of $400-500/mo 
-no other debt 

Thus said, since beginning to acclimate to the FIRE lifestyle, we are still in the process of pulling together a budget.  We eat out too often, buy a lot of clothes and other ""stuff"" that we really do not need.

At this point I have a couple of questions that I would appreciate some advice on:

(1) Mortgage - I currently pay PMI of about $125/mo.  This will stay for another 4 years or so, however, I reach the 5 year point this December when I can pay down the mortgage to 20% of loan value ($106k) and have the PMI removed.  I will need to come up with about $10k.  This will reduce my mortgage by $125/mo and cut about 44 months off my mortgage.  Question - should I cough up the $10k in savings to pay down the loan and abolish the PMI?  Ideally I would put this $125/mo back into savings unless you guys have another thought?

(2) We net around $7500/mo in income - for savings/retirement - ideally how much ""should"" we be saving?  I see some people are saving 20-50% of net income.  As we are adjusting my goal is to hit 20% by the end of the year.  Outside of my Roth, where should we be stashing retirement?  I guess we should open a Roth for her as well, but what about the extra?

Obviously we need to nail down a budget to really start, but I would greatly appreciate any other thoughts or considerations that you guys may have.",finance

personalfinance,"33M, Make Good Money, Struggling to Budget to Reduce Debt","**Background**

I'm 33 and up until now I've been terribly careless with money. The good news is that I have a great job and I'm not afraid to work even more to improve my situation. The bad news is that when I budget, I feel like there's not all that much left over to pay down my debt. I'm a big fan of Dave Ramsey (most of it anyway), and I want to get rid of my debt.

More information: I'm in the process of finalizing my divorce. My previous house was foreclosed on, so I'm renting for the foreseeable future. It sucks, but I've made my peace with that. The mortgage company didn't sue me for the difference between the auction price and the loan balance, but instead wrote off the loss, so I have a sizable debt to the IRS since that loss was treated as ordinary income.

**Income**

I have a salaried job that nets me $1,100 per week. $200 of that net immediately goes to pay child support, so essentially my net is $900 per week.

**Debts**

Car: $17,000 @ $411.83/month (high interest rate, 4 years left to pay)  
Student Loans: $54,000 (current monthly payment is $276, but needs to increase)  
Tax Debt: $15,000 (trying to work out payment arrangement, so not currently paying on this)

**Monthly Budget Items**

Rent: $950  
Groceries: $400 + $100 for eating out  
HBO Now &amp; Spotify: $26 (no traditional TV)  
Gym: $35 (going away after contract in 6 months)  
Car Insurance: $165  
Gas &amp; Car Maintenance: $200  
Gas &amp; Electric: $200  
Internet: $35  
Sanitation: $50  
Water: $50  
Entertainment: $100  

That's approximately $2,300 in monthly spending without including smaller things like the occasional gift, any clothing, etc. It also doesn't include some insurance policies I need to purchase (renter's insurance, life insurance, etc.). By the time I add in my minimum debt payments of almost $700 (not including the IRS debt I'm not paying yet), I'm spending $3,000 of my monthly take-home of $3,600 in most months (I have extra money in the months with 5 Thursdays). Most of that $600 extra is consumed by other miscellaneous ""needs"" during the month.

**The Point**

I know I need to tighten up in some areas. I'd like to cut out the restaurant budget, but I'm also trying to be reasonable. Where else can I cut to make more/faster progress on my debts, since I'm essentially only making minimum payments now?

I should get a bonus at the end of the year. I'm considering selling the car (it's worth about what I owe on it) and buying a beater with cash. That would free up $400/month, and I could reduce my insurance bill by only paying liability.

Honestly, I'm new to trying to truly live on a budget. I want to turn my financial life around, but I'm struggling to see how I'm ever going to get this debt cleaned up, much less do things like save for a down payment for a house or purchase my next non-beater car with cash.",finance
personalfinance,Requesting a loan...from my employer? Is that a thing?,"I'm stuck in a rut with one of my credit card bills right now. I've got a balance that I currently am only able to comfortably make the minimum payments on, but the interest rate is high enough on it that I find myself unable to dig out of the debt even when hardly using the card or not using it at all. I have recently accrued some very high medical bills due to IVF treatments for my wife and I to start a family due to infertility (we're talking quintuple-digit figures), so any available money is going toward whittling away at that, our mortgage, and other pressing things. However, I just can't seem to take down this one pesky credit card bill.

Would it be unheard of for me to request a loan from my employers? The bill isn't for an unspeakable amount of money, but it is a few thousand bucks. I would get the loan from them, and then pay them back bi-weekly in the form of pre-determined deductions from each of my paychecks until the debt is paid off. Is that something that's been done before or would be feasible for me to request?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for perspective,"Hi r/personalfinance, I was hoping to get some opinions and advice about my current situation. I'm not in a bad place financially or employment wise. I feel like I'm stuck in a situation and don't know which would be the best option to proceed.

The situation;
I'm 28, Belgian, still living with my parents (which I'm very ok about, I wouldn't want to have a place of my own just for the added social standing.).
I saved roughly 40.000 euro and I do pension planning up to the maximum amount that gives me tax breaks. (1500€ annually) I also have a pension plan at work so everything else is just a bonus.
I've been working for almost five years as a cheese maker in an Abby. Which is an amazing job, it just doesn't have a lot of margin to grow both in function or pay. The big plus though is that they have a ""we take care of our own"" mentality, which practically would guarantee me a job for life. (These things get more and more rare and would give some peace of mind.)

Now, I don't know what to do best with my savings. There is something in Belgium called long term saving which also gives tax benefits. The interest rate isn't off the charts but it's a lot better then a normal savings account. I'm not sure but I think the minimum time is about 10 years. I also could keep saving and buy an apartment or small house with a loan. I just don't know. I've been looking at bonds and stocks but it just scares me a little and I don't feel like it's the right step at this time. Any advice or opinion would be great. I just need some perspective and maybe other alternatives to think about.

A last option I'm thinking of would be going back to college. When I was younger I started a couple different fields of studies but never finished. Now I'm doing night school to get a paralegal degree. It'll take me about two more years to get it but I'm not sure if that's the area I'd like to work in. I know I'm intellectual enough to get a proper degree, which would give me the possibility of a more satisfying and financially better job in the long run. It's just feels scary to stop a steady stream of income.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

No credit card debt, have student loans of $15.5K and a car loan of $10K.  Both of these loans are from family, and have a 0% interest rate.  I am getting a raise next month, and will have about $500/month that I need to figure out where to put.

So here are my questions:  
1. Should I continue to just pay the current payments on the car and student loans? Conventional wisdom would say to put the extra $500/month towards an IRA rather than paying on the debt, given that it's not accruing any interest.  However, I hate the idea of having $25K that seems looming over me, and that will take years to repay.  I realize this is a subjective thing, but I was wanting to hear some other opinions than my own.  
2. The mortgage is a pretty low interest rate, so I should wait to pay down on that until I can max out an IRA, right? But what about the PMI? Should I pay down the principal on the mortgage until PMI goes away, and then move that money into an IRA at that point?  Again, I hate having a huge dollar amount that I owe, and would love to pay down on the mortgage a lot faster than 30 years.  
3. If I do open an IRA, should I also start putting the $275/month that is going to the Vanguard, Acorns, and savings accounts into the IRA and not continue to fund those until later?  
4. Should I prioritize the mortgage or 403(b)?

financialindependence,Dilemma: Wedding planning vs Loan repayment vs FIRE,"SAVINGS:

Credit cards/bills are paid in full each month (ranges ~$1-1.5k month)  
Car is paid off (finally!)         

I SHOULD be netting about $1k/month with the above expenses and am now seeking advice.  
  
I was excited after reading all the inspiring FI stories about attacking debt asap and ramping up savings to reach FIRE, which I've been doing since the beginning of the year, but trying now that a wedding is in the near future I think I need to take a step back from aggressive loan payments and/or do I scale back on the 401k down to just the 5% match?

I'm hesitant to scale back on the 401k because of how the numbers can grow in my spreadsheet with max 401k contributions due to compounding interest.  
  
But at the same time I am sitting on a manageable but pretty hefty amount of loans at 6.55% which I wanted to attack by putting at least 2-2.5k a month to get rid of it asap until I did a rough budget for a wedding and realized I can't have everything.
  
I have about 10k sitting in a checking account that's kinda emergency fund and kinda wedding fund (since it's not growing maybe I can do something with it? or will it not grow much in 1 yr?)  
  
Planning to have a big wedding in June 2018, about 1 year left and since we are going to have a traditional wedding with a large amount of guests I want to be ready for the costs which can range from (35-50k).  
  
TLDR: I want to save for FIRE by maxing 401k, but i have 48k loans at 6.55%, and we're also getting married in a year that I need to save at least 25k for, how do I prioritize?

**************
Update:  
Instead of juggling all these different things and not being able to fully devote our energy and money to any particular goal, we decided to push back the wedding 1 more year, which would allow us to kill all of the loans, not have to consider any retirement savings reductions and start off marriage debt-free. We're working on cutting down the wedding budget as much as we can and go from there, thanks for all the comments everyone!",finance
gaming,Seasonal Game Releases,"I have been a passionate gamer for what seems my entire life. Nothing is more exciting that E3 in June and the promising game releases coming out in the Fall. As a PS4 player, and the fact that i'm fairly loyal to certain game franchises this issue may not be relatable for everyone. But it seems like most major titles and bigger releases each year are all stuffed between September - December. I understand that it is slanted towards releasing in the holidays but it seems unfair to us, gamers, as well as certain companies that have put in years of work to release these projects. For example, this year some of the most exciting releases for myself are Destiny 2, Assassins Creed Origins, COD:WWII, Fifa 18, God of War, and Red Dead Redemption 2. All of these games are planning on being released in those Fall months, besides Red Dead, and that is only due to Rockstar pushing back the initial release. Not only am I going to be spending a ton of money on games in such a short period of time, but for people who don't have the kind of money to buy all of these games they are either left to wait a few months after or to simply pick and choose from their favorite games to purchase. Now, in June, I'm struggling when it comes to dedicating myself to a game since there hasn't been any appealing game releases in the last few months for me and i'm left waiting for all these new games to be released. I do look forward to grinding these news games and then buying Red Dead Redemption 2 in the Spring as a new game to grind, just wish these major franchises would spread releases throughout the year so that I never have the issue of stale content and wanting something new. Like I said this could just be me and my choice of games, but what do you guys think?",technology

Sometimes just saying ""divided 8 decimal places"" doesn't actually ring a bell in their heads, many need to be spoon-fed the concept.

***People just don't know.***

Some wallets have the feature but exchanges don't do anything to help support this. Price is displayed across the board in BTC and ***BTC only.*** A feature within a settings menu doesn't help anyone who isn't already informed. ***We need it displayed on your front pages.***

How can you expect the community to grow as a whole without every facet of this community growing in proportion? You don't get long term holders and node runners without and influx of short term newbies open to trying to understand what all this hype is about.

From outside the box, this change is inevitable. Any outside (omnispective) observer would say ""riiiiiiiiiight about....***here*** *(points finger on the timeline)* , is when you'll see that shift"", but we're inside the box, so let's get this ball rolling.

personalfinance,"I just got my first ""big girl"" job and my fiance makes good money... What do we do now?","So a little background here. My fiance and I have been together for five years and are getting married in the fall of 2018. He's a software engineer making $95k a year and I just graduated nursing school and have been offered a position making (base) $50k a year. I have differentials and overtime that will get added onto that, but I'd prefer to plan for worst case scenario. We live in the Greater Philadelphia area for context on taxes/housing markets/etc.

My fiance has been leasing his apartment for about two years now and pays $1600 a month. I have been splitting my time between his apartment and my parent's house, as there is a 50 minute commute in between and I work where I grew up. He obviously works closer to his apartment. My job offer is closer to our hometown, so I don't want to commute to his current apartment - especially considering that I'd be doing it after a 12-hour overnight shift. So we both agree that we need to move somewhere closer to in-between.

We've been debating on whether or not we should rent or try to buy a house. I've always looked at a house as an investment and an apartment as ""throwing away money"", although I do realize there is much more to it than that. We were discussing the other day if we'd be able to save up a downpayment for a house between now and March when his lease is up. Although we theoretically ""could"", we're not sure it'd be the best idea.

Here's a rundown on finances for the both of us:

I have pretty much nothing saved. I have a custodial account that my mom is on that I guess I could technically touch at this point, but I'm honestly not sure how much is in it. I've had some issues with school which led to me using credit cards for tuition. I have five credit cards with a total combined credit limit of $17k. In total, I have about $9k in credit card debt across three cards with interest rates ranging from 10%-18% from tuition payments. My priority while I've been in school and working has been to pay those down as much as I can, but when you make a bit above minimum wage and can barely reach part-time hours, it's not easy. I also have about $50k in student loan debt. My minimum credit card payments monthly are $172 (and I know how bad it is to only pay the minimum, but during school it was all I could do...). My minimum student loan payment will be about $500 in six months when they start collecting. I also have a 36-month car lease running through 2019 of which my monthly payment is $215. So my total monthly payments equal $887 not counting food/entertainment purchases. I currently have my money in a traditional bank, but plan to switch to a credit union offered by my work. 

He has a savings of about $10k. He has two credit cards with a combined credit limit of $2k and he pays his cards off every month. He has about $25k in student loans and pays about $400 a month (minimum payment is $260). He pays rent and utilities (about $1800 total), a car payment of $420 (with a principal of $17,900), and a furniture payment for a bed he bought when moving into his apartment ($75 per month interest free for 60 months). His total monthly payments equal about $2695 not including food/entertainment. 

There is also the consideration of our wedding. We've committed to a contract of about $28k for the wedding of which both of our parents have offered to cover most of for us. With that being said, stuff happens, and in the event that something happens to either side, we need to be prepared to foot that bill.

I'm honestly not sure what would be better for us... Buying a house and paying less monthly for a mortgage than we would for rent, or continuing to rent and not needing to worry about emergency maintenance, etc. I recognize that there are pros and cons for each. I realize that if we were to buy, we'd likely be stretched thin while paying down our student loan debts. I don't want to be house poor, but I would love to build equity. I just don't know what to do... Your thoughts would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Cash EE bonds or wait til 20 years or maturity?,"Hey All,

I know this question has been asked before but everyone's situation seems quite different.

* 5 paper EE bonds in hand
* Denominations are 50, 100x2, 1000x2
* Price paid was $1,125 and they're now worth $1,511 (see photo for more details http://imgur.com/yztqPOK)

* I have about 4k split between checking and savings with BofA for day-to-day spending
* A good bit in my Ally savings account
* Currently investing in a Roth IRA and brokerage account
* No additional education plans in the near future

I'm wondering if I should just cash these EE funds and put the money into my IRA or brokerage accounts since the interest rates on these bonds are so low. However, since EE funds double in value after 20 years, I wasn't sure if I should just hold onto them and cash them out at 20 years. One has already double in 20 years but the others are set to double 7 years from now.

I'm also thinking that if the suggestions lean towards holding onto them, I would cash them out at 20 years after they all double in value and then invest the funds elsewhere since the interest rates are so low I don't plan on keeping them for 30 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

There are a number of requirements to meet to obtain loan discharge, but one in particular is disqualifying her, IMO unfairly: ""You must not have had an outstanding balance on Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans as of Oct. 1, 1998, or on the date that you obtained a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan after Oct. 1, 1998.""

Issue here is that my wife started undergraduate school in late-August or early September of 1998 – just like most other college students.  Because of when she started – her loans were dated before October 1, 1998.  However, this date that was chosen, basically invalidated anyone born before 1981.  This doesn’t quite seem right.

I'm not very familiar with how paying off excess amounts towards my loan is actually working.

My lender is Great Lakes, and my monthly payments are **$469**.

I likely will be paying upwards of $1,000 a month, so a bit over double the monthly payment. 


They give me two options of how the excess amount can be paid:

Option 1: Once scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, excess will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time. 
Done automatically.

Option 2: Once scheduled monthly payment has been paid, excess will be applied to the specific loans of your choosing.
You set manually.

If I'm not misunderstanding this, the excess amount is always going towards the principal, right?

So, for example, my $469 payment is interest+principal, and then an additional payment of $500+ would be all paid either divided amount the multiple loands (14 individual loans within Great Lakes) or whatever percentages I choose myself?

I would like to minimize my interest the most I can.

Hopefully I'm not confusing.",finance

I live at or above my means. I took a promotion at work last year that destroyed my finances. I made a bad decisions by taking 401K loans out for travel and house work (etc.) because with the promotion I was led to believe I'd make an additional $20k this year. I'm actually due to make $15-20K LESS this year. 


I also got one of those notices from the IRS stating that I owe $5,400 within the next month due to an error on my 2015 taxes.  I think it's wrong, and that's what I have to figure out within the next 30 days.

I have travel planned in September (including to a wedding which I'm in), which I believe will cost an overall $2,000, thus wiping out the majority of my savings. I've already cut around $75 from my monthly expenses by canceling erroneous services, calling and reducing my car and homeowner's insurance, etc. Should cut another $45 by August of this year. I'm already reducing my Starbucks habit -- I almost halved it this month to $150, looking to cut it off completely. Restaurants are killing me; I eat out when stressed, money stresses me out, vicious cycle... 


I guess, my questions are: where do I start? Do I look for an accountant? Is there a certain type to look for or avoid? Are debt-reducing counselors total scams? I'm finding mixed ideas online. My credit isn't terrible (660-700), but I was already denied when I requested to refinance my personal loan to a lower interest rate. Is it a terrible idea to try to obtain one large loan to pay off all debt, which could potentially reduce my monthly payment of everything significantly?

personalfinance,23yr w/ two student loans and I'm looking for advice,"Hello PF.

First off, let me say if I missed anything in my posting or if I'm not in the right area I do apologize. This is my first time posting here.

I've also checked the wiki for any information regarding my issue but couldn't find anything specific enough. But if I missed anything just show me the way.

Anyway... I have two student loans from when I attended a university in 2011. I'm currently not in school anymore and I'm looking to increase my credit score as it is not ideal and I want to know the best practice to paying back these loans.

They're both private student loans:

Loan A: est. $5,800 w/ 13.5% interest rate

Loan B: est. $7,100 w/ 10.0% interest rate

Would it make sense to possibly consolidate these loans and lump them together? 
My goal is to try and get a lower interest rate, but from what I understand from the wiki and other threads that consolidation isn't always the best practice. From what I've seen you don't always get a lower interest and they just average them together. But I don't know if that applies exclusively to private or government loans.

Granted, I'm not very knowledgeable on the subject so I'm just looking for some general advice on what I should be doing from this point.

Thanks for any help!",finance
CryptoCurrency,What would happen if the government released a new altcoin backed by USD?,"So imagine the US government introduces a new cryptocurrency, call it ""USACoin"" or USC. They take the best features from current available cryptocurrencies and announce they'll back it at 1:1 for USD for the first year and you can pay your taxes or pay for any government service with it. The ICO goes 100% to the Fed but there is a finite amount of USC available. Anyone contracting for the government can opt to be paid in USC instead of USD.

personalfinance,I'm a 24 year old waitress with an arts degree who just paid off her student loans in seven months thanks to PF advice!,"I've read a lot of these 'triumphant' posts about paying loans and it always turns out the person was an engineer and got a huge bonus, or lived at home, or came into inheritance, or something. I was pretty frustrated by this when I started reading PF, because of course those people can pay their loans! I tried to the best of my ability to adhere to the advice on this sub about loans and budgeting and it’s working so far. I thought my post could provide some insight for others in similar situations with no safety net. 

I graduated college in 2015 with $15,000 in debt, in four federal loans ranging from 3.5% to 7% interest. I know this isn't a lot of debt compared to the average. I didn't start seriously paying it until December of 2016 and paid it off completely as of today. I left home at 17 and have been in the service industry ever since. I went to a CUNY school and got an arts degree in a field I love I don’t regret it for a second. What I do regret is that after four years of working full time as a waitress in college just to pay rent ($1000 a month because NYC) and general expenses, I was straight up irresponsible with money for a year after graduating because I finally had free time. I spent from $300 to $800/week drinking and going out. I own a $1000 handbag and yes, I bought a lot of avocado toast. All of my friends had trust funds and could spend hundreds going out and there I was, playing along. I was keeping up with the Jonses in the worst way and was breaking even at best. By the time I got serious about finances, I was $3k in credit card debt, too. I was paying the minimum on my loans ($142) with no end in sight. So I did a complete overhaul:

-Moved to the West coast. Rent is now $650 a month instead of $1000. Utilities are $30-50 compared with $100+, No cable. 

-I don’t own a car or a bike. I live downtown and walk everywhere. Yes, it is limiting, but I spend a maximum of $20/month on uber if I need to. Still way cheaper than owning a car, and cheaper than my metrocard in NY. It also forces me to explore my neighborhood and be more creative.

-Got a job actually in my field!! But pay was $15 and hour for anywhere between 5 and 25 hours a week. Obviously not liveable but something for my resume.

 -So I got a serving job. This was four nights a week, but because I’m not in San Francisco or something I was making between $80-150 a night. 

-Got another serving job that paid a little better, one night a week and two days (meaning doubles on the weekend) so I was now working Monday to Friday in the morning at the job in my field, Wednesday-Friday nights as a server in two restaurants, and doing back-to-back doubles every weekend (9AM-1AM). 

-I cancelled a $75 gym membership and bought a yoga mat and some weights.

-Moving to the west coast helped a lot because my state has a high minimum wage for servers instead of the $5/hr I was making in NY. I think it will help me on taxes next year. 

-I used Mint and tracked every. Single. Penny. I know where every dollar between December and June went and hold myself personally responsible for it. I started making coffee at home. My SO and I meal prep together. We go to the reduced price movie night at the local theater, happy hours or bottomless brunches, and any free event our city offers. We are rarely bored! 

-I set my loan autopay to $600/month, and any extra leftover from the month went straight to the loans. I was averaging $1000/week working 7 days a week, in twelve “shifts.” I paid off the credit cards first and by January was making payments of $1500+ per month to my loans in addition to the autopay. My final payment was for $2k. 

There were a lot of times when it sucked, when I fought with my SO about us not taking vacations, when I was neglecting my personal life because I was pretty much always working. It was not easy. But now it’s all paid off! I spent a lot of time feeling like I may as well be living in a van down by the river, but seeing the zero balance is extremely satisfying and it was all worth it. I have quit two of my three jobs and am pursuing something in my field without the weight of my loans on my shoulders. I guess I really just wanted to say that not everyone on PF has a trust fund, and it IS possible to get your finances in control without one. The best advice is to use Mint or a budget tracker and avoid lifestyle creep. I know my debt will seem insignificant to most people, but this was life changing for me. 
**Edit - TL;DR:** I paid $15k in loans in 7 months as a waitress by moving to a low COL area, working three jobs seven days a week, using a budget, and avoiding lifestyle creep. 


**EDIT 2: I can't believe the support this post is getting! Thank you all for your responses, this is unreal for me. I'm working a double today but I'll be back later tonight and can respond to more of you.**",finance
personalfinance,"[27/F] ready to get out of debt, stop living paycheck to paycheck, and finally have an emergency fund like real adult.","Alright, let me preface this by saying that I didn't have a great financial education, but I'm trying to learn now. I was a little whimsical and very travel-oriented in my early 20's and let my credit card debt slip. Now, after a sort of near-death experience I'm ready to get my life and finances together and stop living so carelessly. Here's the deal:

Credit Card Debt Total: $24,302.00~

* Spread over 7 cards
* Lowest balance: $100~, Highest balance: $7,728.00 
* APRs range from 0% - 14.74%
* Minimum payments: $45 - $146/month

Student Loan Debt Total: $22,388.45

* Currently in forbearance until 02/2018 when I will have to start paying $245/month
* Each loan between 4.5%-6.8% interest

Rent:

* Currently $555/month plus $80~ for internet and utilities.
* Will reduce to $465/month in August which includes electricity &amp; utilities + $25 for internet so $490/mo (I feel like this is pretty good for Austin, TX currently; I tried my best you guys)

Other Monthly:

* Phone: $93.07/month (for the iPhone SE that's outdated and has little data storage I feel like I could be doing better than this, but not sure how.)
* Leased Car : $270/mo (not the best decision I've made, I'd like to get out of this lease, but I imagine paying my CC debt down first takes priority)
* Car Insurance: $131.70
* Health Insurance: $209.24
* Spotify/Gym: $40~ (I don't drink, so I feel like I can justify the subscription for running music and gym membership which I use almost daily)
* Gas: $60-$80~/month, but I'm thinking I can start biking/bussing to work more often and cut down on this
* Food: I get fed 3X a day at work, so this is pretty small. I really try to take advantage of this currently and take food to go if I can catch all three meals here, but it doesn't always work out that way. I generally pay to eat out on the weekends though, so it ends up being more than I anticipate. I need to get better at grocery shopping and stop getting expensive smoothies post workouts... Estimating $40-$75/week?

Income:

* $2216/month after taxes (main contract job, will end in November and pays 18/hr. Am trying to find better paying job by September, however)
* $160-200~/month from my second job at an outdoor store. 11/hr but they're flexible with me. 
* $340/month extra coming in for a while from someone who owes me for something

And there you have it. I've received a generous financial gift of 2K and recently sold my plane ticket that I bought on impulse (I have this weird anxiety/mental thing going after my ""experience"" mentioned before... so I impulse buy and returned things for a few months to distract myself from emotional things) for $400, so I'm thinking the best thing to do is follow Dave Ramsey's baby-steps (because everything else is overwhelming right now) and set up a $1K emergency fund first.

My questions are:

* My current checking account is with USAA as I can withdraw my money from any ATM and they would return the fee. This was useful as I traveled, but no longer necessary. As I am not actually military, I don't know that I am eligible for a savings account with them. Should I, a.) look at a credit union and set up a savings/emergency funds account (speaking of which, should I be calling emergency funds the same as savings?) with them? OR should I b.) try to open a savings account with Synchrony bank that has [High Interest Savings Account Rates](https://www.synchronybank.com/banking/high-yield-savings/)?

* Once 1K of the 2.4K is allocated to emergency funds, should I continue to contribute to that every month/paycheck? If so, how much? 

* The remaining 1.4K should definitely then go to CC debt and I plan to pay the lower cards first. HOWEVER, the one card that has a balance of $2,253.57 and has 0% APR only has it until 01/2018 and then I'd get slammed with a 18.74 interest rate which is higher than any of the other cards. Is it in my best interest to pay that one off first before this happens? Or should I just follow the rules and pay the lowest balances off first?

* I also don't know how to allocate for clothes, hygiene/cosmetics/skincare, etc. monthly and usually end up overspending for these things. Help? How much should I set aside for these things?

* There's also $140/mo for CBT ($70/hr session), but I may try to find someone else that is covered by my insurance and cheaper, even though it's through the marketplace and is pretty awful. But I need it less and less every month so I think this shouldn't be an issue soon... hopefully.

Any other advice is welcome. Also, please be kind, as mentioned earlier I'm still sort of... tender from my experience and am really attempting to focus on how to fix things without everything being completely overwhelming and having excess stress is... detrimental to my recovery, haha. I am definitely going to try to apply for a higher paying job with benefits soon so my costs for unexpected healthcare expenses won't blow me out of the water like they did earlier this year. 

Thanks so much!",finance
personalfinance,"Should we buy a house soon with interest rates rising, or continue to rent and pay off student loans?","The wife and I are in a bit of a pickle. We're currently riding the debt snowball train to pay off our student loans (about 33K left combined). We were also fortunate enough to get some financial gifts in the past few years to use as a down payment toward a house (and NOT to use toward paying down student loan debt). We have about 40k to put toward a down payment toward house, and are currently saving extra to put toward the house. We'll have ~50k by March 2018 (when our lease is up)

The decision we're struggling with is - do we buy a house when our lease is up - approximately 9 months away in March of 2018 - or do we continue to rent until we have our student loans paid off? Should we be concerned about rising interest rates (buy a house sooner), or should we continue to debt snowball until we're out of debt and be more financially flexible in terms of what we could save toward a house/cost of home ownership?

* Current combined gross income is ~136k.

* No Credit card debt, both of our cars are paid off.

financialindependence,Buying a house in cash - FI/RE Perspective,"Hi FI

Using a throwaway due to personal info. I've heard and read the pros and cons of buying a house in cash from the PF prospective, but I want to look at it from an FI perspective. Here's the situation: 

I'm in my late 20's. My wife and I are looking at buying a home sometime in the next few years (I'm asking for advice now because I like to plan ahead and also this may involving liquidating some investments, which I would prefer to do strategically), and we have the luxury to be able to afford to buy the home outright without a mortgage. We have &gt;$1M in investment accts, not including what's in IRA and retirement accts. Assume net worth is about $1.3M. I don't have a FIRE number per se, but want to have the freedom to walk away by like 45-50. Could see myself working that long, don't want to work longer. We like to travel, plan on having kids (so FatFire), and I don't hate my job yet. Tenative plan is get to $3M and reassess. My question for discussion is:

**What are the pros and cons of paying for a home outright in cash rather than a mortgage?** and **If you were in my shoes, would you do it and what would be the maximum you would spend on a home?** I realize that the mathematically optimal answer is to take out a mortgage and invest, since the rate of return (historically, over the long term) will exceed the interest rate of the mortgage. I get that. But I'm leaning towards no mortgage, or a very small portion mortgaged, since the piece of mind just feels worth a lot to me. And it's a guaranteed rate of return equal to the interest rate of the potential loan (stock market return not being *guaranteed* over the loan time period). Plus, isn't a paid off home a huge step towards FIRE?

Further details: The home will be somewhere in the midwest. We plan to stay in this home for a long time. In terms of future earnings to replenish the money spent on the home, right now our combined income is about $100k. It may well exceed that in the coming years as I've recently completed some further education, but let's assume that for future projections. 

And yes I realize this is all a luxury and I should fuck myself and that's why I'm using a throwaway.",finance

personalfinance,29f tattooer making 29k at most. Want to go back to school. Completely lost.,"I am a 29f tattoo artist with about 10 years experience. To be blunt, my career is not one that will ever be profitable. I work on a 50%commission, but I'm an employee with a W2 and not an independent contractor. I have no dependants so my deductions are 1. About a third of my gross income goes to state and federal taxes. I receive no benefits and have to pay out of pocket for health insurance. There is zero chance of me getting a raise, ever. Also, and most importantly, my body is beginning to deteriorate. I have carpal tunnel and constant back pain, and i estimate that i have at most 5 to 7 years of tattooing left in me. 

Last year i made 28.5k taxable income (this is the highest amount that i have ever made in my life. People think that tattooing is really profitable, but unless you own your own shop, it really really isn't. I have zero desire to do that.)  I want to buy a house and save for retirement, but considering that I live in one of the fastest-growing areas of the US and property  values around me are rising exponentially, i have come to the conclusion that is time to change careers. I applied to the local community college this morning and applied to fafsa.  I am thinking something in computer programming or manufacturing, because there are just hundreds of available jobs in those fields, and the starting salaries are at least 15k more than what i make now. 

My plan is to continue tattooing while i to go school.  I am on shifft for about 25 hours a week and spend an additional 5 to 10 a week drawing, so i feel like i would have plenty of time to study. 

Im sick of being broke and having no savings. I'm sick of not being able to plan for my retirement. I'm tired of having to ask my SO for help if there's an emergency.

Unfortunately, i have no idea what I'm doing. I dropped out of college at 19 due to getting a felony and not being able to afford both school and probation costs. (i am currently working on getting it expunged, but again, no money.)

personalfinance,Should I call my school's financial aid office before calling the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman?,"I am in a PhD program now because I was unable to get the only job my Master's degree is good for. This health professional masters degree cost me about 4 times the average US student loan debt. In hindsight, it appears the only use of the degree was to apply to residencies within a three-month window of time the year before graduation; the degree is worthless otherwise. (I essentially missed this narrow window of opportunity.)

The main problem is that this university and others are flooding this job market with graduates every year so that at present 50% of residency applicants are not being matched with a position.

The university trustees got their money, they profited off me and several others apparently in my position, and now the US Department of Education is trying to get back from *me* the money they gave to these university trustees &amp; company -- money I don't have because I don't have the job.

It seems to me they should be getting their money back from the university that sold me a worthless degree. It seems good to call the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman (Navient suggested it when I called them) to explain this situation to them (with additional details I've not provided here). However, [Matthew 18](http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/18/):15-20 comes to mind -- shouldn't I call the university's student aid office and speak with them first, before taking the matter to the Ombudsman?

My concern is that this could ""backfire"" by alerting them to the problem before I contact the Ombudsman, enabling them to 'cover their tracks' with fraudulent behavior so that when the Ombudsman investigates, there'd be no action to take, just this prestigious university's word against mine. Additionally, I am concerned about ""burning bridges"" professionally, since I am still trying to enter this field and don't want to be 'blacklisted' as a trouble-maker. This field is not very large (hence the bottleneck to enter it).

For additional context: I have already tried contacting the program director, email to arrange a phone call; the response from the phone call was hostile-defensive and fruitless: My current situation was 100% my fault, my responsibility. I was told we could talk again and that I would receive their support; this program director later left without notice to me. I tried contacting the second program director (and secretary), formerly a professor in the program; this time the emails were ignored. I later was told by someone else in the field that the program was presently discontinued, being restructured by the university.

Nonetheless, I am concerned that it may still be good for me to contact the university's student aid office in good faith, since they are (presumably) separate from that particular program, and may genuinely wish to help a student, given the endowment and prestige of their university. I am thinking to call them in about 22 hours to discuss loan forgiveness or discount before calling the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman, but would appreciate your thoughts on these matters.

investing,A bearish outlook on the U.S. economy,"**Money will be leaving the market**

1) Vanguard says that 91.3% of equity is held by people over the age of 46 (http://imgur.com/a/r4uSD). This group is retiring and will continue to take funds out over time to cover expenses.

2) (I believe) Yellen raising rates will allow baby boomers to take more and more assets out of the stock market, and put them into bank accounts/bonds instead. 

      **This money will not be replaced by the younger generation**

1) Student loan debt for the class of 2016 was an average of $37,172 (https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/).

2) Yes, median household income has increased since 1985 by around 6k (http://imgur.com/a/Oukiw) BUT

3) Housing in the United States relative to real wages has TRIPLED since 1980 (http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/08/daily-chart-20).

4) The number of jobs available will inevitably decrease as automation takes over. Driverless cars on their own will take a huge number of jobs, 4.1 million according to Marketwatch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hello-self-driving-cars-goodbye-41-million-jobs-2016-09-15).

**TLDR: Money will continue to leave the market due to retirement spending and interest rate increase, but will not be replaced by the younger generation as student loans and housing increase at such alarming rates.**

personalfinance,The cost of commuting vs. buying close to work.,"So on another thread here, I noticed a lot of talk about commuting and how it's often impossible to find housing in some urban centers because of high costs. The general feeling seemed to be that commuting sucks, but it's the only choice. While it *can be* the better choice, it's not always. Let's take a look at some basic numbers. 

I read a lot of people suggesting that an hour commute is no big deal. Depending on how many miles that is, it actually can be a big deal though. Let's do the math. First, we need to figure out how much driving actually costs. Luckily the federal government has done some work for us and we have a good ballpark estimate of the cost of driving in their mileage reimbursement rates, which currently sits at 53.5 cents/mile. This cost, in theory, includes both the cost of gas and the wear and tear on the vehicle. The cost of this is actually probably higher, but we'll go with that. 

Let's also assume that the average hour commute is also only 30 miles. It might be more or less, but that seems reasonable. So 30 miles each way is 60 miles per day just on the daily commute. At 53.5 cents/mile, thats about $32/day. Multiply that by the 261 working days in a year, and you're at $8378/year in commuting costs. 

Now most folks here, at least I assume, tend to stick to the idea that you should buy your house on a 15 year mortgage. Well 15 years of commuting at $8378/year comes out to $125,000. And that's not even including the value of your time. Suddenly, that $350,000 townhouse in the city doesn't seem as such a bad deal compared to the $150,000 house outside of town with the long commute. Now double that commute to 60 miles each way, and you're talking a quarter million over 15 years. 

But let's also be honest here. Most Americans don't buy homes on 15 year notes. They use a standard 30 year mortgage. So over 30 years, that 30 mile commute still costs you a quarter million dollars. A 60 mile commute is now a cool half million over a 30 year mortgage. 

Now obviously there are some other things to consider - how much of a commute would you have from the expensive townhouse in the city (because if you're still driving 10 miles each way, that obviously eats into the savings), the difference in the price of car insurance for the long commute and the in-town commute, the cost of having to replace your car more often (after all, 30 miles each way per day is an extra 15,000 miles a year. Most Americans tend to drive about 15,000 miles a year according to FHA, so that's doubling your mileage on your car, meaning you're going to have to purchase a car twice as often, all other things being equal), and any host of other factors. 

My point here is only that commuting is expensive as well. It might still turn out to be the financially prudent move, but it's not the no-brainer many people seem to think it is.",finance

Bitcoin,Money Transmitter,"So I know this may be old news, but I was wondering if there are any news laws whether selling on Paxful or LocalBitcoins is illegal (because of Money Transmitter requirements). I have heard that as long as you don't transfer more than $1,000 to any one person per day you are fine, but then I heard that Money Transmitters do not have any threshold. 

I am in Tennessee and they do not include someone who deals in crypto-currency a money transmitter, but seeing how I will be operating online, how does this apply? 

Furthermore, I have looked at some sites that claim that a money transmitter is simply a ""middle man"" and that as long as I buy Bitcoins and then sell them of profit, this is not considering a ""money transmitting business"". Surely I have the right to sell something that I bought with my own money through an exchange; no matter what the uncharge may be. 

This is such a confusing issue, are there any traders or Bitcoin specialists who can help me out with this question?

P.S. Please don't tell me to contact a lawyer; there has got to be someone who knows what I am missing here. I doubt very highly that every seller on Paxful and LocalBitcoins are breaking Federal Law. 

Also, if there are any traders on here that know how to make this model legal, I will pay you to help me get everything setup. Thanks.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,First New Car purchase - down payment vs financing?,"Within 6 months I will be purchasing a new (2017) vehicle.  I've decided on make and model, but not options, and I'll be shopping around.  I plan to spend about $25k max after taxes and fees, but I'm not sure how much to put down.

I will likely be buying the highest trim because of important option packages, and I plan to keep the car for 15+ years, or as long as it runs, so I'm not concerned too much about depreciation or resale value.

I currently have $6k in savings, separate from my regular checking account (another $5k currently).  By the end of this year I'll have $10k saved.  I have good credit (749 I think) and will very likely be approved for my bank's lowest auto interest rate (~3-3.5% recently).  I net around $700 each month after my regular budget (most of this 700 is diverted to savings).  I can count on my insurance increasing by around $30/mo with this new vehicle.  

My question is whether I should put the 10k down immediately or retain the savings and stick with 20%.  I'd like to spend no more than 3yrs paying off the loan, but I would also like to continue diverting extra funds towards other savings goals.  A low down-payment would require much higher monthly payments, and more $$ financed overall.  I'll have a reasonable safety net with my 6-7k or so in checking, but I'm not sure if that's enough.  

TL;DR - Is it a bad idea to wipe my savings to secure 40-50% down (10-11k) and low payments (&lt;$350/mo) for a relatively short term?  Does it even matter much?  And how do I approach the bank and dealer with this info?  FYI my trade-in might get me $500.

personalfinance,Refinancing Auto Loan to Save $$$,"Sorry this is a repost, I didn't get too many views on my post late last night. Trying this one last time.

Hi, I have a quick question regarding the practicality of refinancing my auto loan with Ford Motor Credit.

I bought a 2017 Ford Mustang in May of 2017. I agreed to 4.95% APR for 60 months in order to receive copious Ford rebates.

My current payoff is $13,561, and my monthly payment is $292. I think I can easily pay this off in 24 months, 36 months at worst.

Is it worth it to ditch Ford Motor Credit if I'm paying off a relatively small balance at such an accelerated rate? I have been putting $2,000 per month to the car, but plan to slow down to $1,000 or less. I will have to shop the refinance rate, but again, would it really be worth the hard pull of credit just to get a 2-3% interest rate (and save a few hundred dollars)?

Lastly, I know every lender is different, but do lenders generally charge for refinancing?

Thanks in advance",finance

I'm 24, single, have a bachelor's degree, and just came off a two-year stint working abroad, traveling, and not really worrying too much about money. I'm debt free. I own my car (7y.o. Honda CR-V) outright. I'm about to start a new job, making 40k/yr with good benefits. 401k 100% matching up to 5%, etc.

I currently have about 5k in savings and 4k in a Roth IRA. I plan to contribute my 5% to the 401k and about $300/mo to the Roth IRA. I also know that my emergency savings fund needs to be beefed up a bit, so I aim to get that to about 7k.

I would like to live alone. I'm pretty sure I can afford it in the 800-900/mo range for rent, plus utilities.

My car has always been well maintained and should have 3-5 years before I'll want to replace it. I would like to buy a house or condo someday, but not for at least 5 years. I'll be staying with family for the first couple months of my new job while I look for an apartment, but I'll need to get/buy furniture and other household items when I eventually move in.

personalfinance,Lease Exit Options,"I did something very impulsive and stupid. I’m a very impulsive person. I have a very hard time controlling it sometimes.

I got a new car. I got a shitty price for my trade-in, I got a shitty price on the car, and I got a SHITTY interest rate (money factor…whatever, it’s an interest rate) on the lease agreement. The whole situation I put myself in at the dealer was just bad, it’s not an excuse, but I definitely felt pressured and by the time I realized I didn’t want “in,” I had already signed everything.

Let’s just say I’m paying way too much. It’s a very nice car, I love driving and having it, and we can comfortably make these payments for the duration of the lease – but it’s a bad feeling to have been worked like that and to have lost my tongue.

It’s through Lexus Financial, and my understanding is that if you want to terminate your lease agreement, you still owe what would be due for the remainder of your payments if you turn the car in. That would be the obvious option.

The way I see it, my options are to either:

1.       Live with my mistake, enjoy the car, and make the payments like a good boy
2.       Buy the car out and either finance it through my bank for better payments, or sell it (and likely eat &gt;$5,000-$6,000)

personalfinance,[EU] 27/m Trying to get mi finances in check.,"Hey PF! I'm 27 Male from Poland. I was lurking here for about a month trying and trying to use advice given to others however they are mainly tailored for US and I do have problems following them. For example MINT/Personal Capital tend to default to $ which makes it had to properly track my expenses.

I have been doing nothing with my finances as far as I remember Just getting my paycheck and spending it. Right now me and my SO are thinking about starting a family(getting married, having children and getting a flat/car of our own). With my current financial situation i'm feeling pretty insecure about all this.

I have never had a Credit Card, my family usually told me they are evil and to stay away from it. Debit Card tied to my main bank account was all I used.

All amounts I will be mentioning bellow will be in my local currency but i believe this to not be an important factor.

The only loans I ever took were small quick loans with very high interest for when i needed money until next paycheck(200 - 300 each with 8%+ interest rates) All payed on time and 2k loan for a bike.  As you can see my Credit Score/History Is pretty much non existent, My SO also has a non existent Credit History due to mentality of buying what you can with hard cold cash. We are sure getting a good rate on our mortgage will be hard.

Our Earnings are pretty decent for where we live in but we seem to have a lot of leakages where we could do better.
Because we do not share our finances I will be presenting my side of the story as I cannot speak much for her finances.I'm more concerned about my contribution.

I earn 3.6k/mo after tax

- Rent + Utilities are 550-650/mo - This one is pretty small because we live in a small apartment that we would like to move out off due to cramped space. Bigger ones would set me back 1k/mo instead, eating in to any savings.

- Food is around 1.5k/mo - I tend to go out a lot to eat and only cook at home once or twice per week. I also tend to Eat a lot lately

- Transportation is around 80/mo average. Pretty inconsistent as I do not own a monthly Pass. I prefer to walk everywhere.

- Huge amount of money(~300/mo) on small things such as snacks/soft drinks etc. I have problems tracking it as mentioned above.

- 40/mo for gym membership and 300/mo for personal trainer/professional diet consultations to get myself to cook at home. I was severely underweight(65Kg with 190cm height) and this was only thing that actually showed any result(I'm not a living stick anymore). I'm planning to drop it in a month or 2 after i get in a habit of taking care of myself properly.

- 200/mo on entertainment such as Games/Movies (one game can be like 100+ here and a ticket to a move not counting snacks like 30+)

As you can see I'm able to save around 500/mo but it seem so insignificant for my goal.
We want to move out ASAP but to buy a flat we would need 400k mortgage and where we live 15-20% down payment is required, that is 60-80k we don't have(30-40k for my part).Also No Credit history will cause monthly payments to hurt that much more.

What I need help/advice with:
- Should we suck it up and stay in cheap and small(26sqm) flat until we can buy one which might not be for a significant amount of time? Or it is ok to move out and rent a biger one.

- Should I get a credit card and ditch my debit one? Is this enough to build a credit Score or I do also need to start buying things I need with Loans. Like my Bike.

- What good software for tracking expenses do you recommend for non $/€ users. I have tried 2 mentioned above and also making my own excel spread sheet results were OK'is at best. I'm still not sure where every penny goes.

- What techniques do you use to track expenses? Lets say i go shopping and i buy lots of stuff for a week of living. Any good ways to track what did I buy exactly? Right now it looks for me as 300 worth of groceries. No separation between the snacks/actual food/other things required to run my home. Do you just go by each item on a receipt? I need some method to track unneeded purchases and cut them out.

- Should I cut into entertainment and reduce it to 0 to save more money? It does not feel like it will have much impact on my finances at the moment but will make my life miserable.",finance

personalfinance,"25 year old PF success story – modest income, lived on my own","I've been thinking about posting for a while, but I've decided to bite the bullet and share my story. I love reading success stories from others so I hope this helps someone. I paid off my $26,000 in student loans in less than three years while making $30,000-50,000 per year and living on my own.


As a bit of background, I graduated from a small private college in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mass Communication with a student loan balance close to $23,000. Not a terrible amount by any means, but certainly not debt free. I took out a total of $26,000 in student loans during college, but I paid off close to $3000 while I was still a student thanks to multiple part time jobs. Thankfully I got lots of scholarships and grants in my financial aid package, otherwise I probably wouldn’t have gone to a private school. I paid for college on my own. As a graduation gift to myself, I upgraded from a 2003 vehicle to a 2010 vehicle, taking on an auto loan of $7500. I got my first full time job at a radio station right out of college with a starting salary just shy of $30,000. My total loan balance was about equal to that starting salary.

I held that first job after graduation for 15 months before taking a new job that came with a pay raise to a bit under $40,000 and great benefits including 401k matching (my default contribution was 4.5% while my employer contributed about 9%). While at both jobs, I rented a two bedroom apartment ($800/m and then $1075/m, including utilities). I rented out the spare room both summers during my first job (summer vacation town) and one semester in my current apartment (college town) plus Airbnb when I didn’t have a roommate.

I delivered pizzas as a side gig the first year out of college. When I took the new job, I started doing radio sports play-by-play on the side. It’s something I did as part of my first job out of college and I really enjoyed it, so it’s been a great side gig for me. I signed up for Uber and did that for about 9 months, but it wasn’t really worth the wear and tear on my car so I stopped doing that.  Even with side gigs, I haven’t earned more than $50,000 in a year.


Before finding this subreddit, I was already budgeting, tracking balances on all of my accounts and loans, and being pretty frugal. Once I found this sub, I got more into investing and maxed out my Roth IRA for 2016 and 2017 through Vanguard. When my student loans were gone, I upped my 401k contribution by about $90 per month. As of today, my 401k and IRA total about $27,000.

A few weeks ago, I looked through my spreadsheets to see how much I’ve made on side gigs since I graduated college – close to $24,000, which is basically what I owed on student loans when I graduated. Side gigs have been the single biggest contribution to me paying off my loans quickly. But even with that, sticking to a budget helped keep me on track.

Fast forward to 2017 and I have paid off all of my student loans (as of March) and auto loan (Feb 2016). I like to think I've always had a pretty good head on my shoulders financially, but finding this sub helped me speed up the process of paying down debt and investing wisely. I was on the standard repayment plan for my loans (all federal) and paid extra toward the highest interest rate loan each month. I had my balance down under $12,000 in March when I decided to pay them off. I had enough left over for a healthy emergency fund and extra savings to feel comfortable throwing that much at them at once.


There are lots of posts about people paying off their student loans quickly, many of whom make 6 figures or live at home while they pay down loans. There’s nothing wrong with that at all, but I thought I’d share another story of someone doing it on a more modest income and not living at home. I should mention that I have been very fortunate to be able to stay on my parents’ health insurance since graduation. 

**TL;DR** – Paid off $30,000 in loans in less than three years while living on my own and making less than $50,000 annually. Side gigs, frugality, budgeting, great work benefits, and this sub all helped immensely. Still made investing a priority too.


In case anyone’s interested, here’s a typical monthly budget for me now.

Monthly income from work (gross, pre-tax): $3450

Side gig income: $200-1500, depends on the month

Housing/cell phone: $1150

Transportation: $180

Insurance premiums and out of pocket (auto, life, vision, health, dental): $170

Investing (401k and Roth IRA): $700

Food (Groceries and dining out): $200

Entertainment: $100

Etc: $100

Taxes: $750

I usually come in under budget in most categories. I also make sure that my full time job income covers all expenses so my side gig income could go straight to student loans and now to investing/savings.

financialindependence,"Navient Study ""Money under 35"" Second Year","For those that don't know Navient (Federal student loan servicer, used to be Sallie Mae) conducts a study called ""Money Under 35"" which is supposed to show financial health amongst young adults in America.  The study is in its second year.  I've pasted the Executive Summary below, but basically it samples 3,000~ young Americans to find out how we're doing financially.  There's also an infographic, but I can't do images on the work computer.

A blurb that jumped out to me was this: ""Young adults who attended college but did not earn a degree are the most likely group to have poor financial health – including their peers with a high school education or less.""  This makes sense, since these people get all the cons of college education (mainly debt) but none of the perks (degree, access to increased wages).  Intuitive, but maybe not obvious.

What's this have to do with FI/RE?  Well, first off I found this when I checked Navient today to find my last payment went through and I'm done with loans.  But more importantly, I think most of us on here (maybe I'm wrong) are young adults that are interested in FI/RE and I think the idea of Financial Independence is most appealing to young adults.  This report directly reflects (or is supposed to) young adults and how we're doing financially.

Link (various .pdf files for download): https://navient.com/about/who-we-are/research-and-studies/

Executive Summary: Navient’s Money Under 35 is a national study conducted by Ipsos that provides a snapshot of how young adults are faring financially in the current economy. Now in its second year, the study is based on a nationally representative sample of 3,069 Americans aged 22 to 35. The 2016 study finds an improved financial picture for young adults compared to 2015 and shines a spotlight on the relative benefits of college completion. By contrast, the study finds that young adults who start college but leave before earning a degree report lower financial health than young adults with degrees and even those who did not start college at all.""

personalfinance,Credit score vs student loans,"I have been working on my credit score for the past two years and there is one item which is a huge hit I don't know how to handle. 

I graduated in 2012 with about 30+k in federal loans. I was moving around a lot at the time and financial irresponsibility was my MO. My loans were on auto payments and I really just didn't pay attention to them. In 2013 my loans got switched to granite state and it was divided into 8 individual loans. I was auto paying 238 a month and this kept coming out of my account. However, My payments for some reason didn't cover the minimum and I really didn't pay attention to it at all for a year. Fast forward to today and I have had good standing payments since May 2014. That's leaves me with a little over 100 delinquent payments. FUCKIN OUCH. I called to reason with them and just got stonewalled, which makes no sense to me that they want their payments, but want to WRECK my credit. I mean, cmon, three years of never missing a payment and you can't drop EVEN PART of my delinquent payments. I hate these fuckers and I have no idea how to handle this. Do I contest each report? If so, what's the best way to do that. I thought about consolidation with another company cause I don't want to deal with these clowns anymore. Bah. Just typing about it straight pisses me off. What can I do? 


Tl;dr is Federal loans went to granite state and there are 8 individual loans. I was a idiot and didn't pay attention to it for a year and although payments were made, they didn't cover the minimum. Now I have 112 late payments laying waste to my score.",finance
personalfinance,Having trouble refinancing student loans - need help!,"Hello there! I’ve been a long time reader of the subreddit and am finally in need of some help! 

My wife has two student loans that were consolidated a few years ago. One for $31k and another for $48k, totaling $79k. The interest rate is 5.5%. The monthly payment is reaching $600. She makes $50k/year as a teacher and has a credit score between 650-700. We are aware of some of the loan forgiveness options for teachers but she does not qualify for those. 

I’ve seen some ads and others have success getting a lower rate. We applied to a few other lenders to refi again hopefully at a lower rate (SoFi, CommonBond, earnest), but were denied. I’m guessing they don’t like her salary vs her outstanding loan balance. if I understood the directions properly when applying I could not include my salary in the gross annual income. Our goal is to hopefully refi into a lower fixed rate and get a lower monthly rate. Variables scare me unless there is something to know about them that makes them easier to handle and not spike up at some point? So my questions are:

1. Since her loans were consolidated, but still show as “separate” within her account (probably to show where they came from), is it possible to try to refinance only a portion of the $79k? Maybe trying to apply to refi $30k or so at a lower rate?
2. Any other lenders that are more friendly toward teachers?
3. Any other ideas in general? 

Thanks Ya’ll!",finance
personalfinance,Too Many Credit Checks While Buying a Co-Op,"Hi PF,

I'm currently in the process of buying a co-op in NYC and am concerned about all of the credit checks involved in the process from both mortgage lenders and the co-op board.

In preparation to looking for an apartment I followed through with my due diligence in getting pre-approved for a mortgage by a bank who had to run a credit check on me. This was about 2 months ago.

Now I have finally found an apartment to buy and the sales contract has been signed. The next step in the process is applying to the co-op board who will not accept an application without a commitment letter from a lender. In order to do this now I will need to have a lender run my credit again in order to process the full application.

So after this the next step is submitting the co-op application which requires a credit check, so at this point my credit will be run yet again. This now makes 3 credit checks over the course of about 3-4 months.

Also, since we do not yet know when the board meets to review the application (they won't tell anyone) I still don't have any idea of when I would be able to close. So once I get to this point and can finally lock in a rate I may choose to go with a different lender  who can offer the most competitive interest rate, and in order to do this I would need to go through yet another credit check.

Maybe I am thinking too much about this but it seems like there is a potential for too many credit checks too far apart from this point on and I'm not sure if this would have significant impact on my credit.",finance
personalfinance,Private Student Loan Refi,"Looking for some advice on Student Loan Refi options. 

Relatively new out of college, Married, Building equity in a condo, Earning 60K per year at first position, Wife earns about 20K. Credit score is good (been working on that for a while).  We want to buy a house next year so will be saving at least 15K for a down payment (we have about 10k currently)

I made a few decisions in college that led me to take out about 25K in personal student loans. This amount is spread out over 3 separate loans detailed below

$7,000; 6.28%; Variable; 15 yr

$12,000; 7.89%; Fixed; 15 yr

$6,500; 11.5%; Fixed; 15 yr

Currently, since we are saving to buy a house, we are looking into refi options for my student debt. I have looked into SoFi, LendingTree and Citizens. They all seems to be highly recommended on several websites so I think any of the 3 will be ok. 

When looking at rates I found that I can get about a 6.74% fixed rate or a 5.72% Variable rate. Do you think the fixed rate is a better option? I am intending on focusing on these loan pay-offs as soon as we get into a house but I was hoping to save a bundle on interest.

More importantly, does it make sense to refi all three loans into the one fixed loan? it would mean a much better fixed interest rate on 2 of the loans but the third already has a lower interest rate (got it when I had better credit and parents cosigned). I guess I just think it sorta makes sense to me to have all the loans in one place but is it worth the extra cost? Any advice here?",finance
personalfinance,Credit Loan Consolidation?,"Hi all, 

First-time poster here. Just going to give it to you straight: 

26 years old, $55K salary (before taxes), currently working on paying off $13,519.50 in credit card debt and looking for some advice. 

As of now, I throw $500/mo towards the debt, and add no new expenses to it (no need anymore - a lot of it was due to a move to a drastically more expensive part of the country). My card interest rates are 20.74%, 21.74%, and 19.74%, though one's interest doesn't kick in until 11/2017. My goal is to have all of this gone (along with some other debt obligations ie: car, student loans) before 30. 

The plan I'm following right now for the credit debt is perfectly doable within 36 months, but will have me paying about $4700 more than I actually owe. With that in mind, I'm wondering:

1. Would a credit consolidation loan be something worth looking into? 
2. What would be considered reasonable interest rates for these loans? 
3. Any recommendations on providers?

personalfinance,Active versus passive debt funds,"I hope this is the right Sub to ask this question. Currently, some of my IRA is in a passive bond fund (iShares AGG), which is a mix of government and blue-chip treasuries, with an average maturity of 8 years. My investment advisor is worried about a passive bond fund like this in a rising interest rate environment, and wants me to switch to an actively managed fund, which, he says, can better protect against downside when rate hikes hit. He knows I am a big Boglehead, and agrees with me that active management for equity is a waste of money, but thinks that this is best for me, despite the managed bond funds having expense ratios of 1% versus 5 basis points for AGG. I trust him and know he isn't trying to rip me off.

personalfinance,(UK) Received £10k from my gran (UPDATE),"Hey folks, previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6hzv1u/uk_student_in_south_africa_just_received_10k_from/). Thank you so much to everyone who commented on that thread, it's really helped guide my thought processes on this.

Given my personal circumstances, saving effectively seems to be pretty hard. High interest saving accounts seem great, but most require regular deposits and/or possession of a current account which receives above a certain amount per month. I don't have a UK income, so these won't be feasible sadly. 

So I've been educating myself on the options available and it looks like the option at the middle of the Venn diagram of best/easiest/most reliable is the [NSandI Investment Guaranteed Growth Bond](https://www.nsandi.com/Investment-Guaranteed-Growth-Bonds), which offers a 2.2% interest rate guaranteed for 3 years on amounts up to £3000. Doesn't quite beat inflation, but comes much closer than a Cash ISA. 

That accounts for £3k. The remaining £7k I'm not quite sure what to do with. My options seem to be:

* Cash ISA: no string attached savings account. Interest rates are around 1.1% on those, which is pretty terrible compared to inflation (2.7%) but better than nothing and don't require I be either constantly paying into them or having direct debits from a current account. 
* Stocks and bonds: I know frankly buggerall about the stock market, but considering low interest rates and the potential for a high rate of return on investments, it's an option I'm considering. My fiancé suggests a single holding in a Top 100 company as a low-risk investment, but really we're just testing the waters here. My current account is with HSBC so I'd be using their portal to do this.
* Bitcoin: Yeesh. I never thought I'd be thinking about this, but bloody Bitcoin! This is completely uncharted territory for me - particularly with regards to how quickly or easily I'll be able to offload Bitcoin once I'm in South Africa semi-permanently. But with the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing, it seems like the potential for returns is super high.
* Premium Bonds. Seem a bit shit to be honest, as you have to put in lots of money for a decent chance at winning *anything*, and even if you do, the average rate is not great (£10k for 5 years works out at something like 0.8%).

So here's my plan for the remaining money:

1. Buy £1000-£2000 worth of Bitcoin. This is a small enough amount so as to not make or break me, but large enough that the returns on it could be significant.
2. Buy £5000-£6000 worth of big company stock - research pending.
3. Keep £1000-£2000 in the current account in case something gets fucked up and I need cash in an emergency, or put some in Premium Bonds.

Please, critique my thought process! I'm super new at this and have no idea with money (parents never had any so couldn't ever really teach me good habits). This plan I feel offers decent resistance to inflation for if and when I need the cash when I get back to the UK.

Thanks in advance guys!",finance

~$3m home which we are in the process of leasing out for $10k a month (150k left on mortagage and a $200k equity loan for remodeling that he has just been paying interest on for the last 15 years [both are ~3% interest rate])
~$100k worth of properties in a different state (empty lots of land with no houses, but in a good location)
~ Fully stocked IRA (not sure amount) that he has to draw from because of age

No worry of income in the future since he has a partnership in which his reputation brings in clients and he gets a percentage of profits even when retired overseas.

personalfinance,"Navient Study ""Money Under 35"" Second Year","Posted this originally in r/financialindependence and throwing it on here.

For those that don't know Navient (Federal student loan servicer, used to be Sallie Mae) conducts a study called ""Money Under 35"" which is supposed to show financial health amongst young adults in America. The study is in its second year. I've pasted the Executive Summary below, but basically it samples 3,000~ young Americans to find out how we're doing financially. There's also an infographic, but I can't do images on the work computer.

A blurb that jumped out to me was this: ""Young adults who attended college but did not earn a degree are the most likely group to have poor financial health – including their peers with a high school education or less."" This makes sense, since these people get all the cons of college education (mainly debt) but none of the perks (degree, access to increased wages). Intuitive, but maybe not obvious.

What's this have to do with FI/RE? Well, first off I found this when I checked Navient today to find my last payment went through and I'm done with loans. But more importantly, I think most of us on here (maybe I'm wrong) are young adults that are interested in FI/RE and I think the idea of Financial Independence is most appealing to young adults. This report directly reflects (or is supposed to) young adults and how we're doing financially.

Link (various .pdf files for download): https://navient.com/about/who-we-are/research-and-studies/

Executive Summary: Navient’s Money Under 35 is a national study conducted by Ipsos that provides a snapshot of how young adults are faring financially in the current economy. Now in its second year, the study is based on a nationally representative sample of 3,069 Americans aged 22 to 35. The 2016 study finds an improved financial picture for young adults compared to 2015 and shines a spotlight on the relative benefits of college completion. By contrast, the study finds that young adults who start college but leave before earning a degree report lower financial health than young adults with degrees and even those who did not start college at all.""

I know you guys love information and reports, so I'm interested to see your observations, takes, issues, etc. with the report and its findings.

personalfinance,Need advice for reinvesting significant amount of stocks and stock options,"Hello,

I posted this in another personal finance related community, and am posting here to try to get more advice. I'm looking to solicit some advice specifically for my situation, and thus I'm using a throwaway in order to disclose some numbers.

**TL;DR: our household currently has a significant percentage of our net worth invested in a few individual companies in the form of stock options and stocks: (1) What strategies can/should we employ to minimize the tax impact of divesting parts of these holdings (2) How should we reallocate the proceeds of said divesture into other investment vehicles in a safe and diversified manner?**

Some details:

* Married, both in our early 30s
* Total net worth in the mid seven figures: $N,000,000
* Non-qualified stock options (fully vested) in company A in the low seven figures (~40% of net worth)
* Restricted stock units (all held &gt; 1 year) in company B in the mid six figures (~10% of net worth)
* Stock from employee stock purchase plan (all held &gt; 1 year) in company C in the low six figures (~5% of net worth)
* Rest of portfolio spread across broad index funds and a comfortable amount of cash
* Live in ""very high cost of living"" area, only a couple years into a standard 30 year mortgage at 3.5%
* Monthly expenses around $10k (includes mortgage and property taxes)
* All available retirement accounts are maxed yearly

First, it's pretty obvious that we should be getting rid of our holdings in companies A, B, and C, given the significant portion of our net worth that is in those companies. However, companies A and B have had stellar performance over the last several years and continue to improve and maintain great prospects. I also happen to be still employed at company A, so that's even more risk exposure. However, I know that there's a good to great chance that the company will do even better in the future. Am I greedy to want to hold on longer?

The risk averse side of me knows that we need to diversify, but I would like to do so in a slow, controlled way by perhaps selling a percentage on a yearly basis, and to do it in a tax efficient way. Since the holdings in company A are non-qualified stock options and are taxed as income upon exercise, the only strategy I have for this is to sell more during years in which we have less income (perhaps due to time off) or more deductible expenses, but I don't foresee many of those opportunities unless we switch jobs and take significant time off. Another caveat is that batches of the stock options for company A will start to expire in a few years, so there's a finite window on the horizon. Are there other strategies or tax efficient vehicles I'm not thinking of?

The second part is how to take the proceeds and reinvest in a smart manner. I think broad index funds spread across domestic, emerging, and developed markets is my no-brainer default choice, and I've also started looking into choosing certain bond funds to get more bonds in the mix. Our biggest bond holding is VWAHX which gets us federal-exempt yield, and I just started looking into a state-specific muni bond fund which would get us federal and state exempt yields. However, the lack of geographic diversification worries me there, so I might opt to go for both continuing VWAHX and adding a state specific muni fund. I've started looking into other passive income options such as real estate investing, but the required effort is high and my experience is low to nil. Are there other strategies I should be considering?

Thirdly, since we're likely to get large chunks of cash at a time from selling the aforementioned holdings, is it wise to invest those chunks directly into various broad index funds in lump sums, or to spread it out over time and dollar cost average? If we dollar cost average, we'd end up with large chunks of cash earning near zero interest, which doesn't seem ideal either. How should we deal with that? If we make lump sum investments, what about the risk of poor timing and hitting market peaks? Perhaps tax loss harvesting would then help soften the blow a bit?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"This sub has stressed the necessity of an emergency fund, well this week I got to use mine","Firstly, I have atrocious spending habits. 
Having just moved into a new home, my first home, which happens to be pretty remote in the Colorado sticks, I have been dreading a snow removal system. Yes, yes, it's summer... why should I worry about snow? Well we already had a 2' snow storm and it made me realize I'm not so prepared. I have a huge snow blower, but it was no match for the wet spring dump. So naturally I have an atv and plow on my mind, a wood splitter, propane. I want all the things now. But after getting my life in order I remembered that I should probably have a modestly comfortable emergency fund ready to go. So all those expensive things were put in hold until I could build some padding. 
This weekend I worked my butt off in the yard Saturday, improving my trail, building horseshoe pits and more trails, weed whacking (the entire yard, too rocky for a mower) and all the other homely things, I decided that Sunday I was going to chill in my hammock and accomplish nothing. But smoking weed and eating snacks. (I'm not totally useless, just spent the past week on a trip with kids climbing, rafting, and hiking. On the clock 24/7. I earned it) 

Sunday comes around, and I wake up late (9a) to the sweet atrocious smell of cat piss. I get out of bed expecting a mess but not the mess that I found. My kitchen had flooded. Bad. The water went through the walls into the laundry room laminate tiles are peeling up. Water is pooled everywhere. My living room carpet was totally drenched. And the pressure tank was empty. Not having any clue wtf was happening or why everything was soaked, I went into a mild panic for a moment. Sourced the flood, it was a failed piece under my sink. I had installed a reverse osmosis system and one of the adapters blew. Cleaned the cat messes up, (the laundry room also holds the litter box and that shit was just about floating. No way the cats were going in there. )

Then went to my emergency fund and withdrew a couple hundred dollars for a shop vac and an air mover.  Drove the hour and a half to a hardware store and bought them without any hesitation, then headed back up the mountain. 

The story doesn't end here...
So it's my first spring in this house, and the ants have emerged... sugar ants, black ants, and MFing carpenter ants. 

These fuckers love wet wood, and god only knows how much water went through my floor... so I went on amazon, and ordered termidor and all the PPE. Another couple hundred bucks later and unfortunately amazon is fucked and will only send things to me through USPS who won't deliver to my remote address (only FedEx and UPS will deliver out here.) And next week I'm on another week long trip. 

So these things will be re-ordered next week and shipped to my PO box a few towns over, but the moral of this story was without that emergency fund, I'd have been in for a world of hurt, so thanks Reddit PF. 

TL;DR:
House flooded, emergency fund to the rescue.",finance
personalfinance,"50k/year job, 50k in student loans. Some refinancing questions so I can tackle this debt most efficiently.","Hi r/personalfinance, I'm a recent college graduate with loans (private + federal) that equal my starting salary. I'm looking for help with refinancing and what the best strategy would be.

**Background**: 23/F, May 2017 graduate. My degree is in chemical engineering. I struggled to find a job, and eventually found something right at graduation but the pay is low for the field (50k salary non-exempt, pretax). I live in a large city in the midwest so COL is fairly reasonable. I am trying to eventually move to where my long-term partner is within the next year. He makes around what I do and has no debts (graduated debt-free, no CC debt, no car loan as of yet). In the meantime I have created a budget and will live cheaply until I can find a job in his city (in the same state but a few hours away).

**Debts**:

Federal loans: $28k in subsidized and unsubsidized loans with interest rates between 3.4% and 4.6%, with one unsub loan with a balance of $2700 at 6.8%. I do not plan on refinancing these because the interest rates are low. Monthly payment is looking to be around $300 on these.

Private loans:

* **this is the main reason I want to refinance** Private loan with a balance of $13700 at 10.85% interest. My parents, who never went to college and didn't really know how college worked and how much it cost, and I took this out my freshman year so it's accumulated nearly 7k of interest. I had no credit so the rate was extremely high. Yes it was very stupid, I do not need a lecture at this point.

* Private loan with a balance of $3600 at 6.01% interest. I took this out in December 2016 to help me pay for my last semester because my mom was diagnosed with cancer and couldn't pay anything for that semester (she has since beat it, thankfully). I made interest payments on this while in my last semester so there is no accumulated interest on this right now.

These are all in grace until December.

I have no other debt besides this - my credit card and car are fully paid off. I use my credit card for making small purchases each month to build up credit. My credit score using Credit Karma (so not 100% accurate) is 750. My parents are letting me remain on their car insurance policy for the time being. I have $7k in available credit between two cards and $4500 in savings.

I was pre-approved at SoFi for the balance of my private loans with new rates of 5.62% for a 5 year repayment - 6.49% for a 15 or 20 year repayment for a fixed rate and 5.29% - 6.29% for the same repayments under a variable rate.

**My questions are:**

- When refinancing, is it better to take a variable rate or a fixed rate?

- When I refinance my loan,it is my understanding that SoFi will buy out the loan and I will make payments to them instead. Do they just buy the principle or principle + interest? If they only buy the principle, what happens to all the interest that accumulated?

- When does payment start on the new refinanced loan?

After refinancing I do plan on taking any leftover money and putting it towards my outstanding balance to get them paid off quicker.

I know this was a wall of text, but I'm trying to get this debt manageable because I'd like to get married/buy a house sometime in the future and don't want this to burden me and my SO. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,How to go about paying parents back?,"Hi all - I am working on paying off my student loans via avalanche method and the next highest interest rate belongs to a home equity loan my parents took in their name to erase a chunk of my loans.  At the time, they greatly reduced my interest rate (from about 7.9% with the government to currently 4% variable).  The rest of the loans I have are in my name and are fixed at 3.5 and 3.25%.  My arrangement with my parents was to pay the interest on the loan yearly while focusing on the ones in my name but since their interest rate is rising and I have decent fixed rates, I figured it would make sense to kill the parent loan off first.  The amount my parents have is about half of what I still have left in my name.

Is there anything I should consider when paying them back?  Like tax-wise (I am not eligible for the student loan interest deduction) - I was just going to write a personal check to my mother but does that trigger ""income"" for them? What about any down side for not prioritizing reducing my own personal debt to income ratio? I want to do a big lump sum (like 20k) at the end of the year.. does that send off any red flags anywhere?  

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Looking to refinance student loans,"I'm looking to refinance my student loans and try and lower my interest rate. I currently have ~86k @ 8.25% in two parent plus loans, and another ~16k @ 5.875% in subsidized and un-subsidized federal loans. My gross income last year was ~38k with a 680 credit score. My mom cosigned my loans with close to perfect credit. I graduated from Full Sail University in 2010, and unfortunately it seems like a lot of refinancers don't include it as a valid school.

We've been looking around at places and going into application processes without doing hard credit checks, but it seems like most places won't go below 6% and will want to keep her on as a cosigner. After doing some calling one person suggested that I try refinancing all of my federal with just one of my parent plus loans, and refinance the other separately. The ideal situation is finding a place that'll refinance @ around 5% without a cosigner, at a 20 year payment. I know this is all probably unrealistic given my income and interest though.

personalfinance,Paying Off Private Variable Rate Student Loan,"This is a question for my sister. She has a high interest private student loan through Chase on a variable rate. Her budgeting and financial planning is enough to make most people on this sub hurt but that's besides the point.

I'm 22 years old looking to buy a car. I would greatly appreciate any and all advice. I've been dreaming about owning and driving a Cadillac CTS for a long time now. However I'm unsure on spending a lot of money on a car. I would love to have some guidance on this.

I'm thinking that my car budget would be between 15K and 25K.

This car that I buy will be the car I hope to drive for 10 years or so. I have a goal to save up the full amount of the car and finance it with a low interest rate (sub 4%) and put the cash in the stock market in a diversified portfolio (approx. 80% stocks/20% bonds). 

Should I go ahead and save up for my dream car or should I avoid spending so much money on a car early on in life and instead by a cheaper car? I have no intentions on buying a house until my 30s. So I have from now until then to save up for a down payment. After I buy the car that I plan to drive for a long time, I plan on increasing my retirement contributions to about 25%+, moving out of my parent's house and working on my next goal which would be the down payment on a house.

**My PF details:**

**Salary:** 60K

**Debt:** No debt

**Emergency Fund:** 6 months saved up

**Savings Rate:** 16% towards retirement (401K + Roth IRA)

CryptoMarkets,TAXES AND TRADING - How do you traders establish cost basis and pay the taxman?,"Under current law and depending on where you live... (presuming many of you are in the US) you're ultimately going to have to pay taxes on your crypto gains once you cash out to fiat or even if you buy a single cup of coffee with your crypto… That is unless of course you want to risk taking an extended holiday at club fed... Sound unbelievable? That's what I thought until I started looking into basic crypto TAX issues…

Ideally when you cash out of your crypto holdings you'd want to pay a lower rate on your capital gains so you'd hold your coins for at least a year and a day to be taxed at the lower long term capital gain rate... Then once you have your cash and need to pay the taxman for that year, you have to establish your cost basis on your tax forms (how much you bought each coin for versus how much you sold them for) Now say you buy a bunch of bitcoin on coinbase at different prices over a period of years... and assuming you do not trade them and immediately create a short term capital gain TAXABLE EVENT (don't even get me started… more on that later) YOU HOLD YOUR COINS... 

Now years later, bitcoin is at 100,000 dollars and you're ready to exit back into fiat through coinbase or something else. How do you establish your cost basis to the feds if you transfer a random portion of your 100 bitcoin stack from your secure wallet to your coinbase wallet and withdraw to your bank account? It is in your best interest to claim that the coins you are cashing out now are the more expensive one which you bought later in your 100 btc stack building so you have a smaller capital gain/cost basis and thus a smaller tax liability… Remember… You bought 100 coins originally at different times and different prices and sent all of them to a single wallet where they can't be distinguished from one another... Now it's years later and you want to get out with a couple million dollars and keep as much of it as possible after taxes… How are you going to account for the cost basis of all these different coins that have been put into the same wallet? Does each BTC itself (not wallet) have a unique ID and history that can be tracked? Now add to the fact that under current IRS regulation, if you TRADE any of these coins… BITCOIN ETHER LITECOIN RIPPLE… YOU NAME IT… You immediately reset the clock on the long term capital gain rate with each trade/shapeshift and have effectively created a TAXABLE EVENT, that according to uncle sam… you need to pay for in FIAT in the tax year you did it or ultimately face back taxes, interest, penalties and even jail whether you actually cash out any of your stack to fiat (incurring more taxes) or just continue HOLDING… 

Read for yourself…

It's insane.

Now make matters worse… What if you wanted to cash out what are now 100 bitcoins through coinbase that have been traded back and forth and shapeshifted into countless other cryptos which have obviously been held for less than a year due to your constant trading and stack building… Can you risk claiming that those 100 BTC are the same 100 BTC you originally bought years ago and as such… claim that they should be taxed at a long term cap gain rate(which is not the truth)? Does each coin have a history that could get you in trouble if you go that route? Can you get away with it?

Now what happens when you've been trading crypto for years and can't account for your countless trades into and out of different currencies which you have NOT paid short term capital gains tax on going back years even though your digital money has only ever been in digital wallets and exchanges and you haven't spent your crypto on goods or services nor withdrawn a single unit of fiat to your bank account… How many of you are in this boat? How are you going to exit into fiat and keep your money if this applies to you?

Sometimes we all get so caught up in memes and price talk that we neglect to come up with a sound exit strategy… This is serious stuff that we all need to consider… We've yet to see a substantial number of people successfully cash out of crypto and ride off into the sunset with millions… It all may be a fantasy ultimately thanks to uncle sam and his current regulation… so… WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS VISA VIE SHORT TERM CAP GAIN TRADING/TAXES/EXIT STRATEGY?",cryptocurrency

This is a word of warning to anyone buying criptocurrencies at the [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) exchange, and a desperate request of help. I have sent a very considerable amount of money to my Gemini account in order to buy, and up to today I don't have the funds available at the exchange, neither I have my money back. 

So basically either Gemini or their bank have been holding my funds without reason for almost a Month. How is this possible? Is this legal?

Already spent a lot of hours contacting Gemini, my bank (Bank of America) and their bank (Silvergate). To no avail. I just want my money back, but this has become a nightmare. I am not sure what happens next.

**Timeline:**

*May 30:*

I sent a wire transfer from Bank of America to Gemini following all the 
instructions given by the site. Double checked everything making sure to send the wire transfer as instructed by Gemini. 

I will try to add all the information I can without disclousing any sensitive
information: 

Wire Transfer information

ABA routing number: 322286803
Account number: 1000808012

Receiving Bank information:

Destination account information:
Gemini Trust Company LLC

United States of America

*June 1:*

If sent early in the day, the wire is supposed to arrive the same day. However
no funds are available in my account. Okey I think, maybe it did not arrive.

*June 2:*

Funds are still not available, so I opened a Gemini support ticket. Tried also
calling the phone number on their website and messaging them on Facebook. They did not reply.

*June 5:*

I finally had a response on my support ticket, asking me if I was sure it was a
wire and not an ACH push. Called my bank to get the wire receipt, and emailed it to Gemini. 

*June 6:*

Gemini replies back asking for the Federal Reference Number, stating that 
they still don't have the funds on their account. Sent it back to them the same
day. Waiting for a response.

*June 23:*

I have not heard a word from Gemini.


I have tried calling, emailing them, opening support tickets. Nothing. Total
radio silence.

Asked my bank what I could do, and they suggested me to get the wire back. I started the procedure, but Silvergate (Gemini's bank) told me they can't wire the money back until Gemini approves the refund. So back to square one.

I don't know what to do now. I have tried everything. I would prefer to avoid
legal action, since I have never done that, and I am scared that Gemini could
threaten me to close my account, or counter sue me. I just want my money back.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Delinquency issues,"I have been working on my credit score for the past two years and there is one item which is a huge hit I don't know how to handle.

I graduated in 2012 with about 30+k in federal loans. I was moving around a lot at the time and financial irresponsibility was my MO. My loans were on auto payments and I really just didn't pay attention to them. In 2013 my loans got switched to granite state and it was divided into 8 individual loans. I was auto paying 238 a month and this kept coming out of my account. However, My payments for some reason didn't cover the minimum and I really didn't pay attention to it at all for a year. Fast forward to today and I have had good standing payments since May 2014. That's leaves me with a little over 100 delinquent payments. FUCKIN OUCH. I called to reason with them and just got stonewalled, which makes no sense to me that they want their payments, but want to WRECK my credit. I mean, cmon, three years of never missing a payment and you can't drop EVEN PART of my delinquent payments. I hate these fuckers and I have no idea how to handle this. Do I contest each report? If so, what's the best way to do that. I thought about consolidation with another company cause I don't want to deal with these clowns anymore. Bah. Just typing about it straight pisses me off. What can I do?

Tl;dr is Federal loans went to granite state and there are 8 individual loans. I was a idiot and didn't pay attention to it for a year and although payments were made, they didn't cover the minimum. Now I have 112 late payments laying waste to my score.",finance

Additional information is that I make $27,336/year before taxes. I have $2,175 in student loans with an interest rate of 3.76% this amount will for sure increase.

I am working on strict budgeting and trying to follow the debt snowball method. My question is around what to pay off first.

We have one credit card that is closed and in collections (around $4500), with an interest rate of 27.99%

One credit card with a $5k balance that is current with minimum payments being made on it currently, with an interest rate of 27.99%

One credit card with a $5k balance with 0% interest until 12/2017 at which point interest is at 28.99%

One credit card with a $1400 balance on it with 0% interest, current with minimum payments being made.

And then the a few hundred in hospital bills that are in collections.

The car loans and student loans are the largest that I know we will start to tackle after the credit card debt is paid but which should we pay down first?

personalfinance,Personal Finance facts that should be better known,"If you hang out here, you'll learn lots of interesting things.   Many of the big things are memorialized in the wiki / sidebar topics.  Spend less than you make; pay your credit card bill in full each month; take the 401k match.  You know these.  We've also done other compilations, e.g. [ways to work the system in your favor](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5v4cq6/personal_finance_loopholes_updated/) using the Saver's Credit, gift tax laws, capital gains tricks, and COBRA retroactivity.  Or, from the other perspective, [common mistakes to avoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4zcto8/youre_doing_it_wrong_personal_finance_pitfalls_to/), like taking out a loan to build credit, cashing out retirement accounts, or co-signing loans.

 Here are  some more small things that you might not know yet, and in some cases might even think that the opposite of these things is true:

1.  Looking for ways to get more than 1% on your cash on hand?  Are you willing to do direct deposits and monthly debit transactions to get a higher rate?  If so, look into offers such as [LMCU's 3% interest checking account](https://www.lmcu.org/banking/checking/checking_max.aspx).  3% annual interest on balances up to $15,000.  This one is open to anybody.  Can you get 3% safely from *your* bank?  

2.  What's your best deal on a cash-back rewards credit card?  If you said 2% cash, that's a safe answer, but don't overlook the value of [initial spend bonuses](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-credit-card-signup-bonus-offers/) on new cards.  Depending on your spending level and credit history, it's usually possible to net 4% or even more cash back for years at a time by getting  one new credit card each year.   For many people, [opening a new credit card](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/new-credit.aspx) each year has a minimal impact on their overall credit, so  think of it as another way to turn your credit into current income.   

3.  Closing a credit card [won't help your credit score](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/questions/credit-cards-credit-score.aspx), even if you mistakenly think it will lengthen average age of accounts.  If you want to avoid an annual fee, you can do a [product change](https://thepointsguy.com/2016/10/when-to-request-credit-card-product-change/) to a card with no fee.  

4.  If you have a high-deductible healthcare plan (HDHP), you should put money into an HSA even if you don't expect to have any out-of-pocket medical expenses.  The money is tax-deductible like a traditional IRA, but with no income limits on the deduction, and [can be withdrawn for any purposes](https://www.hsaresources.com/pdf/Turning_65.pdf) exactly as with an IRA when you reach 65.  Essentially, a traditional IRA, only better.

5.  You're self-employed.  Are you deducting your [health insurance premiums](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-self-employed-health-insurance-deduction-a-valuable-personal-deduction.html) from your AGI, and do you make employer contributions to [your own 401k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_401(k\))?   You could.  You perhaps should.  You can even roll a prior employer's 401k into your solo-401k and have the control of an IRA with certain unique 401k benefits (such as better Backdoor Roth tax treatment).

6.  Speaking if stupid 401k tricks, do you have  401k assets that exceed your annual income, but poor choices of investment?  See if your employer offers a [brokerage window](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/04/using-brokerage-window-to-expand-401k-options.html).  Most don't, but some do.  This allows you to invest using standard brokerage account choices, in exchange for certain flat fees that are lower than high expense ratio funds for large 401k balances.  

7.  If you somehow neglected to file federal income taxes for the last few years, but you had enough taxes withheld so you would get a refund, then you won't owe any penalties for late filing.  You only have three years to collect your past refunds, though.  If you did end up owing in any year, then there would be [interest and penalties](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-to-know-about-late-filing-and-late-paying-penalties).  But you won't go to jail in any event, unless you were doing something very, very bad in terms of outright fraud.  

8.  Crooks take advantage of your lack of experience with  payments when they [seem to pay you](https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c3-general/3854216-paypal-and-certified-check-scams.html) by paypal or with a bad check, if only you then send them back some real money.  Don't do that.  

9.  This one is obscure, but of particular interest to the reddit community.   Did the IRS take *your* money out of an account that you opened jointly with your parent as a minor, to satisfy a debt that your parent owed?  Some people will tell you that they can do this, but, as it turns out, they can't.  You own the money you put into a joint account in that situation.  ""Because minors in many situations cannot open bank accounts in their own names, the bank accounts list a parent's name, even when the children are the owners of the funds deposited. A levy on such an account to collect a parent's tax liability would be a wrongful levy, unless it can be shown that a federal tax lien encumbered the funds before they were deposited in the child's account."" https://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/irm_05-017-003-cont01.html

10.  Last but not least, one that I hope isn't unknown, but maybe not well enough known.   If you don't contribute to a Roth IRA each year, you should have a real good reason for that.  (Which could just be that you live paycheck to paycheck, of course.  Or, you have no taxable employment income.)   Are you maxing your 401k?  Put the tax savings into a Roth IRA.

-Would it be better to contact a local credit union and see if I can get a $23,518 loan to pay this in full, rather than going through this program?  My credit score is around 700 right now.

personalfinance,"(US) If dad lends us $ to renovate, should we refinance once renovation is completed &amp; pay him cash back?","We bought a small (918 sq ft) house, 2bed 1ba, in a great location two years ago. We want to do a major renovation that includes a bedroom addition, complete kitchen remodel, bath addition, and reworking of the interior space into a modern open floor plan. 

We're expecting the cost to be $150k - 200k based on initial estimates we've received. This would put our total house cost at $300 - 350k which is what 3bed 2ba houses sell at in our area if not higher.

The housing market here has exploded with multiple offers on houses as soon as they hit the market with many closing over asking price. Our house appreciated $30k in two years.

We can comfortably afford a $300+k mortgage at a low interest rate. However, we haven't built up enough equity for the remodel and my dad is considering lending us the money since he is well off financially. I've offered to pay him back with interest &amp; would have a legal document written up to protect us both.

Once the renovation is complete, should we refinance at the completed appraised value / take money out to pay my dad back? What options exist for something like this? Husband &amp; I both have excellent credit and very low debt-to-income ratios. 

Our current interest rate is 4% with no PMI. We don't want a higher interest rate or PMI if possible. 

 I have looked into FHA 203k loans &amp; we've been pre-approved but would prefer to avoid this if possible (they make contractors &amp; owners jump through hoops, the interest rate is higher, they apply PMI for the life of the loan so we'd have to refinance immediately after and lose our First Time Home Buyer Tax Credit).

personalfinance,Discussion - Is it Better to Pay Off Your Mortgage or Invest in Something Else?,"I am going to make the mathematical case that it is better to invest in something else right now so long as you have a properly developed (and growing) emergency fund. A mortgage is simply a rate of return paid to the bank. Paying off a mortgage early essentially results in a rate of return for you equal to the interest rate on your mortgage. Here’s a simple way to think about it: Imagine you are about to buy a home for one year and then sell it. For this example we’ll ignore the irrelevant things like closing costs. I’m also going to ignore PMI to make the example simpler. The home is worth $100,000, and you have $100,000 in cash right now. You could get a mortgage for the entire value of the home at a 5% interest rate. The market rate is 10%, and the home is going to grow in value by 1% this year. If you buy the house with cash you will get a 1% increase in value when you go to sell it. If you decide to buy the house with a mortgage, you will have to pay $5,000 in interest when you sell it (the actual amount will be less than that because you’ll be paying off principle on the mortgage all year, but for simplicity we will ignore that). You will still get the $1,000 gain, and you will invest your $100,000 in the stock market for a 10% gain, so that’s $10,000. Taking out the mortgage will make you $6,000 total, or $5,000 more than buying the house cash. Notice that it is basically the difference between 10% and 5%.

So why wouldn’t a person take a mortgage? And why would a person ever pay off their house? There are simple reasons for that. First, when you take a mortgage you are putting your house up as collateral. In other words, if you don’t make a payment you lose your home. That is obviously a substantial risk, but how much of a risk is it? The answer to that depends on the person. If you have an emergency fund set aside, then the risk is very small because you may hypothetically be able to sell your house before your mortgage is up. Or if you rely on an income to pay the mortgage, then you might be able to find a new job before the emergency fund runs out. Another reason a person may want to pay off their mortgage is for consistency. If you are near retirement then you will not want to take risky investment. You may only want to make a 2% - 4% return, maximum. In this case you will certainly want to pay off your house because the interest rates on houses are historically higher than that range. Those are the only two reasons to ever pay off a mortgage. Either you are scared that you won’t be able to pay or you’re comfortable with a rate of return lower than the mortgage amount because you want less risk.

If you have decided to pay off your mortgage or are strongly considering it, I do not think you are doing anything wrong. You’re simply choosing to take a lower, less risky rate of return because that’s what you want. What I do not want people to do is shy away from a mortgage simply because it’s a dirty word that feels bad. I have attached a model with this discussion. There are two tabs, and you need to fill in the blue boxes to use it. The results are shown in the yellow column on the second tab. Notice that I have put in the same rate of return in the stock market as the mortgage, and it is showing a gain that favors the stock market. This is because I am letting the contributions flow through at the end of the period (as the money is earned) for the mortgage. The real contributions would be made throughout the year, and the Better/Worse analysis (B/W) would be closer to zero.

personalfinance,Pay down mortgage or invest?,"Hey guys I've been fighting with a situation that I hope you guys can help me with. I've tried to read everything on the internet and used various calculators but I'm still torn on what I should do. First let me give you a little background. 

Household members: 3 (1 toddler, 35 &amp; 30 yr/old)
Household income: 315K (gross) plus some consulting work on the side about 20K/yr but varies.
Mortgage Loan: 921K, 5/1 ARM, rate will be 3.375 for 6 years.
Debt: 1400/month (cars with 1.49 interest rate.) No other debt.
Savings: 30K cash, 275k in retirement accounts/college fund.

My mortgage payments (including taxes and insurance) will be about 4400 so we will have a decent amount of disposable income even after funding our retirement accounts and my child's college fund. I was planning on paying 6000/month toward the principle. After talking to my financial planner he thought that would be a bad idea and that I should invest the money (through him of course.) I'm still not sure so I wanted to ask r/personalfinance for their opinion. 

The three options I'm considering are:

1. Put at least an extra 6000/month toward the principle. Pay the house off in about 7-8 years.

2.Invest at least an extra 6000/month, hope my investments (7% return) go well and then do a full pay-off in 7-8 years

3. Either sell the house in the next 6 years (before the rates start to go up) or refinance into a 30/yr fixed rate mortgage at some point and just keep paying the monthly mortgage payment.

personalfinance,"Just finished freshman year of college, trying to afford to finish","Hey guys, first post on r/personalfinance, been lurking for a while. I'm hoping I can get some advice on my predicament.

So just to set the scene, here's where I'm at. I've just finished my first year of college at GVSU in Michigan. Thanks to scholarships, I was able to pay for this first year without taking out any loans, so currently, I have no debt (good!). Only problem is that I was dealing with some personal issues and screwed up in school. I got a 2.3 GPA, so I lost all of those scholarships (total value about $68k). I'm now trying to figure out how to proceed.

I realize I was incredibly lucky to have gotten that much money in scholarships, and I take complete responsibility for squandering that incredible opportunity. By no means am I trying to have a pity party here.

If possible, I'd like to continue at GVSU and still finish there. I've since starting dealing with those personal issues and know I can do a lot better with my studies next year, and if I improve my GPA I can appeal to have my scholarships reinstated after 1 year. Here's where the reality and the financial parts start to play in.

The total cost of attending GVSU is a hair over $11k a semester, and I only qualify for about $3.75k in unsubsidized federal loans per semester. If I were to take those out, that would still mean I'd have to cover about $7.25k a semester, either out of pocket or with loans.

I'm currently working an engineering co-op job that pays well, so after taxes, gas, etc.,  I should have about $6000 saved up by the end of the summer, but that still wouldn't cover everything.

Loans are a problem. My parents are not willing to co-sign on any private loans with me (which I completely understand, they had a bad experience with my brother racking up about $125k on loans they co-signed on without him telling them.), and they can't afford to take out a PLUS loan either. 

Instead, they've been pushing me towards joining the military or starting over at a commuter school. I'm not opposed to the military - I have a different brother in the Navy who's done very well for himself - but at the same time, I'd like to retain control over my life for the next few years if possible. I've considered community college, but due to my curriculum there aren't any credits relevant to my degree that would transfer to GVSU that I haven't already taken.

The other thing is that as an electrical engineer, I should be making pretty decent salary once I graduate. I don't know if the opportunity cost of abandoning that path is worth considering or not.

Anyways, I guess my question for everyone is this: is it financially wise to continue pursuing my education at a university, should I settle for an associate's or vocational certificate, or should I just bite the bullet and enlist, and finish school after I get out?

If you guys have any questions for me to help clarify the situation, I'd be more than happy to answer.

Thanks again guys!

TL;DR: I lost all my college scholarships after a year and I'm trying to decide if finishing college is worth the debt.

We save aggressively, I max out ($18k/yr) my federal TSP, my wife contributes 15% to her workplace 401k, we both max out Roths, we're already saving for a college fund (yes we want kids), and we still put back money each month in our ""normal"" bank savings account.  All told we're saving about 40% of our pre-tax income.

Current mortgage balance: ~$140k at 3.625% on 20 years.  About 18 years left on the loan, though we pay about $100 a month extra and payoff would be in about 15 years.  Payment is about $870/ month and the house would rent for roughly $1200-$1500/month.

Current home value: Approximately $200k.

Combined retirement savings: $315k.  We plan to retire in about 25-30 years.

Current liquid savings: About $70k.

Debt: None except for mortgage.

New home: we would be looking to spend about $250-$300k for our ""forever home"".  Comparatively, we can get a lot for our money given that we live in a low COLA.

I am a federal employee and if I remain one will be eligible for a federal retirement pension that, given my current trajectory, would be probably $30,000/year.

So, here's my question: Does it make sense to keep our current home and rent it out when we buy a new home?  We would want to put down 20% on a new home, which is about $60k given our price range.  My only hangup here is that doing this would require us to nearly drain our liquid cash.  We would obviously not do this if it required totally or very nearly liquidating our savings, but if we could buy the new house, keep the old one as a rental, and keep, say, $15k in cash, would this be wise?  $15k would represent about 6 months' worth of expenses.  

I am interested in keeping the house, because the idea of someone else paying my mortgage for the next 15 years and then owning our current home free and clear is obviously appealing.  I want to know your reasons as to why or why not this makes sense.

As an aside, I fully understand all the headaches and issues that come with being a landlord.  My parents bought and built rental properties, my family works in the construction and home building trade, and I have a fair handle on how this stuff works.  I have been around buying, selling, renting and building homes my whole life.  I am fairly handy and can fix minor stuff myself, though I do understand being a landlord comes with lots of calls to the plumber and electrician, and many unforeseen costs.

CryptoMarkets,"CAUTION: I sent a large sum to Gemini in order to buy bitcoin. I has been almost one month, and my money is still not available :(","Hello reddit. This is a word of warning to anyone buying criptocurrencies at the Gemini exchange, and a desperate request of help. I have sent a very considerable amount of money to my Gemini account in order to buy, and up to today I don't have the funds available at the exchange, neither I have my money back.

So basically either Gemini or their bank have been holding my funds without reason for almost a Month. How is this possible? Is this legal?

Already spent a lot of hours contacting Gemini, my bank (Bank of America) and their bank (Silvergate). To no avail. I just want my money back, but this has become a nightmare. I am not sure what happens next.

**Timeline:**

*May 30:*

I sent a wire transfer from Bank of America to Gemini following all the instructions given by the site. Double checked everything making sure to send the wire transfer as instructed by Gemini.
I will try to add all the information I can without disclousing any sensitive information:

*June 1:*

If sent early in the day, the wire is supposed to arrive the same day. However no funds are available in my account. Okey I think, maybe it did not arrive.

*June 2:*

Funds are still not available, so I opened a Gemini support ticket. Tried also calling the phone number on their website and messaging them on Facebook. They did not reply.

*June 5:*

I finally had a response on my support ticket, asking me if I was sure it was a wire and not an ACH push. Called my bank to get the wire receipt, and emailed it to Gemini.

*June 6:*

Gemini replies back asking for the Federal Reference Number, stating that they still don't have the funds on their account. Sent it back to them the same day. Waiting for a response.

*June 23:*

I have not heard a word from Gemini.

I have tried calling, emailing them, opening support tickets. Nothing. Total radio silence.

Asked my bank what I could do, and they suggested me to get the wire back. I started the procedure, but Silvergate (Gemini's bank) told me they can't wire the money back until Gemini approves the refund. So back to square one.

I don't know what to do now. I have tried everything. I would prefer to avoid legal action, since I have never done that, and I am scared that Gemini could threaten me to close my account, or counter sue me. I just want my money back.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Car totaled. Need to finance new car. Worried about interest rate based on credit summary looking like I still have another loan out,"So I have gap insurance, meaning I will owe nothing to the bank despite being upside down on my loan. But with credit profiles typically taking a month to be updated, I'm worried that my credit check is going to make it look like I currently have two current auto loans (my wife's car and my, now totaled, car). My credit scores are all around 730 to 735 but the loans will make my credit to debt ratio look inaccurately worse and it will also look like I'm applying for a 3rd car loan when really I've just eliminated my second and am attempting to attain a new second loan.

I'm going to try a modified version of Dave Ramsay's ""free cars for life"". Not because of the free cars part which I've read a lot of criticism about, but because I would like to avoid ever financing cars again because I don't like being upside down in my loans and being stuck with a sizable payment . However, being urgently thrown into this situation, I'm going to need to finance a car because it's currently over 100 degrees every day and I need a decent car and can't save up for it and can't buy a beater car like Ramsay would suggest. 

So instead of a 25k car like my last, I'm shooting for a 5k car. But again I'm worried about getting a high rate.

Any advice guys?

P.s. it is not realistic to wait a month or more to buy a car because I work too far away for alternate options like biking to work or taking public transportation and rental cars are just too expensive to make it that long",finance

I've thought of a couple of options:

1. Apply for a 12 month interest free credit card and make the purchase on that. Then cut the card up and  pay off the ring within 12 months. I like this option the most.

2. I believe so jewelry stores do financing of their own but I'm a little wary of what the interest rate will be if i go that direction. 

3. Personal loan through the bank at a fixed interest rate. I know what exactly I will owe at the end but it will be a fair bit more than what I spent on the ring.

personalfinance,[Employment] Overpaid by Employer over 12 months - Deducted Paycheck,"Hello PF,

I'm posting on behalf of my mother, a teacher in the state of Florida. Her contracted salary for 12 months is $32,380.16 before taxes, which works out to be a gross monthly salary of  $2,698.35. She did 4 paid training sessions which grossed  $1,032.26, making her salary for the last 12 months  $33,412.42. Her monthly gross should then be  $2,784.37. She has the following deductions:

6.2% FICA
~1.2% Union Dues (37/month fixed)
~8.17% Federal Withholding (I couldn't get the same percent month to month...)
1.45% Medicare
3% Retirement

With those above deductions, I calculated that she should have expected a net monthly income of approximately  $2,213.35. 

This is the Net Pay received:

 $469.69 (June 2018)



The Issue:

The payroll lady (the whole department, small school system) hasn't been doing the accounting properly, and was asked to leave just this week. She made corrections to compensations before leaving, and my mother, expecting a net income this month of about $1950, instead received a deposit for $469.49, and a note on the paystub marked ""correction"" for about -$2000. This came as a huge shock, and there was no explanation from anyone.

I tracked all of her paystubs for the past 12 months, and she's been consistently given an average of $170 extra per month - some months way more, some way less - but her net pay remained fairly similar month-to-month, despite some months with huge over payments. She is now worried about fulfilling her obligations to the family budget - her car is almost paid off and the payment for the net month is already covered. 

My question:

Does she have any recourse in regards to the sudden correction of compensation? Obviously can't keep the extra cash. Also, she's overpaid her taxes as a result - what happens with that?",finance

I have a Discover personal loan ($1400) which will be paid off by the end of the year at the latest, a car note ($2000) that will be paid off next year at the latest, and a personal loan through my credit union ($7200) that will probably take a couple-three years to pay off, depending on how aggressive I want to be. I also cover all the household bills and still manage to put a little into savings every month.

On her end, she is recovering from some disastrous financial decisions that overlapped with the beginning of our relationship that nearly put her into bankruptcy.

personalfinance,"Liquidated a high risk investment for $250,000. Have $426,000 mortgage. What should I do with the money? (CAD)","I just liquidated a high risk investment portfolio for $249,000.  My original investment was $5,600, so this is a bit like winning a small lottery.  After capital gains taxes, I expect the sum to be around $190,000.  I'm looking for some advise on how best to use this money going forward.

I'm 37, married with one toddler, living in Toronto.  You have probably heard about the insane housing market in Toronto.  My mortgage is presently $426,000 at 2.79%.  Our monthly payment is $2200 presently.  It is a 25 year mortgage and the first five year term is complete in January, 2018.  It looks like rates are presently around 2.4% in Ontario.  I am permitted to pay up to $70,000 on my mortgage right now, if I wish in addition to my monthly payments.  I bought my house for $600,000 about 4 years ago.  I haven't had it appraised, but I expect it is worth over $800,000 presently.  The housing market has been booming, but has just recently started to slow down due to the implementation of a foreign buyer's tax.  We don't have any other investments, besides about $6000 in a Registered Education Savings Plan for our toddler.  We add about $300 to this every month.

Combined, my wife and I make about $132,000 / year before taxes.  We also rent out the basement suite of our house for an additional $1150/month.  Daycare costs about $17,000 / year, or $1416 / month.

What would the community suggest I do with the $190,000?  The simplest answer, to me, is to just put it towards our mortgage.  We would then be able to pay it of in 10 years rather than 20.  Is this the best way to go?  Another option, I guess, is to use the money as a down payment on a rental house.  I'm sure we could find a house somewhere in Toronto that would earn more for us in rental income than the mortgage would cost to carry at present rates.  However, I am not confidant it is a good time to buy real estate in the City and I'm also slightly concerned about the added workload of being landlord to another property.  Also, if interest rates rise significantly, the rental income may not cover the full mortgage and we would cut into our living income.

We live relatively comfortably.  However, we can rarely afford to travel abroad, which is what I want to do most.  In some ways, I would just like to increase our monthly spending money so we could take a nice vacation every year, do some home renovations, keep an up to date computer, etc., but that seems irresponsible.  We also have to save for our daughter's education in 16 years.

What are your thoughts?  Thanks in advance!

1FBUSA: $650 of $4500 limit, which I had exceeded a couple of years ago. I have been throwing everything I get in a tax return at the card and was able to double payments for awhile so have chipped it down considerably. The interest rate is something god-awful like 24%. 

Amazon Chase: $400 balance out of $1000. Right under 20% interest. 

So even though historically I was able to exceed the minimal monthly payments and make progress on the debts, my financial situation has changed and I will be stretched at least for the next few months to make any significant progress. 

I am strongly considering taking out a personal loan of enough to cover my debts through my banking institution. When I spoke with someone at the bank about this 2 years ago I was denied for a loan because my debt was so much greater (over $3000 instead of $1000) and my credit score was sitting in the lowish 600s BUT before being denied the specs of the loan made it clearly preferable to what I am currently paying. My interest rate would be maybe half of what the interest on the others are and my minimum payment at that time would have been something like 40/month. I would be able to pay triple that monthly for the same amount as paying the minimums on the two cards individually. 

My question is - is there a downside to this aside from the initial hit to my credit for taking the loan? Is this a terrible decision to someone more educated than me?

financialindependence,"My plan for FIRE. Please poke holes in it, offer advice.","I'm 38 and a physician.  My wife is 38 and a pharmacist. 

Assumptions:
4.0% withdrawl rate is a ""safe"" withdrawl rate.  Per US history, a 4% withdrawl rate give you a 95% chance of having funds left after 20 years of withdrawls.

I want to retire early, hence I need a sustainable withdrawl rate (SWR), a rate at which I will never run out of money.  SWR with 95% confidence is 3.4 historically.  When you figure in other developed contries, a 3.2% withdrawl rate is considered sustainable.  In order to be truely safe, I will strive for 3%.  This, especially if my first 10 years of returns are even decent, will results in infinate withdrawls.  If I supplement my early retirement, even a little, this will also go a long ways toward sustainability.  Especially since there have been rare bear markets where a poorly timed retirement would have been crippling.  The first 10 years of a retirement is the best predictor of the sucess of retirement savings.  

The 3% must come from invested funds.  Things like equity are not considered.  That said, they do make for a nice safety net.  Further, things like reverse mortgages are worth looking into at some point.  It removes a safety net but adds a guarenteed income.  Moving to less risky investments is an option, but then the SWR should be reassessed.  The 3% assumes at least 75% stocks and 25% bonds.

Federal income tax will not be a big issue in retirement.  As of 2017, the Standard deduction is 12,700 + 8,100 of personal exemptions for married filled jointly means that the first 20,800 is untaxed.  The follwing chart represents potential tax liability.

Federal.             State (MT)

21k= 0.                  $334

25k= $420.            $486

30k= $889.            $701

40k= $2360.          $1151

50k= $3448.          $1723

Therefore, if I can limit my pretax spending, I can avoid most taxes.  Ideally, 21k in pretax spending to avoid taxes.

This makes ROTH savings and regular post tax savings important. 

As long as my taxable income bracket under $37,950, I pay no capital gains tax.  After that, I pay 15% capital gains.  Thus, ROTH savings is crutial.

Given a 3% withdrawl rate, I need to mutiply my expected income in FIRE by 33.33x in order to establish my real amount needed for FIRE. 

My current plan:

Live off 60k per year.  In order to do that, I need 2 million in retirement.  The 60k does not include health care.  Health care costs are in flux and it is uncertain where the system is headed.  I estimate conservatively that we will need 18k per year for heath care.

Total need for retirement: 2.6 million.   

In order to acheive this result, I plan on continuing to invest fully in retirement accounts.

Backdoor Roth IRA: 11k

Work retirement (pretax): 54k

Wife's retirement (ROTH) + match: 21k

Wife's income deferal (pretax): 18k

102k per year

Cannot garentee but may be able to set aside an additional 18k in savings depending on too many factors to account for.

? 120k per year

I owe ~500k on my house and ~150k in school loans.  I plan on making additional payments, 55k per year, so that I can have them both payed off in 8 years.

Assuming 102k invested per year and 320k base saving, the following years to retirement result:

2.6 million saved based on annual interest rate.

102k saved.                   (120k saved)

1% = 20 years               (18 years)

2%= 18 years.               (16 years)

3%= 16 years.               (15 years)

4%=15 years.                (13 years)

5%=14 years.                (12 years)

6%=13 years (51)          (11.5 years)

7%=12 years.                (11 years)

8%=11.5 years.             (10.5 years)

9%=11 years.                (10 years)

10%=10.5 years.           (9.5 years)


I've implemented a budget that is similar to my retirement budget.  It is a little complicated because I obviously still have a mortgage and pay things like disability insurance and life insurance which I will not need once I reach FIRE.  Thus, I don't count those kind of things toward against my current budget.  I also don't include things like daycare.  My wife and I currently get 3k per month for non-fixed expenses.

BTC isn't running arbitrary code/contract within the chain like Ethereum, just transactions, so they are different beasts with different vulnerabilities in this aspect. I was involved in the squabble about the DAO fork and felt it was an exception, since a by-consensus fork changed the ledger and essentially ""stopped"" the leaky DAO contract.  That made their ""unstoppable code"" slogan a little disingenuous, but also allowed them to experiment with using the blockchain as a consensus-based enforcement mechanism.  Not good for trust in the ""unstoppable"" aspect, but it did get the DAO money back.  Is the only way to stop something like my example scenario a consensus-based fork to stop the rogue contract?  Does that show a hole in decentralization in which public consensus can be forced to fork, breaking the ""unstoppable"" aspect of ETH?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"26K Debt paid!!!, where to stash/invest cash for house down payment (Canada)","Why hello there
This Friday I will have finally paid off everything and become debt free. 

My next goal is to save up to buy a house in Trenton Ontario Canada. (Yes I'm Military) 

I currently budget to save $835 a month and have been able to maintain that for the last couple years. 

My question for you is; where should I stash my savings while I build it up? 

Because of the recent negative press I am hesitant to rely on any advice from the bank. It will probably take me 2 years to get the down payment I need. 

Should I accept a shitty interest rate but security of a TFSA savings account? 

Or the risk of a mutual fund? 

Any tips will help.

personalfinance,Inheritance came in: probing for financial options to discuss with my financial advisor,"I recently received my inheritance from my trust and am just looking for things to discuss with my financial advisor. I was told the balance is ~$160,000 with $8,000 in cash from a CD that matured this year. There's also attorney and processing fees that they said we would need to leave in the trust account to pay them off, which I don't yet know the totals for. 

I'm mainly looking for tax advice (what will happen if I take out a certain amount in cash), general investment options, and if the FA is offering a worthwhile service to me (she's been managing my trust, and I don't really know how to gauge her performance).

A bit of background:
1) Currently 25 with no kids/wife. No intentions for either any time soon. Have a decent job that pays ~$60,000/year. Have a townhouse (HOA ~$250) with an outstanding principle of about $174,000, 3.625% interest rate, and LTV is about 90%. I doubt the value has gone up more than $5-$10k since I purchased it (buying price was ~$195,000). Mortgage payment is ~$1,000. I have a car payment of ~$300 and principle is ~$17,000. 

2) As for financial goals, I'm pretty comfortable with everything right now. I don't feel I need to take out this money, and would be fine with just keeping it in investments. Only thing is that I hate how much interest I'm paying on my house. My main thought is to either try to pay off the house completely, or refi, but I don't know what's better.

3) As for asset performance, I was told YTD performance is 9% and the past 12 months is 12%. This is with a relatively conservative allocation of 35% fixed income investments. Being young, I'd be fine with moving this to a more aggressive allocation, but I'm not sure if this performance is good for the type of allocation.

4) Not sure if she is a Fiduciary. I'm still not too sure what this means, but I know it has to do with acting in your client's best interest. I'm just concerned if she's not, then she might be trying to sell me stuff I don't need.

5) Lastly, have ~$14,000 in a Roth IRA, and don't know if this is something I should mention to her and see if she can start managing. It's something I started in college, and haven't really paid attention to because I don't know what I'm doing with it. I just invested in some mutual funds. I've probably put around $10,000 into it, and that's the total after about 5 years.

Bitcoin,Can a miner mine 2 forks of a chain simultaneously?,"Considering the scaling debate that has engulfed bitcoin and seems to be reaching a climax I have been reading a lot about chain forks. One thing that is not entirely clear to me is how the ""answer"" that determines a new block is deemed sufficient.

I know that from the Satoshi white paper the answer must be a value that when hashed ""begins with a number of zero bits"" that depends on the network hash rate.

However, this leads me to conclude that if the chain forked a miner looking to maximize profits would find blocks and then add them to both chains simultaneously, claiming both rewards and transaction fees from both chains.

I am assuming that an ""answer"" sufficient to earn the bitcoin reward when mining must somehow depend on the existing blockchain, which would effectively stop this because as soon as the chain forked then blocks would only satisfy one of the chains.

I'm looking for a little advice for a situation that needs to be addressed, I'll try to keep it as clean and concise as possible.  Here we go;

I am in a long term relationship with my girlfriend of 10 years.  We took care of her ailing mother that passed away in 2013.  My girlfriend is the executor of the estate and we have not probated the will yet.  The house has a mortgage that has $60k left which is still in the Estate's name, We've been paying $1400 on a 9% interest.  In Texas, especially Fort Worth, our house has gained about $30k in property tax value which brings the overall value to $180k for a 2200sq/ft home.  We love the house, but it was built in 1989 and it's becoming apparent that we will need to do repairs on it sooner or later.  The neighborhood constantly changes as quite a few out of state investment companies have bought homes in the area to rent to public housing.

That being said, we know we are in the position that we need to either sell the house and buy a home in our name so we can benefit from a home purchase, better interest rate, and first time home buyer's credit.  

Obviously we know my girlfriend needs to have her name on the deed in order to sell the house, but I'm unsure if we should refinance the current house we're living in or just buy a house somewhere else.

Financially we're in a great spot for our age, I am a designer with a strong network of clients, she does her own thing as well.  I do not have any debt, no credit cards, no loans, vehicles are paid for but I feel like I should at least have a credit card to bring my credit score up into the high 700s.  My girlfriend has about 10k in debt for credit cards, still very manageable. 

So that's it..  I'm not exactly sure what my question is beyond, 'What should we do with an inherited house that would bring in a good chunk of change if/when we sell it.

I appreciate anyone's advice and I'll try to be prompt with answering any questions.

MachineLearning,"[D] GAN's producing more ""structured"" results when regarding artwork?","So - for a while I've been experimenting with feeding GAN's huge datasets of artwork, and the results that I've been getting have been interesting, but they're missing the ""structure"" found in normal images/artwork (by 'structure' i mean the arrangement of objects in the paintings - the idea that the painting is composed of separate objects, and isn't just a big soup of color. The GAN doesnt seem to be picking this up). Here's an example:

http://imgur.com/a/ldMnm

They don't really look like anything... I tried the same thing with a huge corpus of landscape paintings I put together and here's the result;

http://imgur.com/a/2lFAT

The results with landscapes are a *little* bit better, but not by much. I think they turned out better because ~~all~~ most of the data follows the same pattern of land at the bottom, maybe trees or something in the middle, and sky at the top. It's easier for the network to learn to generate this since the pattern is simpler. 

I've been trying to generate different types of art using GANs by trying to force it to learn structure, as opposed to color, etc. through the following approach


1. feed the GAN simpler representations of the artwork (in this case, I'm using an edge detection algorithm to generate representations of the artwork that is purely structural - here's an example http://imgur.com/a/hXQcP ). The logic is that if i feed the GAN these representations that only contain structure, there won't be anything else for it to learn (unlike the GAN that i fed the full color artwork that only learned the patterns in color, shading, etc as opposed to structure/shapes - i guess because patterns in color are much more apparent to the network than those in structure/shape)


2. train a pix2pix implementation to go from edges to the artwork equivalent (i already have a huge dataset of nude paintings and their corresponding edges, so this won't be hard)


3. Have the GAN generate edges and run them through pix2pix to get nude-paintings with structure (hopefully).


The bad news is that training the GAN on edges results in something like this: http://imgur.com/a/mG1MS (you're looking at a batch of 64 images generated from the GAN at epoch ~7000). Obviously, generating edges from the paintings wasn't the right approach. My initial thought is to seek some other form of simplified representation of the paintings - maybe like a low resolution ""map"" of the objects in the paintings; perhaps use object segmentation to make a low-resolution flat color version of the paintings, and then train the GAN on those? this way the patterns of color and shading would be reduced to much, much simpler ones, and it might learn patterns of structure instead since there? 

The problem is just getting the GAN to learn structure, so if you guys know of any way I could simplify the input for the GAN to plug into step 1 of my approach instead of edges, that'd be cool, and any other ideas of how I could get the GAN to learn structure would be greatly appreciated. also I know my wording is pretty bad so please don't be afraid to ask what i mean about certain things in the comments.

**tl;dr GAN won't learn structure/arrangement of objects in paintings I feed it... I've tried some things but it's still not learning structure, only color. help**",technology
personalfinance,Recent grad school graduate with student loans and a dead car -- what's a good plan of attack?,"I just graduated from grad school with a total of $64,000 in student loans ($20,000 private and $44,000 federal with an average of 5.7% interest). While I was in school I was able to pay off a little bit of the principle, but now that they've gone into repayment I'm trying to figure out my best options. Plus on top of that, my car decided to die this week. I'm in the process of working on negotiations for a job that will pay $35,000 a year.

Is it worth refinancing the loans and consolidating them into one loan? I don't think I'll be saving much in interest, but I could be wrong. I have a pretty decent credit score. The only plus side I can see from consolidating the loans would be getting my mother off as a co signer from the private loan so she can co sign a loan for my sister's graduate school next year. Currently I don't make enough money and I haven't been paying anything towards my federal loans, but I've been paying as much as I can towards my private loan.

I guess I'm just at a bit of a loss. I've been searching the internet all day trying to figure things out, but it's just making me nervous and confused. Do I consolidate loans and have a monthly payment of about $500? Do I continue to pay as much as I can towards the private loan and not pay anything towards the federal loan until November when I have to update the ""pay as you earn""? I've read I should pay the highest interest rate loan first, but they are only a few fractions off from each other.

My original goal before my car died was pay off as much of the private loan as possible by throwing almost everything I make between now and then at the loan and at the start of the year look into a new car. Plus start to deal with the federal loans in November.

Now I need a new car a lot sooner than I thought and I'm just not sure how to make it happen when I'm looking at ~$2,000 a month after taxes.

Thanks! I'm just very confused now and would love to be able to understand everything better. I don't want to make a mistake that I'll regret later on down the road.",finance

I am married, and I'm in grad school. My only real income right now is from student loans, but my husband makes nearly 100k a year. He knows about the credit card, we've both just been kinda ignoring it to focus on other things. 

We have a mortgage, it's roughly $1400 a month with about another $400 in utilities. We have no children.

I realize this is basically the definition of ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" but we only owe $3k more on the car, and having it paid off will be a weight off my shoulders.

Vanguard target retirement 2055 fund VFFVX (I've been advised against target retirement funds though)

2. would you recommend I sell the GE stock?  I have been told separately by 2 financial advisors that GE will not grow in value and will pay about 3-4% dividends per year, which is worse than a typical vanguard growth oriented fund

3. edit: also what are people's thoughts on roth vs IRA for this money?

4. any other considerations, things I've missed, etc.?

Other considerations:

We have since moved out, and have had a property management company rent it out and take care of it. Currently, title is in both our names, mortgage is in both our names, lease has both our names. 

We would like to refinance for a better rate and shorter term, for the purpose of saving thousands over the life of the mortgage (calculators have us saving around 45k). Remaining balance is $125k. Current interest rate is 5.25%.

However, my partner has since acquired tons of student debt, and thus has a huge debt to income ratio. Because of the high debt, I would be applying to refinance under my name only. Problem is threefold. All of the mortgage companies I have talked to will not take our rental income under consideration, because we claimed it on her taxes last year. They also won't take my overtime pay under consideration, even though I work construction and always make overtime. Lastly, we are renting our current place of residence, and they want to make me accountable for all of the rent because my name is on the lease (and so is hers).

Logically, the rental income has always gone to pay the mortgage first, and it will continue to pay the mortgage first. But I'm being told that Fannie/Freddie loans have no way to account for this, because they only look at the prior year taxes.

* Food &amp; Miscellaneous: 150 GBP / Month
* Targetted Savings: ~100 GBP / Month

Currently I have ~$70,000 in student debt with various interest rates that accrues approximate $330.00 in interest every month. I have chosen to opt into the new income based repayment scheme (REPAYE, I think is what it's called), and I have payed on it for a year at $170.00/month, as this was the determined payment that I should be making based on my income. Because of how the plan works, the government was subsidizing 50% of my remaining interest charges every month, so for the past year, my loan was growing by ~$80.00 / month.

I have now been informed that due to the massive changes to exchange rate, I now earn below the minimum threshold to have required payments on my loans (in other words, my payments have dropped to $0.00 / month). In order to get a small reduction on my interest rates, I am required to have an auto-pay of at least $5.00 / month, so I will definitely be doing this.

What I'm trying to decide, though, is whether it would be smart to lower my payments to the minimum $5.00 / month, or continue making payments at the level that I could afford before. If I lower my payments, the government subsidy will still cover 50%, therefore I will be accruing ~$160.00 interest / month on the account.

I do not believe that I will be able to pay this debt off very easily in the near future. I ***believe*** that it is likely that I will hit the 25 year limit on payment, and the remainder will be forgiven.

The reason I believe it would be smart to lower my payment to $5.00 / month is because my partner and I will now be saving for a deposit on our own home. Once we are able to get a mortgage on our own home, I would intend to increase my payments to something more substantial. It is my ***belief*** once again that having money saved in the bank is much more valuable to me right now that paying down the loans, simply because the sooner I can get away from the 900 GBP / month rent we currently pay, the more savings I will have to pay down the debt.

What I would like to know is whether you guys feel this is sound reasoning? Apologies if I left any important bits out, but feel free to ask if you want any more information. Thanks in advance for your comments!",finance
investing,Leverage for higher returns?,"The generation that bought houses in the 90s saw their wealth increase rapidly, as the house prices went up. The main reason for their high returns was leverage (and they were lucky the house prices kept going up).

Now, house prices seem less affordable and it seems less likely they will keep going up, with yields already low and near zero interest rates.

But there is nothing special about housing, right? Can we use leverage to get higher returns in other asset classes, e.g. equities, using a form of a tangency portfolio? If we are investing for the long term, and index investing gives positive returns over any 20 year period, why is it not a good idea or is not practical?",finance

personalfinance,Be really careful with auto financing payments,"Wanted to share this quick story for everyone here.  

tl;dr - do your homework and make sure that if you want to pay an auto loan down that your payments are going towards principal.  

We bought a nice car and due to a very low financing rate (0.99%) we decided to finance part of the purchase.  With our life priorities changing (we're becoming more of a FIRE focused family) we've decided to more aggressively pay down the loan.  I thought this would be similar to our mortgage payment where they automatically take every dollar over the required payment and apply it to principal.  (Note: I actually called my servicer to ensure that was what was happening and the online amortization schedule appears to match that for my home loan).

Let me rehash my convo with the lender (who is an arm of the OEM):

Me: I have a question for you- I'd like to make additional principal payments on my vehicle I have financed with you, how do I do that through your payment portal?

Agent: Sorry, unfortunately you can't do that, but you can make additional payments through the portal.

Me: (pause) OK, if I make an additional payment will it go to principal?

Them: Sorry, no.  It will go towards future payments.

Me: How do I get an additional payment to go towards principal?

Them: When you make an additional payment you wish to go to principal you need to call us and direct us to do that.

Me: Wait, I have to call you every time I want to do this?

Them: Unfortunately, yes, you do.

Me: So, every month, I need to execute the payment online, then call you and tell you to put it to principal?

Them: Yes.

Lesson learned- the lender doesn't care about the costs of their call center and actively wants to discourage prepayment on their loans.  I don't know if this is something everyone knows about but me, but figured worth sharing.

Also, as a final note: yes, I get the economics of investing vs having a very low interest rate loan.  I get it.  I'd rather have the payments gone and own my car outright.  Just what helps me sleep better at night now that we've decided to focus a little differently on our retirement and savings.",finance

Currently, about 75% of my income goes to necessities each month (mortgage, bills, groceries, gas). I have no credit cards (minus a company card), good credit, and only a small amount of student debt. My wife has decent credit, some medical debt, and some student debt.

I earn ~5500 monthly, plus additional moneys about 9 months of the year in disability compensation (Veteran).

 My car (20 years old, a gas hog, and not feasible to keep maintained much longer) has got to go. Plus, I could use a pickup truck for a variety of reasons. 

So... 

1. How do I best afford a car payment? 

2. What's the best way to go about auto financing? What interest rate should I be looking for, either from the dealership or from a third party? 

3. What should I look out for (gimmicks, etc) when shopping around? 

4. Is brand new worth the money in terms of warrantee and such, or do I need to set my sights on a couple years older car? 

I really want to buy from a dealership as I'm not much of a mechanic (I'm an IT worker) and don't trust that I wont get ripped off in a private sale.

personalfinance,(CAN) Mid 20's out of school and struggling to pay off debt and become stable.,"Hi there PF, I'm Young and dumb, but I ain't no quitter. I do understand that this is going to be a long game here.
Let me give you some info about me:

I'm a mid 20's IT graduate, I rent and own a car (well two actually). The one is for daily driving and the other sits on the farm and does farm work.
I have student loans around 15K and another 7K split amongst two other credit cards. 

I've really trimmed back what I spend my money on and take side work to help supplement my income. 
I use mint to track my expenses and hold to my budgets.

I've logged my bills and basically half of my monthly regular wage goes to bills.


I was told about getting another loan to lasso up and pay off some of my credit debts but my bank has denied me when i went in for a consultation.

I got one of my credit cards change to a lower interest rate (swapped out cards) but the card (costco Capital One) with the highest rate and most money is too high. I called in and they do not allow for balance transfers.

I haven't had enough life experience to know what to do in this situation. My credit is good, i just dont have enough personal assets to get a bank line of credit.

What options do i have to help get this sorted out or more balanced.



More info:
Two student loans are Provincial (2500 @ 2.7% interest i think) and National (12500 @ 5.2 % i think)
The Credit Cards are Bank( 1200 @ 11% i think) and Costco Capital One (5700 @ 20% i think)

personalfinance,Need advice deciding to rent spare room or AirBnB it.,"A little about my financial background. I am 23 years old. I have no car payments, no student loans. I purchased my home (3 bedroom, 2 bathroom) for 190k, at an interest rate of 5.35% for a 30 year loan. My monthly mortgage is around $1,200. I am renting my two other spare rooms to friends, so in the end I only pay $420 out of my own pocket for mortgage. We split the internet, water/gas, and electricity three ways. Basically, the only expenses I have are $420 rent that goes to my mortgage, $110 per month car insurance, home insurance, credit cards (that I pay off every month), utilities, and food. 

My house comes with a storage shed in the backyard. Currently it is being used as a storage, but being that my roommates and I are young, we don't have much stuff to store. So my parents and I have been discussing about turning the storage into a little studio with full bathroom (toilet, sink, shower), with the kitchen and bedroom/living room sharing one common area. We found a guy who will do every, insulation, flooring, full bathroom, ventilation, drywall, add two windows to the structure, and kitchen for $4,000 total.

investing,"In your opinion, what are the best ways to invest money for the rest of the year?","There are numerous factors that summed up make each investment decision quite dubious. The recent failure of Obamacare, Brexit and the US presidential election make 2017 seem quite unstable, especially as many investors predict an imminent inflation.

Given the 18% rally since the election, in November, the financial sector might be a good investment. This is only the beginning of an upcoming significant valuation increase, which is mainly favoured by raised interest rates and less restrictive regulations. Overall the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) is definitely going to generate revenue and a good investment for 2017.

US equities appear to be another profitable investment, being predicted an 8% increase during this year. A special position is the oil crude, that is now at a historically low price, but will stabilize undoubtedly until the end of 2017.
On the other hand, emerging market currencies might have a better return, especially by pairing weak currencies, like the ruble, with more stable ones, let's say the Swedish krone or American dollar.

Some other ideas might be senior loans, yield enhancers and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.

personalfinance,I've been denied online delivery of first time order of free credit reports. What should I try moving forward?,"EDIT: so the answer to my question already existed on the credit reports wiki page. I'll be sure to read more thoroughly in the future.

Answer:
&gt; Posters on /r/personalfinance frequently point out that Annualcreditreport.com will ask them questions about tradelines that they had no idea existed. This is a common occurrence; your identity has not been stolen. Often, the answer to a lot of questions on that website are: NONE OF THE ABOVE. In addition to this, just because Annualcreditreport.com doesn't let you view your file doesn't mean you answered anything incorrectly. Often, the bureaus will simply not have enough information to automatically verify, 100%, that the user of the website is really you. This frequently occurs with ""thin files"", or credit reports that contain sparse information on a consumer. If you are obtaining an error like this, send a mail-in request. You will need to fill out a request form on the Federal Trade Commission's website, and mail it to the address provided. You can also call their hotline.



After spending four years in college, I am about to start my very first full time job. With this just on the horizon, I decided to pull my free annual credit report just for the sake of getting off on the right foot.

So with that, I visited www.annualcreditreport.com and followed instructions there. Upon attempting to get my TransUnion report, the website said that my report was unable to be delivered, and that I could call or have it mailed to me. Given that I am going to be moving once again in about a month, I decided to postpone getting this report until after my address changes and things settle down a bit.

Upon attempting to get my Equifax report, it proceeded to ask me several security questions involving what already appeared to be on my credit report. The concerning thing here is, I answered all of the multiple choice questions with NONE OF THE ABOVE.

For instance, to my knowledge I only line of credit I have is a single credit card open with chase, where as the question on my lines of credit Equifax gave me had choices such as macy's or nordstrum's.

Furthermore, one of the questions asked me about an auto loan that is apparently on my report, but I have never bought or owned a car before. This sort of implies that there is a bunch of stuff on my report that I have little or no knowledge of.

So moving forward, what should I do? Should I enlist the help of a professional just in getting access to my credit reports? And if so, what kind of professional is best for this? Or Is it safe enough for me to wait a month or two and then request the reports by mail? Or will mail requests run me into issues too?",finance

personalfinance,Will I regret my college choice?,"Hello all, this is my first time posting on Reddit. I'm in need of some advice regarding my recent college decision. Let me set the scene:

I come from a fairly well-off income family (about $120K annually before tax) and have two parents who both work in the federal prison system. Neither of them has a full/extensive college education (Dad never went, mom took some online classes but hasn't finished), but they worked very hard in the military (US Army) before entering their current jobs and moving their way up. They are both 7 years or less from retirement. They support me more than they should and every day I am thankful for them.

Going into my senior year of high school, I was very confused, ill-informed, and terrified of the college process. My parents couldn't be of much help with the process itself, though they did provide much needed emotional support. I did the best I could, navigating this process mostly on my own, and ended up applying to four schools: North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and MIT. I got into all but MIT, which was my dream school. 

I ultimately narrowed my options down to NCSU and Duke based on my on-campus experiences and the majors each offered. I was honestly unsure of how to more thoroughly compare things aside from this. My interests are currently research, mathematics (pure and applied), entrepreneurship, and engineering (mainly either biomedical or electrical), and I'm hoping to create a career in the future than can encompass some or all of these interests. 

When I received my Duke decision (applied RD there and ED to NCSU), it kinda threw me into a thrall of sorts because I had already planned on going to NCSU under the assumption that I wouldn't get into Duke (post MIT rejection blues #feelsbadman). At that time, Duke and NCSU would've been close in price per year ($19K at NCSU first year versus ~$27K at Duke).

After visiting both campuses, talking to current students and faculty in my areas of interest, and thinking about the opportunities I'd likely have at each school, I ultimately decided on Duke. My parents didn't pressure me one way or the other, saying that they'd be proud of me either way and that they'd help me pay for it no matter what. 

Here's the thing: one of my parents is a 100% disabled Veteran, and in the state in which I live, I was able to apply to a scholarship for dependents of veterans. I found out I got the scholarship on May 1, which is also national college decision day; I worried that neither school would hold my spot after this date and I feel that this made me choose without thinking everything through. Also, the wording on the scholarship website itself was a bit confusing to decipher because there are different benefits for going to public versus private schools; I called a lady at the VA center and she ended up confusing me more unfortunately (I should've taken more initiative to look harder myself). The sheet explaining the exact difference was not mailed to me until after I made my decision, but the scholarship covers tuition &amp; room + board allowance at a public school versus $4500/year at a private school.

Financially, NCSU was the much better option, but I only knew this until after May 1, after I'd already committed to Duke, which was the better choice emotionally speaking. The scholarship lasts for 8 academic semesters at any in-state school. I love Duke and would love to go there, but I am unfortunately very worried about the prospect of massive (60K+) debt and have a strange habit of imagining myself as a struggling, overly frugal (not by choice, though I do plan to be somewhat frugal because I want to have a good savings and be able to invest eventually) engineer who lives with regret for 10+ years of going to the school that I loved over the one that was the better financial choice. 

I start in the fall, but have already started considering my transfer options if I'm unable to get the coveted, full merit scholarship through the Robertson Scholars program that first year students can apply to (very, very slim odds). I'm not fully versed in all of it yet, but I think it would be possible to transfer to NCSU after one full year at Duke and have my scholarship transfer as well (and hopefully most of my credits). I must also mention that because my parent is a disabled vet, I should get a small stipend of ~$1000 per month that I can use with discretion. I've already negotiated with Duke's financial aid office and got my EFC down to $24,720. I've saved enough money and made enough this summer to cover the $1,700 of my remaining student contribution after outside scholarships are applied. If I use my VA stipend towards tuition costs, this should bring my EFC down by about $9K. My parents are willing to support me with the rest, but I don't want them to have to take out that much (or even a smaller amount) in loans every year, especially since I'm not sure how my EFC could fluctuate in future years and due to the fact that they have had to take out loans for my sister's undergraduate and upcoming grad school + PhD education. 

I feel so guilty for putting my parents and myself in this situation, but I'm a firm believer in taking responsibility for my choices while also leaving myself open to future alternatives (hence the possible transfer option). Any advice on what you think is the best option or on your experiences with similar situations are appreciated. I realize that now I have a lot of choice in where my life goes from here and that's empowering and terrifying to me.",finance

I receive 90 euros for traveling costs. p/month
I get about 350 euros a month as a student loan p/month (I can increase this up to 600, no interest rate)
In the case of emergency, I can also ask for a small amount from my parents. 
I did have savings, but spent them on my driver's license and have some invested in cryptocurrencies which I don't want to touch.

I have 3 part-time jobs that I can not attend for 6 months in my home country, I lose up to 400-500 euros in loan payments p/month. So money, when I get back, might also be an issue.

My biggest concerns are how to find cheap accommodation. I have signed up for an agency that will actively look for internships I can attend, however, I need to fill in 2 preferred countries. I don't really care where I do the internship as in the country, but it is important I go somewhere CHEAP, in accommodation and in living costs. I hope to become more self-sustainable and learn how to survive on my own. However, I realize I can not start on a bad note and therefore I am here, asking PF for some much-needed help!

So basically, where do I go, what costs should I expect, and how should I prepare for this massive opportunity in my life?",finance
personalfinance,Help untangling credit limit reductions after opening new credit line.,"Hi everyone,    
My fiancee opened a Chase Sapphire Reserve this month for the perks as she travels heavily for work.  She has 4-5 other miles/points cards she opened but doesn't use anymore because her company doesn't book that hotel/airline (i.e. a Marriott rewards card, etc).    
    
Today, I noticed when checking my credit karma that her Amazon Rewards card (on which I am an authorized signer) credit limit had been reduced from ~$20,000 to $8,700, resulting in a utilization increase from under 30% to 51%.  This presumably caused the 50pt drop in my Transunion score (as there doesn't seem to be any other recent changes to my report).    
    
I brought this up with her and she confirmed that both the Amazon card, and her other cards with Chase all had their limits reduced.  She stated that she had no idea this was going to happen, and is pretty miffed as (from a perhaps naive perspective) she basically just paid $400 for the privilege of having our credit scores negatively impacted via the utilization spike.    
    

I am primarily worried about the impact to her credit (mine is not great and being worked on) and looking for any advice or suggestions moving forward.  Some figures and thoughts for perspective:    
* Her credit score was 813 at the time of applying for the Sapphire    
* No missed payments on any account of which several are 8+ years old    
* No other loans besides a mortgage, student and auto loans payed and closed early.    
* Her other accounts seem to have been lowered to keep her available credit below $100k including the Sapphire; Her gross income is ~$145k.  From what I can find online, it is not unusual to have 1x or 2x available credit:income for credit-worthy people.    
    
Looking for suggestions and help preparing her to discuss any of the following with Chase:    
* Reducing the credit limit on the Sapphire and other unused cards and restoring/raising the limit on the frequently used cards.    
* Asking them to restore the limits from the adjusted cards, resulting in a net increase in available credit    
* Closing the Sapphire and switching to an AMEX Platinum, to reduce the total credit from Chase and possibly have them reinstate the limits on the old cards.    
* Anything else you all may suggest.    
    
Between us our household is otherwise financially stable and secure; our primary concern is the lowered limit on the card or two we actually use and resulting utilization.  An increase in available credit would be welcome as well so that we have more flexibility &amp; purchasing room as future needs change.    
    
    
Thanks guys.

personalfinance,22M Failing Across the Board. Finally time to accept subsidized student loans even in Community College? Bonus: I am ignorant of getting into a 4-year.,"I am 22 living in Los Angeles, and trying to support myself while I go to community college and study fim production. In the pursuit of trying to support myself I pretty much have no life, and it's been that way since I was ~20. Many of my peers just went straight to a 4-year, which I neglected to apply to any colleges as I was unsure what I wanted to do so I went to a CC. Now I feel trapped in my condition and fear I'll spend many more years like this. No networking, no friendmaking, just work and (when I'm lucky) school. 

About me:

* Work 80 hours every 2 weeks, split across every day while it's summer for minimum wage ($10/hr). I have had better paying jobs, but nothing sustainable until this job at a restaurant. I have 2 years of production experience already, but haven't been able to land any paying jobs that could support me like working for a news station did.
* Rent is $850/mo, car is $175/mo, gas is $150/mo, Credit Card is $40/mo (450 left to pay), and remaining legal fees are $40/mo.
* My community college's costs are ~$400-$750 a semester now. I am a film production student.
* I had to take my Spring semester of college off because I could not afford to go to school and work as much as I needed to to pay for legal fees after I was arrested and plead to a Wet and Reckless in mid 2016 and the pretty rough living expenses of LA.
* My family has an income of around 100,000, making only about $500 in unsub loans available to me (expected family contribution is almost 20,000/yr; actual is about 2,000/yr at best).
* I'm a generic white guy. I have no special benefits, nor received scholarships (though I only applied to a few; pretty much anything to do with family law enforcement). Supposedly I'm native american (makes sense since we'd to to the reservation when I was a kid) but I never tested this and AFAIK I won't receive anything at my age for it if I did end up being whatever magical % native you need to be to get benefits like friend did (10,000 on her 18th. What a break).
* I did not apply to a 4 year because I did not believe it was wise to spend as much money as I heard other kids were going to spend when I was unsure of my career path, especially consideirng I had no idea how we could possibly have the kind of money to pay.

My goals:

* AS Degree
* Be able to attend Community College full time, or just go for a 4-year (not sure if this is a thing). I'm getting sick of wading around. I want to put my education into high gear, get networking, and begin my career sooner rather than later. 

**tl;dr** My questions:

* Is it possible for me to switch to a 4-year college without completeing community college? My thought is, if I can, and I have to takes loans at this point anyhow, I might as well just go straight to where
* What do I really need to apply to a state college or university like Cal State Northridge or even UCLA if I were just coming out of High School?
* How can I acquire the information I need to apply to a 4 year (I believe I need to know where my GPA was, my ACT or SAT scores [pretty sure I took ACT] + what else to I need)?
* If I cannot get more than $500 in unsubsidized loans despite only receiving &lt;2,000 in family contributions yearly, what is the best way for me to do federal subsidized loans? How stupid am I for needing this when I'm only attending Community College?

A lot of this is just ignorance. I am from a small town, and depsite having spoken with several couselors over the years I seem to get different answers from different people. If you can't help with all of it, just what you do know is appreciated. Also ask me any info you need, and it can be fairly personal as this is a throwaway account anyways. I will reply when I check the thread tomorrow.

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Parents require cosign on a loan for a house.,"Hey PF,

I'll try and be brief. I know this title makes people scream ""NO"" and this is my default stance on co-signing unless you are confident you can pay the entire loan but I will lay out the situation.

My parents are retired and selling their house (fully paid off), they hoped to get 900k but are dropping it to 850k in hopes of selling quickly. They made an uncharacteristically bad financial decision to purchase a 350k house for retirement a few hours away, thinking they would have no problem getting a loan from the bank until they sell the house.

Problem is now the bank will not front them the 120k they need to purchase this new house. I know pulling out of the new house now would have considerable repercussions but I'm not savvy with the details. Here are their current options in no particular order:

1. Cash out all of their assets including RRSP (terrible decision in my mind and they also understand this is worst case) to close the new house until theirs sells.
2. Apply for some sort of high-interest loan, and pay it off when they sell this house.
3. I co-sign on the 120k loan, and when they sell the house they pay off the entire loan.
4. Back out of their new house (I'm not exactly sure of the repercussions, they made it seem like it would cost more than cashing out their RRSP. I'll speak to them again and look into this)

I've discussed these options with them already, and I told them I wouldn't be willing to co-sign for a number of reasons. I've surfed PF enough to know why this is a bad decision and my gut told me no. They are very understanding of this. I know this isn't r/relationships but it hurts to have my parents who have always helped me out greatly, lose so much on their RRSP when I could save them this money by co-signing. Also as a side note they are planning on giving me a significant amount of money when they sell the house which makes it feel even worse to say no and expect that money.

My situation is fine, I'm working full time living with my GF who is working 30+ hours a week atm and we are trying to save money for a down payment. I have 16K left on my car loan, she has 14K in student loans and we have about 15K saved.

I always try an assume worst case scenario, so if they can't sell the house and I have co-signed on a loan I know worst case they would just cash out assets and RRSP to pay off the loan so I don't have to pay it.

It seems to me best case they sell this house soon, and they can just pay off the 120k loan in one go. 

In order to ease my mind I had some questions:

1. If I co-sign, they pay off the debt when they sell the house, does this help my credit?
2. If the loan is paid off within a month or two, would this still affect my credit if I were to apply for a loan/apartment/mortgage? I understand it will still show on my credit report, but I was wondering how this works if it shows as being fully paid off. 
3. Do they have any other options I am missing?

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any input.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice and comments. I believe they found a solution involving a bridge loan or HELOC on the new house so they won't have to dip into RRSP. I'm glad I posted this, took advice from you all and spoke to them since otherwise I think they were considering it the easiest option to cash out their RRSP.",finance
personalfinance,Some help/advice needed getting out of debt options,"I am in my late 20s with a wife and kid.  Currently we have about 20k in credit card debt and paying almost 400$ a month in fees alone.  We make just enough to pay the bills and fees.  I'm hopefully going to be getting another job soon but still it won't be an increase enough to pay these off quickly.  Been an incredible pain to pay these fees and only the minimum each month.

We have a house that if we sold today would most likely make 80k+ on it but really would rather not have to.  Other option I've considered is using student loans since they have lower interest rates and don't start having to pay them all back right away? Selling the house has seemed like the best option for me, but my wife thinks otherwise.  I tried to get  an equity loan or refinance on the house but the higher rate on the loan makes it not worth it at all due to mine and my wives not great credit. Any suggestions would be great, I don't know what to do, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"Balance billed $33,000+ for out-of-network air ambulance even after three appeal attempts (including one through employer). What next?","Last year I required emergency neurosurgery for a traumatic brain injury that I sustained, so I was air lifted to the nearest possible hospital. The air ambulance company contacted me back in February to assist me in making an appeal with my health insurance company to pay the full bill of $40,000+ since they only paid ~$10,000 since the air ambulance is out of network. The appeal was denied.

I made a second appeal and included a letter from my neurosurgeon stating the medical necessity of an emergency air ambulance. He basically stated I would of died if I hadn't been air lifted. Again the appeal was denied.

As a federal gov employee with an employer health insurance provider, I was able to make an appeal through OPM.gov (United States office of personnel management). I sent them my EOBs, the letter from my neurosurgeon and all other required documentation. They concluded that I in fact did owe the money, so my appeal was denied once again.

I know that one of my options is to call the air ambulance company and bargain with them, but that is a last resort for me. I wanted to know from personal finance if there's any last ditch efforts that I can attempt before resorting to bargaining with the air ambulance company. 

This whole traumatic brain thing was already such a negative life changing event. I was in the ICU for 1 week. Afterwords, I spent another week admitted in the hospital. I was cognitively and physically unable to attend work for 12 weeks. I spent that time in neurological rehabilitation doing physical, speech and occupational therapy. If you know anything about traumatic brain injuries, you would also know that they come with a life long negative cognitive effects that I'm still facing. Any help would be much appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,Where were you when BTC was at 6 dollars?,"Ah no it isn’t worth mining 1 BTC every two days. No Bitcoin (BTC) will never go above 6 dollars what are you saying? We have all been there but some have been there harder than others.
I was at university when the BTC craze started. I owned 100s of them in 2012. There was nothing like it out there. I mean you could call up and ask your Goldman Sachs equity holder about BTC and he would just stare blindly down the abyss. It took only 6 years to get the future here. To get The Pied Piper flux going and for the world to reinvent FOMO.
FOMO is “Fear of Missing Out”. Bitcoin did not start like that however. Bitcoin was one of the first decentralized currencies (now more a commodity than a currency) to take effect. Bitcoin was firstly adopted by dark net users as a medium of exchange: BTC for drugs, guns, hitmen or whatever else you wanted to buy without leaving any traces back to you, the consumer. It was the Paypal of the dark era.

1- You did not have to verify your identity to buy BTC.
2- You were not waiting hours on end for BTC to process.
3- BTC was a novelty, it was different and akin to its roots “a dark crypto” with no regulation and governmental power to trace your tracks.

Yeah BTC was really at 6 dollars in 2012 and I was buying loads of it as I was seeing the European Union slowly disintegrate and people starting to voice their disapprovals. Citizens of the EU had started losing faith in their own currencies, their own governments and institutions. Greece was left to fend for itself (not entirely true but it was not in the best of places), Portugal and Spain were salvaged by the European Central Bank and the European Union saw an uprising in the rightists movements.
Institution: 1. Establishment (foundation) or organization created to pursue a particular type of endeavor, such as banking by a financial institution.

It wasn´t FOMO that was driving BTC up, it was the distrust in the system. People fed up with traceable transactions, fluctuating currencies and the lack of a powerful political figures started looking at alternatives. After the adoption of BTC in the dark net community, the regular folks started looking at ways to make money. BTC started shooting up and by March 2014 it was already at 450 dollars.

You may ask if I still have these BTC laying around. My answer is no. I lost access to my wallet some years ago and was never able to obtain my old HDD. Is there regret? Sure. But life goes on right. At 6 dollars a BTC no one could have seen where this was going right? Well, a select few did. The future had just arrived some years too early and it took years for people to start believing in another system. 

I am not going to dive into the technical aspects of BTC or other crypto currencies as I believe they have been well covered by the STEEM community (or even more so reading their websites). We need to have more “alive” posts. Posts that make you think, ask questions and/or laugh. There are too many posts trying to pump the value of their coins. If we continue down this path we will eventually close the lid on STEEM and these other ""make profit for posting"" projecets. Getting paid to post, upvote and comment should not be done so by any means possible.

The crypto currency market is a fascinating thing but we must not forget what drove the world to the largest financial crisis in history in 2008 (largest in real money terms). FOMO is driving up a lot of useless coins. ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) have had some very interesting projects but along with some of these we´ve had an array of projects/tokens/coins with no real value. People fear missing out on the next “Bitcoin” or “Ethereum”.
The corporations we distrusted, the ones we wanted to turn our backs to in 2008 because of their sheer greed and power now control most of the BTC and ETH in the world. The few corporations are the controlling ones. It is all great because we can all make money fast in the short run. Shares aren´t even attractive anymore because you must wait years to get a decent ROI (Return on Investment) if any!

I am not stating that the current cryptocurrency market is a bubble (it will eventually be one) but I am saying we should all be careful about our feelings. Remember Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street), he got thousands of people to invest in penny stocks. Penny stocks were usually sold outside of the major market exchanges at extremely low prices with a small market capitalization but no real liquidity – no money no assets.

Now we are all investing into projects we have barely even heard about. Our friend buys some “X” and we all follow suit because we don´t want to be the one in the group without any “X”. We are not dealing with penny stocks. The market capitalization with some of these projects spread wider than corporations that have been in the making for centuries in just a matter of days. There are new ICOs every few weeks and we are all funding them with a blind eye (Hey! Not all but you know what I mean right?)

Personally, I do not like where the Ethereum market is going. Smart Contracts are a fascinating new addition but the network has bottlenecked the past few days due to ICOs of Status Token, Civic and Bancor (150 million raised). The use of gas and how much you need is not the easiest to understand for the most of us in the Ethereum network. I do not believe that the future is in Ethereum. I believed the future was in Bitcoin but dropped out short. The crypto market craze has just started.

Just invest in what you think is right. What you believe in. Take some time apart and research.

Consider projects you might find interesting but do your own due diligence and research. Research their whitepaper (Whitepaper is a guide to how an idea or project will be implemented with questions answered in a step by step summary) and ask questions on here, reddit and wherever about any upcoming ICOs. After regulation, most of these coins will cease to exist and only the great projecets will be left and thus there will be another price adjustment. You might be able to make money in the short run following the market pumping and dumping (if you´re even lucky enough to know when that occurs) but it is more likely to go the other way for most people.  **edit: Grammar

Bitcoin,The Coming Speculative Attack,"I was reading Pierre Rochard's article over at SNI and i noticed something very interesting.  (Bold at bottom-mine)


&gt;Slow bleed leads to currency crisis as the expected value of bitcoins solidifies in people's minds. At first they are conservative, they invest ""what they can afford to lose"". After 12-18 months, their small stash of bitcoins has dramatically increased in value. They see no reason why this long term trend should reverse: the fundamentals have improved and yet adoption remains low. Their confidence increases. They buy more bitcoins. They rationalize: ""well, it's only [1 -5%] of my investments"". They see the price crash a few times, due to bubbles bursting or just garden-variety panic sales – it entices them to buy more, ""a bargain"". Bitcoin grows on the asset side of their balance sheet.


&gt;On the liability side of the Bitcoiner's balance sheet there are mortgages, student loans, car loans, credit cards, etc. Everyone admonishes people to not borrow in order to buy bitcoins. The reality is that money is fungible: if you buy bitcoins instead of paying down your mortgage's principal, you are a leveraged bitcoin investor. Almost everyone is a leveraged bitcoin investor, because it makes economic sense (within reason). The cost of borrowing (annualized interest rates ranging from 0% to 25%) is lower than the expected return of owning bitcoins.


&gt;How leveraged someone's balance sheet is depends on the ratio between assets and liabilities. The appeal of leveraging up increases if people believe that fiat-denominated liabilities are going to decrease in real terms, i.e. if they expect inflation to be greater than the interest rate they pay. At that point it becomes a no-brainer to borrow the weak local currency using whatever collateral a bank will accept, invest in a strong foreign currency, and pay back the loan later with realized gains. In this process, banks create more weak currency, amplifying the problem.


&gt;The effect of people, businesses, or financial institutions borrowing their local currency to buy bitcoins is that the bitcoin price in that currency would go up relative to other currencies. To illustrate, let's say that middle-class Indians trickle into bitcoin. Thousands of buyers turns into hundreds of thousands of buyers. They borrow Indian Rupees using whatever unencumbered collateral they have – homes, businesses, gold jewelry, etc. They use these Rupees to buy bitcoins. The price of bitcoins in Indian Rupees goes up, a premium develops relative to other currency pairs. A bitcoin in India might be worth $600, while in the U.S. it trades at $500. Traders would buy bitcoins in the U.S. and sell them in India to net a $100 gain. They would then sell their Indian Rupees for dollars. This would weaken the Indian Rupee, causing import inflation and losses for foreign investors. The Indian central bank would have to either increase interest rates to break the cycle, impose capital controls, or spend their foreign currency reserves trying to prop up the Rupee's exchange rate. Only raising interest rates would be a sustainable solution, though it would throw the country into a recession.


&gt;There's a huge problem with the Indian central bank raising interest rates: bitcoin's historical return is ~500% per year. Even if investors expected future return is 1/10th of that, the central bank would have to increase interest rates to unconscionable levels to break the attack. The result is evident: everyone would flee the Rupee and adopt bitcoins, due to economic duress rather than technological enlightenment. This example is purely illustrative, it could happen in a small country at first, or it could happen simultaneously around the world. Who leverages their balance sheet and how is impossible to predict, and it will be impossible to stop when the dam cracks.


&gt;Which countries are most vulnerable to a currency crisis? Business Insider provides a helpful list here. **Bitcoins will have to reach certain threshold of liquidity, indicated by a solid exchange in every financial center and a real money supply – i.e. market cap – of at least $50 billion, before they can be used as an instrument in a speculative attack. This will either coincide with or cause a currency crisis.**

*End of Article*

I think things are going to get very interesting when the next self-imposed government currency crisis hits a country.  As this article predicted, Bitcoin has grown and is now big enough to start eating small governments.

deeplearning,Learning / optimizing strategies?,"**TL;DR:** Bold text below is mainly what I want to know. FlappyBird game with one action and a goal to survive sounds like a good example.

---

I'm new to machine/deep learning, it seems a rather broad field! I have experience programming but not quite sure where to look to get started here. I see alot of pattern/feature matching/manipulation going on, usually with images or audio.

**What are the terms to look into if you have some actions/events that can occur and you have a rough goal/outcome desired and would like the AI to learn what is effective/ineffective based on datasets it's given?** I saw a video on MarI/O which was an AI with genetic algorithm to learn how to play a level(I think it had learned mostly how to play that single level really well, overfitting?) and I found that quite interesting.

Another example could be guessing passwords, a large dataset of known passwords could be fed in, and it could guess what letters are most likely to follow after a previous one or common word combinations/patterns. I've read of this being done with markov chains(or hidden markov models, not sure). This sounds more in line with what deep learning is good at.

I think I am more interested in the ones like MarI/O where the AI has actions it can perform with a measurable goal to achieve while learning from it's actions/decisions that fail. The issue with that propped up was the likely overfitting to that specific level, how would you avoid that, would more levels help or would it need to be combined with other methods so it actually learnt how to play well to procedurally generated levels?

Could I take a more basic game like FlappyBird(one button to move the player up while they otherwise fall to gravity trying to dodge obstacles) and teach it how to survive the procedural generated level by using that one action?",technology

personalfinance,Accountability for a change in Credit Scores,"So this is as much a rant as much as a question. I've been meticulous about my credit every since I graduated 5 years ago from college (I need to, with six figures in student loans) and I keep a very strict accounting of my 5 credit cards, all with a utilization less than 5% at all times.

Last month, my credit score from Karma was around 790-795ish range, and recently it's dropped to 755ish. My theory is that I recently took out a 0% interest loan with a large furniture store, and since this account is technically a credit card with a introductory interest rate and not a personal loan, it will count towards my credit utilization %. Because of this, I now have a credit utilization above 10%, which comes with a penalty. Nothing else has changed that might warrant a cred score drop that I can think of.

My rant is this: why do credit bureaus provide 0 feedback on the reasons *why* a score drops? It would be so much easier for all of us to better understand how that number is calculated. I understand there are so many factors that play into that number, and that generally it only takes a few months to recover from a penalty like this, but that's not always the case.

Does anybody feel where I'm coming from on this? It's just a frustration I have with our current system more than anything else, but if anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear any feedback.",finance

personalfinance,"I have a plan to look to buy a house by January 2017, and am looking for critiques and advice.","Hello all!

So my situation is as follows: I live in Florida, and my rent for an old and barely livable 3/2 house is $1300 / month. I take care of all rent and house hold expenses myself (electric, utilities, internet bill, groceries, etc). This is stupid high and I wish to start looking to buy a house by January after I save up some money for a down payment. 

Reasons to wait until January when I have rent that high: 

My credit is currently in recovery. I have a 527 score in TransUnion and Equifax according to Credit Karma. This is due to poor decisions on my part when I had first moved out of my parents house, as well a stint of being unemployed that resulted in some late/missed payments. I had several accounts go in to collections (1 credit card (totaling $1100, but now have a payment plan set up with a remaining balance of $600. I pay $50 / week to the collections agency), 2 medical (totaling $1400), and 3 misc (totaling $1200, car insurance balance that I couldn't pay when I lost my job, ATT collections, and one other small collections account)). I am paying these off as quickly as I can, and will be paid off by end of July.

My weekly income is $1500. I get paid weekly.

I have opened up 3 different secured credit cards, each with a $400 limit, with 3 different institutions that report usage monthly. I do not carry these cards with me. They are locked in a safe at home, and the only recurring expenses on them are one house hold bill per (so 1 card only pays for my electric, another only pays my water utility, another only pays my cable). I did this as an attempt to have three payments made every month (on time) to help my payment history improve. I pay these 3 cards off in full every month, starting 2 months ago. I have no other credit cards, except the closed one in collections mentioned above.

I also pay student loans every month ($200) and a car payment (I pay over my due amount every month because I have a higher (16%) interest rate. I am paying $500 / month with a balance of ~$12,000 left).

I will be able to save ~$10,000 (aggressively saving because I need to get out of this rental situation) by January or February. 

The budget I have for the house I want to by is $150,000. I would like to spend less but that is my max. 

I would need to look into an FHA loan, probably, based on my current credit score and the hope that I can at least get it to 580 in 6 months, based on my ever improving credit history and the paying off of collection accounts. 

I know that FHA allows a 3.5% down, which if I buy a home at my max is $5,250. I am aware of PMI, and I am also aware of the 1.8% insurance premium on the loan due at closing. 1.8% of $150,000 (again, my absolute max I want to pay) is $2700.

I guess what I am looking for is critiques on my plan as well any suggestions on how to quickly improve credit that I may not already be doing. My renting situation currently has me throwing money away and I would rather own my own home. I know of all the other associated costs with owning home, including HOI and maintenance, but maintenance is one of the biggest reasons I want my own place anyway. It takes my landlord WAAAY to long to fix issues that I would love to just fix myself (but shouldn't have to while renting). 

Anyway, I know this is a lot thrown at you guys, so I am able to answer any questions that are had.

* My mother is over 65, and receives about $1,250 a month in social security.
* I own the house she lives in, I bought her car, I pay her insurance and property taxes, and I give her $150 a month.  Her bills shouldn't exceed $600-$800 a month, and she's taking in $1,400.
* She asked me for under $2,000 a few months ago, which I gave her, as I knew she had a friend visiting and didn't care too much if she used a portion of it for entertainment.  
* I have good reason to believe my mother plays the slots at the local casino, and plays them more than she admits she does.
* She asked for that same amount this time, telling me that she has a negative balance in the bank and she needs it to get everything in order and she had credit card bills run away from her.  At this point, I remembered a couple of comments my uncle (her brother) made, and also remembered that she had a fairly significant windfall disappear.

personalfinance,Does lower interest rate mean higher origination costs?,"I began house hunting a few months ago when mortgage rates were hovering around 4.2%. At the time I was given a sample closing cost/origination breakdown. The closing costs came out to $6017. Additionally, the bank was running a first time home buyers special where you could attend some online classes to knock 1/8th of a percent off the loan.

Fast forward to this weekend - I get into contract (Interest rates are down) and called in to get the ball rolling on my mortgage but the updated closing costs came to $7200. Suspicious. When I pressed the issue with the broker he essentially said that since interest rates are down they charge higher origination costs to make up for the lost interest! Am I crazy or is that ridiculous.

So the new loan with an interest rate of 3.875% cost $1200 more AND the first time homebuyers class was conveniently no longer offered (which would have brought the previous interest rate down to 4.125%. An exact 0.25% difference from my new loan.)

personalfinance,ELI5: Home refinancing subtleties and nuances,"Hey, r/personalfinance.  I feel woefully uneducated about refinancing's subtleties and nuances, so here it goes...

We are currently in year 8 of a 30 year loan on our rental house.  It's through Wells Fargo and at 5.25%.   Original amount of the loan was $235k.  We have just about $200k left on it.  We are very lucky because the house can conservatively sell for $375k right now, possibly over $400k.

A refinancing consultant at Wells Fargo recently approached us to refinance.  The terms he outlined are to drop the interest rate to 3.5% fixed and 15 years for almost exactly the same monthly payment.  The closing costs are going to be baked in the loan, so really the only thing we'd have to pony up is the appraisal.

I know that refinancing is basically issuing a new loan and paying off the old one.  Here's the questions I have -

1) What's Wells Fargo's incentive to do this?  They have us locked in for another 22 years at 5.25%.  Why would they give us a deal where they're earning less interest for seven years less?

2) We're thinking about taking out a home improvement loan for our primary house.  Would it make sense to just increase the refinanced portion taken out and use that money for home improvements?

3) Besides being under water, are there any risks to our built up equity in refinancing if the house value drops in the future?

What should I do?

I'm not drowning in bills or debts, but I also haven't been able to start an Emergency Fund yet. We've kind of been relying on a credit card with a decent rate that we could use in case of emergencies, and I know that's not the best choice. But it's been working.
Should I call one of these places offering 2.25%? Or go with my current lender and have the rait lowered over time?

personalfinance,Weighing a pension buyout,"Hi all, wanted to get PF's take on these initial numbers.  I recently changed jobs, and my former company has provided me paperwork regarding my benefits under their pension plan.  I am currently 41 (let's use estimated DOB as 06/01/1976), spouse is 38 (use est. DOB 06/01/1979).  Here are some of the numbers that I am currently have:

* Final average monthly compensation as of plan termination was $9,389.00 
* Years of service was 9.8110 
* Qualified Pension Plan Monthly Benefit if Paid at age 65 would be $1,145.62 (no COLA)
* Current lump sum value of $54,638.05 

Unfortunately I don't have all of the specific numbers related to survivor/certain period options as the current paperwork assumes I start taking pension benefits now and not at 65, so I'm going to be asking for those numbers.  In any case, there is a note that states:

* For this purpose, ""value"" was determined by using a 7% interest rate and the RPA 2000 Mortality Table projected for 25 years assuming a 60/40 male/female split along with combined employee and annuitant healthy white collar rates.  Value equals the estimated total dollar amount needed as of the pension start date to provide all of the benefits to both the retiree and/or survivor for their lifetimes, assuming that the money earns 7% annually. 

I was expecting they would offer a lump sum buyout with a rate closer to current interest rates, and nothing like 7%.  My rough calculations agree with the above note.  With these numbers, I don't think it makes sense to take the buyout as a direct IRA rollover at this time, but I thought I would as PF for your thoughts.  Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,[Student Loans] Need advice on repayment strategy,"Good evening all! I have recently decided to take a much more active mindset with regards to paying off my student debt. I'm going to cut to the chase. 

**The damage**: I have 61k in student loan debt from undergrad and graduate school. It is primarily concentrated into 2 ""large"" loans (with equally large interest rates), a ""medium"" loan, and then 5 ""small"" loans. They can be broken down into:  

Loan 1: 22k, 10% variable  
Loan 2: 20k, 10% variable  
Loan 3: 8k, 8.6% fixed  
Loan 4: 1k, 2.7% fixed  
Loan 5: 1.3k, 6.8% fixed  
Loan 6/7/8: 2.5k each at 6%

I have looked at snowballing/avalanche. I have tried crunching numbers, and have wracked my brain on the best way to attack this.

We do not have a mortgage with Royal Bank.  I also don't think our actual mortgage provider sold our loan.  This looks like some sort of fraud, but I can't tell if it's a phishing letter or identity theft.  Can someone help?  
  
The bill indicates a loan balance similar to our actual balance, except off by about 10%.  It's a similar, but not exactly the same, interest rate as our existing loan.  The statement lists both my and my wife's names, except they are not our full legal names as appear on our real mortgage.
  
I just called my actual mortgage provider's service number and verified that we still have a due date and a correct balance, so I don't think our loan was sold (and if it was, where did the missing 10% of our balance go?).  
  
My wife and I just pulled our credit reports - each from two sites that together hit all three - and nothing from RB appears on them.  They all still show our current, correct mortgage.  
  
So everything above just makes this seem like a phishing letter, trying to get us to make a fake payment somewhere.  Except this is the part I don't understand, because the bank's address on the bill is correct.  The phone numbers and web site listed also seem to be correct, or at least redirect to the correct site.  So how does this scam work?  Is the account number that of a scammer who gets my payment?  Or did someone actually scam RB out of the money somehow without it hitting my credit and get a second mortgage on my house?

Bitcoin,James Rickards: The Fed Is Going To Cause Recession and Bitcoin,"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-06-26/james-rickards-fed-going-cause-recession

Mr. Rickards: Dollars, euros, yuan, gold, and bitcoin are five different kinds of money, but they’re not investments. They’re money. If I buy stock in a company, I can look at management, I can look at earnings, I can look at a whole bunch of things to come up with an evaluation. That’s an investment.

But bitcoin is not an asset class. It’s not an investment. It’s just money. If I buy bitcoin, I’m swapping one kind of money for another.

So when you see bitcoin go from $1,000 to $2,000 or $3,000, what’s happening? If one bitcoin is my unit of measurement, then the dollar is going down. So one possibility is that people are losing confidence in the dollar.

Is there any other evidence for that? If people are losing confidence in the dollar, it would be reflected in a lot of places. Gold would be going up. Oil would be going up. Real estate would be going up.

Except that what we have is bitcoin going up and everything else not. Gold’s up a little, but you know all these things go up a little bit, not by a lot. Bitcoin’s the only one that’s going up a lot. So that tells you empirically that this is not a generalized loss of confidence in the dollar or the euro and other currencies. I think that will come, but we’re not there yet.

So if that’s not the explanation, what is? One is the greater fool theory, which is, “I’ll pay $2,000 for bitcoin because I think there’s some sucker who will pay me $3,000.” And that guy says, “Well, I’ll pay $3,000 for a bitcoin because of some sucker that will pay me $4,000.” That’s called the greater fool theory.

That works until it doesn’t. There comes a time when you’re the sucker—as the old joke goes, if you’re in a poker game and you don’t know who the sucker is, you’re the sucker.

There is no evidence that there’s a general collapse in the dollar. I expect that will happen for other reasons at a different time, but not yet. Bitcoin looks like a bubble.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Do you think bitcoin goes up or down in value during a worldwide recession?,"I'm torn on this and find both arguments compelling:

A: Increase in value due to bitcoin acting as a safe haven asset similar to gold. Bitcoin can't be debased (protecting against central banks printing money to inflate out of the problems) and it can't be seized in the same way that assets can be in banks (Cyprus depositor hair cut for example)

B: Decrease in value due to the reversal of the worldwide run up in asset prices. Equities, bonds and many many other assets have absolutely soared in value since the last recession due to rock bottom interest rates and multiple rounds of QE; bitcoin has probably benefited from this. If there is a contraction in asset valuations worldwide due to a recession, bitcoin may not be immune - if suddenly you're losing a lot of money in other assets do you really want to hold on to your volatile crypto?

personalfinance,Can an employment contract be used when calculating income for a mortgage?,"I’m currently trying to plan moving next spring (spring ’18) which will involve selling our current house and buying what we would like to be our forever home. My question revolves around what can be considered income and how debt is considered.

My salary is $75k and my wife’s is currently about $58k, she is has just started her final year of residency (Family Medicine doctor). She has about $250k in student loan debt (med school is expensive) all of which are federal loans and are all in forbearance while she’s still in residency. I owe $122k on my current mortgage (purchased prior to meeting my wife). Based on similar houses sold in my neighborhood I can expect to sell my house for $235k to $250k. I'm using $100k as expected proceeds from the sale. Outside of my wife’s student loans and my mortgage we don’t have any other significant debt (~$1k CC paid off completely each month representing various bills, food, etc). We have about $60k saved up right now (savings/checking accounts).

Sometime this fall my wife will be negotiating and signing an employment contract for probably around $150k with a start date in August ’18 (after we plan to buy the house) which will roughly coincide with her loans coming out of forbearance for a $2,700/mo hit.

Will lending institutions consider the contract for future income when calculating how much they’re willing to lend us? 

When calculating the debt to income ratio will they use A) $133k ($75k+$58k) income $0 debt (forbearance) B) $133k income, $2,700/mo debt or C) $225k ($75k+$150) income, $2,700/mo debt?

With node validators which come online NOT in banking community to be labelled/categorized via trust scoring, and incentived on a per transaction basis by network (aka a person can add fuel to their transaction to incentive validator nodes which are more trusted).

Fiat conversion window much larger (longer time period).

""If you can't beat em join em"" mentality imposed by Government and Central banks.  With Bitcoin going to $100k by 2026 and $1M by 2031, FedCoin and Phoenix implementation allows Issuers to become primary Nation and CB holders of Bitcoin and Litecoin - pairing with holdings of China.  Allowing for $22 trillion dollar market cap of Bitcoin, alone, to obfuscate large portions of fiat national debts of holding nations - not to mention other currencies. (Which is why Japan has embraced crypto - allow citizens to hold it and later confiscate). Imposed Regulation will not ban such crypto currencies but gold backed security of Phoenix will provide comfort for many to convert.

personalfinance,ROI on Eliminating PMI,"Hey PF!

I am wondering if there is an equation to use to determine the return on investment for paying a lump sum towards my mortgage principal in an effort to eliminate PMI to gauge that vs. other investment options. For example, let's assume the following:

* If I stick to the current payment schedule, PMI drops in 5 years.
* PMI = $85 / month
* $25,000 is needed to pay towards principal to eliminate PMI
* Mortgage interest rate = 4.125%

By putting that $25k towards principal has a rate of return of 4.125% and over 5 years that would save me $5600 in interest. I'd also be eliminating a total of $5100 in PMI payments.

So, my question what is my effective ""interest rate"" on this investment? Using an ROI calculator I found online and treating this as if this were a 5 year investment I get 7.38%. Is this correct? Because if true, it makes this a much better investment than anything else I can do with that money (plus it is ""guaranteed"").",finance

There is a fairly strong chance that I will be moving from Houston to San Francisco for work. I'm in the tech industry, and this job would be based out of the Palo Alto area. I'm looking at a few cost of living adjustment calculators online and most are in the neighborhood of about +60% from Houston to San Francisco. 

I'm running through a few simulations and I'm seeing about a 35% ($85k to $120k) increase to be the break-even in terms of free cash I would have. I currently own property down here, but I ran a simulation based on the following adjustments since I would be renting over there:

-one bedroom apartment cost adjustment relative to Houston (+$1,000 per month, $1,500 vs $2,500)

-increased taxes for state income tax and federal income tax

-Reduced spend on property tax, maintenance and mortgage payments since I would no longer be owning property. 

-increased spend for general expenses such as food, insurance, entertainment and such as +20% across the board in SF.

Is there anything I am missing here that will help with cost? I am not sure what the offer would be but if they come with +$20k, this isn't something for consideration unless I am drastically missing something in my analysis. Even assuming I get +$35K based on the simulation above, about half of that is just going to taxes before housing is even considered. If anyone here has moved from Texas to California for work, your opinions and experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"Probably needing surgery, low-income, no insurance","Hello. I would appreciate any advice or input on my situation. Recently my doctor has told me they think I have a cyst in my sinuses. 

I don't think there is any treatment for these cysts other than removal surgery. It was hard to find any cost estimates but one person said their's cost $30,000. 

I have no insurance and Medicaid does not cover non-disabled adults in my state. I think I make around $13,000 a year, and am part-time so I don't qualify for insurance through my work. 

I have considered as an option trying to move to a different employer where I could get full-time, but since the pay would be low there ($10 an hour) I still don't know that I could afford insurance.

For instance one of my roommate's insurance offered through their work has a $3000 deductible, and the premiums are a little less than $200 a month. And if I'm understanding correctly, there is copays and things to pay even after that. That seems like it would be a huge chunk of my income (at least $5000 a year out of a $19,000 income? That seems insane to me...) but  I guess after insurance and medical spending I would essentially be taking home the same money I do now. So technically feasible. 

The problem there is I don't drive/have a car so I could only do that if I could find someone to carpool with to get there. I am doubtful whether I can physically do the work either since I have other health problems (like RSI, asthma, anxiety). 

The other option I am considering is trying to find a state that includes working low-income adults in its Medicaid coverage. Because most of those states have a higher cost of living, I had picked out Kentucky (rather low CoL it seems) as the one. But now it seems like federally they're going to be changing/reducing Medicaid funding or something? 

So I'm not sure if I should aim for a state that has always covered low-income adults in its Medicaid program (Does anyone know of any? I thought perhaps Illinois might be one) or if it's going to affect *all* the states' Medicaid programs? 

I don't want to quit my job and relocate only to be in the same boat...

I am totally open to other options if anyone knows of any. If there's a charity that helps with these kinds of things or a great medical savings account or something. Thank you for reading. 

Edit: I have to go to work now but I really appreciate all the advice, it's been very helpful! It didn't even occur to me before that I am now eligible for the ACA subsidies, and I also appreciate the info on facilities that do reduced payment and billing. Thank you so much everyone!",finance
personalfinance,"How this 30 year old paid off $48,000 student loans in 2 years and a half","Yesterday, I paid off my loans. I did it, I am finally debt free.  I am super excited!  I used my travel and emergency savings to pay off the debt.  My vacation in Spain is now postponed until next year.  It sucks that I can’t travel this year but at least I get to save up.  I paid off $48,000 of student loan debt in 2 years and a half.  Paying this debt wasn’t easy at all.  First, I want to thank my mother and my brother for encouraging me to continue to make large payments.

Three years ago, I hated my life.  I drove 5.5 hours to commute to work because I couldn’t afford to move closer. I started paying my student loans at a salary of 38k and lived at my mother’s house. I wished I could’ve lived on my own but I couldn’t afford it.  Not with a 38k salary in California.  I made the decision to commute and pay rent at my mother’s house.  I did this for 2 years.  I used a lot of coupons, meal prep on weekends and exercised every day including weekends to avoid spending money.  Back then, I used to exercise at the Gold’s Gym and paid $40 dollars per month. It was worth it because they have a sauna, Jacuzzi, swimming pool, weights, and a cardio theater room.  There was no need for me to spend money on weekends.  The gym helped me worry less about my student loans too.  A year later, my knees began to hurt as soon as I got home from the long commute.  The daily visit at the gym was highly needed.  I cried every day while driving back home because my entire body felt pain.  I was hungry and tired from waking up every day at 4 am to avoid traffic and arrived home after 7 pm.  I refused to stop during my commute because traffic in the 405 and 10 Fwy was horrible.  I was at the gym by 8:15 pm and got home at 10:30 pm. This was my life and I accepted it.  My mother, stepfather, brother, and boyfriend kept telling me to keep looking.  Why?  They noticed I got too comfortable. 

Sometimes you need to stop worrying and have faith to get to the place you ultimately want to be. Patience for me was very hard especially when I saw myself going nowhere.  Seeing my friends buying a car, going on vacations, eating out at fancy restaurants, buying expensive makeups, Michael Kors handbags, new clothes, jewelry, a new car, getting into a relationship, marriage, having children,  buying a house was the things I too wanted to have.  I refused to give up and didn’t want to continue to live the way I was living.  I wanted to have these things but I didn’t want to be in so much debt.  So I sucked it up and kept making large payments. 

A year later, something terrible happened to me on my previous job at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Instead of getting a promotion and retro pay, I somehow ended up owing the government 3.5K debt.  I refused to pay for a mistake the Payroll Department team created but I was forced to pay it all.  The money was taken out of my paycheck by almost at 40%.  I got so angry and wish to no longer be comfortable.  So I kept my head high and updated my resume.  I kept looking and waited for the precise moment to submit my resume and transfer.  I kept waiting and waiting. Why? Because I was searching for a career, not just any job. It was a matter of when and how long it would take.  While I waited and researched all the job announcements posted on USA Jobs, I took the opportunity to perfect my federal resume.  

Nine months later, I saw an opportunity and got hired at NASA.  This was a rare opportunity and my mother and brother convinced me to accept it.  There was a problem, I needed to relocate and had less than 4 weeks to find a place to live.  It was my brother who helped me find a 2 bedroom apartment for less than 600 dollars.  I got lucky!  Extremely lucky!  A few months later, I decided to rent the 2nd bedroom for six months to a student which helped me add more payments towards my debt. 

Currently, I have no cable, no brand makeup, have less than 6 pairs of shoes, no car payment, and no credit card debt.  I no longer pay for a gym membership. I exercise at the Air Force gym for free. This helps me pay for the internet service.  In fact, I have no laptop.  Mine failed in 2014.  My brother gave his old computer but it doesn’t work.  I’ve been blogging using my boyfriend’s laptop while he is completing his technical school at the Air Force.  It’s true that I’ve been living frugally.  To live frugally, have patience, and faith has prepared me for success and ultimately live debt free.  

Next goal is to continue blogging and saving up. It's going to be a good year next year.",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loan monthly payments are so heavy, am I doing something wrong?","I recently moved out of my parents home because my relationship with my father was incredibly toxic and abusive. I did a lot of research on affordable cities and moved to Buffalo Ny as I was able to find rent there for 400$ a month.

I got a job as quickly as I could and currently have about 5,000$ in savings. I'm working full time as a cook, making 10.50$ an hour plus overtime when it's available, I work between 39-45 hours a week, my employers won't let me take more than that.

My problem is my grace period on my student loans is approaching fast, I have a wells fargo loan for 5k, federal loans, and sallie mae loans.

My sallie mae loans come around as 900$ a month, I can probably lower that a bit if I opt into their graduated repayment loan plan where they only charge interest for a year but no principal. That should get me down to 600-700$ a month.

The problem is my federal loan appears to be 574$ a month, my monthly student loan payment is floating between 1100$ to 1500$ a month, I only make 1600$ a month at best, if I don't buy any food.

I don't have a car, and in a month I won't have health insurance. (I'll be taken off my parents plan). I want to get a job in my degree but It's so difficult to seek better jobs or build a portfolio when you only have one day off a week from work.

I'm starting to get all worked up about this situation and my emotions are getting the better of me with the impending doom. I don't know what to do.

**Edit: for those inquiring about total debt, i'm sorry I forgot to factor that. My sallie mae loans are around 64,000, my federal loans between 22,000-25,000, and a single wells fargo loan for 5,000.

Would consolidating the sallie mae with wells fargo help? **",finance
personalfinance,IRA Contribution Tax Question - Married Filing Separately,"Like the title states, my wife and I file our taxes separately because she's on an income-based student loan repayment plan (Fedloan forgiveness, 7 years left), and this saves us quite a bit of money monthly. We'd also like to make contributions to an IRA every year, but are running into the problem where we both make over the 10K MAGI (and thus don't qualify for a deductible contribution). We would still like the tax-advantaged growth of an IRA account, though.

So my question is: can we each make the $5500 IRA contribution to a Traditional IRA, knowing that this money will still count towards our AGI for this year (thus we've paid tax on this money). Then, can we re-characterize these funds as Roth IRA funds, but avoid a taxable event because these funds were non-deductible when originally put in the Traditional IRA?

It seems like we shouldn't be able to do this, because it's essentially like we're both making Roth IRA contributions for this year (which we definitely don't qualify for), but I can't find anything anywhere that says I can't do this. Can anyone poke holes in this argument for me before I go ahead and try it?

gaming,I ordered a Razer ManO'War through Google Express... Here's my terrible experience. (x-post from r/razer),"So I've been looking to pick up a wireless Razer ManO'War recently. When I saw a deal pop up with a coupon for Google Express, I figured I'd give the service a try and order my ManO'War through Google Express (fulfilled via Fry's Electronics). With the 25% off coupon capped at a $30 maximum discount, I was able to order the headset for $139.59 after tax and free shipping. Not a bad deal for a $159.99 headset. Five days after placing my order, FedEx dropped off my ""new"" headset. That's where things went south.

The Google Express packaging was okay, but not exactly impressive. There was a single sheet of small bubble wrap in the box along with some crumpled brown paper for padding. Not exactly the most secure packaging, but at least the Razer box wasn't free to bounce around. Upon taking the ManO'War box out of the Google Express shipping box, it was clear that there was no damage during shipping. There was no sign of damage or mishandling. However, when I went to open the Razer packaging, I found that wasn't sealed. This was very odd, as the item was supposed to be a brand new, sealed item. I didn't think much of it at the time and continued with my unboxing.

I took the headset out of the Razer packaging and at first glance, it looked fine. I found it a little odd that it was missing the plastic that you usually enjoy peeling off of new electronics, but again I didn't give it much thought. I've done a lot of research on the headset and was pretty excited to try it out. I placed it on my head, and while it felt comfortable, something felt off about the fit. I took it off to look at the head strap and found that the top pad was broken. Both plastic tabs that hold the pad in place in the headband were completely broken on the one side. When I looked closer, you can clearly see that someone tried to glue the broken plastic tabs. It was clear to me at this point that this item was an open box return. 

I was pretty disappointed, but I figured, ""Hey, this is Google. They'll make this right."" So I got on the phone with Google Express support and told them about the issue with my order. The support representative checked my order and agreed that I should have received a brand new, sealed item. He said that this was probably just poor judgment on the part of the Google Express shopping team that goes out and purchases the item before they ship it. 

This is where it gets really bad. I was told that Google Express would send me a prepaid return shipping label. However, due to the ""high cost"" of this item, they would need to have their returns team evaluate the item when it arrives back at their facility. The team would then evaluate the condition of the item against Fry's return policies and decide whether or not they can refund my money. IF they determine it qualifies for a return, they'll refund my purchase and coupon. At that point, I can reorder the headset if it's available. I voiced my frustrations, but the support rep could only sympathize with my situation. 

I honestly have no idea what to expect from the returns team. Either Google Express purchased an open box item and charged me for a new item and pocketed the difference, or Fry's sold the item as a new item while it was actually opened and returned. I find the latter scenario more likely. If that's the case, I'm going to be at the mercy of Fry's and whether or not they believe the story by the Google Express team returning the item. And therein lies the problem with Google Express. This might not be their fault. But as the service provider, you'd expect they'd help protect their customer. 

So here I am now, 5 days after my order date. I have to ship my headset back to Google Express and wait for a decision on the refund. Then, as long as they decide that they can return the item to Fry's, I'll get a refund and can go through the whole purchase process again and hope that the same or similar mistake isn't made again. If you figure 5 days for the next order, plus the return shipping time on this order, plus however long it takes for the returns team to make a decision... I'm probably looking at least another week until I can receive the headset I tried to order last week. Thanks Google ""Express"" for a speedy process. Thanks for putting the customer's interests first. What a joke.

I'll be fighting for my refund, but I won't be purchasing through Google Express again. I'll pay the extra $30 to buy it through Amazon Prime or at a local Best Buy. I'll also be cancelling the trial for Google Express. Clearly they're not ready to compete with other shopping services. Accidents happen. Shipping the incorrect item happens. But treating customers like this during the return process because of your own mistakes or the mistakes of your participating stores? That's just unacceptable.

Here are some images to show you exactly what the issue is:  http://imgur.com/a/XfuGg 

TL;DR: Ordered $140 ""brand new"" Razer ManO'War from Google Express. Received a broken, open-box item. Google Express says ship it back and ""maybe"" they'll refund me.",technology

personalfinance,"Massive amounts of student loan debt (US). I technically make more money by not working, is that right?","Hi everyone. Throwaway account obviously. My problem is a pretty simple one. I borrowed money to go to college (Economics) and graduate school (Law, JD). Both were decent private schools. Not Ivy League but well regarded regional schools. The kind you root for during the NCAA tournament.

After I got out of law school. I worked for a family friend who had his own firm in a major city. The economy was in the dumps and no big law firms were hiring. Lo and behold, this family friend was tight on cash and rarely paid me and when he did he didn't 1099 me or withhold taxes. I quit that job, got married, and moved out of the region where I went to college, grad school, and previously practiced law. 

Now I live in a region I have no connection to. I have not been able to get an interview let alone a job in any profession. Everyone around here went to one of the two major universities in the area or the local state schools. My wife (PhD) makes good money at a large fortune 500. We file our taxes separately and keep separate accounts. Her income is enough to live on. We actually just bought a house. I am not on the mortgage.

With my student loans I owe in the low to mid 6 figures. The monthly payment on my loans, if I wanted to pay them off, would be well higher than my cash take home pay from any job I could reasonably get. Even the interest alone would eat up half my cash take home pay. I am currently on the income contingent repayment plan which means my student loan payment is currently 0. If I was on a regular payment plan it would be over 3k. 

My question, finally, is this: Does it make financial sense to simply not work and let the feds pay off my student loans for me? It seems to me that the government is giving me 3k a month in cash essentially. That is more than I could make at my age and education level in the area where I live.

I've just started working at a new job and my compensation is substantially higher than it was at my last job.

Compensation

That being said, my compensation is a bit complicated. I'm doing rotating shifts of days and afternoons at $18.66/hr. Afternoons have a 5% premium. Vacation pay is 4% of gross earnings (note: I'm not exactly sure what gross earnings is defined as - just my basic Hours Worked * Hourly Rate, right?). Attendance bonus is $0.45/h for each week *and* $0.43/h for each month of perfect attendance.

Hours and OT


Hours are 40/wk. I haven't been there long but I've already done some overtime and I estimate it at 5h/wk @ 1.5 times pay.

I'm not sure if my calculations are right but I am looking at just over $44000 yearly (before tax, after EI and CPP, which puts me in the 15% federal tax bracket. My take home earnings should be $37500. After my car, insurance, and rent: $29000. Keep in mind that this depends on my OT hours and having perfect attendance - it isn't a best-case scenario but I think it is a reasonable estimate of the hours I am going to be working.

Assuming this number is accurate (I wouldn't mind a second set of eyes), how should I go about dividing my income into emergency savings, investments, chunking off debt, and leisure savings? In addition, what can I do to ensure that I don't break into the 20.5% tax bracket since I am so close to it?

stocks,Thoughts about Put options on FANG stocks?,"Two weeks ago I bought put options in Netflix that expire early 2018. My reasoning was based on US tech stocks reaching all-time highs at the same time the FED was pulling out support (i.e. increasing interest rates and planning on unwinding the balance sheet, both potentially massive deflationary triggers).


Why Netflix specifically?


- Rate of growth in subscriber base is slowing (we'll see by how much when the Q2 earnings report comes out). This is even accounting for the international expansion efforts underway. Not to even get into the whole account sharing issue across households, which will ultimately exacerbate the company's growth issues creating an illusion of more market share to capture. The company could implement a ""one account per household"" terms of service clause, but that will ultimately hurt the company's PR and/or stock price.


- Competition is increasing substantially - Amazon, Apple, HBO, etc. The competitors are well positioned in the tech distribution market with much more cash and stability than Netflix, so it begs the question: can Netflix continue to hold its competitive edge for the next 5-10 years or so without lowering its price and while turning a profit, which is proving to be very difficult given the negative cash flow its had over the past couple years.


- Volatility [edit -&gt; VIX specifically] is historical lower than it has ever been. Statistically, low volatility time periods are followed by volatility increases.


- It's massively overvalued at current price (P/E ~200). Generating ~0.75 per share would take a long time to justify P/E ~200. It seems that the high valuation is coming from the future growth potential of the company, which is a questionable assumption.


- It's burning incredible amounts of cash on expansion and original content. The development of original content is very costly and time consuming and it's a big risk (e.g. low viewership = wasted investment, and they've had several of these in the past year alone.). So, it's long term debt profile is increasing faster than revenue growth.


- They have had tremendous growth over the last three years with no major draw downs. This was arguably caused by loose monetary policy from the FED and the low volatility environment as a result. This monetary support is being pulled away via interest rate increases and an unwinding of the FEDs balance sheet. This support removal is coming at a time when the economic environment is weakening.


Rebuttal? I'm really just trying to make sense of this. I welcome any feedback and debate.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bubble for sale,"Hi,

I've been discussing with some friends lately about cryptocurrencies. FYI, I'm a hodler and so far was able to make quite a nice profit. My friend, who is very sceptic about the crypto market, sent me today an article that was published in a European newspaper. For those not willing to read the entire article below, the key points are: 

* crypto does not meet the minimum requirements to be used as a currency: crypto does not have an intrinsic value (e.g. not linked to gold) and crypto has no credible central instance that is willing to accept it as a payment vehicle
* no central entity can take measures to keep it stable
* there's an infinite amount of equilibrium prices
* there is a lot of value in the blockchain technology, however it's a free technology =&gt; who would pay for something that is free
* there will be crypto currencies in the future, but entirely due to a central instance issuing them

Note: this does not represent my view or opinion at all, but I found it sometimes difficult to disprove or counter some of the arguments the author is making. Therefor I though it was nice to collect feedback from the 1000s of Redditors on this subreddit. What do you think about the article.

**Soap bubble for sale. Bitcoin price to match**

A colleague who recently stayed in Greece had a conversation with a local taxi driver. The driver advised him to invest in ""those bit coins"" because that is guaranteed profitable. In 2009, the virtual currency that you can trade online is less than one euro. Meanwhile, the price has risen to more than 2,600 euros. Count your profit. In this paper, the cryptomunt also became increasingly popular with us as a savings or investment instrument, and the question is whether there is another chance for interested buyers to pick up (DS 24 June). Anyone who loves it may be worn, but it is absurd to consider bitcoins as an investment or savings product.

Based on basic valuation principles, the intrinsic value and realistic price of an investment is equal to all (discounted) future profits that will generate the underlying asset. For a share, this is, for example, the profit benefits of the company, for a real estate investment, this is the rental income after cost. Those who pay less for an investment than the final profit benefits are doing a good job. Whoever pays more breaks his pants.

The problem is that bitcoins can not generate future profits. The blockchain technology that is the basis of bitcoins is undoubtedly revolutionary. She offers numerous opportunities that can change the worldview, such as contracts closing and registering online without the help of a notary or legislator. But this technology is essentially a computer code that you can find on the Internet for free or create it yourself if you want to use them. Why would anyone ever pay a fortune for something that is available free of charge? In the meanwhile, for example, more than 700 alternate crypto points are circulating. The intrinsic value of a bitcoin that you hold in a digital portfolio is therefore nil.

It is absurd to consider bitcoins as an investment or savings product

Some argue that the bitcoin's value is derived from the fact that it will eventually replace the euro as a means of exchange and unit of account for economic transactions. Digital money is efficient and cost-effective because we do not need classic coins and banknotes and banks become superfluous to perform the transactions. In that case, everyone has to purchase bitcoins.

However, the bitcoin does not meet the minimum requirements to be used as exchange and calculation unit. For this purpose, the currency must either have an intrinsic value (for example, gold pieces), or there must be a credible entity which will always accept the currency as a means of payment and make every effort to keep the currency's market value (purchasing power) stable or relatively stable Evolves (eg 2 percent inflation per year). With the euro, the government obliges everyone to pay taxes in euros and the ECB, which increases or decreases interest rates if prices rise or fall too much.

I'll save you the technical details, but with the bitcoin there is no mechanism that creates a stable market value and the buying power of the currency. There are infinite many possible equilibrium prices for the bitcoin, including scenarios with hyperinflation and deflation. The headsteps of its course on bitcoin markets illustrate this problem. It is impossible to paste a value.

This does not matter that we will ever pay with digital coins. The ECB and other central banks have also noted the numerous benefits and potential of blockchain technology for transactions in the meantime and are fully researching how to put them into practice and what their consequences would be. Only will be the digital euros issued by the ECB, and not bitcoins or other existing crypto coins. A digital euro is then worth the same as a classic euro, and the stock is off.

The bitcoin explosion explosion has all the features of a pyramid game that has spread throughout the world. Buyers are seduced by groundbreaking technology, but ignore the economic fundamentals. As long as buyers enter, the party will last. Early or late, the price of an investment always evolves towards the net asset value. It's hard to predict when this will be accurate, but one day the bitcoin rate will be less than the 0.000000000000 clenbuterol found in Alberto Contador's blood at that time.",cryptocurrency

My question is this: 10% is insane. If I make diligent payments on my credit card and my $10,000 loan, can I expect a better interest rate for next year's loan? 

Thanks so much for the advice.",finance
stocks,Where are the contrarians in this sub?,"It seems like everyone is drinking the Kool-aid. Stocks, based on P/E ratios are rivaling all time highs, while the FED is removing support in the form of interest rate increases (especially over the last 6 months) and is in preparations to unwind the balance sheet.

The VIX is historically low, which is helping to fuel these high evaluations, notably US tech stocks. It seems eerily similar to the later 90s and early 2000s tech bubble.

It really seems like everyone is all-in on the BTFD trade strategy. I'm betting with put options that this will end very very badly for people and soon (put options expire early next year).

Yellen - ""We have been in an economy with low interest rates for some time, and that influences asset prices... Asset valuations are somewhat rich by traditional valuations like price-earnings ratios... Some asset valuations look high. There is no certainty about that.''

Williams - ""I am somewhat concerned about the complacency in the market. If you look at these measures of uncertainty, like the VIX measure, or other indicators, there seems to be a priced-to-perfection attitude out there... The stock market still seems to be running very much on fumes...""

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"Hello all, so I currently have a little over $133,000 in student loan debt. Only problem is that ~$71,000 is directly in my name, which has already been refinanced once. The remaining balance is in my mother's name, under a fed parent plus loan. However, I'm paying for both.

My question is, would it be smart to just leave the two loans separate, and forego the tax benefits I could claim, and the fed benefits that come with the loan. Or should I refinance my mother's loans into my name?

Right now I'm paying $1210/month. I'm just afraid that if I refinance it'll make the payments even higher, since the fed loan is already on a 20-25 year payment plan.",finance

The NSLSC doesn't make it easy to choose this option, you have to call them and have them create a new repayment agreement.

I may not be considering everything but I want to explain my situation and ask for opions.

Current Situation:
30yo, income $60k, $32k federal student loan, $7k remaining on car loan, no credit card debt.

I have a 401k from a previous employer at about $20k and a new 401k with current employer at about $1k. However new employer does not match.

I would like to get into a Roth but not pay all taxes up front, ideally at all. I know I can slowly roll it in over years to avoid a large hit from previous $401k, but this still seems less than ideal.

Questions:
Is a Roth much more beneficial than traditional? This has been the main recommendation.
What should I do with current 401k? Currently investing with John Hancock.
Are there any investment companies that might be best for my situation?

personalfinance,"Received a judgment from former state's department of revenue claiming I owe unpaid taxes and they have a judgment. I know I paid and they've offered no proof, but I also lack some documentation. What are my options? (Details inside)","I already posted this at /r/legaladvice, but thought I'd also cross-post here. Long time lurker, first time poster and all that. I'm probably going to need a lawyer here, but I'm looking for info where I can get it. Please see the edits as well. I found at least partially supporting W-2 information, but I don't actually have my local returns for the years in question.

------

In March of 2011 I moved from Delaware to Colorado. I've always paid my taxes (federal and state), but some supporting information was lost in the move. In 2012 I was contacted by a company called Progressive Financial Services claiming I owed $100.88 to the Delaware department of Revenue. I contacted the department of revenue, confirmed the debt (they stated it was for unpaid taxes for the prior year), and paid it through the Revenue department. I provided proof to Progressive and all seemed fine... until 2014.

In 2014 suddenly Progressive Financial Services contacted me again to claim I owed $148.49 to the Delaware department of revenue. This wasn't adding up for me, as it had been two years since the last notice, and I know I paid my taxes for everything. The claim was that this was for unpaid taxes from 2009 and 2011. This is bunk, but unfortunately my documentation for those years went up in smoke when my laptop's hard drive died. The only document I have backed up from then is a W2 for 2011, where I earned $10,000 in Delaware that year, and paid $304 in state taxes. Not sure if that info helps. (EDIT - I put that W2 info into an online tax calculator for 2011 and it indicated I would be due a refund from the look of it, so I'm at a bit of a loss there).

Given my lack of info, but also their lack of supporting documentation, I requested validation of the debt via written, certified letter. I included a bank statement of the previous payment. I heard nothing back for 30 days. After 60 days I contacted them, confirmed they had no documentation and they had removed any reporting of the debt from my credit reports. I've heard nothing since and assumed it was resolved and just a clerical error or something, until today.

Today I received a certified letter from the Delaware department of revenue stating they contacted me on 5/17/2017 (they didn't, I've received no mail and no calls) about a debt of $198 for unpaid taxes in 2009 and 2011, and that they now have a judgment against me with the superior court for the amount due to my failure to respond. They are also demanding an additional$31.25 to satisfy  the Judgment of Record. The only evidence of the debt provided was dates (12/31/09, 12/31/11) and amounts as so:

TPE | TAX | PENALTY | INTEREST | TOTAL
- | - | - | - | - |
12/31/09 | 89.00 | 30.26 | 54.65 | 173.91
12/31/11 | 15.00 | 3.75 | 6.31 | 25.06
 | 104.00 | 34.01 | 60.96 | 198.97

And that's it. Is this enough for them to get the judgment? The debt hasn't been validated, in the past attempts to contact and get info from the revenue dept were fruitless, and all I want is actual proof that this is owed. As noted above, I filed all of those years and paid my taxes, but I'm frustrated by missing documentation. I also find it extremely odd that they charged me for previous year, then went radio silent for two years before sending a third party to collect for the abutting years. Like, wouldn't they have already known when they requested the debt for 2010 that I hadn't paid 2009 if that was the case? Why come after me for it later or not include it in what was owed? This is all seeming shady to me but I feel like I don't have any recourse since it's a state entity. What are my options here, and how do I request or demand proof and evidence of this debt? It's been off my credit report now for over three years.

Technically I could just pay and be done with it, but since I've done that once assuming it was resolved and only to have them hound me further, I'm afraid that if I did pay, they'd suddenly find some reason I didn't pay taxes in 2007 or 2008 or some other bullshit. I want this done with permanently and it's very frustrating.

-----

Edit 2 - I found a hard copy of my W2 from 2010 as well, indicating I earned ~$41,000 and paid $2542 in Social Security tax, $595 in medicare withheld, and $1198 in State income tax. I'm not sure how this is coming up with me short on the state tax, but hopefully it helps. Just trying to provide all the info I can find.

----

Edit 3 - And I found a partial W2 from 2009. Apparently I worked multiple jobs that year, as the Wages were only $7132. State taxes for that were $258, and $89 in local tax (Wilmington). So far I haven't found any others from 2009.

I am a 29 year old who graduated law school last year. I am currently $108k in debt but accepted my first ""big girl"" job at $74k with a potential 10% bonus based on company performance. I will be starting mid- July, but I've been pouring over the numbers tying to figure it all out. 

I want to know if I should refinance. I really really want to be student debt free, but I struggle with also wanting to have a life. 

Monthly expenses (fixed):

Student loans: $1300 (for 9 more years)
401k/IRA: $260
Health insurance: $120
Gas: $100
Gym: $20
Additional medical expenses and prescriptions: $160

$1960 total 

Estimated pay after federal and state taxes: $4340

Extra: $2380

Now, my question is- I have looked at some options to refinance my student debt and I found that I could probably get approved for 4% interest for $2k (variable) a month for 5 years. 

I plan to throw all my money at my personal debts (I owe family members money and have a car insurance lump payment coming up- total is about $3k) while paying the minimum $1300 while I wait to work for a bit before deciding on submitting an application to refinance. After I pay the $3k I want to throw all my extra money towards my loans as well. I also plan to put my bonus towards this debt as well, unless I have an unexpected expense like a car loan or something down the line. 

My TL/DR: would it be stupid of me to pay the $2000k a month and refinance if I hope to get a cheap place and live away from my parents within a year or two? That would leave me $1680 a month for electricity, rent, food, the works for an apartment on my own. Cheapest I know of in the area is about $600/mo. Keep in mind that I live in the North east and I have 3 nieces and one nephew so my superfluous expenses can start to add up a bit. 

I also have an 11 year old car but only 80k miles on it. It's ugly AF but it's good on mileage and has cheap repairs. It may be an expense down the line.

personalfinance,Using over half of savings to pay off student debt/ debt fatigue,"I've been reading personal finance articles for about two years now but I decided to make a post to ask for some direction. I have a general idea of what is safe and what is the right thing to do, but I would also like some opinions.  

Two years ago I moved to a new city with $54,000 of student debt. I made the move with a plan to pay off my debt within three years and also have a decent savings account. Through extreme budgeting, reading PF, working six days a week and working double shifts I've managed to pay off my $35,000 student line of credit in full in a year and a half as well as about $7,400 of my student loan. 

I have a $10,000 emergency fund,  $8,100 in a tax free savings account for future larger purchases,  and my chequing account rarely goes below $3,000. 

I also have another account that I basically treat as non existant because it is used strictly to pay for taxes at the end of the year. 

My monthly income varies month to month as am a manager and have some serving shifts at a restaurant, but I average $4,500 a month after putting money aside for taxes. 

My monthly expenses are as follows: 
Rent: $800 ($1600 split with boyfriend) 
Phone: $120
Loan payment: $210.90
Dog: $100
Food/ household products: $400 (seems high but we live in a very expensive city) 
Medication: $100 
Transportation: $100  
Savings: $250 

=$2080.90 / month.  

My expenses vary month to month as well depending on a few factors , but I never spend over $2,100 a month.  

This leaves me with $2,419 that I could be throwing on my loan each month. 

I have $11,241 left of my student loan with a 5.20% floating interest rate. 
Which means I could pay off my loan in five- ish months if my income doesn't vary too much and I keep my budgeting  strict for the next five months.  

However, now that I'm so close to being debt free for the first time in my life and earning an income that has allowed me to get ahead and finally feel financially stable, I really want to pay the loan off. 
Every day I struggle with the idea of using my emergency fund plus a week of tips / wage to pay the whole thing off in full. Especially because I know I could replenish my emergency fund rather quickly.  
(My and my S.O are also planning a few trips for next year and I want to start focusing on saving for these as well as a vehicle.) 

I all of a sudden have this weird mindset that the money I have saved isn't truly ""my money""  because I still have debt. 

I know the safe thing to do is trek it out, keep budgeting and pay it off while retaining my emergency fund.  My cautious side says to continue to do this because, well, life happens. 

But this is something that weighs on my mind every single day. I'm so close to being debt free, something I thought I would never accomplish and I'm not sure how to proceed for the final payment (s). The weight of my debt somehow feels heavier the smaller it becomes- which doesn't make much sense, but that's what I have been experiencing.  

So I would like some opinions: 
Option 1: Take the next five months to pay off my loan while retaining my emergency fund 
Option 2: Use my emergency fund to pay it off in full and replenish my e-fund over the next few months. 
Option 3: Any advice/ other opinions from you 

Maybe I just need encouragement to keep going. It's been almost two years of constant budgeting and maybe I'm just looking for a quicker way out. I'm not sure. 

Thanks so much!",finance

personalfinance,"GREAT Credit Score, Can't Get Loan to pay off my current Credit Card","Hi guys!!

I did a search and read the credit and debt wiki and couldn't find anything particularly helpful to this case- if I missed a relevant post PLEASE let me know!! :)

So I'm 27 and I actually have a good Credit score of 760-780, I can't remember which number exactly. I've always been very smart with my money and have, up until the past couple years, paid off my credit card in full every month. 
Then I got saddled with a roommate who got fired and never bothered to find a job again (bc why not) in a lease that was laughably cruel, according to the lawyer I took it to, so I carried us for a few months in a VERY expensive college town.

 Then my dad lost his job and had to borrow a sizable amount from me via getting a cash advance from my credit card and thennn I had to pay to fix my fiancées car,  pay to fix the pipes that backed up sewer into my dad's shower, pay out of pocket bc I took a single summer class so no financial aid for me, and so in and so forth, until my fiancée and I just moved back in with my equally broke dad so we could at least put rent money toward the card.
SO!

Now I have debt. I tried to get a personal loan to pay off the credit card, due to the high credit card interest rate, but NO ONE will give me ANY loan bc of my ""debt to income"" ratio. To sum up:

760-780 credit score.

I have one $13,000-limit credit card with about $3,000 charges, interest rate of 19%

Another $500- limit credit card, completely free of any charges, 18% interest rate.

$3,000 dollar car loan with a 1.4% interest rate, paying $140 a month.

$10,000 in student loans, in deferment bc I'm still in school (attending nursing in Spring!).

I make $10 an hour and work 32 hours a week. It's not great but that's why I'm going to nursing school.

I went to every credit union and bank I could think of about 8 months ago when I had WAY more debt, but EVERY single one turned me down, much to the surprise, disappointment and horror of both myself and the tellers who were super pumped to be the one getting me a loan. I knocked it down myself to $3,000ish but today when I paid my credit card, a new branch manager took my payment and got all starry-eyed about my loan possibilities, insisted on trying to get me a loan, POSITIVE I could do it and get a nice 9% interest, and I was shot down again. No big deal, except now I'm pissed off all over again. I've never missed  or been late on a single payment since I had a credit card at 18. What. The. Hell? I've had friends get personal loans with way worse credit and HUGE student loan debt.

 I could REALLY use that money I'm paying in interest every month, honestly. Basically all my paycheck goes to it and we're saving NOTHING and so every once in a while a huge bill will come up and oops, there goes the credit card again, and I just feel like we're NEVER going to move out at this rate.7

Thinking of balance transfer card, but I think that can mess up your credit a bit? Then again at this point my credit score can blow me tbh. 

The branch manager suggested I open another credit card to increase my revolving credit but I'm hesitant because, well... this.

Any other options for me??",finance

personalfinance,Option to pay for going back to school,"I'm starting an online Master's program in August and my job offers tuition reimbursement which is great, except that it's reimbursement. So I have to find a way to pay for it upfront by the first or second week of September. The first semester is $3450 +whatever fees (those haven't been added yet) and I currently do not have that much money saved up. Assuming I can find that money, my plan is to use the reimbursement from semester 1 to pay for semester 2, reimbursement from 2 to pay for 3 and so on. So that at the end of the day I'm only really out money from semester 1 and I get it back at the end of the last one. I hope that makes sense. 

I'm just not sure what my options are. I hesitate to take another student loan because I've already got 23K from undergrad and if I take another one I'll be responsible for the interest that gets tacked on to the new one. I know some of the federal loans don't add interest until after you have graduated but those are also based on financial need which I'm pretty sure I won't qualify for as I am set to make around 40K this year. I'll take another loan if I have to, I just don't know if it would be the best idea or if there's some secret loan I don't know about somewhere. 

Any ideas? Surely I'm not the first person in this situation.",finance

They gave me a provisional offer with %9.48 Estimated Annual Percentage Rate and %7.5 above the 3 month USD LIBOR Estimated Interest Rate, but they've made it so that I have to pay it in 120 months, 300$ each month. When I asked them about changing it to a short-term loan(24 months?) They told me that it is not possible in my situation. However, they also told me that there is no early payment penalty, which sounds really absurd. If there are no early payment penalties, why is it for 120 months? Am I missing something here?",finance

With these things in mind, I am trying to predict or possibly avoid having to pay federal and state tax (as I have been able to easily the first two years). I don't really understand how the brackets work, and what they are based on (the money I actually take home, or my total pay).

It's been a thing with us where several things at once would break and we wouldn't have the cash to fix it but needed it all fixed just to survive. At one time both cars needed new tires or else end up in an accident, they both needed replacement parts at the same time, refrigerator died, AC died, so on. Everything would be okay and we'd begin to pay off the debt when something else would break and another avalanche would happen. Anyway, we're at that point of needing a personal loan to help pay it off and cut cards up. That typical problem occurs often with us where you're prequalified for a personal loan but the monthly payment ends up higher than what you already pay. 

Has anyone found a loan or way to get a lower interest personal loan to consolidate and begin working on debt? It may just be that we are stuck. Our interest rates for cards is 16%, 18%, 20%.

I am a graduate student in physics making ~1.6k each month, though this can go down based on funding problems. I have a credit card with bank of america and I am really close to the limit of 5.8k, with a total debt of about 5.7k.

I am married and live in a house that my wife owns. She has a crap ton of student and credit card debt.

The way i see it, I am going to be in grad school for another 2 years making at most 1.6k a month. I like using my credit card on gas and groceries because i get 3% and 2% back, respectively. Based on my expenses, I will not be able to pay this card off any time soon. What is the best way to handle this debt?

personalfinance,Increased Net Pay and the affects of Compounding Interest/time on 401(k) vs IRA question,"I've read a few threads about the pros/cons of a 401(k) vs IRA, but still have this lingering question. I'll try to keep it general and just use a couple personal numbers to help provide examples.

If I max out my 401(k) contributions I'll reduce my taxable income by $18,000. According to a Federal Income tax calculator, my net pay would be $5800 more than if I didn't take any pre-tax benefits and put $18k into after-tax accounts; IRA, personal brokerage account, etc. That's because my taxable income would be less.
Over a 40 year period (age when I could retire) that $5800 annual addition compounded once a year at 6% will grow to almost $1mil. That's one million dollars I wouldn't have if I didn't take advantage of these pre-tax benefits. Lastly, that Net Pay pre-tax/after-tax difference will grow as my salary (hopefully) increases.

Now I know it'll be taxed when I withdraw, but am I over simplifying anything or forgetting something?? I'm hoping this could get a little discussion going cause I haven't seen this question brought up before.

personalfinance,(NL) Moving in together: How to split costs when partner is the owner of the apartment?,"My partner and I are planning on moving together soon.  
He owns the apartment where we would be living together.  
To give a bit of my personal history: So far I have lived in a variety of rental rooms/apartments and have never previously had a joint household.  
This is his first property. The total monthly costs for the property are 1201.81 euro per month, out of which the following are the costs that relate to the ownership of the house:  
* 575,00 euro mortgage
* 305,00 euro interest rate
* 111,56 euro for the association of homeowners in the complex
* 46,71 euro for the ownership taxes.  
Total ** 1038.27** euro.   

My dilemma is as follows: we would very much like to make an official contract detailing out the financial rights, responsibilites and obligations towards one another. On one hand, I don't want to be greedy and take the advantage of my partner, but on the other hand I also don't want to be paying off his mortgage, as the investment on my part would not convert into ownership of the place.   
What would be the fair way to distribute costs. Our incomes are the same.   
He is Dutch and I am not, we are both highly educated, work in stable jobs etc but have no experience with joint households.  

It would be greatly appreciated if I could get some tips on how to share the expenses so that neither of us feels taken advantage of and we can both maintain a healthy financial balance.

In addition, I will receive $1000 a month stipend in exchange for working for the school.

Here's the question. I have no debt currently, and have never taken out a loan. It's questionable whether my step-dad will help me pay tuition, so I may need to pay everything myself. I have around 2k in personal savings, but I don't want to touch that if possible.

What's my best route here? If I take on a small amount of debt to pay for my tuition and expenses, is that really so bad? I'm thinking I might incur ~10-15k over 3 years. I've heard to avoid taking loans whenever possible, but I also don't want to stress myself out while I'm working for the school *and* taking a full load of classes.

2: if I do indeed take that deal, I'll get a new loan number, which will show my current mortgage as paid in full and a new loan issued under new 30 year terms. Would that be a bad thing? 

3: my current payment is $1135.00, and I typically pay $1200.00 with $65.00 going to additional principal. If I take this deal, it will reduce my payment to approx 1085.00, which would give me an Additional $50 to principal each month. Is there a down side to doing this.

personalfinance,Questions on refinancing mortgage to pay off other debts.,"I hope to not get into all the details of our complicated situation... but my wife and I have a good amount of debt spread across under grad loans, post graduate loans and credit card debt.  

We pay a mortgage on two homes in different parts of the country.  Home A has been for sale for six months and is not in an area that is a sellers market.  We have no idea how long it might take for this home to sell and are considering renting it out.   

Home B we reside in in another part of the country and had to relocate to for my wife's new fantastic job. I kept my job as I can work from anywhere.  

We owe around $290,000 on our mortgage on Home A.  This is the one we would refinance.  Our purchase price was $325,000 in 2014 at an interest rate of 4.25%.  

In any scenario does it make sense to refinance up to say... $310,000 on Home A?  I keep reading that interest rates are dropping and that it appears that we can beat our current interest rate if we refinance.  

What is the typical % on closing costs for a refinance and how do we go about finding a lender who would potentially pay those closing costs?

Factors I am considering... our house sells for less than we purchased it in 2014 and we end up under water if we refinance up to a certain amount. 

What factors am I not considering?  

Ideally I would like to come out of this with $20k-$30k in cash to pay down some debts and free up monthly payments to said debts.... I would like to think of this as an ""advance"" on the profits from selling our home while making our monthly debts more comfortable/putting the same amounts to other debt to pay down faster.  

I think this makes sense in a scenario that we are lowering our interest rate on our mortgage but if the cost to close is significant then it might not actually make sense.

Hello /r/personalfinance, I've lurked around here for quite a while, read the Wiki, and know the basics of how to handle my money (build up savings, max contribute to IRA/401k, etc..) but after all my reading and research I still have some questions. 

I (22m) recently got married in June, finished undergrad in May, and will be moving from GA to SC for law school in two weeks. As of now my wife (that's still weird to type out) and I are 100% debt free thanks to scholarships for undergrad.  

I am paying for law school and cost of attendance with unsubsidized federal student loans, and federal Grad PLUS loans minus whatever salary my wife will contribute to our cost of living and anything our parents contribute. 

I will have a part-time job for a few weeks in South Carolina until school starts, and I currently have a job in Georgia, so I know I will have to file income taxes in both states. 

I was just reading in a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5v4cq6/personal_finance_loopholes_updated/ddz8ogv/) from several months ago, about how to move money into a 529 then pull it back out in the same year and use it (up to the school's cost of attendance) to keep it from being taxed. 

My first question is, would I open a 529 in South Carolina or Georgia? Would it even be beneficial to open a 529 since student loan's don't count as income tax/we don't (and won't) have enough liquid cash to put into the 529 to equal cost of attendance?

While I'm asking questions, is it better to accept the lowest amount possible in student loans (i.e. subtract what my wife will be making+any help from our parents from my total award and only accept a partial award) or should I just accept the money up to the full cost of attendance, and use the money we are gifted/making to pay off the student loans while in school?

The only reason I can think that I would accept the full award is that that is guaranteed money that I don't have to make payments on until after I graduate, so we could just pay the interest every month until we have a good safety net built up in savings, then start paying off the principal.

So brought my debt from 17,000GBP to 2700GBP within 2 years. But here is the thing for the last 6 months, things were crazy. Got a great job with a REAL Career Progression, that pays about 680GBP a month (For my currency and as a Fresh Graduate, its decent). Borrowed a car from a friend who was studying for 5 months (travelled for about 60miles a day for work-return). I took some money from loan sharks to help pay for my debts, borrowed money from some friends, bank loans, maxed out CCs.

Citigroup Inc (C.N) has been granted permission to return nearly $19 billion of capital to shareholders after passing a tough regulatory test, a long-awaited victory for investors and Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat.

Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, on Wednesday said it plans to repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common stock over the next year and double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion.

The total payout is 54 percent more than the Fed allowed last year and is about 1.25 times the profits that analysts expect Citigroup to earn over the next four quarters. Analysts had expected Citigroup would win the right to increase payouts to roughly 1.12 percent of annual profits.

Citigroup announced the details after the U.S. Federal Reserve said that the 34 biggest U.S. banks had passed the second component of its annual stress test, and would therefore be able to put capital to work in ways other than fortifying their balance sheets. [L1N1JP1U9]

This year's test was an especially crucial rite of passage for Citi, whose shareholders have been keen to see management buy back shares that had been underperforming rivals.

Citigroup shares were up 2.3 percent in after-hours trading at $66.68, compared with a stated net worth of $65.94 per share as of March 31.

""For some time, we have retained a significant amount of capital in excess of what is needed to prudently operate and invest in the firm,"" Corbat said in a statement. Now, he said, the bank can begin ""returning a higher level of that capital to our shareholders and improving Citi’s overall returns.""",finance

The term of my remaining loan would be stretched out, but the agent said I can keep making payments of $651 on the new $472 payment to pay off my loan faster. The interest rate is only 0.63% lower. Would refinancing be worth it in this case? The agent said there are no fees except the $15 title transfer fee. 


My main reason for refinancing would be to pay less interest. I'm okay with my current monthly payments. This is my first time refinancing a loan so I'd appreciate any input! Thanks!",finance

investing,How to go about currency risk?,I'm located in Europe. About half of my portfolio consists of European stocks with the Euro as currency. The other half is US stocks. Lately the Euro has been getting stronger which is frustrating. I'm very happy with the performance of my stocks but the recent EUR/USD movements are eating most of my gains. This is so annoying. I'm confident with my stockpicking but I have absolutely nothing to say about EUR/USD except that interest is gonna stay at zero in Europe for a while while there are interest rate hikes for the US Dollar.

They tried to look up businesses that would help them repay all this and maybe even save them money in the end, but I fear they only are getting scam callers. A company called Finance Solutions (from New York) called and offered to create a savings where they will deposit money into, where it can accrue interest. At the end of the 4 year period, the money will be enough to negotiate a full payment with all cards and cancel them. Now they also will have large fees for the first 44 months and this will tank her credit score since she will not be paying the credit card companies at all for 4 years.

Between the Fiancee and I we only make around 500 or so more than we have in bills monthly.

We both have apartments, she has credit card debt, doctor bills, student loans, and almost 700 month on a car note/insurance. Together that pretty much cancels out her income. I dont have as many bills but right now we're pretty much living off of the leftovers after I pay my bills. My credit utilization on my credit cards is at about 50% and on months where money is tight I end up charging to my cards so that isnt coming down. Plus I have a loan from a few years ago. Im paying over the minimum on time every month but not much so its not really going anywhere. Her credit is terrible, in the mid 500's, mine is bad but not terrible, mid 600's.

So all that said she's moving in with me in august so all the money going to her rent now gets added to the bank. I'm having trouble deciding where to put it. 

1.) I have a small business im trying to expand. Takes money to make money but no guarantee if I invest in myself it will pay off. Thought about taking out a loan, but the type of places that will give me 10k will also give me a 26% interest rate.

2.) I can spend that money paying off credit cards. I know in that will help raise our credit scores, but even spending 1000 bucks a month only on credit cards it will take a while to pay them off and we'll have no more in savings than we do now.

3.) I can put that towards a wedding fund. We've only been engaged a few months but she wants a moderate sized wedding will around 200 guests, which will cost us bare minimum 10k but more realistically upwards of 15 if we have all the things she really wants. I want to give her the type of wedding she deserves but financially we're looking at putting the wedding off for years depending on how we can save and putting it off that long comes with its own set of problems. (Want to wait till marriage for kids, ""Shacking up"", Family shenanigans, etc..)

personalfinance,Borrowing against 401k vs personal loan vs staying status quo to finish reno'ing a house? (USA),"First time posting in here, briefly read the links and guidelines, so feel free to delete if I'm not following protocol.

Recently divorced, bought a house about a year ago that needed a good bit of renovation.  Divorce came with CC debt split from when we were together, plus I have a significant amount of student loans, on top of normal monthly expenses.  I'm fine on a month-to-month basis in terms of money (not going into debt, but nothing is getting paid off; can only spit into my savings account).  The house probably needs another ~5k of work done to be finished (in that I'm living with unpainted ceilings, every other project requires sanding or spackling or taking something apart, and it has been a year of slowly trickling money to get this done, couldn't just do it in one shot with contractors).

The CC debt I'd really like to get rid of, and it's a fairly sizable amount (~14k).  At this point, anything I'm doing to the house is incremental because of the tight monthly budget.  I'm considering borrowing against my 401k (which has a decent amount of money in it) at 4% interest to pay off the CC and to take out the extra 5k just to get the house finished.  The CC currently has an 11% interest rate.  Credit score is fine, mid-high 700s, no delinquent debt or anything, and it would be higher if my debt to income weren't so extreme. 

If I do this, the house after renovation could probably net ~55-70k in equity, and I won't have an 11% interest card anymore, but my monthly payments won't really change - I'd just be paying the same amount towards the 401k that I am towards the CC, just at a lower interest rate.   

Edit: I put 20k down on the house, and have done about 15k worth of major reno (laid down hardwood, built another bathroom, updated some of the kitchen).  At this point, there's little stuff that I need to finish up, just don't have the mass of money for except for monthly here or there kind of things.  Good friends with a real estate agent, the estimate of 55-70k in equity is based on his observations of the reno that I've done to the house.
Is there anything past this that I could do, considering the house value would a decent bit more than when I bought it?  Refi vs. 2nd mortgage for instance, roll it into that maybe?  Just looking for advice from people who may have more experience than I have in lowering my monthly bills and freeing up some money + getting my house finally finished.",finance
personalfinance,"Need Advice - 23 YO, Debt, Savings, Grad School","Hello! My situation is a bit complicated so please bear with me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:** I am a 23-year-old African American who has recently graduated from university. I spent most of my undergraduate career studying abroad (studied in 3 countries) and learning international relations. My hometown is rural and in the middle of nowhere Danville, VA, one of the poorest if not the poorest towns in the state --  The income per capita is $20,569, which includes all adults and children. The median household income is $32,173. Needless to say, there are no opportunities here for a recent graduate who has career ambitions in the international community.

&amp;nbsp;

**Debt/Savings:** During university, I used credit cards irresponsibly which I own up to, and owws a host of late fees and payments. I used all of my graduation money to pay off the majority of things. My credit score is currently an abysmal 549 (just raised 51 points due to mentioned payments) and my current debt is:

&amp;nbsp;

* $1000 to Barclays
* $659.00 to Wells Fargo
* $358.00 to Cox Communications.

&amp;nbsp;

I am lost on the best way to pay them off while building up my credit and savings. I paid off nearly all the collections and debts, and these are the remaining things left. I guess in hindsight $2000 is not much to pay, but I want to pay them off as efficiently as possible, which I have no idea how to do. All the credit cards accounts have been closed and I am currently using a debit card/cash for all my transactions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Employment:** My current job pays me $10 an hour and I am full time. It is highest paying job offer I got in this area ( a call center...), and the nearest metropolitan area is 1 hour away, which would make quite the daily commute. This is supplemented by a job I got during an exchange program, where I make $16.00 an hour working from home. I can get up to a maximum of 12 hours a week for this job (make my own hours). That's $800 before taxes in job 1 and $320 from job 2 -- paid biweekly for both. I currently live home with mom and dad, and have no bills to pay other than the debt and a gym membership. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Grad School/Future:** I have $30k in current student loans to pay off, but I have been accepted into an internationally acclaimed (ranked top 5 for employability and best in its country, but 50k for the cost of attendance) for a Masters of International Relations program. It is the only school that accepted me out of the six I applied too, but I researched into the course, internships, and opportunities, and find it most appropriate for my career goals (for example the course offers internships in embassies/consulates/international orgs). However, I would like outside advice on how to proceed with this given my complete situation and the fact that it would put me 80k in loans to pay back if I were to pay the whole thing using them. If accepted I would start in July 2018. I think it would be worth the investment, but at the same time, I feel as if my judgment is clouded. I do not know how to proceed. To be competitive in international jobs, especially for the federal government, I would need a masters/Ph.D. and show my eagerness and capacity to be successful while overseas.

&amp;nbsp;

I am EXTREMELY lost and need all the guidance I can. I am young and eager to start my career, and I would appreciate any advice, harsh truths, or encouragements you can give me. I want to build up my credit score by paying off those three things, but even then I am not sure on the best way to do this. Should I go monthly minimum or pay as much as I can? In regards to savings and given my financial situation what should I do? About grad school, is this a foolish venture and I am being too ambitious given the enormous costs and general risks of postgrad life. I appreciate you for reading this long post and thank you so much!

Several years back I went through a few personal life events which resulted in me making some knuckle-headed choices with my finances. I spent some time visiting mental health professionals and therapists to get my mind back on track, but still struggled with my spending. 

However, before and after the massive depressive episode, I spent a lot of money commuting for college (3 hours each way), not eating at home often, making unnecessary purchases, and things of that nature. 

Needless to say, I racked up about $13,000 in debt over a span of 3 years. 

**Debt:**

* **Card 1:** $9,600 - 14.65%
* **Card 2:** $4,300 - 16.99%
* **Card 3:** $3,900 - 0% until next Spring
* **Card 4:** $3,300 - 22.99% 
* **Card 5:** $1,200 - 18.99% 

**Now:**

Fast forward to now. I moved overseas to find a job and it took me a year to land a steady gig. Between moving expenses, flying in and out of the country (due to immigration), and being jobless, I racked up another $7,000. 

I now currently have **$20,000** worth of credit card debt. I make enough to pay my rent and eat, do small monthly activities, but not much more. I'm happy, but the anxiety my previous decisions has created in my life is becoming somewhat debilitating. 

**My Plan:**

I wanted to use a P2P debt consolidation program and take out $20,000 to pay off my debt over a span of 3-5 years. I can afford the monthly payment (~$475/mo), **however I cannot apply for the loan due to not living in the United States** (I'm a U.S. citizen). 

Right now I'm stuck and looking for a way to fix my mistakes. The interest rates on the cards that I have a balance on is and has been sinking me for the past 4 months. I know that if I got approved for a $20,000 loan (10-13% interest) I'd be much more focused in my day to day activities. 

**Current Spending:**

* Apartment: $500/mo
* Food: $200/mo
* Leisure: $100/mo
* Professional Development: $30/mo
* Cell Phone: $10/mo
* Insurance: $70/mo

**Total: $910/mo out of $2,000/mo**

I'm just looking for some advice. I just want to rid myself of this debt that's been pulling me down for the past 3 years of my life. I have no one to blame but myself, I'm fully aware of that reality. 

Thank you for reading.

This brings my total paid interest from **$5800** to **$2200**. 

I'll be paying roughly $1000 per month for the next 2 years. I guess I'll need to work a little more, stay busy and become more frugal. Any additional money I come across will be towards paying off the $3,900 card, since the 0% APR is only good for 18 months.",finance
personalfinance,[International Student with SSN] Looking to start a credit history with secured credit card,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Long time lurker here. I've been reading y'all's advice for a while, but for a lack of SSN/ITIN I wasn't really eligible to do anything regarding my US credit score. 

I just recently got a job on campus and therefore got a SSN. I'm looking to build in credit just in case I end up living in the US for a while (no solid plans but I think it wouldn't hurt).

I've tried looking up my credit score but both websites I used (discover and nerdwallet) returned errors. Do I just not have a credit score? I haven't opened any credit lines yet.

Anyway, I'm thinking of getting a secured credit card with about a $300-$500 deposit. My plan is to:

* Use this credit card only for low monthly recurring payments (say, my netflix/spotify/adobe accounts)
* Spend about 10-20% of my monthly limit and pay it in full at the end of each billing cycle
* Not get in debt or carry over a balance

Other information: 

* I currently bank with Chase 
* Although I do have a job now, my parents still largely support me
* I don't have anyone that could be a co-signer
* I don't care about the interest rate because I'm responsible about spending money, have an emergency fund, and just don't think I'll need to pay interest
* I'm ok with a low (&lt;$30) yearly fee if that's what I need to get the ball rolling on this

I've seen the Discover It Secured Credit Card recommended here a couple of times; I've also seen people saying they got denied. Is that really my best option? Or is it better for me to walk into a branch of Chase and try to get one through them?

What would be a good secured credit card option for me? A lot of the advice here seems to apply to people with low credit scores, but I simply don't have one and have no one to ask for guidance.

**EPS - Earnings Per Share**

Let's take the exameple that Company XYZ Inc. has made a $125,000,000 and the company decides to gie out $1,000,000 in dividents. They had 10M shares outstanding the first half of the year and then 14M shares the second half. 

So... to get the EPS we do....

    (Net Income - HOW MUCH THEY ARE GIVING OUT ) / Average Outstanding Shares

So... in this case the **Average** Outstanding Shares would be 12M. Thus, we get...

    ($25M - $1M) / 12M
    = $2 per share. 

Also, be careful with my terminology. Is it Net **Income** - Dividends OR Net **Profit** - Dividends?  The examples SO far, all seem to say Net Income, so I just wanna be clear of that. The reason I am asking this is  suppose XYZ Inc uses $5,000,000 from the $25,000,000 to invest in buildings or something. Will the EPS be calculated with $25,000,000 or the $20,000,000 that's left over?

Also, the reason I capitalised *HOW MUCH THEY ARE GIVING OUT*, is because I wanted to know if it only applies to dividends. Suppose a XYZ Inc. wants to donate $1,000,000 to a charity. Is the new equation

    ($25M - 2M)/12M

Now, the most important question I have, is about the actual value of the EPS. A $2 EPS... what does this mean exactly? To me it sounds like the company profited 2 dollars for every share owned... but this is still a bit cloudly to me. If you know, could you please go a little in depth with this, because I literally have to Google EPS, everytime it comes up. Sometimes people say things like... *the investor pays $2 for every dollar the company earns* but what does that even mean. Sounds like I am losing money, if I am PAYING 2$ for every $1 it earns.


Next, we have the **Price to Earnings Ratio**. From my understanding, EPS alone can not provide the investor with enough information to many any kind of remarkable decision. However, you van use the EPS to use to generate different kinds of ratios which may actually give you some good information and make smart comparisons between companies. To begin...

    P/E Ratio = 
    Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

To exemplify, if XYZ Inc. is at $10 / share, their P/E ratio
    = $10 / $2
    = 5

Therefore, it's trading @ 5 times earnings. 

Now suppose a similar company is at $25 a share and their EPS is $1.95. Their P/E ratio 12.8. 

To me, XYZ Inc. is a way better (valued) company of the two, because it may be undervalued and it's got a higher EPS (if that's something I should look at). But what about the P/E ratio? Is a lower P/E ratio always better? I guess I should watch [Is Stock With a Lower P/E Always A Better Choice?](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/stock-lower-pe-always-better-choice/).

** Also, a reminder, if I say something that is not correct, please do not hesitate to correct me, I want to learn value investing from those have knowledge in this topic so I too can be an intelligent investor. **


**Yields &amp; Bonds**

To begin, let's dive quickly into bonds. Whereas a stock is an ownership in a piece of company and if you are an investor on a publicly traded company you are apart of it's earnings and assets. Bonds, on the other hand are a ""loan"" that entities (government, institutions, etc) sell to investors so that the entity doesn't have to go to the banks and stuff. 

That being said, all bonds have the following: (, right?)

* Face Value: The price each bond is sold for (typically they are several hundred dollars)
* Coupon: Interest rate it will give back to you
* Maturity Date: The date that you can sell back your bond and get the initial loan back. 

In addition, you can sell your bond before maturity... this is something that's still cloudy... is there a website or something where people go and upload/sell their bonds. Kinda curious about how this works :D

Anyways... the real confusion is when bond **yield** comes in to play. So a bond yield is just the return percentage, right?!

    YIELD = 
    (Interest Rate / Bond Price) × 100

And I get the philosophy of how bond yields vary inversely with the market price of the bond.  ie. 

When bond price goes up, yield goes down.
When bond price goes down, yield goes up.

So why would I care about the price of a bond? Isn't the goal to have a high yield through out the duration before maturity? I am out here trying to make money, so you are telling me I can make more if the bond I bought loses value? Something doesn't add up. 

Here is a quote of something Graham initially spotted in 1957 before it became noticeable to everyone in 1959.
&gt; Never before had stocks yielded less than bonds; after all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why would anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to compensate for their grater risk?
...

&gt; More than four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again; the tield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on bonds. 
[Zweig 114]

Uhhh..? WTF WHY! Sorry, but I don't know what to take of this. This is kinda crappy, is it not?


Anyways, I wanna wrap this u shortly, but this chapter briefly discusses **Dollar Cost Averaging** and I believe I have a good understanding  of it and it seems okay! 

Basically, I am essentially devoting $X amount, let's say $500, every month to buy a specific stock. So if a stock was averaging $50, it will give me 10 shares, if it was $54, I will buy 9 shares.
 
One thing I wanna cover is... does the algorithm wait until the end of the month to look at the average price? Suppose the average price was $49.50 but the price on the last day of the month pushes the average to $50.34?

So, when I decided to YouTube search *dollar cost averaging*, some of the suggestions were negative, in the sense that, thi strategy is a ""losing"" strategy. But it didn't resonate with the way my understanding of it, but whatever. 

Lastly, there is one last image/chart I want to share with you about Dollar Cost Averaging, that I am having trouble understanding. [Figure 5-1 shows the magic of Dollar Cost Averaging in a more recent bear market.](http://imgur.com/a/Xw7rM)

personalfinance,[HELP] I need some advice on college loans,"TL;DR I have college loans currently in repayment. Want to make a payment. Better to pay part principle on high interest private loan. Or payoff private loan. Or pay off stafford loan

I graduate college (U.S.) about 2 years ago with a total of $65.5k on loans. I have a total of 13 loans ranging from Private (Discover), Subsidized and Unsubsidized stafford loans, and Parent PLUS loans. I have been repaying my loans since I graduated as I was able to get a well paying job right after college (Engineer, started making $68k and currently making $77k). Most of my loans are less than $5.5k each. And 2 loans of about $9k and 1 at $12.5k (Parent PLUS). My private loans have a 7.75% and 8.25% interest rate. My Stafford loans have rates from 3.15% up to 6.55%. Parent loans have 7.65% and 6.96%. Some of the rates are fixed and some are variable, I cant recall which ones are which.

I have been making monthly payments of more thatn the required amount. And I am in good credit standing. I have about $3.5k leftover on my bank account and I am thinking of paying off a part of my account.

My question is, should I pay an amount of my private loan with high interest rates, pay off 2 of my stafford loans with 6.55% interest rate. Or put that money on the highest principal balance loan? Highest interest rate loan?

My current plan is to keep paying more than my current monthly payments require, but I have a goal to pay off the totality of my loans in less than 10 years. I would like it to be 7 years. I think my current payments put me somewhere in the range of 12-13 years. 

I am hoping that I keep growing at my current job as it is a stable job and it seems that my pay increases every year with merit raises and promotions. *knocks on wood* So I am looking into increasing my monthly payments as well

personalfinance,Help me escape the Debt Cyclone! Financial review,"PersonalFinance,
For too long I have sat on the sidelines of my financial world allowing my financial future to drain down the endless cycle of credit card debt. While I have been able to maintain minimum payments and continue the cycle, I am running into an ever increasingly perilous situation of scrambling for cash to make payments and not knowing where or how to utilize the resources I have efficiently.
This is a no shit checkup on my financial situation and a call for remedy on how to cease the debt cycle. I’ve updated my Mint account and pulled updated numbers shown below.
Some of the primary issues that we run into that could be immediately addressed:
Immediate spending – Our strategy was relying on the Southwest CC for primary spending and paying as much as possible toward balance, always ending up maxing the card. This left me reaching for another card, typically utilizing BofA CC as it has lowest APR.
BofA ATM fees – At least 5x $3.00 fee every month from utilizing ATM in quick scramble for cash
*This could be addressed by having cash on hand, but how often to replenish and where from?
*Also can be addressed by moving funds into USAA (refunds ATM transactions), requires 1 biz day
BofA Overdraft fees – I’ve done better at addressing this lately, but paying Babysitter with checks can cause account overdraft fee if not careful- @$35.00 each they accumulate quickly.

Thoughts: I’ve been paying on revolving credit cards for the past 10+ years now, almost never missing a payment while steadily stacking more and more debt onto new cards. All this while, I’ve been paying between 12% - 24% APR on these while the balances remain near maxed. 
Tentative Solutions – Consolidate the Credit Card debt balances into a single loan with a lower APR while will save money immediately and over time (This solution effectively doesn’t exist ??)  I receive offers from LendingTree / Prosper and such, but reading PersonalFinance has scared me away from them for the most part. I hear they require invasive paperwork and rarely offer better alternatives than the prevailing situation? 
Option 1: Balance Transfer to another card //  Costs ~3% balance transfer fee, rolled into balance – Cannot get a new credit card with high enough limit to effectively transfer balances.
Option 2: 401k loan // Removes loan from market, no cost but must pay account back within 6 months?
Question:  Should I attempt to pay slightly more ($5 - $20) than the Minimum Payment to CC debts each payment?

personalfinance,(UK) Paying mortgage off VERY slowly - tactics/strategy?,"Hi all,

so I'm in the process of purchasing my first house, I was set up on a 20year mortgage with the aim of aggressively paying it off. However, a few people mentioned it would be better to extend the payment period and make money on the monthly mortgage payments I'm now saving. My rate is a 2year fix @ 1.74%, 75% LTV. I've now switched to a 37year repayment period.

Does anyone else take this approach? It makes sense in theory to me and with a simple example. However, if we extend that example over a long period of time, entering several periods where interest rates on savings/investments are likely to be lower than the savings made just paying off the mortgage. It gets confusing for me, like should I be changing the repayment period every time I remortgage? At a time when it makes more sense to pay off the mortgage, I change to a 15year period and throw everything at it? Or when it makes sense to make money on investments, remortgage so it's the longest period possible?

Any good articles or resources on this people could point me to? I just want to educate myself better so I know the ins and outs of how to handle the mortgage, whatever the situation is? Obviously how well I handle the biggest debt of my life will enable me to FIRE earlier.",finance
personalfinance,$4600 in credit card debt and I feel I will never be free,"Hello everyone,

I have a credit card through Capital One. In 2015-early 2016 I had a bit of a rough year and went nuts buying DVDs and video games to bring me out of the funk. Now I am $4600 in credit card debt and I fear I will never be down to $0. 

I do use my credit card to buy gifts on Christmas and birthdays. I use my credit card to pay bills. My minimum payment each month is about $135 and I pay around $300. Sometimes I pay multiple times a month. 

Each month after rent is due I have maybe $1100 to spend, yet I also wish to move apartments and jobs this fall, and I fear this will add to my credit card debt. I have maybe $600 available. 

My local bank, with whom I have been for years, offers a credit card with 0% APR. I do not know what that means. I could transfer my balance and perhaps take advantage of this 0% APR. I do not know the interest rate of my current card. 

I think I have slightly above average credit. I want to be financially healthy. I am 29, I work full-time, I have an annual income of $39000 before taxes. 

I appreciate any thoughts, tips, or questions you have. Thank you!

personalfinance,Extra monies to mortgage or student loans,"Hello all! My SO and I just bought a house. At the moment, we have a couple of roommates that contribute approximately $1100.00 towards the household (their rent and portions of electric). Initially we wanted the house to ourselves and were going to give them about 2-3 months notice to find their own place. Now we've been discussing the idea of letting them stay for one year and putting that extra money towards the principal of our mortgage. As of now our monthly payment only puts $185-$195 towards the principal, therefore I feel like this would benefit us greatly. Now he has about 20K in student loan debits. Would it be more beneficial to put the ""extra"" income towards the students loans or mortgage principal? No other debts for either of us. I have excellent credit and his is probably fair to good. I have budgeted our incomes and we can afford all of our household bills, groceries, $200 extra to our principal (if it's just the two of us), and savings. Please let me know your opinions and experience. Thank you :)

Bitcoin,How are bitcoins sustainable?,"From my limited understanding, Bitcoins are ""created"" by verifying transactions in a very specific way that satisfies a complex algorithm and verifies the result across many decentralised systems.

The growth rate of bitcoins is diminishing as it gets harder to ""mine"" as the algorithms that need to be satisfied becomes harder over time.

As bitcoins get harder to mine, its growth rate becomes slower than the amount of transactions that want to use it, so naturally the price goes up.

Does this mean bitcoin value could only go up? Then who would want to spend it if they know it's going to worth more tomorrow? If people don't want to spend it, there will be even less transactions to verify and ""mine"", further slowing it down.

So how is this sustainable?

In a simplistic scenario, assume the whole world adopts bitcoins and the worldwide GDP grows by 8%. Assume bitcoins could only grow at 4% due to the complexity of its algorithm. 

In this scenario, wouldn't bitcoins just be worth more and more indefinitely? It is like the interest rate parity but without any reversal.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Question on what to do with an auto insurance payout.,"Hey guys,

So here is my situation. I recently got into a car accident and received $24,500 from my insurance company - the car was written off. There was $21,100 left owing on my vehicle so I am coming out of it with a $3,400 surplus. The original cost of the vehicle was $27,500 an with interest came to $32,700 over 7 years, which I have been paying for 2 years. The interest rate was /is 5.23%. 

I am looking at a used vehicle right now with a total cost of $8500, however, since it is an older vehicle the best financing term that I can get is 9% over 24 months. I also have $6000 of credit card debt at 20% interest. 

The insurance company did not make the cheque payable to the bank that I have my original loan with so I was able to deposit it into my personal cheuqings account.

My question is this: Should I use the $24,500 to buy the used vehicle upfront and payoff my credit card debt while continuing to pay off my original vehicles loan like nothing happened? And is that even legal?

Living on 35,000/year in California wasn't easy, but I was able to make it work. Now that I've almost doubled my income, I feel really rich (which is fun, and new for me).  At this point, I probably have about $4,000 in a 401k and I am 30 years old - this screams at me that this isn't ""enough"", but I'm not really sure.

My question is - should I focus more of my money on increasing my retirement fund (&gt;9%?) before focusing extra money on paying down student loan debt?

Live and learn, right? It's a bit of a spiel so thanks again for reading...



Anyway, I'm 23 and I'm a Paramedic for a rural ambulance agency. About 2 years ago in the fall, I got my first vehicle, a 2012 Dodge Charger. It's my baby and after sliding around in that all winter, I decided it wasn't entirely practical where I live. I was also starting paramedic school at the time. I was fine driving it most of the following year, but as winter approached again, along with required vehicles and clinicals being 4hrs away in the city, I needed a reliable A-to-B ride and something that could handle the winter. I ended up getting a 2013 Dodge Avenger (FWD, and from DriveTime of all places). The Charger ended up being parked and I took the Avenger to school, work, hospitals, other Fire Depts/EMS agencies, etc.

Medic class finished about 7 months ago, and I started to have more breathing room financially. My sister who lives in the city needed help with another car (her and her husband shared a car, worked opposite schedules, have 2 toddlers, etc etc her problems). She was willing to take over payments, pay me monthly, only wanted the title after the loan was paid off. She's my oldest sibling, and the most responsible (at the time), so I figured I could trust her. I went to start to use the Charger again (kept it under covers; again, it was my baby), but it ended up housing a bunch of mice during the winter months and that was some costly detailing, decontaminating and repairing that took some time to deal with (mostly due to the dealership along with me having to save up to make payments on all of that to get it back). 

I was car-less, and the dates on repairs/etc being completed kept getting pushed back. My sister eventually offered to co-sign for a new (used) vehicle for me, as she was taking over the other one. Sooooo my dumbass ended up getting a 2013 Camaro...

Sister ended up getting addicted to crack, lost her husband and kids, and couldn't afford the car. I took it back, and thought all was lost when my older brother offered to take over (again, super responsible, drove an old beater, etc). Until last night, where I got a phone call from the ER saying he was brought in by police (he bought a pistol, him and his gf were going to off-themselves...she was successful and he witnessed). He's now being transferred to a psych facility. 

So, I'm now stuck with 3 auto loans. I have another brother (last sibling I promise lol) who works alongside me at EMS (we went through medic class together), and between this brother, myself, and my dad, we split bills at my parent's house amongst our other personal financial obligations...

I make $17/hr, with a minimum of 96hrs a pay period (4 24hr shifts). So about $2900 after taxes a month. I've been getting lucky as of late, getting at least an extra 24 or 48 a pay period of OT, but as that's not always promised we'll base it off a typical 96.

Monthly expenses include:

*$200 for cell phones (I cover the household's plan)
*$180 for dish/internet
*~$330 insurance for the cars
*~$330 Camaro payment
*~$307 Charger payment
*~$385 Avenger payment
*$80 credit card payment

Charger payoff is $13,366.48, costing $307/mo. It's my baby as I've mentioned, and as it's been kept under covers and had great upkeep before and after the rodent incident, it's worth the most. It's been appraised at dealerships with offers anywhere from $10.5k-$11.5k, given excellent ratings each time. I've posted it on craigslist with no bites yet.

Avenger payoff is $13,770.18, costing $384/mo (192 bi weekly). Great car, but Drivetime deals through income instead of credit so the interest rate is atrocious. It has about $8k negative equity.

Camaro payoff is like $17.9k, costing $330/mo. It's in excellent condition also and has like $8k negative equity....I know.

I've been saving aggressively and come towards the end of July, was thinking of selling the Charger to Carmax if it doesn't sell privately. I don't know what they'll offer, but I'll be able to eat about $5k towards that payoff depending on their appraisal.

As for the Camaro and Avenger, I don't know what to do. I was considering a personal loan of about $10-15k, but I've no idea how to disperse it between the two, or if I'll even get approved (credit karma says I have good approval odds through Avant or One Main; with payments of $212/mo but ridiculous APR of like 29 or some shit). I feel Carmax would take the Camaro also if I ate enough of it.

I need help, guys. This shit stresses me out to no end and I'm beyond frustrated and have no one else to turn to but the internet lol.

If I had the time, I would be able to save enough, but I didn't realize I wanted to buy a house until a couple weeks ago... It's a long story...) BUT my father already owns a house worth considerably more than the price range I am looking at. So. What I'm thinking is, what if he took out a home equity loan, and gifted me that money. I then use this money to pay cash for a house. I then use my ""paid off"" house to apply for a home equity loan, and give that money to my father for him to pay off the loan he took out. And boom! I have now purchased a house with no/considerably less than normal up front cost, and simply make payments on my equity loan instead of having a mortgage. Am I crazy? Could this work at all? Are down payments required for equity loans for some reason? Would I wind up with a significantly worse interest rate this way, and if so how bad are we talking here?

TLDR: Could I use an equity loan to pay cash for a house, take out another equity loan on the new house and use it to pay off the first loan, and then make payments on the second loan instead of having a mortgage in order to buy a house with no/considerably less than normal up front costs?",finance

The company I work for matches up to 6% so I opted into that so far. I'm also figuring in $30.54 for medical insurance and $100 per month for and HSA.


My expenses consist of $1120 per month rent and I also figured in a $100 utility which is probably high but I'd rather play it safe. Internet   is 45 dollars per month at the lowest I can go. (As far as I know, It won't let me see all of the offers until I actually move in August 1). HBO and Apple Music at $15 each a month (HBO will be gone after GoT Season 7 is done) and finally I estimated how much gas per month at $217 high point as well. (Should go down quite a bit once I move into the apartment as it is closer to my work.)


Also I have roughly another term left of classes but should have enough money in my bank to pay off the remaining classes.


My problem comes in with the roughly 20% savings (5% Invest, 10% Personnel Savings, 5% Emergency Fund) the excel sheet recommends and my school loans being around $60,000 I don't know how much I should be contributing right now since I haven't graduated yet and am unsure if the loans interest rate will start since I do have a full time job now or if they will start after I graduate. If I figure it $600 a month now the Flex account and expenses are both over by quite a bit.


So should I be saving money now for paying off the loan later if the loans don't need to be paid now? Is there anything I can do budget wise to help this? Am I using the excel sheet wrong?

I'm starting residency this month. So far I have around 245,000 in debt from undergrad and Med school, and 10,000 in loan money that I have sitting in my checking. I have 2500 emergency fund. My residency program offers a Roth IRA without matching, or a traditional IRA also without matching. My salary is around 64,000. After all monthly expenses including rent and food, I estimate I will have 1300-1800 left over (post-tax). I cook all food at home and budget closely.  I walk to work.

I will likely apply for REPAYE which offers loan forgiveness in 20-25 years. Not sure what my monthly amount will be for repayment, but probably a few hundred dollars. The thing is I don't want to risk this program changing or not being available in 25 years. Also I am uncomfortable with building up so much interest over time, even though I know inflation helps counteract that a bit.

All loans are government owned. Interest rates range from around 4.5% for $12000 from undergrad,
And 5.8-7.2 % from Med school. There is only $8300 left with the 7.2 interest rate, and the rest is 6.8% or under. Should I just pay off the $8300 lump sum with the leftover loan money? Or should I keep the $10,000 and put it in the IRA?

For my monthly loan repayment budget, say I have $1500 left per month after living expenses, and say my minimum loan payment is $400. Should I pay the minimum or put in more like $1000 per month? My question is, what should I do with leftover money each month? Save for a mortgage down payment?

I'm single and would like to purchase an apartment within the next 5-10 years, with or without a partner.

I graduated my undergrad and graduate degree programs debt free through scholarships. My girlfriend did not. 

She has 65k in fed sub/unsub. 
Car note at 16k remaining on a 2012 mitsubishi outlander, 60k + miles - commuting an hour per day, one way.
Personal loan at $9k+
Credit cards at $9K+
Private loans at $10K+

I had a inheritance of $100K rec'd 2013. I paid all debt off ( but current car note $13K @ 2.89%) and have a taxable vanguard account of diversified index funds. 

Current net worth estimated $130k + (not including car note - car value equals balance)
SO - 100K - plus interest at varying rates ( student loans are 5-7%, personal are 9%, CC are your usual 16-23%) 

My Salary $44K - take home $2,800
SO $39,500 - Take home $1,150 Bi -W = $2,300 monthly. Server position that avg.'s $500 p/m

Let's talk options:

My expenses are $1,100 - leaving $1,700 p/m disposable 
SO expenses are $1,900 ( covering min due on all EXCEPT 65k loan - Too low income to contribute, due to her just starting her new position. THIS will be reevaluated and owed on an income based repayment.) leaving $400 which goes to food/dog food. 

We combine rent, renter's insurance &amp; car insurance. Phone is minimal. All bills are built into fixed rent cost. 
We are now taking total income/debt:

Total Expenses $3,000 (minimum of all debt)
Total take home minimum ($5,100) Max ($5,600)

PROBLEMS:

We're talking $1,000 including social activities - usually split food of 600 and 400 paid by me eat/drink out. 

Worse case: 5,100 - 3,000 - 1,000 = remaining debt payment 1,000 per month 
best case: 1,600 per month 

Combined, or SO's potential pay increase draws a min payment increase on fed debt ( as it should).
Getting there:

Why I'm not getting specific:

100K debt + interest. Looks like we have 1k to throw at it. Won't cover interest. Game over. 

We both have higher earning potential but not guaranteed. Me- MBA, not seeking advancement advice. SO - MS in Bio, starting career. 

Real Options:

1. Yes, I know, drop my inheritance and cover debt, start fresh and max all investment accounts. I'm just not prepared to do that - My mother's life work is in those funds and I'm attached - as I believe I should be. 

2. Use inheritance to eliminate short term debt, CC &amp; P Loans, gain new jobs, and combine income to attack student loans. Potential option but reliant on both incomes increasing over $84k combined - significantly. 

3. Sign a Pre-Nuptial - However - I don't think a marriage would work IMO. I would want to have one family income. 


4. I like this ( #2, plus sell her car as close to cost, and eliminate payment (16 k total debt). Wait until one gains employment to desired city, transition and attack all debt as FT job!)

5. Break up. FI/RE on my own time. Plan to max as close to 18k 401k as career progresses, plus HSA, ROTH then taxable. 

Side notes: 
SO isn't wild with money, just didn't receive grants/funds for UG and paid just like the best of you all middle class parent incomes.  
We were young in our relationship where I couldn't talk her out of the new car - she regrets it. 
Question isn't how/where/when did debt come from - done deal..seeking forward thinking plan. 
Finance is important to me and SO. Want to travel and FI/RE early!

Optimistic Final thoughts:

Planning to move to a mid-west metropol area where I believe we can increase income quickly to min 100k to 120k. Dependent on standard of living increases, we are still looking at 20+ year pay off.

Disclaimer: I know realized why posts had poor formatting and why you geniuses asked for more info, I must have missed details.

RECAP: Don't need budget advice. Asking is it feasible to pay down a six figure debt with modest(?) incomes, and/or worth it. 

If I was reading I would probably guess that this isn't a question and the answer is obvious. Maybe similar stories may help. 

PERSONAL but MAIN QUESTION  - Outside of love, why should I sacrifice my FI/Re potential to fight debt for 10+ if not 20+ years.

personalfinance,"$7000+ in debt, 1000 in savings, need to eliminate debt and save $10,000 in the 2 years I have left in the Navy. (X-Posted from /r/MilitaryFinance)","Hi there, not sure if this is a very good place to post this, but I am currently in the Navy, just made E-4 but still paid as an E-3. I will be hitting my 2 year mark in July, and have accrued $5500 in Credit card debt(my first credit card ever and Navy Federal gave me a 12K spending limit...sigh. So, there is that.

Then there is a 1500 loan I had to take out for an emergency and now I have that debt sitting. I am making minimum payments on both the loan and CC but struggle to budget because I eat out a lot and such. ALSO, I need to save 10K by the time I get out. I have my bi-weekly paychecks from the Navy, usually totaling around 930 dollars and then I have about 1K sitting in a certificate that matures in August, that I only started because I realized I needed a way to save that I couldn't touch and spend on stupid stuff.

What can I do and how can I accomplish my goals? Even getting my CC to around 1-2K in debt on there while eliminating my loan completely would be great. Should I use the 1K in the certificate to get started? How can I budget good?

I have a car bill to pay every month($237) , on top of rent/utilities(375), a cell phone bill(100) and that's pretty much it for the neccessaries. I appreciate any help or a better place to post this. I read the debt wiki in the sidebar but am still unsure of where to start honestly. I am only 20 years old and really don't want the past year or so of building debt to follow me out of the Navy even, because I have the goal of starting college while I am in(mostly paid for by Tuition assistance through the Navy) and finishing once I get out with the Post 9-11 GI Bill.

personalfinance,On a scale of “Best idea ever!” to “You’ll regret it for the rest of your life” how would you rate using money from a 401K for a down payment on a home?,"I have a 401K from a previous job that is sitting doing its thing and has been for the past three or so years; I have a new job now with a different type of retirement plan, and I was lazy and never rolled it over.  It’s doing pretty well as far as I can tell; the average rate of return for the past 5 years is 10.12%, and it’s over $50K.  I am 31 years old, single, no kids, and I rent an apartment, but I have always wanted to own a home.  An opportunity has arisen for me to purchase a home from a family member, and I can give more details if they’re relevant, but the bottom line is, it would be a really great deal, but only if I can use the money from my 401K as a down payment.  When I say really great deal, I mean, mortgage, taxes, and insurance would be ~$200 less than I am paying in just rent right now.  Standard financial wisdom, as I understand it, says to not touch that money under any circumstances because of the loss of the eventual return, but without using it, I would have a very hard time coming up with any type of reasonable down payment in the near-ish future, and if I retire when I’m 62, I’d like to have a place to hang my hat and no mortgage payment if possible.  

I realize that with the purchase of a home, the financial piece is a large part of the conversation, but not the only one.  That being said, I’m leery about removing the money because it’s doing pretty well, and should I cash out, I would lose ~$13K in fees and taxes right off the bat not including the additional income tax I’d have to pay on it.  On the other hand, I have other retirement investments that, according to my projections, will keep me fed, clothed, and comfortable when I retire, and the payout would allow me to put about 33% down and avoid PMI.  I am well and truly on the fence, and would appreciate any input.",finance
investing,stockAday: can FedEx deliver? $FDX,"Are the drones really a threat to FedEx?

# Key Stats for FedEx Corporation
|Ticker|[FDX](https://stockflare.com/stocks/fdx)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Other Air Freight &amp; Logistics
Latest price | $215.23
Value | $57,547M
Daily vol | $440M
Date | 30 June 2017
Links | [SEC Filings](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=fdx&amp;type=10&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;count=10), [fedex.com](http://www.fedex.com/)


# 1. They Deliver!

FedEx provides a portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the FedEx brand. 

Though they do own the TNT Express brand as well, buying it in May 2016 for $5bn, from the Dutch Post Office... don't ask!

* There are 5 divisions FedEx Express, TNT Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services. 
* If you are wondering Express is a time-guaranteed delivery service. Ground is the cheap / slow service
* The Services segment provides the other divisions with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service and other back-office support.
* And you won't be surprised that 90% of the profit comes from Express &amp; Ground, with TNT and Freight lost in the rounding.

Now, FedEx has a year end on 31st May... so guess what... they reported this week :)

|year to May|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $44bn | $46bn | $47bn | $50bn | $60bn|
|Reported EPS | $8.55 | $7.48 | $3.65 | $6.51 | $11.07|
|Adjusted EPS | n/a | n/a | n/a | $10.80 | $12.30|

But don't get too excited by the jump in sales... that is what happens when you buy TNT. Strip it out and sales were up 5%. Which is still pretty good.

And on the bottom line, there were some nasty exceptionals in 2015 and 2016, so it's a little less remarkable a jump as seems. Though Adjusted earnings up 14% is impressive.

And despite the acquisition of TNT last year, FDX has got a reasonable debt level of circa $10bn, i.e. 1.4x operating profit. So there's little risk to their dividends or share buyback program!

# 2. Would UPS be better?

At the topline, UPS and FDX are perfect rivals. There's little difference in margins though returns are substantially better at UPS. 

The logistics business is clearly better than the two big European postmen. (note: DP owns DHL). Though the industry has substantially lower margins than the railroads. Why? I assume it's cos they are local monopolies?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
FedEx Corporation | $60,319M | 14% | 20%
United Parcel Service, Inc. | $61,803M | 12% | 231%
Expeditors International of Washington | $6,225M | 11% | 23%
Foreigners |  |  | 
Deutsche Post AG | €57,334M | 8% | 24%
Royal Mail PLC | £9,776M | 10% | 6%
Freight |  |  | 
Union Pacific Corporation | $20,244M | 47% | 22%
CSX Corporation | $11,320M | 43% | 15%
Norfolk Southern Corp. | $10,043M | 41% | 14%
Kansas City Southern | $2,381M | 48% | 13%

So it's not a surprise that investors value railroads the highest, then logistics then postmen. Though it seems there is a preference for UPS over FedEx.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
FDX | $57,547M | 16x | 12% | 1% | 11%
UPS | $95,263M | 18x | 8% | 3% | 9%

NSC | $34,635M | 19x | 12% | 2% | 10%
KSU | $10,873M | 20x | 13% | 1% | 9%

# 3. Wall Street like them both!

Sticking with the UPS v FDX theme:

* The brokers on Wall Street say _Buy_ FedEx and expect a 7% upside to the $230 price target
* For UPS they say _Hold_ with a price target just 4% higher than today.

In the last 2 years, FDX has traded between 12 and 18x earnings, with UPS trading between 16 and 21x. So the UPS love's been pretty extended. Though they did downgrade UPS to a Hold in Dec.

# 4. Time to fly?

It's worth a look at this week's [management presentation](http://s1.q4cdn.com/714383399/files/doc_presentations/2017/IR-Earnings-Pres-Q417-Final-06.20.2017.pdf) where they see moderate economic growth and adjusted earnings up between 7 to 14% in the next year. 

The integration of TNT is key to the figures, as it was break-even last year. They've only owned it 1 year, and we can expect a few more years to get it to FedEx levels of cash-flow.

And as for drones and Amazon, they feel like pie in the sky for now. In fact when Bezos is asked about FedEx UPS or the US Postal Service he's said:

&gt; We will take all the capacity that the U.S. Postal Service can give us and that UPS can give us and we still need to supplement it. So we’re not cutting back. We’re growing our business with UPS. We’re growing our business with the U.S. Postal Service.

It's as if Amazon is growing so fast that it's main concern is delivering what it sells, not who does the delivery!

All in all.. a large cap, potential 10% grower... benefiting from e-commerce, with margin improvements and cash back.

It looks like FDX should deliver!

IOT,People wake up: The IoT cloud is an insecure mess! A purely commercial view.,"Think twice before you connect your things to the cloud, business or private. Because everything is sniffed out. Nothing is really protected. The technology backend is highly complicated. And, they make you pay for it. 

Don’t believe this? This is not a political article, it’s a commercial one. No-one's running for president here. Although, it might seem that way, but actually – no.

Today, most of us trust the four big data collectors in the world – Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Between them, we hardly have secrets. Which brand of dishwasher we use, they know it. Where we work, and where we live, when we work, if we get home late one evening and where we were before that, and whom we have met. A copy of the video stream of your baby monitor when you accessed it through your app. Who was in front of your door and rang the bell. And so the story goes, which pattern we live in, and when and how we break that pattern. 

All this is done with legitimate shareholder interest in mind. To serve us better ads, for example. Let us pray that all this data is stored securely. And that not ever any government comes into power that uses this wealth of information to do shady stuff with our societies, and limits our freedom. 

If you own a business and your products connect to your company through the cloud, think twice too. You are not really able to protect the data of your customers. And if the all-knowing middle man gets hacked, guess who is liable – you are. And if you now think that you can ask your cloud provider to protect that data – sure, they will, using THEIR keys not yours, stored on THEIR servers. And for that “security”, they will make you pay extra. 

If you are an app developer, the cloud offers all these wonderful services. Go ahead, make your app dependent on it – but be sure of one thing: Slowly but surely the economics of your software delivery will change. Prices for cloud services will adjust while competition in your market will squeeze your price point. And eventually, you will not be making the money. The big four will. 

Putting one and one together, a simple combination of current implementation of cloud technology, and market mechanics: People, they are really gearing up to own your world.

Seriously?

And I actually own a business that does develops apps, I don’t want to be an attack surface to hackers that harm my customers, and – yes, I do want to be able to live off my work.

On the individual level, I guess that many of you will say, it’s OK to share some of my data. I am in that category too. I want control over my life, and who knows what I do and who doesn’t. The cloud is not my intimate friend, it’s a technology service that I pay to serve me – not the other way around. 

There is a better way – beame.io secure IoT cloud for business and private use

Our cybersecurity startup is called beame.io. We have released a software developer kit that secures access to your information with keys that are generated on your device, and that never leave your device. Nobody, unless authenticated and verified, can read this information during transmission, it uses true asymmetric crypto because it is based on the Public Key Infrastructure. This really is the way the IoT should be going.

The software developer kit is open source, and there are a few ready-made apps that are also available for free. beame.io is paid a nominal amount for the certificate issuance, in the range of $1.5 per year. For all this security and crypto, for your privacy and the privacy of your customers, this really is not much.

personalfinance,Refinancing my car loan - is it worth it?,"So I have had my car for about 3 years now and I signed a 73 month finance term and have made 34 payments on it thus far. 

I still owe about $12,000 roughly out of the 20,500 that the loan was for. My monthly payments are $360. 

So at the time I got my car I had horrible credit, my score was just under 500 and I've worked hard to raise it up to where it is currently at 687. And my interest rate on the loan is 8% too, which is obviously high. 

So what are some good options for me to reduce my payments (maybe to around 300)but also not be paying this car off for another 6 years? I don't know how this works or how much I can knock off my monthly payments at this point.

personalfinance,Rolling over old auto loan into new auto loan WITHOUT trading in current vehicle,"Hey guys!

So I've been researching this question everywhere and can't seem to find a thorough answer.

Now I'm looking for a used car to purchase. Nothing new but unfortunately don't have the cash sitting around to purchase this used vehicle in full.

I have a current loan that has a remaining balance of less thank $4000 with CarMax.

I've looked into financing from Capitol One which they pre approved me. 

However the car I'm looking to get is an older model, 2004 Honda CRV which averages between $4000-$11,000. 

When I bought my current car, I was 19, first REAL job, okay credit, and in desperate need of a car. So of course I sucked myself into a bad contract. It hasn't been too bad but I could have gotten a better deal if I was more informed then. 

Well I am almost done paying it off however we're in need of a second good running car. I'm not interested in anything new and have my eyes set on the Honda.

My question is, can I/ or will any finance company(dealer or not) combine my current auto loan with the new auto loan for the Honda? WITHOUT TRADING IN MY CURRENT CAR

From what I am estimating the loan would probably be between $10,000-$15,000 depending on what year/price Honda I choose. I can afford this type of payment and there will also be a cosigner on this loan for a better interest rate.

However is rolling over old loans to new even possible without a trade in? I really love my current vehicle but again I need TWO good running cars. 

Any tips or suggestions would be great guys. Im just trying to learn before I jump in.",finance

I make enough to cover my bills, but spend most of the excess on overpriced food (my financial weakness).

I don’t drive much. I have no idea what 6 months’ worth of expenses will be, but I would bet at least 20k. I also have significant personal loans that I owe to my parents, maybe 10k in total, none of which have any interest or any strong expectation of being paid off any time soon.

I don’t believe, even with the biggest down payment I could make, that I could afford a house in the area I need to live without putting myself in financial danger. I’m also not sure if this is the best time to buy a house. I think the interest rates are low but the prices are somewhat high. Not sure.

I’m ok at budgeting, but am the type of person who spends what I have easily available, so I don’t really want this money to be liquid for too long. It seems like the sensible option would be to pay off my school loans, car payment, and personal loans first, and keep the rest as an emergency fund and try not to spend it, then feed a second retirement fund from the savings I get from not making those payments.

Does paying off large school loan as well as a very low mileage car seem like a smart way to protect myself from myself? 

My close family members, many are accountants, not sure how good, have postulated that some kind of index fund (is this the right term?) would, over time, generate more income than I would pay on interest on the school loan, so paying this off would not necessarily be the best strategy.

Other friends have suggested that interest rates are so low that picking up a house while I still can might be the best option, but I highly doubt the risk is worth it.

How to I decide? Again, my #1 goal would be to protect myself from possible future bad decisions while still not making a bad choice in order to do that.

personalfinance,Switch to fixed rate or stay variable on an Earnest loan?,"I have a question about whether to switch from a variable rate on a loan to a fixed rate.  I'd really appreciate any advice/suggestions. 

Here are the details: 
I have ~87K in an Earnest loan.  I consolidated several high-interest student loans a little over a year ago at 4.15%.  The current interest rate on my consolidated loan is 4.91% variable (able to be increased up to 9.95%).  It has gone up steadily over the course of the year, much more within the past 2-3 months.  The rate is tied to the 1-month LIBOR.  I have 12 years, 9 months until it's paid off (though I plan to start paying it down much more quickly within the next 2-3 years).  

I am concerned about the rate increasing more and more.  Would it be smarter to lock myself into a (somewhat higher) fixed rate now?  I could get a fixed rate of 5.73% from Earnest for a term of 15 years - monthly payment of $727.  

I wonder if this is a better long-term bet than the rate potentially blowing past that within a matter of months.

personalfinance,"Why do banks, such as Ally, offer lower interest rates on seemingly inferior products? Whats the point, if","I'm just wondering if I'm missing something here.

I've been looking at Ally Bank's services, and they have a savings account at 1.15%.  AFAIK, there are no hidden fees, no minimum, and there is a limit of  6 transactions per month.

At the same time, they also offer the No Penalty CD with 1-1.5% interest.  Similar to a regular CD, except you can withdraw the entire balance with no penalty after a week.

But then.. they have the 3-mo and 6-mo CDs with less than 0.67% interest.  Why do these even exist?  Why would anyone choose the 3-mo or  6-mo CD if they can just throw it in the savings or No Penalty CD?",finance
personalfinance,Ineligible for federal Financial Aid. What are my options?,"I didn't take school seriously the last time I was enrolled. 8 years later, I'm paying for it. I'm on academic probation, and just found out I am not eligible for Federal Aid. I remember once using a program through the school that allowed me to make monthly payments throughout the semester. I can't find any info on the school website about it, and don't remember the name of the company. Google search for the company only brought up big private lenders like sallie mae, and credit card companies that offer student loans. I should be able to have most of the money by the time school starts, and will make enough to have it paid off in full by the end of the semester. I don't plan on staying in debt long (do we ever?) but I simply won't have it all up front. What are my options? My credit score is ~705. Edit: I just changed jobs, so a bank loan isn't likely to happen. Thanks for the help :)",finance

Among the options are 10, and 15 year loans with the same interest rate. Are there any differences between how my interest is calculated in these loans?

personalfinance,How much life insurance should I purchase as an apparently healthy 26 yo female?,"One of the many benefits my employer offers is life insurance- they pay for $50k, I have the option to pay for an additional amount. 


A breakdown of my current debts:

Mortgage co-signed with my fiance: $174k 

Student loans: $30k (federal)

Car loan: $20k


Here are my thoughts: My student loans will die with me. The car (2016) loan is in my name only. We have a 2014 car that is 100% paid off, title in hand. If I pass, the bank will take back the car, unless my fiance wants to pay it off (which he won't, he would just use the 2014 car). So, my only real debt that he would be left with is the mortgage.

Currently, I am the main source of income for us. I make $90k on ProSal. He is a first year resident and makes $55k, but has a larger student debt burden ($80k), so most of his income goes to loans. If I were to pass, I would like him to be able to: pay for my funeral (probably cremated), pay off the mortgage, live comfortably through residency. 

My plan was to pay for an additional $150,000 to make a total life insurance policy of $200,000. Does this amount seem adequate to cover what I want it to? The additional $150k is $5.05 every paycheck (paid bi weekly). I can increase to $175k for $5.90 per pay check, or $200k for $6.74 per pay check, all the way up to $350k for $11.79 per pay check. 

I also did the same thing for an accidental death and dismemberment policy- employer pays for $50k, I elected for an additional $150k for $1.38 per paycheck, can go up to $350k for $3.23 per paycheck.

Thanks! :)",finance
