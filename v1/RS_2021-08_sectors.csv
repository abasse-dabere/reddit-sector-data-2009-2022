personalfinance,"I feel like things are so close to picking up, but by the time they do i'll lose my stuff. What options do i have?","I think it'd be best to lay things out bullet point style since theres a bit of info to consider.

\-I'm self employed. Just got a new job that pays about $300 a week for about \~12 hours of work, give or take. Also doing alright on Fiverr and Upwork making about \~$100-$200  a week combined  
\-I start that job probably monday, the boss had some issues come up with family, said we'd start monday  
\-Until earlier this month, i was drawing unemployment. We all thought we were just losing federal pandemic benefits but they cut everything.  
\-After they did, i fell behind on my car payment. Now theyre looking for it. $380 payment and i was 8 days late when they turned it over to collections. Pretty heartless, but whatever.  
\-I rent my work computer through Aarons. I'm two weeks behind on it, they keep calling. I paid $40 earlier to buy some time, i've got $150 due monday.  I need it and cant make money without it right now.  
\-I did manage to pay my rent and lights, so theres that.  
\-Also have another interview tomorrow to make another $200 a week.  
\-Waiting on $1800 tax break refund, but they cant give me any sort of timeline on when ill get it. Most people already got theirs, so im hoping its very soon.

I've thought about trying for personal loans. But even though i've been rebuilding my credit score, im still only at 590.(Was 320 this time last year) I cant find anyone to approve me with my score where its at.   
I also heard about some of the subs on here. Looked and i dont fit the requirements to make a post. Tried to find a facebook one instead but wow, there are a TON of scammers.  
I dont have any family to turn to. All my friends are even more screwed than i am. I've got money coming in but by the time it does, i'll lose my ability to make more and i'll end up losing everything shortly after.   


My question is, what options do i have? Is there anything available to me to help get those payments in time? At the very least, i need to pay the $150 on my computer. If i have to, i can bide time with the car but not for long. Any advice is appreciated.",finance

stocks,"Robinhood &amp; Me: or How I Got Screwed ... recording with ""Highest Level Of Escalation""","Looking for help/direction here, not sure what my next step is, if there is one. Most of this is in the intro to the the video that contains the full hour long conversation I had with ""Joe"" who introduced himself as ""the highest level of escalation that you can get above a manager."" From the Robinhood IPO Roadshow I believe this to be Joe Iraci VP Enterprise Risk. Since he blocked me on Twitter ...

Morning of 6/25 woke up giddy ready to buy some AMC as I had made a deposit and thought it should be cleared. INSTEAD. Woke up with a deficit. Panicked I called my bank. Money was there, they refunded the NSF charges. Called Robinhood support, on with them for about 40 minutes. Explaining it's a bank error, how I can I fix this since now my access to ""instant deposits"" are restricted, how can I get them the money, trying to make sure that since it didn't go through is there a chance they would run it through again because then stuff would be bouncing for real. I'm told it'll be escalated.

* edit: As it seems some might have misunderstood, I didn't call making excuses or asking for more time. I was asking them how to resolve it right then and there.

As I'm anxiously awaiting, approximately 9:45 am, less than two hours later they liquidated my stocks. I couldn't breath. Support couldn't have told me, warned me? Now I'm deep red.

Monday I call support. Speak with ""Matt"" for about 30 minutes who is often referred to in the video/phone call with Joe. Matt asks me to send the copies of the NSF charges being refunded as it might help him escalate this quicker. He also stated that I should not initiate a new deposit as it could interfere with getting my ""instant deposits"" restrictions removed. Keep in mind I only care about the ""instant deposit"" feature as a means to put money in there to fix all this. I send the screen grabs. Within two hours they liquidated all of my options.

After many emails, most of which just type of blaming me, sorry this is not what you want to hear, case closed. I'd write back, would be told it's being escalated. On 6/17 I got one from Cameron and this line was the gut punch:

*""even without access to the Instant Deposit feature, if we could see you had initiated transfers that would be sufficient to cover your margin call, we would not have needed to liquidate positions while we waited to confirm those transfers landed successfully. Even though this may have taken five trading days to land, you still had the option to initiate deposits to cover the call.""*

Part of my reply:

*""FULL STOP. Caps aren’t meant to be aggressive but THIS WAS NEVER communicated to me. I was wiped out because I didn’t simply redo the deposit. You realize there were loses incurred? And all I had to do was redo a deposit despite being told that instant deposits were not available by tech support. I have contended since the beginning of this entire fiasco that what my issue was was that I was not given any way to remedy the situation, not informed by support on either liquidation that they were about to take place though they were BOTH within an hour. GO listen to the tapes. At NO TIME did anyone say “all you have to do is redo the deposit.” My entire account raped and pillaged because of the seemingly poor use of the word “instant” deposits. Your support does not know how to articulate anything other than sympathy and cant, out of the hour or more I spoke with them, when I’m begging them telling them repeatedly I HAVE THE MONEY, I HAD the money to start with. If there was any confusion that’s something support should have understood because the only recollection that I had was asking “But if I made a deposit it wont help because I don’t have instant deposit?” YES IT WOULD HAVE HELPED … APPARENTLY. ""*

My case got elevated again, this time to Sabrina on the 13th who said: *“Robinhood accounts are entirely self-directed. This means that all transactions made are the responsibility of the account holder. Given this …”*

Partial reply from me:

*""It is undeniably clear that the reason I suffered such devastating losses and endured such excruciating emotional distress is directly a result of your support directing me to do the opposite of what you and Cameron say I should have done. Your statement:*

*“Robinhood accounts are entirely self-directed. This means that all transactions made are the responsibility of the account holder. Given this,”*

*is unsupported by the facts as detailed multiple times to multiple people including yourself. I was told, in no uncertain terms, by Robinhood staff that I SHOULD NOT initiate another deposit. My actions were not self-directed, they were directed by Robinhood. This invalidates the erroneous and conclusionary “Given this.""*

More escalation till Joe. Joe, in my humble opinion, was trying the white hat approach hoping I'd say, I don't know, anything that might be used against me. But I think it did more to bolster my position than anything else. He continually goes back to this timeframe that doesn't make sense when it would have taken me ten seconds to initiate a deposit. He says ""this occurred on the 25th and you called Mike on the 28th"" ... well I actually called ON the 25th also. About Mike telling me NOT to initiate a deposit he said:

*""What he was basically referring to is that the and I don't think he communicated it well. And that's kind of why I want to kind of come to this is that if the events have already occurred. So this occurred on 25th. And when you're calling Mike, the reason why they don't initiate is because there's really no there's no remedy that situation is still deposit, the same outcome will occur.""*

But NO, my options weren't liquidated yet. He goes on:

*""So what so I think that might be and I think when we are looking at these, and especially, obviously my job is to go backwards coaching opportunities will occur. Similar representative telling you the that he could have deposited is very, very, very small windows martensitic, the other five in the morning, and trying to make a deposit. That theoretically, you could have done it. Yes. Realistically, there's a very small window, and it's very bad outcomes that we wouldn't have.""*

The way me makes this ""tiny window,"" which was actually hours on the 25th &amp; 28th sound like they were some herculean task, as if I would have had to rob a Brinxs truck, loaded up bags upon bags of dollar bills, hoofed it over to my bank where they would have had to send it to them by pony express.

It's all bullshit and doesn't *seem* legal to me. I'm just fucked beyond in every aspect over this and at a loss how to go about doing anything about it, which is what I assume they count on. I've come to think that's why they target retail, cuz they can fuck em over easier than someone who defend themselves.

... for the record, everything above is ""allegedly."" ...

I don't plan on staying here for more than 2 years, don't plan on selling anytime soon either, rather will put it on rent and buy a bigger place. 

Is it worth refinancing? What I am getting from Loan Depot - 

1. 15 year at 1.99% on $251,500, which will make monthly payment $1909 with closing costs of $5874 which includes buying 1.1 points (1 pt = $2785). They claim this is most advantageous for me as my lifetime interest savings is $44,153
2. 20 Year at 2.625% on $250,000, which will make monthly payment $1632 with closing costs $3017 - $1695 (deducting points dunno how much). They claim in this scenario, my lifetime interest savings is $21,781
3.  30 year at 2.875% on 250,000,  which will make monthly payment $1329 with closing costs of $3017 - $1783 (deducting some points).

If I'm reading this right, I'm not sure why both scenarios have loan amount over $250k even though my current mortgage left is $5-6k lower and adding closing costs makes it $12k more out of my pocket in the long run.

My objective for refinance is when I put it on rent, the rent and mortgage offset each other and I'm not paying out of pocket, and my house would go on rent for around $2100-2300 right now but based on the refinance quotes I've gotten, I am not sure if its worth refinancing if I'm paying hefty closing costs. Even though monthly rates would be lower than rent but is it advantageous for me to refinance or leave my mortgage as is...what do you think?",finance

The reason behind this I will be applying for PSLF and will be trying to have my income low so my payments to repay the loans are low as well as fund my retirement. Plus, I would like an account to invest/save for buying my first home within the next 3-5 years.

personalfinance,Considering buying a house. Have lots of personal questions. AD military.,"So some context. Sorry for the long read fyi but I need some opinions.

24 y/o E4 military, $53,452 annual salary, including allotted 1272 for bah monthly to pay for a house that’s non taxable,change of my income is untaxable due to allowances, about 3900$ post tax take home monthly. 
I have about 500$ in debt monthly on a Tacoma I bought a year ago, 28k left on the loan. This is my only source of debt. My Debit to income ratio is about 22.1%and I have about a 7k savings 5k in my tsp. No dependents. 770 credit score. I plan on staying in Vegas whether I stay I’m the military or not and have a secure 4 years here until 06/25.

I recently pcs’d to Nellis AFB and have been renting with a roommate for the past 7-8 Months. Lease was coming up soon so I figured I’d look into buying as a particular townhouse I wanted has been on the market for a 2 weeks. I personally know the sellers now, and they had it listed at 305,000. They are retirees looking to move to somewhere cooler than Las Vegas, and appreciate other active duty members. They recently had a VA appraisal completed and it was appraised at 282,000 and passed inspection w no major discrepancies as it’s a fairly new house. I’m NOT looking at this as an investment property but it’s a 1600sqft 2bd 2.5 bath double master so it’s there if I changed my mind way later down the road

Sellers were willing to do 267k w a 12% sellers concession if I was serious and gave me a friendly discount. Immediately I thought it was too good to be true, but after going and talking to a real estate agent I was told that would be a great deal and the owner still strands to make 50k since purchasing it in and all the renovations. Went out, got preapproved for a VA loan at 2.350 through VU, 2.5% funding fee, down to 1.8% if I used a real estate agent they recommended instead of my current one. 

the thing that excited me about this particular townhouse: It has a good hoa according to neighbors, major things like roof has been been done in 2018, new appliances 1 year ago, a/c replaced last year, energy efficient windows placed this year, new floors, epoxied 2 car garage a year ago, really a lot of the major things covered.

Basically I’m contemplating if I should jump at this because it’s good timing for me however I feel I could stave off buying a house for another year and room it up and save maybe another 10-15k over a year. Or maybe I could purchase the townhouse and get a roommate that way instead of renting.
Finally, got it priced out: Debt to income would rise from 22.1 to 46% if I went solo on a mortgage with no roommates 


1. Should I save a bit longer? Wait to buy a house? Rent for another year? 

2. Get the place and rent rooms out? I feel as though it’s a good interest rate and a good price. I could sell the tacoma for about what I bought it for 42k in this market, been offered more actually, but I kind of intended on it being a forever vehicle.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
business,Fed's Brainard: Can't wrap head around not having U.S. central bank digital currency,,finance
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin ticks most boxes,"Given the nascent stage of evolution of block chain technology and crypto currencies based on it, the cautious approach is understandable. However, the caution must be pragmatic and should not transgress to typical dogmatic paradigm.

In my view, the real debate is whether the world needs an independent reserve currency for cross border transactions; given that the unmindful printing of fiat currency by the respective large central banks in past two decades has perhaps diminished the credibility of the popular global currencies USD and EUR.

A broad evaluation of Bitcoin (or any other widely accepted cryptocurrency for that matter) highlights that Bitcoin may meet all prerequisites of a good currency – e.g., medium of exchange, store of value and unit of measurement. As evident from the following evaluation table, the advantages of Bitcoin, as an evolved independent digital currency, outscore gold on some parameters. It also outweighs any fiat currency that is not backed by real assets. 

Insofar as the criticism of Bitcoin for its volatility and opaqueness is concerned, I note that 100yrs ago, USD was not much coveted asset outside USA. Aluminium, Gold, Silver, Slaves, cows, etc., have all reigned as widely accepted currencies in history.

 

[Comparison](http://imgur.com/a/SbX1Q8Q)


Gold vs Bitcoin

For many centuries, Gold was the most popular currency – store of value, medium of exchange and unit of measurement. However, with evolution of paper currencies and metric system, the usage of gold as a medium of exchange and unit of measurement declined significantly.

In past couple of centuries, Gold has served as reserve currency whenever the paper currencies have lost faith of people due to a variety of reason, particularly high inflation and fiscal profligacy. It has also been used as such during transition periods in global strategic power equilibrium. However since end of Breton Wood agreement in 1971, gold has not been used as reserve currency. Post fall of Berlin Wall in 1989 the strategic supremacy of USA, and consequently USD, has remained mostly unchallenged.

The demand of gold as store of value is a deeply complex matter. In past gold had been a preferred asset to store value both during economic (especially hyperinflation) as well as political (including geo-political) crises. 

In 1970s the world faced serious stagflation as the demand generated by post WWII reconstruction activities faded and Iranian revolution created a worldwide energy crisis. Gold jumped 10x in real terms during the decade of 1970-1980), to give back most of the gains in the following two decades.

Again in the decade of 2000s, as the dotcom bubble hit the global economy, interest rates crashed leading to sub-prime crisis that culminated in a major global financial crisis. The gold jumped 5x in real terms during this decade (2001-2011).

Presently, the gold prices are only marginally higher than the highs recorded in 2011. Whereas Bitcoin has risen almost 1000% since 2011. Like gold in 2001-2011, Bitcoin has risen 5x since outbreak of Covid19 pandemic, whereas gold is higher by about 5% in this period. The question is whether unconsciously markets are replacing Gold with Bitcoin.

Is Bitcoin replacing Gold

When economics fails in providing solution to a problem of livelihood and sustainability, philosophy always provides the answer.It is a natural instinct of human being to look up to the skies for guidance when all our efforts fail. (Some even do so without making any effort at all!) Religion has therefore been an inextricable part of human life since beginning of the civilization. 

Most ancient cultures, China, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley etc. have believed in continuation of life after death. Gold being an indestructible (and therefore sacred) object had always been an important part of their religion, culture, traditions and beliefs. It naturally evolved as symbol of power and prestige over time. The church &amp; temples, kings &amp; feudal lords hoarded and displayed gold to asset their power and status.

In past one century, especially past three decades, the factors like popularity and spread of technology in common man's life; rising fascist and communist tendencies due to worsening socio-economic disparities; rise in electronic transactions (personal, social and commercial) thus lower risk (less travel, less physical transactions &amp; deliveries); emergence of new articles of luxury to serve the vanity needs of the affluent; stronger and deeper social security programs; demise of monarchy and feudalism; popularity of spiritualism over rituals; dissipation of church &amp; temples, etc., have all led to sustainable decline in traditional demand and pre-eminence of gold.

In the modern context, technologically challenging things, e.g., Bitcoins, certainly find greater favour with investors as compared to gold.

Conclusion

To conclude, I would say that the ultra-loose monetary policy prevalent in most developed countries shall have to end at some point in time in foreseeable future. This suppression of savers and poor cannot continue into perpetuity. However, ending this tiger ride may not be easy and would require some innovative measures.

For example, the following is one of the scenarios that is potentially possible—

·         US Government and Fed decide to correct the fiscal and monetary indulgences of past couple of decades, by material devaluation of USD and letting USD retire as global reserve currency; settle trade and currency dispute with China agreeing to restore the global trade balance.

·         Global commodities are no longer priced predominantly in USD. The share of neutral currencies (cryptocurrencies) increases substantially in global trade.

·         Consumption pattern change materially. The consumption of fossil fuels, steel, chemicals etc. declines structurally.

·         Digital transformation leads to material rise in productivity, further adding to deflationary pressures created by aging demography of the developed world; thus alleviating the fears of hyperinflation and need to resort to gold as reserve currency.

This may sound fanciful but is not totally unlikely.

There could be many similar or different solutions to end this tiger ride of quantitative easing, negative rates, and suppression of poor (people, economies and regions). Out rightly, rejecting the need and importance an independent currency at this stage could prove to be fatal.

The question, whether Bitcoin would be emerge as the independent global currency would best be answered by time. I would though not reject the probability. Nonetheless, Bitcoin (cryptocurrencies in general) has assumed the status of a popular alternate asset and there is no reason to despise it, just because its price in USD terms is highly volatile presently.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation - explained.,"By now, I am sure everyone even remotely interested in Cryptocurrencies (and for the purpose of this thread, Bitcoin) has heard the key pro-Bitcoin argument that it can serve as a hedge against inflation. But why exactly is that?

*Heads up, long post ahead. I encourage you to read it all, as you might learn something new. If not, I understand, so here’s a TLDR: Bitcoin good - fiat bad.*

**First, it is important to understand what inflation really is. Welcome to economics 101!**

In simple terms, inflation can be defined as the decline of a currency’s (be it the Euro, the Dollar or the Yen) purchasing power over time. What this means, is that the same unit of a currency used to purchase a basket of goods today, will purchase fewer items in the future. Look at the following figure for illustration:

[See why inflation is a bitch?](https://preview.redd.it/eegh41le8re71.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e45e86cd6cd75b1a82e0bc7cf450ba7e7965e3)

***Inflation can thus be viewed as a measure of rising prices of goods and services in an economy.***

You might then naturally wonder - **what drives inflation?**

Various factors drive prices or inflation in an economy. Typically, inflation results from an increase in production costs or an increase in demand for products and services. These are the 3 most common drivers:

1. Cost-push inflation.

Cost-push inflation occurs when prices increase due to increases in production costs (usually raw materials and/or wages). Whereas the demand for goods remains unchanged, the supply of goods declines due to the higher costs of production. As a result, the added costs of production are passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices for the finished goods.

2. Demand-pull inflation

Demand-pull inflation is typically caused by strong consumer demand for a product or service. This surge of demand leads to a general price increase, which, in the long term, can echo throughout the economy, raising costs for other goods too. The result is demand-pull inflation.

3. Expansionary fiscal policy

An expansionary [fiscal policy](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-fiscal-policy/) by governments is commonly used by central banks to lower interest rates. As a result, the amount of discretionary income for both businesses and consumers typically increases. This often leads to consumers purchasing more goods, driving an increase in demand for goods and services, leading to price increases.

*Interesting fact - inflation and unemployment maintain an inverse relationship, represented by the* [Phillips curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/phillipscurve.asp)*. Low levels of unemployment correspond with higher inflation, while high unemployment corresponds with lower inflation and even deflation. This puts governments in a tricky trade-off situation - focus more on inflation, or on unemployment?*

Now off to the more interesting parts!

**While inflation is generally considered to be a positive sign of a healthy economy, it is becoming increasingly unwise to hold your savings in cash due to cash losing its purchasing power over time.** 

As a result, the smart investor (and that would be you!) will tend to turn his/her hard earned money into a store of value investment - **such as Bitcoin!**

*Side note: for an asset to be considered a store of value, it should be expected to hold its purchasing power over time, meaning that it should either remain stable - or increase in value.*

An assets considered to be a good hedge against inflation is called a “hard asset”. These are its key properties:

Scarcity: A limited supply means that greater demand will likely push prices up.

Accessibility: The market will value and accept the asset.

Durability: The assets will continue to gain demand over time.

*Okay. Now that we’ve understood what inflation is, its drivers are and what a hedge against it is - we can dig into the juicy part…*

**What makes Bitcoin a hedge against inflation?**

&amp;#x200B;

* Bitcoin can’t be manipulated by governments adjusting interest rates or printing more money to achieve policy goals.
* Just like gold and other scarce stores of value, the conventional wisdom around Bitcoin is that it should rise in price over time. Sure, it has its spikes and bottoms, but its overall trend has been just that. Steadily increasing over time.
* It’s a much more convenient way to store and transmit value than gold — it can simply be sent over the internet.
* As we’ve learned, scarcity is one key to making a store of value resistant to inflation. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. As of February 24, 2021, 18.638 million Bitcoins have been mined.
* This hard cap of new supply over time makes Bitcoin predictable in a unique ways (unlike gold): no new bitcoin can ever be “discovered.”

&amp;#x200B;

*Fun fact: Around every ten minutes, miners process a new block and 6.25 bitcoin are added to the network. In 2024, the mining reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoin, and will decline by half again every four years until all bitcoin is mined. This was designed into the Bitcoin protocol and is known as the halving.*

**Now, you might logically wonder - does Bitcoin experience inflation?**

Technically, the answer is yes. As more Bitcoin is mined, it experiences inflation. However, because the amount of new bitcoin is automatically reduced by 50% every four years (the halving), Bitcoin’s inflation rate also decreases.

So for as long as Bitcoin’s purchasing power continues to rise vs. the fiat (*blehhh*) we usually compare it to, Bitcoin’s few-percent annual rate of inflation isn’t a major factor to consider. 

**If you made it this far - congratulations! You are ready to graduate from the Cheeseburger university.** ***Hooray!***

Thank you for reading, and I hope you learned something new. Now do your future self a favour, and go buy some Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Is BTC truly a hedge against a failing economy?,"BTC is widely considered to be a strong hedge against inflation and a failing economy (as is crypto in general) - primarily due to capped total supplies or deflationary tokenomics.

In extreme scenarios i.e. third-world, developing or war-torn nations, this is undoubtedly true. BTC offers an economic lifeline to those in, e.g., Venezuela, who experienced +65,000% inflation in 2018.

[Annual correlation to BTC. Source: VanEck, Feb 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/f78ysycyhre71.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f386fad5d1a75ae7bfb38bb9d9e5a360de2b4d24)

However, in 2020, this correlation began to strengthen - with BTC now displaying, in particular, a moderate correlation (0.34) to Gold (a classical hedge). Interestingly, these correlations, so far, have weakened in 2021.

To put this into perspective, the S&amp;P 500 showed a correlation to U.S. Real Estate and Oil of 0.73 and 0.34 respectively (between 2012-2020).

**Conclusion**: BTC typically moves independently of the wider economy, as expected for a niche and nascent market. But as institutional investment increases and the space grows, this may no longer be true going forward.

Does this mean you can safely ignore the wider economy? **NO!**

The above data shows *global* correlations. BTC has and will always show *local* correlations:

[Correlation between S&amp;P 500 and BTC. March-August 2020 i.e. COVID-19.](https://preview.redd.it/vctr37h2jre71.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c31c5f8dcd42daa67c2c19a7b88ac761502208be)

There is no causation here. The S&amp;P 500 and BTC simply respond to the same macro-economic stimuli - inflation/liquidity injections, world events (e.g. COVID-19) and so forth. **In times of economic uncertainty, people will liquidate assets regardless of what those assets are.**

It's also important to remember that BTC was created in response to the last, significant crash (2008). BTC will be battle-tested now going into 2022 - arguably for the first time - as the full effects of COVID-19 and reckless federal reserve policy hit.

Ultimately, if the economy crashes, so will BTC. There is no way around that - the economy will take everything with it.

**Is BTC truly a hedge against a failing economy?** IMO, not yet or it remains to be seen, but it has potential. This subreddit is an echo chamber and it's easy to have tunnel-vision when investing in crypto - as if no other economies or assets exist. My advice to you is to avoid this, educate yourselves and keep an eye on the wider economy. It *will* affect your portfolio.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,An overlooked problem with the future of Cryptocurrency,"Everyone knows that crypto has occasionally been used in crime. It was that backbone of unregulated markets like Silk Road, it has been used as a vehicle for money laundering, and in some cases, it has been used for tax evasion. 

Sometimes cash is used in illegal transactions, cycles through the economy and ends up at a bank; if you end up receiving this cash from a bank it's not an issue. You received the money in good faith and from a federally regulated distribution method. There is no reasonable method for you to determine whether or not that exact serial number of bill was used in a crime, and it can be proven in court that you obtained it through legal means. This, however, is a substantial problem for cryptocurrencies.

Crypto is generally non-fungible. This means each ""coin"" is identifiable from another. Crypto is also completely traceable. The structure of the blockchain is essentially a ledger within which the entire history of each transaction of each coin is contained (excepting privacy-based coins, but they have a much larger issue that I'll touch on later). Also, crypto is considered a commodity in most places including the US. This creates huge problems for owners of potentially tainted coins.

When we fire up the ol' US Code in reference to stolen goods, we learn:

"" Whoever receives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of any goods, wares, or merchandise, securities, or [money](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=18-USC-74526880-980243310&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113:section:2315) of the[ value ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=18-USC-82420049-980243310&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113:section:2315)of $5,000 or more, or pledges or accepts as security for a loan any goods, wares, or merchandise, or securities, of the[ value ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=18-USC-82420049-980243310&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113:section:2315)of $500 or more, which have crossed a [State](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=18-USC-80204913-980243306&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113:section:2315) or United [States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=18-USC-80204913-980243306&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113:section:2315) boundary after being stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken, knowing the same to have been stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken; or ...

... Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. ""

This is bad. When you own crypto, you have access to the ledger that can prove the history of that commodity. If you receive a stolen car but didn't check with authorities on its history, you still received stolen goods as it is your responsibility to verify whether it was obtained through legal means. It has yet to be determined whether it is reasonable to assume a normal person should verify each of their coins have a clean past, but it would be a very easy way for the authorities to clamp down on the broader crypto market by requiring proof that each coin in your possession has not been used in a crime.

Lots of crypto has been tainted by money laundering. Tumblers are a common method of cleaning currency. They act as a big jar, where everyone tosses in their coins, the jar is shaken, and you receive the same amount of currency back. If you put your crypto through a tumbler to simply increase privacy, you may receive crypto back that was used in a crime or stolen. The criminal's problem has now become your problem.

I can already tell you what the first comment is going to say, ""Monero doesn't have these problems!"" That's where you are wrong. If a government determines that a privacy coin aids in money laundering, the use of that asset would be easily made illegal altogether. Google ""Liberty Reserve"" for a case study.

In conclusion, will a precedent be set that enforces someone to know the history of their crypto? I am not sure, but it wouldn't be a stretch considering the blockchain is a big ledger. This isn't an immediate problem, but one we should be aware of as we go forward.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,History of the US Dollar and the Future of the Global Financial System (Part 2),"This series aims to give everyone a very important history lesson on the US (dollar), and subsequently the future of the global financial system. 

**Part I** touched upon the Federal Reserve and it’s involvement in WWI, this part will cover the Treaty of Versailles and the Roaring 20’s leading to the Great Depression (and the global impact those would have).

**Treaty of Versailles:**

I assume y’all have all learned about that one. The reparation costs Germany had to supposedly pay back to England, France and Italy, when in reality this entire contract was created by the US (‘Dawes plan’ - American banker who would later become Vice President of the US; and later the  ‘Young plan’ - also an American industrial leader).
This entire thing was manufactured for one reason, which was to enable the UK, France and Italy to pay back their loans to the US, which obviously they wouldn’t have been able to otherwise since they were broke at the end of the war. 

Ironically, in order to actual make those reparation payments, Germany borrowed money from the US again 🤦‍♂️, and thus the cycle closed. - Btw final rate of payment originally should have been 1988, a small 70 year credit.

**Roaring 20’s and Global Financial Crash:**

The 1920’s aka the Roaring 20’s were all about lending money, creating a gigantic credit bubble around the world. The big American banks were handing out credits left and right, this time to both their own population but also continued to do so around the world (for example, the US kept financing the Weimarer Republic). The only problem (for the big banks) with that was that through all this money being spent within the county, thousands of smaller banks started to emerge and hand out often cheaper loans than the big banks would. This is important, because you have all heard about the Great Depression, which started in 1929 after a gigantic financial crash in the US. 
Now this part is NOT officially confirmed, however if you look at what happened during this crash (the FED suddenly raised interest rates during a time were so many loans were handed out), the only banks that profited of that crash were the big ones, while over 10,000 smaller banks had to close permanently, they took over all the business. 

Since those banks had given massive loans to Germany (Weimar Republic) as well, the crash of 1929 had similar repercussions, the banking system would end up heavily concentrated, however more importantly, the state itself ran into some serious debt issues, unable to pay back the loans, leading to the reduction of social spending and rising unemployment.
As so often in history, if a country is doing especially bad, like Germany ended up doing at the beginning of the Great Depression, it leaves the country and it’s citizens very vulnerable to manipulation. 
Thus began the rise of the Nazis in Germany, made possible by the FED. 

Some of you might say that this sounds made up, however it is not. If you need more convincing, the FED eventually meets up with Adolf Hitler (shortly before he was Reichskanzler) on the “Obersalzberg”, to establish their cooperation. Subsequently, the FED pretty much financed most of Hitlers war machine going forward (eg tons of loans, investments into German companies, cooperation with American companies etc.), enabling him to lead WWII. In case you’re thinking that the Americans were not aware what Hitler was doing (lmao), he had already published his “Mein Kampf” book where he very accurately described all of his goals (Lebensraum), his Anti-Semitism, and more.

personalfinance,Need help understanding this “investing” thing,"I always hear it around, everyone talks about:

“Always invest your money”
“Instead of letting your cash sit around and collecting nothing, invest it!”
“If you had invested instead of saved you would have had x amount of money in x amount of years”


Cool. This seems to be the best thing to do then, right? Why doesn’t everyone do this “investing” thing since they have nothing to lose. Instead of money sitting around, let it make you money. Seems pretty straight forward, or is it??

I always have been taught that if someone is too good to be true then it might as well be. 

What do people invest in?
What are the risks?
How do I go about starting my first “investment”?

Sure there are stock markets but that seems like a gamble than it is an investment.

“It’s only a gamble if you don’t know the stock market”

Cool, I’d rather spend time learning coding practices to help improve my performance at work.

“Ok then have a savings account that gives you a good interest rate for your savings annually”

Ok that’s fair advice, however, the money earned after x amount of years doesn’t even come close to what people can make with “real investing”. 

What are people doing to invest? How do I make the cash I have sitting around make me money?

“Investing is a broad and you can invest in whatever you want such as opening a business”

High risk high reward, I get it. But there are people making it seem if they put 5k in dollars into this investment-that gives you 12% in return in some years. What is that they’re talking about?

CryptoCurrency,What are securities and how does this make crypto vulnerable to regulation by the SEC?,"**TL;DR - There is a lot of overlap between some crypto projects and how a security is defined. We should anticipate regulation at some point, but the impact can be minimized. Our best protection may be more decentralization and community involvement.**

I'll preface this by saying I'm not an expert on this, just someone who got curious and did research; it's just my thoughts based on what I found. I'd love for some of the more expert community members to weigh in on this. This also isn't intended as FUD, more as raising awareness of where crypto may need to head in order to lessen the impact of regulation when it comes.

First, what is a security? Basically, it falls into at least one of these categories: debt securities or equity securities. There are also hybrid securities that combine elements of the two. I'll focus less on those because I don't see that being used much here. More clearly defined, the two are:

**Debt securities**: represent borrowed money that must be repaid and specifies amount, interest rate, and repayment or renewal timeframe. This one is interesting to me, because I think a lot of the DeFi lending platforms we have (Aave, Compound, Venus) may run pretty close to this definition. The biggest difference being that there typically is no repayment/renewal timeline. The tokens on most of these also aren't representative of the borrowed money. The exception I really wonder about is Maker/Dai. Dai is minted when we borrow, so could an argument be made that it is representative of debt? If anyone would try to make that case, it's the SEC.

**Equity securities**: represent ownership interest in an entity, like stock shares. I see this as a more likely case to be made for some tokens to be classified as securities. To me, it isn't a far stretch to say many governance tokens fit here (voting and ownership of the protocol) as well as others that aren't primarily used for transactions within blockchains and apps (which fall closer to currencies by definition).

So in short, I think there is risk to SEC regulation, and as an organization that tends to go after anyone but the largest offenders, I can see the SEC eventually moving to regulate this industry. But we can protect ourselves.

In the US, the Supreme Court has also issued guidance on how to determine if something is considered a security, known as the **Howey Test**. There are four parts: 1) there is an investment of money (check) 2) there is an expectation of profits (check) 3) the investment is in a ""common enterprise,"" often read as multiple investors pooling money into a project (check) and 4) *any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party*. 

\#4 is important. Precedent has set that if the investor's own actions largely dictate if an investment will be profitable, then that investment is probably not a security. Here is the protection crypto has. We are decentralized. If communities of investors are what drive the profits and expansion of a given token, it would not be a security and therefore outside the SEC's regulations. And this gives lots of cover, but not for everyone.

We need more decentralization. We need more community-driven projects and marketing, and less centralized entities promoting their own projects. The more we do that stuff, the more the SEC can fuck off. Thanks for listening to my ramblings.",cryptocurrency

Right now ETHBTC is breaking its downward trend and ETHUSD is about to put in another consecutive green day (12th in a row on ETHUSD/Coinbase), but BTC looks like it's going to put in another red day. Also, interest rates on USDT on Aave are going back down, meaning people are borrowing less.

algorand,The market efficiency hypothesis and why you should probably focus more on staking and governance instead of the price of ALGO,"I've noticed recently that it seems that several people are a bit disappointment with the price point of Algorand. Especially considering that other cryptocurrencies have done relatively well in the past several weeks. There are price predictions showing up everywhere. But I think it's important to realize that at any given point, the price of a token/stock is based on ALL the available information. This is the market efficiency hypothesis. So while there is a roadmap for ALGO and there will be advancements in the future, that information is still baked into the price of ALGO, as well as any other asset. This is a reason why it is so hard to accurately predict the price of any asset in the future. So I think people should focus on staking and governance rewards, and here's why. 

I don't know what the price of ALGO will be. But I do know if I stake my ALGO in the Algorand wallet, I will have more ALGO tomorrow than I will today. Even if the price of ALGO is stagnant, the 6% return is still very promising. As a frame of reference, the interest rates on savings accounts and CDs are extremely low right now. I would be surprised if you can find anything in the United States with an interest rate above 1%. 

So long story short, as long as the price is stagnant and you're staking your ALGO, you're still doing well. (Now I will weep and hope the price goes up, as I bought most of my ALGO around $1.20) :(",cryptocurrency

They're going to be hiring that out to a local installer called Elemental Energy.

personalfinance,Considering consolidating credit card debt with cash-out refinance; could use some advice (US),"The long story:
A four year process of pursuing a postgraduate degree has resulted in a great career shift and higher income, but I racked up about $20k in credit card debt through school and our recent move to a new city. 

In truth, my new income should make easy work of the CC debt, but I was also loaned some money for school in lieu of student loans. The family loans are interest free, but my plan is to pay the family loans most aggressively to show my gratitude and prevent any unforeseen stress on those family members.

Here's where I'm getting a bit lost.
We left a home that is now providing rental income of about $400/month. I have some equity in the home, and could cash out around $30k in a refinance. The rental is currently financed on a 5/1 ARM, and the arm is scheduled to adjust in early 2022. 

Would it be foolish to use a cash-out refi to payoff this credit card debt? I think I can reasonably pay off the cards in between 12-18 months which should equal interest payments in the $2000-3000 range. 

Refinancing will result in closing costs similar to to the interest paid on the credit cards, but the case would be available sooner, and debts to family could be repaid more quickly. I think the unknowns of what my ARM will adjust to and knowing that refinancing as an ""investment"" property will result in a higher interest rate have me a little lost. A 3.375% rate will cost about $5k in points. 

I know this post is all over the place, but if someone has the energy to guide me on how to approach this decision, I'd appreciate it. 

TLDR:

* $20k in CC debt
* Could probably pay off CCs in 12-18 months ($2-3k in interest charges)
* Considering a cash-out refi of an investment property to advance the process
* Property generates $400/month and is currently on the 4th year of a 5/1 ARM
* Cash-out closing costs ~$3k + $5k for points to equal a rate of 3.35%",finance

CryptoCurrency,Conspiracy theory time. BTC will be co-opted by 1% or ‘Elites’ in the coming years.,"Full disclosure just a random thought I’ve had and basically just theory with no evidence.

I think originally BTC may have started with cypherpunk and anarchical intentions. We know how BTC works so I’m not delving into that. However seeing how things are going banks, high-value individuals, all them are buying BTC in massive amounts. People are praising Michael slayor for his software company buying large amounts of BTC. Most average individuals, at this time, don’t even hold any crypto. I believe it’s something like 1% (Edit looks to be 20%) of Americans actually do.

Soon this individuals and corporations will control a majority of BTC. 

I think this defeats the purpose of BTC. When the extremely wealthy can buy massive amounts of BTC via Fiat on-ramp then all that really means is the extremely wealthy will then be total control of BTC in the coming years. There are already other cryptos (dogecoin) where a few control a massive amount of the coins. 

This puts these individuals and corporations into even great power and control not only of ‘centralized currency’ but soon decentralized currency.

Who’s to say with that much money, influence, and power can they not then hire coders for BTC chain to make favorable changes for them?

BTC is also now mined at an industrial scale which takes massive amount of power and infrastructure… who’s going to have control of that. Obviously those with millions of dollars. 

What they also know is the US dollar ‘reserve currency’ that the world currently uses, is doomed. Right now black rock and black stone two major Hedge funds, are buying up properties, land, assets, and just started dabbling with BTC.

In the end the decentralized freedom and cypherpunk nature of BTC will be dead. In coming years will see ‘federal reserve of BTC’ of some sort controlled by Govts, IMF, and wealthy elites.",cryptocurrency

[https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)
2. Draft table of contents for Mastering Cardano has been revealed. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1407165366355124225](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1407165366355124225)
3. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
4. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
5. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
6. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
7. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
8. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
9. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
10. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

12. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa.

25. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

44. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

52. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

68. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

71. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
72. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML.

73. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)

Yet I am researching crypto lending platforms for quite a while and I really want te be sceptical as the percentages are +8% APY on stable coins. 

For Hodlers to earn 8% is maybe to good te be true as the current lending rate at banks is &lt;1%. How is it possible for these lending platforms to sustain as I can't imagine someone wants to lend against 8% interest rate instead of &lt;1%?

CryptoCurrency,"DEBATE: Nano legitimately fixes a real world problem. Most of crypto doesn't ""fix"" any real world problems.","I will preface this with this. I do realize Ethereum and DeFi does provide some access to financial instruments to countries that lack access. My biggest issue with this conclusion, on the face of it, is that the cost (interest rates) and collateral is extremely high for instruments like loans and poorer countries that don't have access to banking, also wouldn't be able to use most of DeFi because of how cost prohibitive it is.

From card processing fees, bank transaction fees, merchant fees and transfer fees, there is a large cost passed on to the end user.

Companies like Visa and Mastercard charge upwards of 3.5% per transaction in fees to the merchant. On top of this, these fees are constantly increasing, with no extra benefit to the user.

Even if Nano isn't adopted, you can't ignore the fact that Nano does actually provide real world value by eliminating the ever increasing fees of parasitic middle men like Visa and Mastercard, instead of just replacing them with miners and other forms of fee-taking.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 08/02/21","Good morning everyone, I hope you enjoyed your weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* TSLA: Looking to open right around the 697-700 resistance level (from daily chart). If it's able to break through resistance, I'll be watching for opportunities to go long. If it fails, it could provide shorting opportunities. 
* XPEV: Holding up over relevant SMA's. I'll be watching for more upwards movement, particularly if it can hold up over 42. 
* BIDU: Still below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around the SMA(9) (\~169.73). Could reject and provide shorting opportunities. If it can get up and hold over 170, there could be opportunities to go long. 
* MRNA: Looking to open near ATH. I'll watch for any further momentum, but it could provide shorting opportunities at some point in the near future; daily chart looking over-extended. 
* AFRM: Looking to open around SMA(20) at \~60.80. If it can hold up over that level, I'll be watching for opportunities to go long up towards resistance at 62. Could provide shorting opportunities if it fails to get back over 61. 
* FCX: Holding up over relevant SMA's. I'll be watching for opportunities to go long, particularly if it can hold up over the 38 level. 
* LEVI: Gapping up over relevant SMA's. I'll be watching for it to hold up over 28, could provide opportunities to go long. 

Gapping DOWN:

* SQ: Could test a couple of SMA's at the \~234.30 level as support. Potential support level at 230. Could test 240 as resistance if it sees strength. 
* KDP: Seems to have failed to get over relevant SMA's in last week's trading. Could provide shorting opportunities if it continues to show weakness. Potential resistance level at 35. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning. Going into August, we have seen 6 straight months of gains in the market. Having said this, we could be in for some more volatility this month. UVXY, which tracks VIX short-term futures, has been picking up in volume on the daily chart, while volume has been drying up somewhat in other areas. This could be people hedging against an upcoming correction. Inflation rates are continuing to rise, which could cause the Fed to take action. With multiple indices hovering near ATH, I'm feeling cautious. 

SPY is trading just over 440, and could test that level as resistance/support this morning. DIA is trading a bit over 350, and I'll be watching price action around the SMA(9) at \~349.29. QQQ is trading a bit over 366 and could test ATH levels this morning. EV stocks are seeing some strength in premarket. TSLA is trading right around the 700 resistance level and is worth watching closely. XPEV and LI also worth following closely after they reported strong numbers (NIO was a bit weaker for reference). Meme stocks are up a bit in premarket trading, worth following for potential breakouts, just remember to not force trades. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why Moons could be the Bitcoin of social tokens,"Been doing a lot of thinking about this.  And no, I’m absolutely NOT calling for $100k moons.  But some things that really ought to be considered with potential value:

-Moons are earned via proof of work.  No, we don’t “mine” moons, unless you consider posting, upvoting, socializing “mining.”

-Moons are infinitely divisible, and as months go on less and less become available.  In fact, our “halving” actually happens MORE often than bitcoin.  (Roughly every 26 months. 100 X .975(reduction given out per month) X 26.

-Moons are fun and meme-able, which has buying power no matter how much the techies here want to admit it.

-Moons are already be exchanged for work AND money, and rose substantially in value while the crypto market tanked.

-again, moons are a -social- token.  BTC is wonderful as the first mover and store of value, while Ethereum is the road to the next internet.  But what if moons are the next Facebook? The Next Instagram?  Sound crazy? Well…

#Moons have true first mover advantage in this space. 

-Yes, there are other social tokens, but moons are built on a solid chain, have great tokenomics, and a large amount of them were never claimed or lost, and will not be coming back.  And they are the token of cryptocurrency news and discussion, which is growing to be a force that the world banks, fed, and governments not only can’t ignore, but are being forced to adopt lest the lose their financial advantages.

CryptoCurrency,Best Gold/Silver Backed Coins?,"Hello all,

Recently I was talking to my wife about savings, and how we're DCA'ing a percentage of anything we can save into crypto. I made the comment that, if it was up to me, I would throw it all in. This led to a conversation getting into interest rates, modern savings and banking accounts, and how holding money these days is losing money. She began to ask some questions (which got me excited) about fees and things like that. 

Of course this conversation led to questions about volatility, which of course is a good point. Bitcoin hits and ATH of \~60k per coin and subsequently gets cut in half. What if that happens to everything we put in in the future? Fair point. After this discussion, I started to look at asset backed crypto a little harder for the first time. Some of the coins that are backed by physical gold are intriguing, and maybe buying into those as a hedge isn't such a bad idea, and because the value is tied to the value of a commodity, the volatility is a little more in check. 

Searching some gold backed coins yielded way more results than I would have guessed. I had no idea how many gold backed coins there were. I'm assuming some are better than others, and having no experience with these, I wondered what asset-backed coins you have experience with, and consider reliable, accessible, and safe? What is your opinion on asset-backed coins in general, and compared with traditional crypto? Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

CryptoCurrency,The Anti-Crypto Infrastructure Bill Might Actually Make Crypto Better,"I've seen a lot of posts about the infrastructure bill and how the Federal Government plans to raise billions of dollars in revenue by taxing Crypto and forcing exchanges to basically report all transactions to the IRS/SEC.

Government interference or regulation has been hanging over the head of Crypto for a decade, since Bitcoin first appeared.  The more adoption that we obtain the more politicians that don't understand the technology cry out for regulation.  Many of the comments on this sub are basically that the politicians don't understand Crypto and these new laws will be impossible to enforce.

Think about what that would mean for a second if all of a sudden exchanges had to report to the IRS or SEC about transactions?  It would be a massive ""disruption"" to the marketplace but technology moves much faster than governments.  We already have the tools for things like privacy coins and decentralized exchanges.  Tor and privacy networks have been around for decades.

Ultimately, government intrusion into Crypto would just push the entire industry towards more privacy and decentralized exchanges.  It might slow the growth of Crypto in the short term but it would solve a massive problem in the long term.  Crypto would become something that the government would have to admit that they can't control.  Instead of coming up with laws on how to regulate it, they would need to learn how to live with it.

When you think about Crypto, isn't the absence of government regulation one of the main reasons that Crypto grew in the first place?  Governments will never let Crypto replace Fiat, they have every incentive for that not to happen.  Governments printing Fiat has become the primary source of raising funds.  If the industry is forced by the hand of government to move back into the shadows it could be just the push needed to change the direction of the Crypto industry towards a more secure future.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does an 800 vs 850 credit score make a difference in terms of interest rates?,"I had an 820 credit score and then Nissan Infiniti reported a missed payment on me when they failed to tell me their automatic payments on my lease would stop and never sent an invoice or notified me. So it went down to 720. It’s now a year later and it’s back up to 790. After never missing a payment in my life and being a customer of theirs for 6 years, they do this to me. No amount of calling or sending letters made a difference. But that’s a topic for a different thread.

I know it will be back over 800 again especially if I open up a couple of more credit accounts (which Mint.com suggests I do to improve). However I’m wondering if I should bother pursuing legal action against Nissan Infiniti to try to fight this misreporting in order to remove the discrepancy from my record and probably get my score closer to 830.

I am planning to buy my first house early 2022 and will need to take out a mortgage. My question is will the interest rates I receive on my loan be different if I have an 800 score as opposed to something closer to 850? Or do I just fall in a bracket of sorts and it doesn’t matter?",finance

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan in forbearance has due date pushed back - does this mean my payment was not applied to my principal balance? (Nelnet),"i have for the most part been not paying my Federal Loans in Forbearance because i was using the time to aggressively pay a private loan, and had fingers crossed for some sort of loan forgiveness. i'm not holding my breath on the latter, but i had nothing to really lose with no interest accrual, and only lost out on the potential to pay less interest in the long run. however, looking at my public loans in nelnet, i noticed my due date is in November when the forbearance ends in September. i'm not sure how this works then exactly, does nelnet, apply the payment across your loans and then ALSO push the due date back to give grace if you miss or reduce your payment the next month, or is that money just sort of deferred and applied to the loan the following month when it comes due? I want to pay down my principal so that i reduce the interest paid and i want to pay it off ahead of schedule.

i'm not super financially literate, but i'm trying to get better. when i look at the payment history, it breaks down how much is applied to principal and how much is applied to interest, and while it says my entire Payment has gone to principal, i'm just unsure if postponing my due date is a courtesy, or some way of preventing me from paying things down early and them getting the money they expect to make off of my loans. it doesn't say what my balance was before and after the payment, so i can't tell if it has gone down or if that money is just kind being held until a payment comes due.

finally, is there an advantage to telling them NOT to defer my due date with overpayments? will this somehow save me money, or can i theoretically just pay the whole thing off while never actually having a payment come due because of the due date being pushed back by overpayment?

On top of my skepticism for the practical value of moons for incentivization, what really makes me concerned is that MOD comments are **always** pinned to the top of a post, and MOD posts are often pinned to the top of the page—for days. 

I’m gonna call it what it is: *moon farming*. 

A few days ago, someone posted a [chart of the wealthiest moon-holders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oi16oa/first_update_top_100_moon_holders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

***NINE of the top THIRTEEN moon-holders are MODs.***

Since MODs have different powers and authorities than the vast majority of us, earning moons at the same moon/karma ratio will **always** tend towards moon inequality. While most MODs here are active members of the community who do great work, it does not change the fact that the system they support is corrupt. 

It’s like the US federal government in many ways: those who write the rules are able to make the rules more favorable for themselves over the common man. The current system is like a flat tax which favors the wealthy. Not to mention the risk of market-tanking rug-pulls by ANY of the wealthiest MODs. 

Either we mush change the ratio of moons/karma for MODs, or we must ban MOD-moons and create a separate incentive system for MODs to continue doing good work. I do not see how the current system is sustainable. 

Please discuss and tell me where I’m misunderstanding. Even if the proposed change of rules to disallow moon rewards on pinned posts/comments is allowed, it will not take away u/nanooverbtc’s 700,000+ moons. And with the rate of average moon distribution currently, it would take 24,000+ distribution cycles for anyone new to catch up.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Interest Rates August 2021,"When looking for a place to compare crypto interest rates I found most sites were either out of date, inaccurate, or didn't compare sites I was interested in. Here are the current US interest rates as of August 2, 2021. All data is pulled directly from their respective sites.

To keep things as apples-to-apples as possible, the APY rates here are all for the lowest level, tier 1, etc. rates. These are all non-staking/flexible term rates. Hope some find this data helpful. Let me know in the comments if you think I missed a site, but these seem like the more popular platforms.

personalfinance,Can I apply for medical financial assistance if I'm still in the family's plan? Also is medical financial assistance taxable?,"Will acknowledge that I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post.

personalfinance,When in the home buying process to shop around for best mortgage rates?,"I'm house hunting now as a first time home buyer (Philadelphia suburbs) and am curious when exactly I'm supposed to shop for mortgage lenders. I've been pre-approved for 2.82% (no debts, renter, 790 credit score, can put 20% down) after talking to a regional mortgage-only institution and the two very large financial institutions I bank with that also have mortgage services.

I've seen in the standard sale agreement paperwork as provided by the PA realtor's association that there's a place to include the name of the buyer's lender (Q1- that's not binding, right?) and there's a short window of time to apply for a mortgage if the offer is accepted. I'm guessing it's during that period of time I'm supposed to call up a dozen lenders and wave my number around and ask if they can beat it or not, but want to be sure before I put an offer in on any home.

Is this timeline correct? I see pretty varying numbers around for interest rates and don't want to get stuck with terms that may not be the best for me. But also don't want to do work that might be presently unnecessary. My parents and in-laws have had unusual home buying experiences their entire lives and, while wonderfully helpful in many ways, are a bit out of their depth on this one. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Interest Rate Shortcuts,"Hello! There was a recent post by u/chirographlimpedg2 about compound interest and how small investments can eventually lead to huge gains. Forgive me for being a newish poster, I'm not the best at links so forgive me for not being able to link users and their post. I have some tables that I used in college that I find very handy and wanted to share because of their ease of use. I don't mean for this to be an r/investing post, but they come in handy when I'm trying to calculate how much ETH, ADA, etc I'll have in the future. I have uploaded a PDF with the tables and coversheet here:
https://docdro.id/8f9rTwW

First, I wanted to cover the basic variables and the generalized equations. When looking at the symbols

for the table we mainly see F, P, A, 1%, and n. F= Future, P = Principal (the NOW amount), A = Annual

amount, 1% interest in terms of percentage, and n is the number of periods (years).

The main question I'm looking to solve is how much will I have at a certain time when the coin I'm looking at has a given APY. If I have $1000 now, and invest in something with a 10% interest rate (APY), what will it be worth in two years? The general formula is F=P*(1+i)^n. P (now) = 1000, -10%-.1, n=2 years. My future amount will be F=1000 (1+.1)^2 = $1,200.

This also works for the number tokens or coins I'm looking at. Since crypto varies so much, it helps me

get a better idea on how much I'll have in the future. Say I have 420 ADA. If the APY stays constant at

4.91%, and I don't touch this wallet for 7 years, how much ADA will I have? F=420*(1 +0491)^7 =

587.44 ADA.

Now for the tables. Let's skip straight to the factor table-i=12%, because what are these first couple of pages, a fiat bank? A interest rate for ants? So, the way to read these are periods (years, if using APY) on the left and the top we have categories like P/F, P/A, etc... For the example above we want to look at F/P. This means we are wanting to know F (future value) while given P (principal/present value). So Ifl have 300 of coin X with a 12% APY and I'm not adding any additional coin to it, let's see how much I have after 3 years, Go to column F/P, row 3, we have a value of 1.4049. Take 300 1.4049-421.47. The tables basically calculate our formula for us. 300 (1+.12)^3 also equals 421.47.

Another example, say I'm DCA'ing $1000 yearly into a stable coin with a return of 12%. After 10 years, how much will be in my account? Use factor table 12%, F/A (want Future value, giving annually), row 10, and the number is 17.5487. $1000 17.5487 = $17,548.70.

I have a 403b set up from my old position with $1,034. I understand that when doing an early withdrawal (I'm only 22) I will get a 10% IRS penalty, plus federal and state taxes withheld. I am a bit confused about the penalty. Is the 10% penalty taken out at the time of withdrawal, or is it paid at tax time? Is it 10% of the original amount ($1,034), or is it a penalty of 10% of my yearly income? The agent from Fidelity wasn't clear at all, so I figured I should try to seek out more information. I'm going to be at a new hospital and no longer contributing to this account.

personalfinance,Mother trusted a friend as a contractor and due to unwritten business practices now is in a bind.,"Hey guys!  Long time lurker, first time poster.  I'm really out of my depth here and want to pick your magnificent brains:

Mother unfortunately had a good deal of water damage from the ice storm across Dallas in February.  We're talking water under floorboards, busted piping and showers, inflated walls and trims, and other things.

Father is sadly no more, so this is out of the picture, but we have had friends in our community step up and help her in things outside of her scope.

Well, one of these friends is a general contractor who has done work in her home before (renovated a bathroom and reformed the front porch into a walkway).  He offered to help out and they started by seeing what they could get from the insurance agency, which came out to be around $7k, and she also had him charge $2k from her CC for some additional expenses.  Then as work was going underway, I suppose there were some upgrades along the way and the contractor told my mom to not worry about things like too much cost, making it seem like he was absorbing costs outside of this amount.

Well fast forward to 5 months later (I found out about all this as of last week) and apparently the work is still not done. Basically the floors are done, but the bathroom has almost no operating water utilities (no sinks, no shower, only a toilet).  He is not doing any more work until the price has been paid, and apparently the current total is $13000.  She's absolutely fed up with this and is now deferring this to me for whatever reason, so I am trying to consider my options.  She currently has no more money to finish payment, and I don't have $4k to lend at the moment.  He is threatening to take legal action and I have no idea if/how to deal with this.

So key red flags:

1.  There was absolutely no written agreement/contract/expectation of services/deadlines for when this was started.  It was literally a completely verbal/handshake deal (as they were friends at the start).  I suspect this is what he is using to prolong services until payment is rendered.

2.  When discussing changes like material choices, etc., The word ""upgrade"" often found its way into the conversation.  When my mother told me this, I told her immediately she should have specified she wanted ""equivalents"" or ""replacements"" to keep the costs down.  I think he took ""upgrades"" as selecting the more expensive options which drove the costs up further.

3.  As far as documentation goes, we have an itemized estimate from the insurance company and a generalized cost summary from the contractor that only totals up to $11k.  She had spoken to the insurance and somehow this guy is one of their ""preferred vendors"".  Apparently they offered to intervene (which really surprised me because I thought they wouldn't care since the check was already cut).  Not sure what communication happened on their end, but it's likely to be him defending himself in a way to make it look like he's in the most positive light possible.

4.  I cannot find any hints of his company anywhere for review (BBB, etc.) Or any significant online presence for research.  He had a website on his cost summary but it's a generic contact form to fill out and not much else.

Any and all insights are greatly appreciated!  Thank you for reading this far!

TL;DR - Mom had water damage and hired a contractor friend to repair it.  Contractor kept extracting higher costs and refuses to finish the job until the inflated cost is paid.  Mom doesn't want to deal with it and is pushing it to me instead and I have no idea what to do.",finance
CryptoMarkets,FED Targeting Crypto?? This Will Shock You!,,cryptocurrency
MachineLearning,[D] Inferring general physical laws from observations in 300 lines of code,"Inspired by a curious [paper](http://fenn.freeshell.org/Science.pdf) published in Science, I have made a tiny [demo program](https://github.com/vtereshkov/conservation-laws-inference) that infers conservation law formulas from numerical measurements using Keplerian orbits as an example. It finds the energy and angular momentum conservation formulas in less than a minute even without using a GPU.

The inference engine is fed by a simulator that generates satellite position measurements in terms of the distance r and angle φ in the orbit plane. The expected engine output is not just a set of numerical parameters but a complete conservation law formula expressed as bytecode of a minimalistic stack-based virtual machine. Each instruction is 4 bits, and a formula may have up to 16 instructions, so that the formula is completely represented by a single 64-bit integer. Such a compact representation is a key factor in speeding up the inference, compared to the Science paper. A formula may contain:

* Four floating-point variables a = r, b = φ, c = dr/dt, d = dφ/dt
* Integer constants 0 to 5
* Four arithmetical operators
* Squares (denoted by \^)
* Empty instructions (denoted by . )

Using simulated annealing, the engine finds a set of conserved quantities, which are printed in the reverse Polish notation. For example, `da^..*5/........` means (dφ/dt) r^(2) / 5 = const. If we neglect the arbitrary factor of 1/5, this is obviously the conservation of angular momentum. Similarly, `.c^d3a-*d5.5++-+` means (dr/dt)^(2) \- (dφ/dt) (r - 2) - 10 = const. This is a combination of energy conservation and angular momentum conservation laws.",technology
personalfinance,"Pay off 2% mortgage in full now, or buy VTSAX instead?","USA - Family has 650k liquid after selling property, and has 350k 10 yr mortgage debt in overseas properties at 2% interest. no income aside from these potential vtsax gains.

* Pay off the debt in full, and dump the rest ~300k in vtsax. 
* Keep and slowly pay off the debt, dump ~650k in vtsax. Use vtsax gains to pay the mortgage payments

or some other option

my initial reaction is pay off debt in full, then buy vtsax with remains. however ive also heard it is prudent to keep debt with low interest rates (whats considered low) to use the 'saved' money in higher return areas (like vtsax)

Thoughts? wondering what the pros and cons are, and under which situations/numbers would you choose the other option.

PS: in the case of the latter (slow pay debt), they already have an emergency fund. should that be increased substantially due to having debt, or are the gains from vtsax sufficient to outweigh that?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 2, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**

Stocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

In the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, “In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools”. 

As I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn’t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. 

In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. 

According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

Moreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

**Highlights**

* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, “Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \[buy now, pay later\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.”
* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.
* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).
* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, “We've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \[computer\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.” Ford suspended its dividend last year.
* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. 
   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY
   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY

personalfinance,84 month finance at low interest rate?,"Usually I finance at 60 months, but right now the difference in interest is 1.69 vs 1.99. To me that’s peanuts. I’ve got a lot of connections in the car game still, so while it may be the worst time to buy new, I can still snag a good deal.

My intention would be to pay the vehicle off sooner, but my thought process is that I could keep my payments low for when I need it low (eg. if I’m going on vacation that month, if the market is low and I want to buy a bit more, etc.) Also within the next two years I’m expecting to be moved up within my company (yes not everything is for certain but this one I’m pretty sure of) where I’d use my year end bonus to just pay off the vehicle.

I can easily afford the 60 month payments if I wanted to, but I’m not over here living pay cheque to pay cheque, so I figure why not enjoy the lower payments when I want to with little recourse.

personalfinance,Impending income loss - pay off loans or keep savings?,"Due to health issues, we're about to lose my spouse's income. Our monthly income after tax/insurance/401K will drop from about $7,900 to $4,000. We have $40k in an emergency fund that we'll have to start dipping into to stay on top of things until they are able to return to work. It could just be a few months, but it could also be 12 months, so we want to put ourselves in the best situation. 


Our immediate obligations total $3,300 a month, our other expenses (groceries, gas, childcare, etc) are around $3600/month, and we typically put ~$1000/month into various investment accounts (emergency fund, 529, IRAs, etc). The immediate obligations include $250/month towards student loans and two car loans that total $520/month. The interest rates on these loans are all in the 1.5-3.0% range. The payoffs on the student loans total $27k and the car loans would be $11k. With the glimmer of hope that student loan forgiveness will be a thing, we're reluctant to pay down the student loans faster.


While we can cut back on expenses (eg we won't need as much child care), we will have to dip into the emergency fund each month. I figure we can last 24 months without having to make tougher decisions like selling our house. However, I'm grappling with the decision about paying off the car loans. Should we take $10k from the emergency fund and pay off the car loans now? I'm intimidated by the idea of cutting 25% out of our emergency fund, but it feels like reducing our monthly expenses is the smarter move. With the current used car market, I've also considered selling one of the cars, but for now we need both so I can commute to work and my spouse can drive to frequent medical appointments.

CryptoCurrency,What digital currency accomplishes for central banks.,"It is really just a shift of power away from your personal autonomy and toward banks. If inflation runs hot, CBs can raise fees on all of your transactions to suck some heat out of the system, reducing money supply and reducing your willingness to move your money while keeping the banks’ income constant or improving. They are, after all, central planners who have long believed they can manage the economy better than a free market (which we haven’t seen in a very long time).

Digital currency increases bank profitability by having less transaction friction. At the same time, it offers you greater convenience, but at the cost of less autonomy because it gives the banks more ways to trap you into paying fees if you want to move your own money or just want to store your own money. You can’t take it outside of their management and their possession.

With CBDCs, central banks can manipulate your choices more directly. They can also monitor all that is happening in the economy down to the most finite transactions. Even if they don’t track who spent the money, they would have the potential to know what every cent was spent on and where it was spent.

Realistically, central banks don’t want negative interest rates any more than you do if they can be avoided. Negative interest rates have proven all over the world to be damaging to banks and perilous for economies to navigate. So, you can strike that off your list as a primary reason central banks want digital currencies. (In our Patron Posts we’ve seen central bankers telling each other that negative interest rates aren’t the best reason for going to CBDCs.)

Central banksters would prefer to successfully manage the economy without having to go to negative interest to stimulate the economy. As pointed out, going negative has resulted in some banks in some nations paying people to take out mortgages — not something banks inherently like to do.

The way that worked was that the mortgage holder had to make regular payments, but the bank wrote down the principle each month by more than the payment. It’s insane, and even banks know that it is not the business model they prefer. Central banks essentially forced it by creating money in reserve accounts and then penalizing banks if they held on to it.

Banks have struggled a lot to figure out how to work in a negative-interest environment when their models have been built for centuries around making money off positive interest. They’d rather not.

Beware that banks don’t fully think of the money they manage as your money. At the higher CB level, they consider all money as being their money since they created all of it out of loans they entrusted into your hands to put to specified uses, such as to buy a house or a car or inventory (“flooring”) for your auto dealership. They think less of themselves as stewards of your money than you as a steward of theirs. That high-minded central-bank attitude filters down through the system to varying degrees.

After that first collateralized loan where the purchase was specified, however, the newly created money migrates into generalized use anywhere people want to spend it. Banks would like to control what you can do with it at all stages to some extent as well as have a clearer understanding of how much if flowing where in the economy.

One example of something banks might like to control: if they create lots of new money, and you just pay off loans, that doesn’t help them because they were making interest on those loans, and now they’re not. All they did was create money for you to use to take away one of their income streams. If, for example, they create money by loaning it to the government at low interest, and the government gives it to you as a stimulus check, and then you pay off part of your highest interest loan with it, that doesn’t help the banks.

That is largely what happened with the “stimulus” checks:

“This ‘new threat’ to the U.S. economy flies in the face of conventional wisdom“:“Americans are slashing their spending, hoarding cash and shrinking their credit card debt as they fear their jobs could disappear during the coronavirus pandemic.“That is the lead in a CNN Business story this week about how U.S. consumers have been navigating one of the greatest financial curveballs the world has ever seen. MarketWatch It seems prudent, considering the climate, but how irresponsible of you not to think of serving the economic interests of the nation (and its banks) foremost in your personal financial plans.

Credit-card debt dropped by its biggest percentage in more than three decades, while savings jumped to levels not seen since the Reagan era. We can’t have that! You are taking too much responsibility into your own hands. Or, as banks would put it, you are just hording cash (which is fine when they do it, but not when you do as they don’t make money when you pay off loans, instead of taking out more).

That is good, right? Not necessarily…. “Although caution is a logical response to that uncertainty, hunkering down also poses a risk to the recovery in an economy dominated by consumer spending.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Fiance and her dad own a house that needs a refinance, and he wants to gift it to us.","Good evening PF,

My fiance and her dad own a home they bought in January of 2018 for $220,000 at 4.375 interest rate. My fiance just now realized now is a pretty good time to refinance because of the mailers she's been getting about it. 

Her dad has been talking about gifting this house to us and buying a place of his own. He's a plumber that makes good money and only ever bought the house with his daughter because he had been in a bad accident and wasn't working at the time. Both Fiance and I make 40k each working for the state. The house has $207,000 principle balance left. We have no intention to sell the house in the foreseeable future (3-5 years)

My rookie knowledge says that the process should go something like this: shop around for the best rate, even from online lenders, then take those rates to to banks and credit unions and see if we can reduce our closing costs as much as possible. go through the process of a refinance at what should be a better rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage, but the new mortgage will be in mine and my fiance's name. Once all of that is finalized file quit claim deeds to transfer the dad's name off of the house and add me in his place.

First time ""buying"" a home and would appreciate any and all advice. Doesn't seem like I will be able to avoid PMI, and I don't understand if/how an appraisal that would presumably raise the value of the house in this market might alter the situation.

I have no major debts, maxed out 401k, and try to put at least $3,000 into RIRA every year, with 30k in savings accounts. This is in FL.",finance

We have excellent credit and cash to cover any gap between what we can get as a loan vs what it costs, but am wondering which options will provide the best interest rates.

personalfinance,Should I reduce my emergency fund to invest more?,"**TLDR: I'm on probation for 3 months (new job) and my partner has a secure job. Should we invest part of our emergency fund, or keep it as a safety net? **

I'm a mid-late 20s M. My partner and I work an office job. She's on $95k while I'm on $160k per year. 

We currently have about $150k in ETFs and shares, 6k in cash, and an additional $30k in emergency funds (3% interest).

Monthly rent is around $2k between both of us. Living comfortably, we could spend $1-2k in addition each month (groceries, takeout, netflix etc) 

I am about halfway through a 6 month probationary period in my new job. I've been doing well, so performance isn't an issue, but Covid has caused another big lockdown for us (Australia), which might impact the economy.

We beefed up our emergency fund given the scare around covid last year, and we expect we'd be able to live easily on it for 6-7 months without changing our lifestyle. Tightening the belt, we could make it last 9-10 months if needed (assuming worst case scenario where we both lose our jobs) 

However, given the returns in real estate and ETFs, I feel like we're losing a lot of money just leaving $30k cash in the bank. On the other hand, I have 3 months until my probationary period ends, compounded with the potential economic impact of covid, I wonder if I should stay risk averse and keep the full emergency fund in case the worst happens. My partner is in a permanent position, and is fairly secure in her job, so we could probably rely on her income as well as the emergency fund.

What do you think? Is it better to keep the fat emergency fund given the new round of covid and the economic uncertainty, or are we shooting ourselves in the foot financially by having so much in our emergency fund?",finance
CryptoCurrency,My experience trying to rationalize with garbagecoin HODLERS,"So there's this really shitty coin, its whole deal is that they're gonna make a $200 bottle of rum with it and incorporate an NFT into the bottle and somehow that's good for the coin.

Anyways, I dig into their official website linked from the coin page and they have an address and phone number listed to look legit! I tried calling the number for about a week straight, no voicemail, no answer and it's not even a CA area code....so I check the address they listed on Google maps. No logo on the building, but there are company cars with a logo on their cars so I google the company name on the car and it turns out that it's actually their company who is using the building and not the distillery. I call their business to confirm.

I relayed this over to the guys on satoshiSB (I've never bought a shitcoin guys I swear) and what followed was both insane and hilarious. Obvious attacks from all around. We're commenting back and forth with me stating stuff like ""they're selling $200 bottles of rum and have never made rum before in their life"" ""they're blatantly lying about owning a distillery ect...""

One guy gets so fed up that he PM's me and comments multiple times that he wants to set up a fight, like legit he kept trying to act tough and make it happen ""I'll drive out anywhere in northern CA"" ""come to Irvine"" ""meet me at my gym"" ect...

One of the mods of the subreddit for that specific crypto even PM'd me this exact message:

""We know who you are. I have reported it to the MP admin team and they are considering taking legal action against you. Yes, they have a lawyer who has helped every step of the way. And social media threats and mininformation make for A GREAT CASE in this day and age. Trust me, this is your first and last warning.""

vet,My puppy just ate a dog toy,"My 16 week old bulldog was playing with his sister and they were chewing on some toys. One was a small (around 2""x2""), soft, fluff-stuffed, egg-shaped toy. I think it had a tiny squeaker in it. One second they were tossing toys around and the next I heard an eating sound and came to see that toy disappeared.

I called the emergency vet and they said I could monitor him and bring him in if he started acting ""weird"". They didn't seem too worried about it and maybe I've watch too many episodes of VetLife but it seems like it might become a big deal if it gets stuck.

Could anyone give me some guidance on what ""weird"" symptoms I'm looking for? He's breathing normal right now. How long do I need to watch for labored breathing? Can he drink water or no? Also, if he does do fine through the night, do i take him to the normal vet tomorrow or wait to see if he'll just poop it out?

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown August 3, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. A quarter million votes were cast in Catalyst Fund 5 voting! Apparently, this is over 10x what we saw in Fund 2. [https://twitter.com/danny\_cryptofay/status/1422253955816505345](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1422253955816505345)
2. Here’s a very good read on one vision for prosperity via CBDC and how such a currency should interact with existing blockchains like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1422270993498705921](https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1422270993498705921)
3. The Cardano rate on Celsius has been revealed. But, it’s currently lower than common staking rates? [https://twitter.com/Mashinsky/status/1422252594957799429](https://twitter.com/Mashinsky/status/1422252594957799429)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)
2. Draft table of contents for Mastering Cardano has been revealed. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1407165366355124225](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1407165366355124225)
3. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
4. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
5. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
6. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
7. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
8. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

9. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

67. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

70. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

71. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal.

72. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event.

89. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions.

personalfinance,Recently got a new job. Should I pay off my student loans in one lump sum?,"i have around $30k in savings and $80k salary. I really want to start using my savings to actively invest in retirement accounts, stocks, and in the near future possibly real estate. I have already started to max out my roth ira. 

I have $14k in student loans that I still need to pay off. I was waiting for the current gov admin’s student loan forgiveness to kick off, it it seems unlikely that non-gov employees will get it any time soon. 

For the sake of not having to pay interest for my federal loans, should I just pay off the $14k and never have to think about it again? Or do I remain hopeful and see if there’s any forgiveness plans from the gov in the coming months?

EDIT: I believe interest is 4% which kicks off again in a few months",finance

CryptoCurrency,Update on my friend at work who sells at a loss every time.,"He just sold all of his xrp because he seen this post on Facebook.

((Specifically, the bill would:

Create statutory definitions for digital assets and digital asset securities and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority over digital asset securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with authority over digital assets;

Provide legal certainty as to the regulatory status for the top 90% of the digital asset market (by market capitalization and trading volume) through a joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking.

Require digital asset transactions that are not recorded on the publicly distributed ledger to be reported to a registered Digital Asset Trade Repository within 24 hours to minimize the potential for fraud and promote transparency;

Explicitly add digital assets and digital asset securities to the statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), formalizing the regulatory requirements for digital assets and digital asset securities to comply with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;

Provide the Federal Reserve with explicit authority to issue a digital version of the U.S. Dollar, clarify that digital assets, digital asset securities and fiat based stablecoins are not U.S. legal tender, and provide the U.S. Treasury Secretary with authority to permit or prohibit US Dollar and other fiat-based stablecoins;

Direct the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to issue consumer advisories on “non coverage” of digital assets or digital asset securities to ensure that consumers are aware that they are not insured or protected in the same way as bank deposits or securities; and,

computers,Help setting up computer for 88 YO MIL,"Hi all,

I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this question. If there’s a better place to ask then please direct me there.

My MIL went in an independent living facility 2 days ago. I want to set up a laptop to send to her. She has very little experience with computers, she had a desktop a few years back and enjoyed sending emails with family in Scotland and watching youtube videos. She commented how she would start watching a video and then go down the rabbit hole and end up watching 3 hours’ worth of videos. At some point my wife’s evil sisters effed everything up, somehow the wifi password got changed and nobody knew what it was, and somebody messed around with her computer and it wasn’t working either. I was there in May and thought about resetting the router and trying to get things working again, but decided not too because I didn’t know what else was connected to the router and I was afraid that after I left something would stop working and then I would be the bad guy for screwing everything up. I’ve got a pretty decent laptop, I going to wipe it with a clean install of Win 10 LTSC. I figure someone can help her connect to wifi once she receives it at the home.

I figure there’s at least 3 things I need to set up, but I’m sure there are more, that’s why I’m here asking for help.

1) I would like to be able to connect via RDP to work on her computer as needed. I do this with all my computers, but they are behind my router with a reverse proxy and VPN tunnel into the router. I’m not sure how I can do this with her computer. I’m assuming she will have a dynamic IP from the ISP and the router will assign DHCP dynamically. I’m also assuming I would need to configure the power settings to have the laptop powered on at all times so that I could get in without her assistance. Any ideas for the best way to do this?

2) I would like to have screen sharing of some sort so that my wife can talk to her on the phone and walk her through how to use it and get her going. Something where both people can see the screen so my wife can coach her. I have no idea where to start with this one.

3) My current work computer was locked down so bad that I couldn’t even remove a program shortcut from the desktop without the admin password. They finally set up a separate admin account for me so that I could make changes and apply updates to dropbox, etc. I’m not real familiar with how all that works through windows, but it seems like that would be good for her laptop. It would help keep viruses from making changes and also keep the evil sisters from effing things up again. Can someone tell me the basics of what I need to set up for this? I’m pretty computer nerdy so I can do the research and get it going, I just need someone to point me in the right direction as this is outside of my normal skills.

I’m sure there are lots of other good ideas, so let me hear what you think. I’m surprised that someone hasn’t come out with a Jitterbug type computer yet. She has a Lively flip phone and loves sending texts and mms so I’m sure we can get her up and running on a computer also. It would really help her transition to her new life and give her something to do with her time.

Thanks in advance for any help.",technology
CryptoCurrency,IMF Governors Approve a Historic US$650 Billion SDR Allocation of Special Drawing Rights - another reason Cryptocurrency is a better way forward.,"After the US printed a record-breaking amount of money during the past years, the IMF is now creating 650 billion dollars worth of SDRs.

Source: [IMF statement](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/07/30/pr21235-imf-governors-approve-a-historic-us-650-billion-sdr-allocation-of-special-drawing-rights)

SDRs, or ""Special Drawing Rights"" are a non-currency asset that countries hold beside their more well-known holdings like currencies (EUR, USD, CNY, ...) and things like gold.

The thing is that SDRs could actually be considered currency in reality: this is because nations can exchange SDRs with other nations for cash. This gives the country exchanging away their SDRs the liquidity they need to fill up a hole in their spending budget.

Now of course, holding those SDRs must be interesting as well right? Well...no. The interest rate on SDR dropped off of a cliff: down from 1% in 2019 to 0.05-0.1% in 2021. 

**This makes it less interesting for a country to hold SDRs as a value store.**

So what if a nation wants to exchange their SDRs to cash, and no one wants to uphold the other end of the bargain? 

No problem: the IMF can force another nation to take over the SDRs in exchange for cash!

Source: [IMF SDR factsheet - ""SDR Operations""](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR)

This effectively means that close to another trillion is being distributed across the global economy in an attempt to artificially prop up global spending and increase velocity. 

**I believe this is yet another signal that holding cryptocurrency is a great idea into the future.**

The lengths that international market makers, central banks and financial institutions will go to to artificially prop up the global and local economies knows no bounds.

In my mind, cryptocurrency will become an increasingly interesting safe haven from these institutions who have a variety of tools at their disposal to manipulate the value of an asset you are holding. 

Inflation caused by actions like this will disproportionately affect those who do not hold non-cash assets: the value of the dollars/euros/yen/... in a bank account decreases with inflation. If you do not hold assets like stocks, real estate, physical goods, ... you will feel the effect of this far more.

Of course, the idea of the market makers is to create liquidity and try to get money moving: the velocity of money needs to stay high for the economy to function - but this hurts your average joe, especially if their wages do not follow inflation.

**Cryptocurrency is not a luxury but a necessity to return the global economy to reality: manipulation of currencies must no longer be used as a tool to prop up economies - currencies should be a healthy medium of exchange for goods and services, with a clear and stable value.**",cryptocurrency

solar,An improved approach to adopting solar?,"A couple of things I've wondered:
Would it be more effective if more solar collection was on the site where it is to be used, say at homes, factories, etc? That would reduce transmission line loss.
Would it be better for homes and businesses to run on DC current? Every electronic device (TVs, computers, etc.) first changes the AC supply to DC. Other home appliances' motors could be DC motors. Wouldn't there be an efficiency gain if home solar panels fed directly to the home in a usable form, rather than converting it back to AC, delivered to the electronic devices that must then reconvert it to DC for use?
Larger industrial size solar installations might remain converted to AC for sending long distances to prevent line losses. What distance range is that conversion to AC for transmission at break even? Five miles or fifty miles? If the answer is on the smaller side of that range, would it not be better for the goal of larger arrays on a more per area plan?
Should we use electric car batteries to supplement home use? Some countries do this now, I've read. It's nice to have a car with a 300  mile range, but if your typical travel is only 30 miles couldn't some of that excess be used in the home to supplement during times of temporarily low solar gain?",energy
CryptoCurrency,PancakeSwap: More or less ponzi than fiat?,"TL;DR: CAKE is indeed inflationary, but much less so than fiat. PancakeSwap appears to look solid long term, but as anything on BSC, it hinges on Binance not engaging in game breaking shenanigans. 

1. PancakeSwap is no doubt the most popular DeFi platform on the Binance Smart Chain(BSC) right now, but their pools and reward schemes present APRs that may seem a little too good to be true. In this post, I will try to explain how PancakeSwap could remain profitable, and how it could collapse entirely. This is not a shill post, and of course it is not financial advice either. If you already know how PancakeSwap works, you could skip right to the 7th paragraph.

2. First, to understand the gist of how PancakeSwap works, we will take a brief look at its history. It started as a Uniswap clone on BSC, which means an AMM platform where people can provide their assets as liquidity in return for a portion of the trading fees. However, PancakeSwap goes one step further, and provides staking pools and yield farms. They have also been adding more features later on, like a BNB price prediction game, and a lottery, slowly building themselves somewhat of a casino. They have their own token called CAKE.

3. It feels a bit weird to call the PancakeSwap staking pool “staking”, but I will roll with that terminology for lack of a better word. With occasional exceptions, the staking pools on PancakeSwap let you lock up your CAKE in return for more CAKE, or some other token. The CAKE to CAKE pools are fed CAKE from the minting cycle, and are therefore eternal. The CAKE to TokenX pools are temporary, because they need an external source of TokenX. So, when the pool runs out of tokens to reward the stakers, the fun is over. This post is mostly concerned with the CAKE to CAKE pools, because these tie directly into the CAKE tokenomics. I mentioned there is minting of CAKE, and indeed there is. On every block, which for the BSC means every 3 seconds, 40 new CAKE is minted. Looking a bit at that number, our old friend DOGE comes to mind, but I would like to emphasise that both DOGE, and here CAKE, mint a static amount of new tokens per period of time, which means inflation rates decrease over the long run, as opposed to fiat where they just pump harder and harder to keep their rates up. Additionally, most of this freshly minted CAKE actually does not even enter circulation. At the time of writing, 10/40 goes to the staking pools, 9/40 goes to the farms, and the rest is burnt. 

4. Apart from the staking pools we also need to consider the farms. Farms also reward CAKE, but you need specific LP tokens to stake in them. These LP tokens are the ones you get when you provide liquidity to a trading pair. Important to note here is that when you provide liquidity you also get a portion of the trading fees. The trading fees are paid in whichever tokens you provided, and work completely separate from the farms. Not all token pairs have a farm, and some farms are only temporary, so apart from the impermanent loss that everyone is warning you about, some additional care is required when choosing which pair to provide liquidity for on PancakeSwap.

5. To summarize, PancakeSwap provides two ways to earn passive income. Just like Uniswap, you can lock a pair of tokens in a liquidity pool to earn trading fees, rewarded in those tokens. Additionally, you can stake the LP tokens you get when providing liquidity in a farm for additional rewards in CAKE. You can also stake CAKE in various pools for more CAKE, or some other token. But, doesn’t this just cause massive inflation in CAKE you say? Yes, indeed it does, and that is exactly what we want to look closer at next. 

6. To prevent hyperinflation of CAKE, PancakeSwap performs token burns, i.e. they remove CAKE tokens from circulation every week. To do this, they need to gather CAKE from the end users, which is naturally done through fees. Part of the trading fee that users pay when using the DEX is used to burn CAKE. This is also where the casino comes in. Through the casino, PancakeSwap generates fees that can be used to burn CAKE. When the fee is collected in CAKE it is simply burnt, but when the fee is collected in some other token they do what they call “buyback and burn”. Pretty self explanatory, but that just means they use whatever token they collected in fees to buy CAKE from the market, and then burn it. I only have a BBA, so what do I know, but my hunch is that this “buyback and burn” is rather effective because not only does the burn reduce supply, the buyback also generates artificial demand. However, this is the kind of system that only works as long as it works, so let’s remember to consider how it could stop working.

7. The most obvious threat to PancakeSwap is something happening to Binance. There is not really that much for us to do about that though, so I will just recommend everyone who keeps funds on BSC to have an escape plan that does not involve the Binance bridge. It is a rather unlikely scenario, but the consequences could be massive. Then there are hacks, rugpulls, or anything else that would ruin their reputation, but this is the same for pretty much any project.

8. Second, given the burn mechanism I explained above(6), PancakeSwap is reliant on keeping platform traffic up to keep inflation down. If the bear market hits and traffic drops substantially, the inflation could spike. With the market already on a downwards trend that could get nasty. 

9. Finally, CAKE as a token really only has one use, yielding more crypto. It also works as a governance token, but that is more of a secondary utility. Due to the way CAKE minting works(3) the APR on the pools is steadily creeping downwards along with the gross inflation rate. This makes staking CAKE seem like sort of a *prisoner’s dilemma*. A krill like me is not going to make a difference, but imagine a pancake whale suddenly deciding the APR has dropped too low, and deciding to dump his CAKE. This would of course cause the APR to rise back up, but if the price suddenly dumped notably this could cause FUD and panic selling, further dumping the price to a point where it is not able to recover.

10. In conclusion, PancakeSwap might not qualify as a ponzi, because your profit is not so much from the investors coming after you, but mostly from the users of the DEX, or the casino, both of which are legit products. In fact, the more value is invested in a pool the lower the APR gets, so from a yield perspective we would prefer people to burn all their CAKE on the lottery. 

11. If I have to make predictions, I would say that PancakeSwap is going to survive a bear market, if only because it is by far the biggest DEX on BSC right now. The price of CAKE will drop more than the average top 50 coin, but not so much that the pool APRs cannot compensate for the difference. They will see a new ATH at roughly the same time as BNB during the next bull run. Now I just need to wait 4 years to see how well these predictions are going to age.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,PSA: Wash sales and tax loss harvesting in crypto are not free from IRS scrutiny. The IRS can disallow the transactions that you report if they determine they fall under the Economic Substance Doctrine.,"We often see posts and comments on this sub and other crypto subs explaining how the wash sale rule that applies to the stock market doesn’t apply to crypto. We are encouraged to sell at a loss then immediately rebuy and claim that sweet, sweet tax loss. 

Well, unfortunately, the IRS has a tool that they call the Economic Substance Doctrine. It *can* be applied to cryptocurrency. 

###The Economic Substance Doctrine is a tax law of the United States under which a transaction must have both a “substantial purpose” aside from reduction of tax liability and an “economic effect” aside from the tax effect in order to be considered valid. 

###For a transaction to be respected, the transaction must change the taxpayers economic position in a “meaningful way” apart from federal income tax effects and if questioned, you must be able to prove that you had “substantial purpose” for entering this transaction, apart from tax benefits. 

While it’s true you can sell at a loss then immediately rebuy and claim it as a capitol gains loss, the IRS can disallow the transaction if they decide it falls under this law. 


This doctrine is used by the INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to determine whether tax shelters or strategies used to reduce tax liability are abusive. 

###What is the likelihood you’ll be audited or questioned? I have no clue. What is the likelihood that the IRS will use this doctrine in determining the legitimacy of crypto transactions? I also don’t know. I just know it is a tool available for the IRS to use. I  guess it depends on how thorough the IRS wants to be with cryptocurrency. While you may not face any legal action, you may end up having all of your transactions scrutinized. 


Be careful out there people.

Edit: I felt that my original title could be viewed as a blanket statement covering all sales. The rules and punishments in this sub about tax related posts are strict. 

I can only say with certainty that this doctrine is used by the Internal Revenue Service and applies to the United States.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Conspiracy theory: Why is the government is so dead-set on ""regulating"" cryptocurrency? They hate you and want you poor.","One of the main reasons 99% of us are into cryptocurrency is to get rich. Yes, the technology is cool, it may replace regular money one day, centralized banks and governments such, and so on. And it would be really cool if cryptocurrency becomes as widespread as regular currency. But today, this very minute, it’s all still pretty speculative. We don’t know for sure which cryptos will be around in 10 years, which hot crypto technologies will really get used, which hotter crypto technologies will happen in the future, or if governments and banks go crazy and ban and regulate and tax everything into oblivion and ruin it all for us.

If that last thing never happens, cryptocurrency is always going to be around in some form, and a lot of us may seriously be rich 10-20 years from now. But there is a huge chance of widespread government intervention stopping that from ever happening. While governments can never truly destroy cryptocurrency, with enough laws, taxes, and regulations, they can make it very hard to buy, sell, and use. And let’s face it: If governments take a definitive and strong anti-crypto stance, the speculative investors are mostly going to sell, and the price of all cryptocurrency will tank. We will not get rich.

This goes beyond governments wanting control over money or being lobbied by big centralized banks. It’s much simpler than that: Your government does not want you rich.

At its core, what is money? It’s a medium of exchange. A collateral layer that lubricates the economy. If we didn’t have money, we’d all have to barter. If I owned chickens and needed milk, I would have to find the one other person on earth who owned milk and needed chickens, or some convoluted chain of trades to exchange my chicken for a string of ten other things to finally get to my milk. But with money, anybody can buy my chickens for money, and I’ll take that money because I know that I can trade that money to anybody else for milk or whatever else I need, and anybody else will take my money because they know they can trade it for other things. 

But money isn’t actually valuable. It’s a construct we have become accustomed to agreeing to accept. Why? Because money is backed by governments. Without governments saying it’s valuable, it’s just paper rectangles or electrons on some bank computer.

Money is not really yours. Money is something the government issues to you to lubricate a country’s economy. But the government actually controls the money. The government controls how much it prints, interest rates, taxes, regulations on how it’s used, and in extreme cases, they can even decide to outright seize money or stop taking a currency or change currencies altogether.

It is not your money. It is the government’s money that they are letting you use. And it’s not banks or the economy they are trying to control. They are controlling you and me, and money is how they do it.

The government lets you use money in exchange for a promise: You are promising to sell yourself. You are promising to turn yourself into a commodity. You sell labor units – you work, giving your time and the products of your labor to the economy – and you are compensated by being given money. And you contribute economic units by spending that money back into the economy. Everything costs money. Food, water, shelter, clothing, electricity, everything. So through money, you are required to work, turning yourself into a commodity, and then you give that money back into the system just to buy the very necessities you need to live. 

If you have extra money leftover, you contribute that money back into the economy by buying certain approved extra things. Luxuries, entertainment, and so on. Some things are illegal to buy or do with that money the government is letting you hold for them, but you can buy certain approved things they’ve given you permission to buy.

Your government does not want you to be rich. They don’t want you to have too much money. Because if you have lots and lots of extra money – far more than you need – you aren’t going to spend all of it. You are going to save a lot of it, maybe invest a lot of it, and that money doesn’t go back into the economy. And if you have lots and lots of money, you are going to work less and not contribute as much of your time and labor.

So if you make a lot of money, more than the government thinks you need, you are taxed more on it. They take more of it away from you than they do from people who have less money, with the idea that you can afford to part with it because you don’t need all of that extra money. Some countries even have outright wealth taxes where they simply take a portion of their money they’re letting you hold as a penalty for having a lot of it.

Because the money isn’t yours and actually belongs to the government, they also regulate the ways you are allowed to use their money. If you travel with more than a certain sum of money without getting the government’s permission first and are found carrying it, that is deemed suspicious and your money can be seized by law enforcement under the assumption that you are planning to commit a crime. They do not have to return your seized money. Hopefully, you have a second pile of money you can use to hire attorneys to try to recover that first pile of money. If you try to withdraw more than a certain amount from a bank, you require permission before the bank will give you that much of the government’s money from you bank account. Businesses are not allowed to accept transactions from you for more than a certain amount of money without permission, and the transactions must be overseen in certain ways.

And the ways you are allowed to spend money can be restricted. Because the money isn’t yours and actually belongs to the government, they can limit and regulate the ways you can save and invest extra money. For example, you are limited to only investing in companies that have gone through certain regulatory steps to sell shares in their company. And you can only buy those shares through authorized brokers who have gone through certain regulatory steps, who will report your transactions as required and will not let you make certain kinds of transactions, also as required.

The government is very interested in figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrency, because they don’t want you spending their money in ways they do not approve. If you lose a bunch of their money that they’re allowing you to hold buying baby moon dog safecoin, that’s money you’re not putting back into the economy. Plus, now you can’t afford to eat or pay rent and they have to give you more money through one of their social programs or else you die and can’t contribute labor or economy units. 

If you make a bunch of money investing in Ethereum and get rich, that’s even worse. You’re going to work less, not spend all of that money you made, and worse, you can sell that Ethereum elsewhere. So you might leave your country and take that wealth with you.

If you achieve life-changing wealth and become financially independent, that’s what you’re really winning, and what they’re really afraid of. Independence. If you don’t have to work, and you can go anywhere, and buy anything without oversight, you are beyond controlling. You are no longer a commodity – a source of labor units and economic units. 

By regulating crypto, your government is not interested in preventing fraud or crime, or even that interested in taxes. The main thing they are interested in is keeping you and me from becoming rich and leaving their country and taking our wealth with us. If you ever do make those crypto millions, the very first thing you should do should be to relocate to a bitcoin haven country with low taxes to stick it to your government.",cryptocurrency

So, my 2009 SUV with 140K miles sustained some cosmetic damage and Progressive considered it a total loss. I am a little sad about it but the projected pay out is more than I think I could ever have sell my vehicle for.   
The issue is that when I bought the vehicle in 2015, my close friend at the time (we'll call him T) cosigned for me so that I may get a better interest rate. I hit a rough patch while working at ski resort and my options were to either find an apartment in the ski town or buy a car and live in the more local and cheaper towns about 10 miles away. I chose the latter because I was going to need a vehicle to leave the ski town when I relocated to start college anyway. 

We agreed that he would help me as long as I kept up with payments and kept both our credits clean with the car loan. 54 short months later, and I kept my promise. However, since I left the ski town in 2017, T also left and continued traveling, doing seasonal work.

&amp;#x200B;

My vehicle was just considered a total loss and because T is the co-signer (and considered a secondary owner in the state of Oregon), Progressive is at a standstill on what to do because I have not talked to or seen T in years. His phone numbers have been changed, he is absent on all social medias (none of my messages are replied to), and our mutual friends have not heard from him either. We parted ways on very good terms but naturally grew apart.

Therefore, APY is always higher than APR.

gaming,Help with gaming laptops,"Hey everyone, I’m asking this on behalf of my girlfriend because I don’t have any experience myself.

So she’s looking for a gaming laptop around the £800 mark, although she’s willing to go a little over for something that will run well enough for her. 

She intends to use the laptop for gaming, think m Stardew valley, the sims etc. nothing too demanding like AAA games or MMOs. She has said she wants to get into a little modding as well.

To be honest, i don’t know what to advise her. I have little knowledge on specs and how they fare with certain games. I have a pre-built gaming PC of a similar price range that’s done me well, but i don’t know enough about laptops to be able to work this out on my own. Honestly I’ve always been fed the stereotype that gaming laptops are trash compared to PCs however she doesn’t have the space for one.

Any advice on specs to look out for, any product suggestions or other advice would be great. Also, if at this price a decent laptop isn’t possible, what kind of budget should we be looking at? If this is better off in another subreddit let me know. Thanks :)

personalfinance,Trying to avoid owing on tax return when withdrawing from retirement,"OK, I am thoroughly aware that making early withdrawals on my 403b is a rotten idea.  BUT I am in the middle of a move to Chicago for a new job and, although I can cover the move I won't have enough to cover my living expenses until my first full paycheck rolls in.  It's a crappy situation: I move into my new apt on September 5th but my workplace only pays monthly on the 1st of each month.  Since I'll be starting September 15th I'll have half a paycheck which will certainly pay for October rent but not much else.  Essentially I'll need funds to cover September and October living expenses, and October rent (I've already paid September rent up front).

So we're talking about $3K, and I'd like to take out another $3K for emergency expenses (yes, I get the irony).

**My question:** If I make sure that the correct income tax is taken out upon withdrawal for my bracket (22% federal, 5% state) *and* I set aside the 10% penalty amount which will be due come tax time *and* the extra ""income"" from my 403b doesn't bump me up into a higher tax bracket (it won't), **will I owe anything on my taxes in February**?  Does this hold true for any amount withdrawn from my 403b?  My W4 is pretty simple: just one allowance for myself, and I did get all the stimulus checks, for the record.  Only complexity is changing employers and state, of course (state income tax is essentially the same in both states, MA and IL).",finance
CryptoCurrency,I’m glad I was “late” to the crypto party,"I first learned about Bitcoin in 2011. Thinking it was no different than Monopoly Money, I didn’t get involved. I heard about Ethereum in 2016. Thinking it was just a Bitcoin wannabe, I didn’t get involved. 

I watched both of them go vertical during the 2017 bull run. At that time I didn’t go anywhere near crypto. I was convinced the whole ecosystem was a bubble and that these digital coins/tokens could never be worth that much. 

In the years that followed the 2017 all time highs, I watched the markets retreat. I relished in the fact that I was “right” about crypto and I was happy I didn’t get involved.

Not once did it occur to me that I should try to figure out what this shit was all about. Not until the summer of 2020. The world was going to shit and money was being printed as fast as ink could hit paper. That was my wake up call. It became apparent that things were changing and I either needed to change with it or become a victim of broken monetary policy. 

So like a lot of people in the last 18 months, I got involved.

I began researching. I dug through archives of videos, articles, message boards and comments. Anything I could find that could help me better understand what crypto is, how it works, and why I need to care. 

I quickly realized there are millions of pieces of information out there. Everything from what to do, what not to do, mistakes made, success gained, and lessons learned. The good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Going through my DYOR experience truly makes me appreciate being “late to the game”. So many people have been the guinea pigs that paved the way for the rest of us to know how to not fuck up. The thousands of story’s of “I lost my seed”, “I threw out my laptop”, “I got scammed”, “my exchange went under”, “I got rug pulled” are critical to every crypto newbie’s education. Every bad thing that has happened to someone in crypto teaches the next person how to better exist in this new ecosystem. 

Then you have the success stories, “how crypto changed my life in x, y, or z way”. The reward that can come from taking the risk. Hope for the future. Plus a pretty simple formula for doing well in this space,   HODL=GAINS. 

That’s the advantage of getting in “late”.  You don’t have to learn these lessons the hard way. You just have to get educated about how to avoid the mistakes that someone else has already made. The education has been developed. The information is out there. It can be found. It’s just a matter of if you’re willing to go find it. 

During this last decade crypto and blockchain technology has gone from sci-fi bullshit that only “tech nerds” are into, to a world changing technology that will provide the foundation on which the future will be built. It’s already started with the explosion of alt coins, DAOs, and dapps. The use cases for crypto continue to grow, the applications and infrastructure built around crypto continues to improve, and the communities surrounding these projects will just grow stronger. All things that will only accelerate widespread adoption. 

And that’s the greatest part of it all. If today is your first day in crypto you’re not late. Widespread adoption is still yet to come. You may be “late” in the short history of crypto as we know it right now. But 10 years, 50 years, 100 years from now? The 2020s will be considered *“just the beginning”*",cryptocurrency

Just a smart contract chain like Ethereum that solved the now 10 year old problem of how to scale Proof of Work without sacrificing decentralization, speed, security, fees, etc

Not a lot of people realize how huge this is since PoS is basically central banking on blockchain and often times owned by big VCs that will always be in control of the Network, because in practice POS, is closer to feudalism. Whoever is a land owner early gets to be a land owner forever... because they as a class can refuse to sell the land.

PoW is also fundamental to sharding that works, you simply cannot shard a PoS system and it's the reason why eth2 will never come out, it will probably rebrand if anything else.

    what do you mean?? by favorite shitcoin is Proof of Stake

https://preview.redd.it/xawlotouk7f71.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b817e6b67b773eeb421795c1cf7932d13f9c3a

I mean If bitcoin wasn't so inefficient, Proof of Stake wouldn't have existed for at least another 1000 years when people got really bored of blockchain and decided they needed to start coming up with stupid pointless bullshit to justify funding etc.

PoS is far less secure than PoW, PoS is an attempt to improve on Bitcoins inefficiency, nothing more, if a scalable PoW blockchain arrives on the scene (Kadena) PoS becomes obsolete. PoS will still see adoption by VCs, because it allows rich people and early adopters to outvote everyone else. But PoW is pure nakamoto consensus, proof of stake also causes huge problems when you can lend your coins out, by manipulating interest rates on the chain you can force stakers to move their holdings to liquidity pools and this makes it easier for malicious nodes to outvote the rest. in fact this can happen entirely by accident, why stake if you get better returns lending? Bitcoin basically had things spot on, it's just inefficient and slow, after 10 years of wild experimentation we are finally seeing new, well reasoned approaches to blockchain tech, and Kadena in my mind is so far ahead it's almost absurd.

    That sounds unbelievable, how does it work?

https://preview.redd.it/4yqdfruwk7f71.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd671fe6273cd76553ac5b84647fc7eab3bd160

The very basic idea of it is that with a bitcoin or an ethereum you have one single chain.

With chainweb think of a two chain version, with this you end up doubling the throughput, and you don't need any more energy because the hashrate is spread out evenly, this means you can have unlimited chains for the same energy consumption.

And you're actually increasing the security. This idea of having two chains braided together is an older idea than Kadena, it's called a beta coin or block probe, and you can find it on the bitcoin forums, and it was proposed first for security not for throughput.

Kadena's main contribution is figuring out how to take that seed of an idea and actually scale it dramatically, so they added graph theory to be able to go instead of having two or ten chains in parallel to having 1000 if not 10,000+ chains long term.

If you need much more info on how exactly it works, go read the whitepaper

    you sure it's not a scam? who is behind this

the team is anonymous but-- no I'm kidding, both CEO's worked at JP Morgan, one was Lead Engineer for Juno (JP's blockchain prototype) was Tech Lead for the SECs Cryptocurrency Steering Committee and the Quantitative Analytics Unit, The other CEO directed JP's Emerging blockchain Group and has 15 years experience in building trading and exchange backbones. Oh did I mention they have S. Haber on the team, who is that? only the most cited person on Satoshi's BITCOIN whitepaper, they are even having an AMA in a week.

They also have people from the haskell foundation, Google and Microsoft, and no those people didn't just build websites, they worked on distributed systems and planet-scale data processing.

    Wow.. b-but it's probably just a VC pump and dump like all the other projects

Except Kadena only needed 15MM in funding to create what other projects needed hundreds of millions for. This also means they didn't launch at a billion valuation with VCs ready to dump.

    Well it's probably just vaporware like cardano!

It's not, it's working right now, smart contracts, scaling, everything.. That'd make it the first non-vaporware crypto implemented in Haskell.

    Alright tell me about those smart contracts..

https://preview.redd.it/fzyefk90l7f71.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ad491822dd43799c7291381da64020c58acafea

The most important aspect of Kadena is PACT, pact is a smart contract language and it's the most powerful tool for creating applications on a blockchain, pact already contains all of the features that other projects say they will develop eventually, including full Formal Verification of user code, error messages, contract upgradability, multi-signature, and support for interoperability

It's so easy to read and write that a technical lawyer can reliably program his smart contracts with a little practice just like he could learn to manipulate data in Excel, formal verification which is invaluable when you are dealing with critical systems i.e. those that handle a lot of money or play a key part in infrastructure, Turing incomplete (prohibits recursive function calls, unbounded looping and variable reassignment which eliminates the potential for exploits that have ravaged EVM languages by design), upgradeable contracts whereas Solidity contracts are final and require proxy contracts etc. It's a next gen smart contract language that improves upon Solidity much like Chainweb is a next gen blockchain that improves upon its POW predecessors.

Pact, unlike something like DAML, was always supposed to be an easy-to-adopt standard for smart contracts by other chains. Pact is a competitive advantage, but that's because they were the first ones to figure out what will be the standard vs the only ones that can use it. Any project that wants to adopt/incorporate it gets their full support. They are hopeful that it becomes the lingua franca of safe smart contracts so that the entire industry can move forward from the Proof-of-Concept that is Solidity. Seriously, at this point Solidity/the EVM is just holding crypto back.

    Are there examples of things you can do with Turing completeness 
    
    that would be useful on the blockchain?

No, **I cannot come up with a single use-case for the blockchain that requires Turing completeness**\*.\* *The EVM does not use any of the properties of Turing completeness because it restricts all recursion via the gas model anyway, which enforces that recursion either terminate prior to gas running out, or terminate the program* *when* *gas runs out. So in effect, the EVM’s gas model sort of simulates Turing incompleteness, but not really. The EVM adopts all the flaws of Turing completeness (side effecting, illegible and unreasonable code, arbitrary looping), but use none of its benefits (no infinite recursion allowed).*

    What's with the tokenomics it says only 18% of the supply is out..

https://preview.redd.it/s4bsp6h6l7f71.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e104d0a8998ee3092a03768f88387c26f5e0de9c

KDA has a fixed economy. They think BTC got that right and ETH got that wrong. However, they also like long-term economic planning, which ETH got right with it's infinite supply/inflation, and BTC is gonna have trouble with in the 2020's. So, how do they as a new project rectify the situation? They decided to have a fixed economy that was modeled out for 120 years -- so they have the best parts of BTC and ETH without the drawbacks. The one drawback on their economic model is that people need to think for a minute... which is mostly a PR problem.

    What's the catch? does it have like 10min blocktime lmao

Kadena has 30sec blocktimes per chain, but there are 20 chains \[currently\] running in parallel, so the network blocktime is 1.5sec (if your dapp is scaled across all chains). Once they scale to, say, 50 chains, the blocktime will drop to sub-second blocktime and a 1000 chain KDA would have a blocktime crossnetwork of 0.03 sec

But yeah one chain ""only"" does 30s which isn't a problem at all when you consider that POW settlement time is lightning compared to what came before (remember that in finance a tx and settlement aren't the same). We're talking about a fully reliable settlement time on the order of minutes with KDA. That's crazy fast. IMHO ""fast finality"" is a solution looking for a problem... because you can use state channels or layer-2 to achieve it. Layer one doesn't need sub-second finality, it needs scale and robustness.

    do you work there? is this a paid post?

No

* DAI is backed by a variety of Crypto Assets and is algorithmically programmed to balance assets, collateral, interest rates and circulator supply to maintain price stability.
* DAI is the Stable Coin of the xDAI Chain.  xDAI is a SideChain of the Ethereum network that offers fast speeds and low transaction fees for popular projects and dAPPs like Gnosis, HoneySwap, SushiSwap, Agave and many others.  **xDAI is also the initial chain of xMOONs** (now porting to Arbitrum), meaning they were one of the first Cryptos/Chains/Organizations to support our r/CryptoCurrency community.
* DAI is available on most popular exchanges, and has liquidity pools and yield farming across most of the popular DeFi platforms.
* As of this post, USDC has Blacklisted 8 addressed, and USDT has Blacklisted over 400.  DAI has blacklisted 0 addresses, making it the least censorship-prone Stable Coin of the bunch.

If you want a Stable Coin that stays true to the purpose of CryptoCurrency (Decentralized Money), yet is still widely available and usable across the multitude of CryptoCurrency platforms and ecosystems, DAI is the clear-cut choice.

$100 monthly for 45 years: a million.

Currency and Money are not the same thing. Money is a store of value. Currency, by its nature, is the exact opposite. Your grandpa Wazza B must mean take a percentage of this and park it in hard money, park it in #Bitcoin . 

Once your in, and you see it appreciate +100% year on year you will wonder what the hell you were thinking trying to make 8% from stocks. If you think stocks can still compound &gt;8% from these levels, you also understand this will only be achieved by printing more currency.

personalfinance,Starting new job and the new W-4 is puzzling me,"I'm starting a new job at the end of August and I need to fill out the W-4. Obviously the W-4 changed in 2020 and is certainly more complicated than before. I'm married, we file jointly, each have a job. We have a $15k/year difference in salary. Can I select the option 2(c) and have my taxes covered without having to owe? A refund is fine as long as it isn't a gross over payment each pay period.

I tried using the IRS estimator and it said I would owe and need to withhold an extra $600 a paycheck. That made me question my selections. So I entered my current job salary and taxes. We itemize our deductions as it's above the standard and it still said I would owe on next year's taxes. It is strange because we got over $1k refund from the fed last year. Either I'm paying next to nothing in taxes or I'm not using the estimator right.",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my apartment?,"First off I should say I’m not in the USA. I’ll use dollars but the actual value is in another currency. 

I have an apartment worth around $400k that’s fully paid off and it’s in a very touristic town in a pretty good location. My mom bought the place 13 years ago and back then it was valued at $130k and my realtor says it’ll keep going up. Right now I’m renting it out for $1900/month and living with family. 

After some twists in life I decided I want to live and work on a farm (I have enough experience to be sure of that at this point). Right now I’m unemployed (I’m actually out of the county until October) and I have around $25k saved and an old truck, no debt. 

I came across a decent farm for sale for $350k. Ideally I didn’t want to sell the apartment to buy the farm but I don’t think I have any other short-medium term options. 

What are your thoughts on this? Should I just go ahead and sell it and make the switch? A couple of years ago I went to the bank to see if I could use the apartment as collateral to finance a farm but the payments were a little too high, and obviously interest rates not cool too. 

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"SO and I debate paying off home loan (55K, 12 yrs, 5.25% interest)","My SO and I are trying to do some retirement planning. We both have about 5 years until retirement and are in good financial shape with good incomes,  a healthy emergency fund, very good savings and investments, and excellent credit scores, etc.


But we disagree about paying off the home loan. We owe about 55K over the next 12 years at an interest rate of 5.25%.

He just doesn't want to carry the debt any more. He has never liked debt but also recognizes it is necessary for several reasons (credit development, large purchases, etc). 
That's just the way he is. 

He wants to retire this debt as soon as possible even though we could still easily continue to pay this mortgage for 7 more years after we both retire in 5 years. I like this because it will give us a nice raise in 7 years too.


I think we should just continue to pay on schedule. 


We've looked at:

Paying bi-weekly- but at this point it won't save all that much money over the next 12 years- only about $2,000 if I figured that correctly.


Refinancing at a lower rate but it seems no reputable company wants to refinance a loan of less than about $75,000 (we owe $55,000). Plus the fixed costs of refinancing are relatively high at 55K which is unappealing.
I guess we should have done this sooner but we missed it.


Tapping investments- but I think that it's a poor idea to trade our investments which are earning more than 5.25% to pay off a loan at 5.25%. Plus those are just loans anyway. Problem not solved.


And cash paying. We don't have enough cash to pay off the whole 55K although we could probably come up with $10,000 to $20,000 to throw at it if we worked at it that wouldn't deplete our emergency fund or present us too much of a hardship in other areas.


I could be wrong but I just don't feel like paying off this loan is a pressing issue and we could just as easily leave it be.


So questions:

How would paying, say, and additional $15,000 to this home loan affect the loan? Would it shave off enough time to make my ""let's make the debt go away""-desiring SO happy?


Do you folks have any other suggestions that we haven't though of to eliminate or reduce this debt sooner than scheduled?

What am I missing?



Follow up: I called my existing lender and told them I was shopping for a lower interest rate. They offered me 2.5% and said that would save me $23,000 and 3.5 years.

I will have to pay a fee- it's about $1500 and about $680 out of pocket- but don't have to pay for a lot of stuff a new loan with a new lender would require such as a title search, inspection, etc. I could also pay the $1500 but she said that adding $720 to the loan wouldn't make all that much difference.

I forgot to ask about prepayment stuff (Can we? Penalties?) but will the next time I speak to them.

Thanks everyone!

- The second loan is a 5 year loan. I’ve made 22 of 60 payments. I owe $2,091. The payments are $70 a month. 14% interest rate.

- My Best Buy credit card haunts me from my spend happy days long in the past. I owe $2,000. My monthly payments have suddenly risen from $35 to $67 over the past couple months. I’m not sure why. 25% interest rate. 

I’m not very good with this kind of stuff as you can see. The payments are beginning to be too much. I’m sure many of you are wondering why in the world I’d put myself in this situation. Well, all I will say is once I turned 21, I formed a really bad spending habit. These loans are ways to cover my past debts. I’ve had counseling and I can confidently say those ways are in the past. 

But now, I’m stuck with the debt. Should I consolidate these debts at my local credit union? I feel like I can get a better apr plus only having one (hopefully smaller!) monthly payment. Any help is appreciated!",finance

A few months ago I re-submitted my W4 and changed my withholdings because every year I get an almost $2,000 refund.  

I decided that it would be better for me to have the additional monthly cash flow and save/invest rather than give the government an interest free loan for a year (Shout out to PF subreddit and Suze Orman).  

Anyway, I noticed that since I did that my paycheck says FD S whereas it used to say FD S01.  The state portion remains the same ST-01.  

I used the withholding calculator and it told me to write in a certain value on the form. 

I really hope I didn’t mess this up and I owe a bunch at the end of the year.  

Also, federal tax is continuing to be taken out in proportion to what it was before so I don’t think I went exempt or something.

1. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan!  [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)

3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

3. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
4. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
5. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
6. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

8. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time.

9. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

51. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

67. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

68. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins.

70. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

72. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event.

89. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders.

personalfinance,Feedback/Advice for a temporary loan from family,"Hi there, I have a question that's very similar to one that was [posted on this subreddit before](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/nsl65d/family_loan_question/)...the only thing is it was posted 9 years ago, so not certain how reliable the info may still be.

The gist: I have been talking to family about a temporary loan that I would pay back, ideally within one year (I had considered going through a bank, but family had offered an alternative). I understand there are tax implications for amounts beyond the $14,000 gift threshold, but here's a hypothetical I'd like to get some feedback on:

*We set up a loan for \~$60,000 at a low interest rate (I understand there are generally recommended AFR minimum rates, under 1%). I pay back the loan in full within one year, and depending on the interest rate, I pay increments each month until paying back in full.*

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions:

* How low of an interest rate is ""reasonable""? Could interest payments be deferred for, say, 6-12 months?
* Could the interest paid to family then be sent back to me as a ""gift""? (This, to me, would seem sketchy, but I am curious.)
* How extensive does such a loan agreement need to be; meaning: would a signed piece of paper or an email suffice? Or might there be a general loan agreement template that's recommended?
* Is there a better/simpler way to set up such a loan with family?

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to pay interest, but I also want to ensure the process is as simple and easy for the family member -- meaning, as little paper work and tax implications on their end -- as possible.

I was offered a new job earning $75,000/year. I would take out 5% for my 403(b) pre-tax to get my employer’s match, putting me at $71,250 which would be the amount I’m taxed at (is that correct?). I am currently making $71,000/year. I currently do not need to pay monthly premiums for health insurance, whereas my new job would require me to, but that is deducted post-tax (is that correct?). The only information I see on the HR site is that the monthly costs are taken out of each paycheck, and I assumed that meant post-tax.

Assuming no changes to my allowances on my federal/state taxes, should my take home pay be basically identical (not factoring in health insurance costs)?",finance

personalfinance,Need help/info on repairing my credit score.,"So eight+ years ago I got like four diff credit cards when I was like 20 y/o, maxed them all out really fast, and eventually stopped paying them all together. My credit score is super low now but all of the accounts are removed. Now I want to start repairing my score which is at a FICO 545 since those accounts aren’t affecting it anymore. I just got a CC that I only plan on using 10% of each month by making a bunch of small purchases and paying the balance almost immediately. I was just wondering if anyone knows how much my score could go up if I do this consistently every month for a year? Also if you have ANY other tips for me on ways I can fix my score I would REALLY appreciate it! Some background, I’ve never had nor do I currently have a car loan because I’ve always bought my cars in cash,I’ve been renting an apartment the whole time so I literally don’t have any debt since those accounts fell off. My credit limit on the cc when i get it in the mail is really low ($300) with a v high interest rate, but I really will only use it up to $30 every month and will pay every balance almost immediately after making it.",finance

personalfinance,Opening a traditional IRA or wait it out?,"**Edit:** Title should say *taxable brokerage* not traditional IRA. Apologies.

I am a 21 year old senior in college. I am set to graduate in May 2022. I just finished a summer internship, and during the school year, I work at various on-campus jobs.

My summer internship paid well so I used that money to max my 2021 Roth IRA. I have another $6k put aside to immediately max my 2022 Roth IRA in January. Once the 2022 Roth is maxed, I will have achieved CoastFi, if relevant.

I don’t have an employer plan through my campus jobs. I know getting a job (especially post-grad/entry level) can take a while, so, I’m wondering if it’s worth the time opening a taxable brokerage account in the meantime to invest in, until I find a job and (hopefully) get an employer plan? 

Or should I redirect the funds to something else? I have 7.5k subsidized student loans (taken out during my first and second year when I had gaps in my financial aid due to on-campus living requirement). The interest rate is 4% and my grace period ends November 2022.
**Edit**: I currently have a HYSA where I am saving up payments. Current balance is $1,500.

I could also start saving up funds for a potential relocation (I plan to negotiate this if required, though). I have no clue where I’ll be going (open to lots of places but avoiding HCOL places like NYC/LA for now), but my lease ends in June 2022. I plan to start looking for FT Employment in January.

I have a fully funded emergency fund and have the remainder of my lease saved up in rent. My tuition is already paid.

personalfinance,Explain why I shouldn't use a margin account as an emergency fund,"Iv done some research on this strategy and it seems to be unpopular, but just looking at the numbers and risk, I don't know why?

Consider this scenario:

- High income
- stable job
- fairly low debt load
- 6k monthly expenses
- 50k emergency fund in saving account earning 2% interest

Why should I not move my emergency fund to an interactive brokers brokerage account, invest it in an s&amp;p or total market fund (earning significantly more than 2%) and use a margin account (2.5% interest rate) as an emergency fund? 

From my understanding, I would be able to take out 50% of my investible assets (25k) in cash, which would cover 3 months of expenses in my case. 

The main risk that I know of is that during a market down turn when you are most likely to need emergency funds, your assets will be falling, reducing the amount you can take out on margin. I'm aware of this risk and will continue increasing the amount of marginable assets over time, slowly reducing overall risk. 

Given that I have a stable job and high/fairly diversified income, I see the likelihood that I would need to dip into an emergency fund being low. So why should I keep a large (and growing) sum of cash in an account earning 2% when I can get much higher returns using a slightly more riskly/complex method?",finance
personalfinance,Dealership really wants my car,"Hello! First time poster long time lurker :D 

I was at the dealership today because of some car trouble and as per usual, one of the salesmen tried to get me to trade in my car. Now the start of my day was going downhill quick and my car stalling was the last thing I needed so I just listened to his offer. 

According to him I could get lower monthly payments, money in my pocket (that was their biggest pitch of course), lower interest rate, get myself in a 2021 civic, and all these very lovely flashy things. 

My first thought was hell no I don't want to do that dealership dance all over again when my car is only 2 years old and barely has 10k miles on it. Plus the emotional attachment I have to it makes it hard.

My main concern although is that the bank denied my refinancing bc according to them a 740 credit score and a $25 hourly rate, is not good enough. I don't make enough money to take my brother out of the loan and keep making the payments by myself. The guy at the dealership of course said that wasn't a problem and he couldn't believe the refinancing got denied. I was shy of a few months of being at my current job for a year so, that was a factor in the denial too. 

My mom says to go for it with the new car (just bc the car gave trouble once) and I am a bit strapped for cash since I had to spend some money for a little emergency. I don't want to get carried away by the ""money in your pockets"" thing, is that even real? I would think it would just go back to the price of the car as a downpayment and I don't think it'll be smart to have another hard Inquiry on my credit score when the last one was 2 years ago. 

Would this be a smart thing to do? Any help is appreciated, thank you so much in advance!",finance
datascience,ELI14: Attention vs. self-attention in deep sequence models,"# TL;DR: In this post I lay out my understandings of attention and self-attention. I'd just love some feedback on whether I've really understood them, both their similarities and differences.

I am learning about attention and self-attention in RNNs and Transformers. I’m not convinced I understand these mechanisms correctly, i.e., their similarities and differences, and I don’t want to move on until I do. I think I just need the right explanation to make it all click, but haven't found it yet. I'd love one which is approachable and intuitive, but which doesn't shy away from technical details, hence ELI14 and not ELI5.

## Anyway, here's my understanding of attention, which I'll call ""vanilla attention"":

Intuitively, it's a component which allows a model to focus its ""decision-making"" more on certain (more relevant) areas of the input than others by making the relevant areas more salient. More rigorously, it uses a single decoder hidden state to generate a vector of normalized similarity metrics (.e., scalar attention scores). These metrics are used to element-wise attenuate all of the encoder's hidden states, *but attenuate the more-relevant states less*. The attenuated states are then linearly combined into some ""context vector"", which is then fed into the decoder in addition to the previous decoder step's (unmodified) hidden state. **Vanilla attention is therefore all about supplying additional information directly from the encoder to the decoder in the form of a step-specific context vector.**

## And here's my understanding of self-attention:

Intuitively, it's a component which takes all the information contained in a series of vectors and transforms these vectors such that their combined information is distributed across all them in a way that emphasizes relevant information and de-emphasizes less relevant information. Like vanilla attention, this redistribution-by-relevance relies on attenuation via normalized similarity metrics - hence ""attention"" in the name. However, unlike vanilla attention, (1) the similarity metrics encode how relevant each input vector is to each other input vector, not how relevant they are to a decoder hidden state, (2) the input vectors are not (necessarily) encoder hidden states, and (3) the attenuated input vectors are not combined into a context vector, but rather simply transformed into a set of new vectors whose components now directly encode each vector's relevance. **Self-attention therefore has nothing inherently to do with connecting encoder to decoder, and instead is all about transforming inputs to make them more informative for a given time step.**

To illustrate that last sentence, it seems like self-attention could even be applied during the encoding steps, taking e.g., raw word embeddings from the source sequence as inputs, using similarity/relevance to ""smear"" information across these embeddings, then feed those new-and-improved embeddings into the encoder, ditching the original embeddings. In this example, there is nary a decoder in sight.

## **So to summarize, here are the similarities between vanilla attention and self-attention as I understand them:**

- both involving weighting vectors by similarity to some input vector, effectively telling a model where to focus its attention

## **And here are the differences:**

- vanilla attention connects encoder to decoder; self-attention is completely ""self-contained"" and doesn't imply a decoder

- vanilla attention computes the similarity of every encoder hidden state with a single decoder hidden state; self-attention computes similarity of every input vector with every other input vector

- vanilla attention outputs a single vector; self-attention outputs a series of vectors, one per input vector

- vanilla attention relies on inner products to compute similarity; self-attention seems to have several different possible mechanisms, ranging from simple dot products to the much more complicated query-key-value paradigm (I didn't discuss this difference in this post, but wanted to put it out there)

- self-attention mechanisms can be composed such that the output of one self-attention mechanism can be the input to another; I'm not sure this compositionality would make sense with vanilla self-attention (I didn't discuss this difference either)

Okay, this post is getting long AF. I could say more, but might start to ramble, and anyway I've made my points. **So I'll stop here and just ask: Is everything I've said correct, and have I grasped the key similarities and differences of vanilla- and self-attention? Or am I way wide of the mark?**

Please weigh in on anything I've said. I really look forward to any discussion this post will generate. Thanks for sticking to the end!",technology

stocks,Betting against 20+ year treasury bonds is a win-win,"**I believe shorting 20+ year treasury bonds are a win-win.** I also believe that the bond market can only proceed forward in one of two ways.
 

**1:** The Federal Reserve raises interest rates, and bonds prices come back to earth. Interest rates are about as low as they can reasonably go, therefore the only way they can truly move going forward is either up or to stagnate.
 


**2:** The Federal Reserve chooses to stagnate interest rates and keep them low, this allows inflation to grow and the inflation is what brings treasury bond prices down.
 

 
And if the Federal Reserve chooses to somehow lower the already incredibly low interest rates, then that will simply speed up inflation rates which would ultimately also bring bond prices down. This would also likely lead to them raising the interest rates sooner down the road.
 
 

Essentially, no matter what happens moving forward, bond prices will come down.
 
 

The good news is that historically, this exact scenario has play out a bunch of different times, meaning there are already a few inversed and leveraged 20+ year bond ETFs we can play with to gain some exposure.
 
 
A couple of things to be aware of is that this is a long term play. I don't expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates until the unemployment rate returns to close to what it was prior to the pandemic. This could take potentially until the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2022. Powell himself said that the Reserve would raise rates mid 2023 at the latest. Now we're certainly on track to see rates increase much sooner than mid 2023, but please plan your positions accordingly if you do partake. 
 

 
 
There is also the potential that the country shuts down for a second time due the Covid Variants. If that is the case then the Federal Reserve won't do anything, and we will have to lean on the growing inflation rates to drive down treasury bond prices.

personalfinance,Helping refinance my parents' house?,"My parents have $26k left on the principle for their house and about 7 years left on the mortgage. The monthly payment is $1200. I don't actually know the interest rate but the house &amp; the 4 acres of land around it was purchased for $150k ish (low col - we're in the Deep South) and thus the payment sounds pretty high to me. For reference, a friend just bought a $116k house with no money down via a USDA rural development loan and pays like $750/mo for her mortgage. I'm assuming their rate is much higher than what's going on right now. 

That being said, neither of my parents have stellar credit scores and Mom was out of work due to COVID. She's back at work (and incredibly happy so I'm hoping for some real longevity at this position) and our finances are going to straighten back out but unfortunately they've got a lot of cc debt. Like $30k. 

I moved back home for COVID and will be working and taking grad school classes part-time for free, since I work for the university. I make $30k and am hoping that I'll get some raises but that's a hope, not a guarantee. My income is low but my credit score is 730 and my work history w the university is 5 years, since I basically have the staff version of the job I had as a student. 

My folks and I are going to start planning our ""farm"" and planting fruit trees soon so that they can start maturing. My plan is to stay at my current job until I finish my MS and then move to get my PhD. Ideally, I'll come back home after that and work at the small college in my hometown but there's the university research campus (where my current job is), and USDA outpost, and this is a regional extension hub. I think I'd be able to get a relevant job in/near my hometown with a PhD but the pay might be quite low. If I do move back home - which I know I want to do but is predicated on getting a job - I'd literally move back into my parents' house, with plans for a master suite addition on the other side of the house from theirs. 

That might sound bizarre but my parents and I have an excellent relationship, they're getting old (in their 60s to my mid 20s), and we're trying to do the farm thing. Plus I love my house. It's a great house and it's the only home I've had - we moved in when I was 6 months old. That being said, if moving into the house isn't a possibility in the future and I have to just sell it, once my folks die or have to move into assisted living, we're pretty sure the value has risen. Above friend who paid $116k for her house got a much smaller house on like half an acre. 

So ANYWAY, on to my question - should I float the idea of them refinancing with me as a cosigner (mainly bc their credit scores are bad)? My after tax monthly income is $1850 so I could afford the house payment if shit really hit the fan. I'm an only child so I'm going to inherit the house when they pass (hopefully in 2 decades or more). Combined, their salaries are $110k ish but I have no idea about monthly income. They can certainly afford the house when they're both employed, though. 

I've started paying for groceries so that the parental income earmarked for groceries can go to cc debt. I'm going to put some of it on a 0% apr for 18 months card and try to get some more balance transfer-friendly cards. I'm also considering a debt consolidation loan from the local credit union and last, considering pulling out some money - maybe $10k? - when/if we refi bc the interest difference is astronomical. Their discover apr is 21% on $15k ish. 

I'm trying really hard for them to be totally debt free by the time I leave for my PhD in 3 or 4 years bc Dad's looking to retire in a few years and I can't focus on myself entirely (and go back to grad stipend pay, choke) if they're having money issues. 

Other than ""I'll be responsible for the payment if shit goes sideways,"" what are the considerations here? Ought we put me on the deed? What does that do for taxes? If we pay off the house before I'm looking to buy a house (IF I can't just move back home) will that impact my ability to buy a house? If we don't? If I own (or co-own?) a house when I get married, can that be protected in a prenup? I certainly hope to never get divorced (and don't have anyone to marry at this point anyway) but I'll be damned if my family home &amp; land &amp; micro farm gets broken up or sold bc I have to get divorced. That shit is MINE. 

Thanks for reading all this  - I felt you needed plenty of specifics to get a full picture. Happy to answer more questions if I've missed something and sorry I don't have more data about the mortgage itself; I haven't even suggested this to my folks bc I need a better understanding of it myself. 

PS: I'd love it if the farm starts making some decent money in like a decade but it's not really to make money. It's be an intensive hobby, basically: give my (ag scientist) dad something to do when he retires, for me (an ag social scientist - I study food systems) to have an at-home agroecological laboratory, and raise my (theoretical, eventual) kids with a strong tie to ag &amp; the food cycle. Plus fresh food! We're working on figuring out the orchard aspect now and will add chickens soon. Dairy goats and bees will be added when I move home permanently. And I keep hearing about small farm tax reductions? Happy to hear about that from anybody.",finance

Link: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03

Noteworthy Excerpts: 

&gt; Let me start at the beginning. 

&gt;It was Halloween night 2008, in the middle of the financial crisis, when Satoshi Nakamoto published an eight-page paper[1] on a cypherpunk mailing list that’d been run by cryptographers since 1992.[2]

&gt;Nakamoto — we still don’t know who she, he, or they were — wrote, “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”[3]

&gt;Nakamoto had solved two riddles that had dogged these cryptographers and other technology experts for a couple of decades: first, how to move something of value on the internet without a central intermediary; and relatedly, how to prevent the “double-spending” of that valuable digital token.

&gt;Subsequently, his innovation spurred the development of crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology.

&gt;Based upon Nakamoto’s innovation, about a dozen years later, the crypto asset class has ballooned. As of Monday, this asset class purportedly is worth about $1.6 trillion, with 77 tokens worth at least $1 billion each and 1,600 with at least a $1 million market capitalization.[4]

/

&gt;We already live in an age of digital public monies — the dollar, euro, sterling, yen, yuan. If that wasn’t obvious before the pandemic, it has become eminently clear over the last year that we increasingly transact online.

&gt;Such public fiat monies fulfill the three functions of money: a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.

&gt;No single crypto asset, though, broadly fulfills all the functions of money.

&gt;Primarily, crypto assets provide digital, scarce vehicles for speculative investment. Thus, in that sense, one can say they are highly speculative stores of value.

&gt;These assets haven’t been used much as a unit of account.

&gt;We also haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange. To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions, and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with Colonial Pipeline.

&gt;With the advent of the internet age and the movement from physical money to digital money several decades ago, nations around the globe layered various public policy goals over our digital public money system.

/

&gt;The SEC has a three-part mission — to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets in between them. We focus on financial stability as well. But at our core, we’re about investor protection.

&gt;If you want to invest in a digital, scarce, speculative store of value, that’s fine. Good-faith actors have been speculating on the value of gold and silver for thousands of years.

&gt;Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West.

&gt;This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications. There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.

&gt;If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.

&gt;First, many of these tokens are offered and sold as securities.

&gt;There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front. In the 1930s, Congress established the definition of a security, which included about 20 items, like stock, bonds, and notes. One of the items is an investment contract.

&gt;The following decade, the Supreme Court took up the definition of an investment contract. This case said an investment contract exists when “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”[6] The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this Howey Test.

&gt;Further, this is but one of many ways we determine whether tokens must comply with the federal securities laws.

&gt;I think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: “To the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities — and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security — we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.”[7]

&gt;I find myself agreeing with Chairman Clayton. You see, generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects. I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.

&gt;This leaves prices open to manipulation. This leaves investors vulnerable.

&gt;Over the years, the SEC has brought dozens of actions in this area,[8] prioritizing token-related cases involving fraud or other significant harm to investors. We haven’t yet lost a case.

&gt;Moreover, there are initiatives by a number of platforms to offer crypto tokens or other products that are priced off of the value of securities and operate like derivatives.

&gt;Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These products are subject to the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.

&gt;I’ve urged staff to continue to protect investors in the case of unregistered sales of securities.

&gt;Next, I’d like to discuss crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and other “decentralized finance” (DeFi) platforms.

&gt;The world of crypto finance now has platforms where people can trade tokens and other venues where people can lend tokens. I believe these platforms not only can implicate the securities laws; some platforms also can implicate the commodities laws and the banking laws.

&gt;A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.

&gt;Moreover, unlike other trading markets, where investors go through an intermediary like the New York Stock Exchange, people can trade on crypto trading platforms without a broker — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from around the globe.

&gt;Further, while many overseas platforms state they don’t allow U.S. investors, there are allegations that some unregulated foreign exchanges facilitate trading by U.S. traders who are using virtual private networks, or VPNs.[9]

&gt;The American public is buying, selling, and lending crypto on these trading, lending, and DeFi platforms, and there are significant gaps in investor protection.

&gt;Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption.

&gt;Make no mistake: If a lending platform is offering securities, it also falls into SEC jurisdiction.

/

&gt;Before I conclude, I’d like to note we have taken and will continue to take our authorities as far as they go.

&gt;Certain rules related to crypto assets are well-settled. The test to determine whether a crypto asset is a security is clear.

&gt;There are some gaps in this space, though: We need additional Congressional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks. We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.

&gt;We stand ready to work closely with Congress, the Administration, our fellow regulators, and our partners around the world to close some of these gaps.

&gt;In my view, the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending, and DeFi platforms. Regulators would benefit from additional plenary authority to write rules for and attach guardrails to crypto trading and lending.

&gt;Right now, large parts of the field of crypto are sitting astride of — not operating within — regulatory frameworks that protect investors and consumers, guard against illicit activity, ensure for financial stability, and yes, protect national security.

&gt;Standing astride isn’t a sustainable place to be. For those who want to encourage innovations in crypto, I’d like to note that financial innovations throughout history don’t long thrive outside of our public policy frameworks.

&gt;At the heart of finance is trust. And at the heart of trust in markets is investor protection. If this field is going to continue, or reach any of its potential to be a catalyst for change, we better bring it into public policy frameworks.  

I know when Gensler was appointed there was much hope that he would take a very soft line on crypto markets, it would seem that he is laying out firm intention at this point to pursue fraudulent and misleading offers heavily.  Obviously nobody knows what this will look like in practice, but I'm sure anyone who's been paying attention to that space long enough has seen a few coins that ended up being scams of some sort.",finance
financialindependence,10 years of the FI journey,"10 years ago I had finished grad school and started my first post-grad job. That was also when I had started learning about the idea of FIRE, and I was sold. My net worth was negative (hi, student loans). 10 years later, I'm not there yet, but I'm closing in - the end is in sight! 

My entire career (both pre- and post-grad school) has been in tech - the video games industry for a long time, then Yahoo, and now in fintech. But I'm not a software engineer or a product manager - I started my career in customer service, and I still work in customer service management. No real tech skills here, just gradual development of leadership skills. 

I really, really hate debt, so even though the interest rate on my ~$50k grad school loan was fairly low (I think like 5% or so), I focused on paying it off quickly. I know that investing that money in the stock market would have been the financially optimal decision, but for me personally, paying off the debt was more important for my own mental well-being.

Along the way I also picked up a side hustle, which is daily fantasy sports. I both play DFS and I also now create content around DFS strategy. The income here has swung wildly (including one year in which I lost money), but in aggregate my total net income from DFS, both playing it and creating content for it, has been around $300k over about 7 years (so, about $40k/year or so). 

My wife is an artist who has somewhat worked on her own small art businesses over the years, with a break after we had our kiddo (and another forced break due to Covid). She's made some money in this space (she makes silicone mermaid tails, of all things!), but the majority of our income has come from my side of things.

Here's a year-by-year highlight reel (net worth numbers as of August of each year):

**2011** - Started new post-grad job in customer service at an online game developer. Net worth about -$40k, salary $52k in San Francisco (so, not exactly a lot for SF!)

**2012** - Promoted to manager, new salary of $75k. Net work ""up"" to about -$10k. 

**2013** - Moved to Portland, OR to open a new office for my employer. Got a raise to $100k. Net worth finally positive at $59k, student loans paid off!

**2014** - Promoted to director, new salary $155k, net worth up to $125k. Bought a house for $530k (planning to have a kid at this point, wanted to buy a house large enough and in a great school district, so paid more here than we ""had"" to so that we could be in the area we really wanted to be in). 

**2015** - Changed jobs and went to Yahoo in a senior director of customer service role. New salary $160k, but also with bonus + equity (prior role was a startup, so I had stock options, but the company was floundering so options weren't likely to go anywhere). Net worth up to $196k.

**2016** - Salary didn't really change, but between the equity and bonus part of my comp at Yahoo, my income went way up (sadly I only have net after-tax income tracked here, but it totaled about $176k after taxes). Net worth almost doubled this year (!!) to $396k. Daughter was born in September, woohoo! We also purchased a single family home as a rental property this year as a way to diversify away from a pure stock market investment strategy. 

**2017** - Stable at Yahoo, total after-tax comp was $217k (difference from prior year primarily due to a higher bonus). Weird that Yahoo was paying such generous bonuses when the company was struggling, but they were really trying hard to compete for talent. Net worth up to $633k primarily thanks to great stock market performance. Yahoo was also purchased by Verizon in the middle of this year. 

**2018** - It's becoming clear that the future at Yahoo/Verizon is not promising. Yahoo had an agreement that guaranteed any employees a strong severance package if any acquirer laid them off within 1 year of acquisition. I was in a position to engineer my own layoff here, and I took it, ending my employment in November 2018. I got 6 months' severance pay, insurance, plus immediate vesting of all outstanding equity. This resulted in net after-tax income of almost $300k in 2018. Net worth in August 2018 shot up to $835k. 

**2019** - With a young daughter and a generous severance package, I decided to take some time off post-Yahoo to spend a lot of extra time with the kiddo. I didn't start a new job until May of 2019 but I would not trade this time for anything in the world. In my new role I was hired to build out a new customer support office, with a starting salary of around $180k plus equity. Total net salary this year was only about $70k (because I only worked half the year), but a lot of the Yahoo equity that was vested after my layoff did not actually ""process"" until early 2019, so my net income for the year still ended up being about $170k between salary/equity. This is also when I started creating fantasy sports content. Net worth passed $1M in February (with the big equity chunk vesting) and was at $1.25M in August. 

**2020** - Ah, the Covid year. Fortunately, my job isn't impacted, and in fact our company does phenomenally well during the pandemic (as many tech companies did/are doing). As we saw with Covid, there was a disproportionate economic impact - those with money and secure jobs did extremely well due to a booming market, those without money and/or secure jobs really struggled. I was extremely lucky to be in the former group (and as a result, upped we upped our charitable giving). Got a modest raise and an incredibly well-timed equity grant at the annual merit cycle (the date on which the equity grant was priced was near the bottom of the Covid market crash, so that meant my grant of $X resulted in more shares). Net worth climbed to $1.42M in August. 

**2021** - Another annual raise has put my base salary at $215k, with estimated equity vesting at almost another $400k/year. The equity is (obviously) a massive component of my total compensation, driven by the company's stock more than 3x'ing since the date I joined (and the 2020 equity grant is at about 6x the grant price). All of this plus a really strong stock market rally and my best year of fantasy sports to date has pushed our net worth up to almost $2.3M. Our target number is around $3M or slightly higher - it's so close I can taste it. 

Some comments: 

* I have been VERY lucky in many ways. I had student debt, but it wasn't nearly as significant as many others (I had no undergrad debt - went to a community college for 2 years, then a state school, and a combination of working + parental assistance meant no debt here). I've worked for a company that both avoided Covid impact and has had a skyrocketing stock price. We have not had any significant health issues. 
* All that said, while luck obviously plays a factor in our lives, we can also somewhat prepare for it. Yes, the company I work for has done extremely well - but I also selected this company intentionally because I strongly believed in its long-term future. 
* I benefited from working for a fast-growing startup right out of grad school that allowed me rapid career progression (the pay was only ever ""decent"" for the Bay area, but I moved from a supervisor/lead type of role to a director level role in just 4 years). Working at fast-growing companies means lots of opportunity for advancement if you work hard and are good at what you do. Then I moved over to a larger company (Yahoo) where I was able to reap the financial rewards of being at that level. My career progression would have been a LOT slower had I not worked at that fast-growing gaming company (we went from 50 to 500 employees in a little over a year...then down to 250 a couple of years later. Quite a roller coaster). 
* While the majority of our investments are in index funds (about 80% or so), I have also invested in individual stocks and cryptocurrency, both of which have done extremely well. I believe that most people are best served via index funds, but if you're willing to put in the (fairly significant) time and effort, it's reasonable to invest a small portion of your portfolio in more risky assets. In my case, I believe in ""stick to what you know"" - I work in tech, so all of my individual stocks are in tech. I've done particularly well in picking small to medium tech companies (Shopify, Okta, Fortinet, and Match have been some of my biggest winners). I recognize I'm taking on additional risk here - but in part it's fun and interesting to me, and in part I believe that ~15 years working in tech has given me enough insight to be able to identify companies with bright futures. 
* We have largely avoided lifestyle creep. We're not perfect here, but we live in the same house we bought in 2014 and have no plans to move, our cars are 2010 and 2011 Nissans, we don't really buy a lot of random other crap.
* My overall timing was pretty fortunate in that we've been in a long-term bull market for the entirety of my FI journey. That has contributed enormously to the pace of net worth increase.
* All of this was without some specialized skillset. I started in customer service and worked my way up, learning to be a (hopefully) effective leader along the way. You don't have to be a software engineer, doctor, or lawyer in order to make significant income.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Nice seeing ETH get back above 2700. Now can it get back and stay?,"Two parts to this post (comment and question). 

1. Just love seeing my beloved ETH climb passed the $2700 mark. https://imgur.com/a/XFyO8cN 

Pretty impressive to see how much faster interest accrues when it’s that high. Makes me anxious in anticipation to see how fast it climbs when ETH is over 3-4k. 

2. I’m staking on CB because I can’t afford the 32 coins to stake elsewhere. I know there are higher interest rates to be had, but not sure what other platforms are out there that don’t require such a large amount that offer better or even comparable interest rates. Who is getting better than 5% and where are you staking?

btc,We Can't Let DeFi Lose,"People have speculated on how the Eu and US would ban DeFi or force KYC on it. Well they can do so much more than you think they can. Practically all I do these days is follow legal developments with DeFi. Last month, a very good post on r/cryptocurrency was put up about the Fatf and it got 3k likes. That was the first time I saw the major reddit community acknoweledge how serious this is, after I tried to speak about it for 2 years. 

They absolutely intend to force KYC on defi globally, and can. That is the intention of the infrastructure bill, the intention of Gensler's statements. It is consistent with Mnuchin. It is fully outlined in the Fatf report. They left it vague because ultimately there are people in the US and EU goverment who fully believe that they can enforce KYC on miners, validators, nodes, and DeFi apps. 

They want total mass surveillance. This is obviously for greater nefarious political goals. The desire for this level of surveillance is coming from a larger political trend by western oligarchs to remake the west as a totalitarian system of persistent surveillance in a manner of social credit and negative interest rate central bank digital currency based tracking. They do not want their farm animals off the grid or out of the gate. If you can't see this after 18 months of pandemic politics than I truly cannot help you. 

This is about more than finance. This is about code, speech, and finance, and media and press on an unconfiscatible, uncensorable, undeplatformable, fully disintermediated backbone full tech stack on the internet, otherwise known as web 3.0 We are headed towards full bore totalitarianism because of the level of oligarchic control in the west that multinational corporations and federal agencies have now with artificial intelligence through the likes of Palintir, Insulir, Google, and various defense contract systems. Things Witney Webb talks about by the way. 

Not only is this not conspiratorial, it is very dour and urgently dangerous to liberal western democracy. We must get off corporate press and social media, and onto uncensorable web 3.0. This is becoming a 1984 playbook very rapidly.

Our lives and freedom are dependent on web 3 developer and defi developer who can make this tech stack backbone to the internet. 

Gensler and the EU want a trust based system of public policy. We know what that means, and we know why we build trustless systems. But this is an ideological battle for public narrative. They have the nuclear option, they can and will come for miners and developers, there are plenty who want to do so, and moreover they can and will try to destroy the price of an non compliant coin. The only coins that will be left alone are ethereum and bitcoin for the most part because they are easy to regulate. Defi is not easy to control, it really threatens their system, and they will absolutely crush the price. It's hardly worth it at this rate to be a doxxed defi team. That alone isn't good for human development. So we need to get the public narrative on our side.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Refinancing a house we will sell soon-ish: should we do 30 years and invest the savings, or do 20 years?","We bought the house 4 years ago on a boring 30 year fixed rate mortgage. We had PMI, but the market has gone crazy here and we will be able to cancel it. The interest rates are about 1.8% lower than we have on our current loan. Refinancing seems like a no- brainer. We have two options:

1) Refinance for 30 years. This saves us about $600/month (with interest rate and getting rid of PMI). We could take that $600 and put it toward retirement savings or college fund or some other investment. 

2) Refinance for 20 years. Our payment would stay the same, but more of the payment would be going to principal since the interest rate is lower and we aren’t paying PMI. 

We will likely sell the house somewhere in the next 2 - 5 years, so it’s not about paying the loan off sooner.

personalfinance,"As an International student with no credit history, I'm trying to get a car loan and a credit card","Hello,



As stated in the title, I'm currently trying to get a car loan and a credit card to start building my credit score and to make my life easier, let me explain my situation and give detailed information about it:



I'm on an F1 visa and got here 9 months ago. I got a part-time job on campus which I can work for full time during the summer (for 1 more month). I got the job approximately 1.5 months ago, but due to the high volume of new hires, the number of shifts I got each week were absolutely terrible: they were pretty low and I wasn't really able to get more. I get paid $9/hr currently and I have received 2 pay statements so far, totaling at $144 currently. I will be getting much more hours as I spoke to the managers, hitting 35-40 hours very soon (most likely starting by the end of this week, my next week will be 35+ hrs) but unfortunately the previous pay statements I can show is little. I can prove that I'll be getting more shifts and income, and I do have external income sources to help me out further. I have had my Social Security Number for about 2 months now and I just got my bank account set and currently have a pay card as well. Unfortunately, I do not have any credit score yet and trying to establish one, but it will take me a decent amount of time to be able to get a decent score, but honestly, I do not see any possible ways to establish a credit score without getting a credit card or a loan.



I just made an inquiry to get a low limit ($500), unsecured credit card to use today after creating my bank account and also applied for an auto loan, both got declined from the credit union of my school. I do understand why and I'm not surprised, but I'm willing to go for the highest interest rates possible, with the longest possible terms to minimize monthly payments and minimize risks for lenders and/or increase their benefits. You might think that the rates I'm willing to go for sounds crazy or is a bad idea, but frankly, I **really** want to start from somewhere and I'm willing to make the required sacrifices for it. Even with a very high interest rate and low monthly payments, if I'm going to get declined, how am I going to do this? The vehicle I would like to get is a used vehicle no older than 10 years, less than 100k mileage, and the maximum range I'm willing to go for is about 12k. I'm ready to make a down payment of 1500-2000 (can go for 2000 but prefer 1500 if possible) already and I also stated this as well. What are my options? Which lenders will work the best for me? Thanks in advance for your help and my apologies for the lengthy and possibly poorly formatted post. I also used the ""credit"" flair while talking about both getting a car loan and a credit card, jumping between subjects, I also would like to apologize in advance for that, my mind is just messed up right now and I'm feeling hopeless.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on my current financial situation, would you guys mind looking over my income, expenses and goals?","Hey guys, I took a deep dive into this subreddit after posting here concerning a new car purchase I decided to sit down and take a nice look at my finances now that I've been working for a full year. I was wondering if you guys would mind looking at my financial circumstance and tell me how I'm managing and maybe give advice on areas I can trim and adjust.

I'm 24, and I've graduated and secured a job paying 62k per year. I've been juggling my finances over the past year to develop a rough budget, set some simple goals and pay off some lingering expenses. I utilized an incentive bonus to pay off my car so that's entirely paid for, and I moved out at the beginning of the year to have a separate work space while I WFH. My monthly take home is roughly $3,200 after taxes, benefits, and 401(k) contributions (I contribute 6% of pre-tax income at the moment and my employer matches 25% of the first 6% of my pay) and my expenses/budgets for the month are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Description|Amount|
|:-|:-|
| Student Loans (I currently only pay private but will start federal in Oct, I refinanced my multiple private loans into one 4%, 16 year loan)|$684 ($919 including federal)|
|Car Insurance|100|
|Phone Bill|47|
|Rent|850|
|Parking (necessary)|45|
|Internet|54|
|Utilities|\~75 (depends on month, currently using AC)|
|Gas|100 (this is a random calculation, with WFH it's been mostly ad hoc payments for gas as needed)|
|Food|200 (one of my major hobbies is cooking and baking so that's considered)|
|**TOTAL**|**$2,155 (2,389 with federal loans)** |

This leaves me with roughly $1,000 after all is said and done to spend on things like eating out, happy hours and other fun activities as well as the remainder being used for savings.

I manage a credit card and bank account, I currently have about $7,000 in liquid cash and a credit score of roughly 750.

My financial goals at the moment are:

* Build an emergency saving of at least $10k
* Make advanced payments on my private student loans (looking to allocate about $200 a month after my pay raise)
* Save for a new car in the future (down payment of 5k+ so when I'm ready to purchase a new car I'm prepared)

Lastly, I'm expecting a pay raise in the next month as I have an offer for a new job paying me 65k in a lower cost area (I'll eliminate city wage tax securing more money as well, but I'm going to try and negotiate even higher salary).

Ultimately I'm just curious based off this information how do I look financially? Would you recommend I tailor my budget or goals elsewhere to account for something you'd think is more important? At the moment I'm saving money (may not be the fastest) but I'm very comfortable and happy in my current position, which I think is more important than penny pinching in all facets to pay off a loan faster or something like that.",finance
personalfinance,Details of Consolidating CC Debt With Personal Loan,"I have about $18k in credit card debt across 4 credit cards at 20.99-22.99% APR, which I am (very) slowly chipping away at.

But I'm also assuming it is still lower than 21-23%.

My question is not whether or not I should, but rather HOW? Do I take out a loan for the full amount and pay them off entirely? Or should I be keeping a small balance on the cards? I don't necessarily understand how my credit will be affected if the balances are dramatically reduced to $0 vs  some other amount or percentage. After, should I literally not touch the cards? Or make small purchases each month that are easily paid off to maintain activity? TIA.",finance

personalfinance,AMEX/Webster CC Dilemma,"I’m in a CC dilemma. 

I have a points reward card with Amex because I used to be a Webster Bank employee last year &amp; they had a partnership (Webster Bank Employees wouldn’t have to pay an annual fee). I was informed that if I ever left Webster, to avoid the $100 anual fee, I could downgrade the card to a cash back rewards.

I have since left Webster &amp; these businesses are no longer partners. 

I contacted both of these business to do something to avoid annual fees but, I no longer have the option to downgrade/upgrade to any other card. 

My only option is to cancel my current Amex card. 

Would my credit hurt if I was to cancel this Amex card? I see no point in having it. It’s interest rate is insane, they don’t offer any 0 apr offers, the point rewards system isnt my thing (I really would prefer cash back), and I’m paying $100 for nothing.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 4, 2021**

Today was another choppy day, with stocks ending the day mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.48% and 0.89% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell 1.25%. It seems market participants were disappointed by a report from ADP, a leading employment services company, which estimated that private employers added half the expected amount of jobs in July. This sets a negative backdrop for the official July Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. 

ADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP’s report isn’t 100% accurate, it’s usually fairly close and sets a negative backdrop for the official July Job Report on Friday. ADP’s report shows that the labor market imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic remain. Moreover, with concerns surrounding the Delta variant increasing, that could be a relatively new factor adding more pressure. Here is the entire report: [https://adpemploymentreport.com/](https://adpemploymentreport.com/)

Concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida emerging as the US’ new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) fell roughly 10% despite posting its first profitable quarter. Earnings are very weird.
* Shares of GM slipped 8% after posting earnings.
* Shares of NovaVax (NVAX) gapped up roughly 20$ after the company announced an agreement with the EU to sell up to 200 million COVID vaccines. 
* Shares of some Chinese companies somewhat after pulling back yesterday following signaling that the CCP may be targeting video game companies next as the regulatory crackdown on tech stocks continues. Yesterday, shares of Tencent (TCEHY) and other tech stocks fell after a state-media called video games ""spiritual opium"". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. 
* Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up again today, rising roughly 50% today.
* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday the central bank is still on track to begin raising rates off their current near-zero levels in 2023, as long as the economic recovery remains on its current trajectory. He said “While, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.”

personalfinance,Parental Situation: Pay down mortgage (or) invest?,"Hello Personal Finance Community,

I've found this subreddit to have a lot of good advice on how to best move forward with finance-related issues. Therefore, I wanted to see if you all might have some advice I can pass along to my parents regarding their situation. To provide the necessary context, my parents recently won a lawsuit for a modest amount with another civil suit (smaller) payout coming right behind it. My dad is 63 y.o and works way too much (72 hr/week - recently reduced from 88) as a security guard. My mom is currently pursuing an education in the medical field and will graduate in June of 2022 with an AA that can transfer into a standard four-year uni. 

Me personally, I'd like for my dad to work less and focus more on his health because no person should have to work those hours. So, I've been working with my mom to figure out how to put them into a better financial situation. Currently, they owe 450k on the house that looks to be worth about a million (likely due to the craziness going on with the housing market). Their monthly mortgage is $2,600 w/ house insurance &amp; property tax included. With doing necessary house repairs that could not wait any longer (hvac, flooring, &amp; termite), they will have 75k to allocate towards paying down their mortgage via Recast (or) towards an investment. Right now, they have an awesome 2.75% interest rate on their 30 year fixed. I am steering them towards doing a recast on their home, which would keep the 2.75% and allow them to drop their overall mortgage amount to 375k &amp; monthly payment w/ insurance &amp; property tax to around 1.8k-1.9k-ish. 

They will also have about 40k to just keep in their pocket + the smaller settlement that is waiting to be paid out after 4+ years of battling in court. However, we do not know how long or short it will take to get that payout. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question: So here is my question, with them having about 5 months worth of mortgage saved at that current 2,600.00 cost and some very minor savings, but no real retirement savings. What would be the best thing to do with that 75k? Do a home recast and reduce the monthly mortgage cost by around 800.00, thus reducing the amount my dad needs to work. Or investing that 75k somewhere safe to build some type of retirement fund? 

Last additional context: my mom plans to join the workforce likely sometime after graduating, so that will bring additional dollars into the house. But that's speculation right now as to how much and when. Let me know what you think and sorry for the poor spelling/formatting!",finance
algorand,"[update]I emailed Lofty over my concerns and they answered, quickly. Here are their responses.","Hello!

Yesterday I made this post about my concerns over Lofty's structure:

https://old.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/ox7u20/lofty_is_a_ftc_and_sec_nightmare_need_more/

They have directly answered each question and I am sharing their responses, unedited, below.

My takeaway - I still have questions, but I am comfortable in saying that this isn't a scam.

""Hi Donald,

Thanks for reaching out with your questions! Those questions actually have been asked multiple times before in Reddit and through a variety other channels such as our Discord channel, Slack group, and Telegram groups. However, the answers have been buried over time, so I'm happy to answer you here as well.

**Tokenized real estate. Are they securities? If yes, can we please see the SEC registration? If you are raising capital without the proper registration, please show us your Regulation D exception. The Howey test is commonly used to evaluate if something is a security or not, Lofty tokens seem to me a security under this criteria.**


We're currently engaging with regulators to make a presentation that what we are offering are not actually securities. This is because in essence, we're using technology to allow a group of real estate investors to invest together in a single real estate property. This process happens thousands of times per year in the US where a group of friends or small investment club get together, pool funds, to purchase a rental house as an investment. Frequently, these groups will often utilize an LLC as well to make sure they're not all individually liable for anything related to the operations of the rental property. As you can imagine, very few, if any, members in these groups register the investment as securities, nor do they take the time to verify each member's ""Accredited Investor"" status. Yet, none of them are prosecuted by regulators, both state and federal, as offering un-registered securities for sale. Turns out, there are often exemptions for these investment clubs, you can read more about it from the SEC site here: https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html.

I won't go too much into detail on exactly why we and our attorneys are confident enough to make a case to regulators that our offerings count as an investment club, as that would require a huge wall of text even longer than this current one. With that said, we've structured each property investment using Regulation D, for US investors, and Regulation S, for international investors, exemptions. You'll be able to see all the disclosures and self certification if you read our Terms of Service, which is a requirement to read before anyone is able to invest in the property on our platform. The reason we did this was based on the advice of our lawyers, who claimed if our argument to regulators regarding the ""Investment Club"" model was rejected, we would still have safe ground to stand on for these offerings, if examined more closely by the regulators. However, we were advised not to make the Form D filings yet, because by filing before our appointment date with the regulators, we would in essence be admitting that we do in fact believe our investments are securities, which would defeat the point of our presentation to the regulators in the first place. As a result, you would not be able to find any Form D filings on the government website from us. The plan is that if our ""Investment Club"" argument was accepted, we wouldn't need to file at all, and if the argument was rejected, we would then batch file all the form Ds from our existing list of offerings. So, hopefully this gives you some more clarity into the regulation side.

**Withdrawal - is it true that there is currently no way to withdraw said rental income other than emailing support?**


As for the withdrawals, there is a way to withdraw the rental income you've collected as an investor in the property. It's just not automated yet. This means, you have to reach out to us either through our online chat, email, or DMs in Telegram to request an ACH transfer to your bank account. Why is it not automated? Well, simply because we haven't built out the automation aspect of it yet, because we've prioritized other features and so far, only 3 people have requested a withdraw out of all the listings. But, this automation is the next update we're releasing as our team is working on it now. With that said, I don't believe that's the real question you were trying to ask here. My guess is that you're trying to ask if we hold people's money hostage, like Bitclout. So to answer that, no, we do not. So far, we've had multiple sales where people redeemed their tokens (selling back to us), where we purchase back the tokens, and then re-list them back up for sale for other investors. On top of this, people have also requested to withdraw their rental income, and we've also done that for them as well.

**LLC Ownership - Okay so, the common defense I've seen is that a new LLC is created for each property and the token holders are listed as members of the LLC. Is there documentation somewhere that shows this ownership? What if I buy 51% of the tokens? Can I move it to new management and screw everyone else?**


I'm not quite sure by this specific question, especially the part where you mention the ""common defense…"" portion. Yes, each property is held by a single LLC that's named after the property in question. That LLC does not engage in any other business other than holding and operating the underlying property. With that said, it's not really a defense mechanism for trying to dodge regulations if that's what you meant. It's set up this way, because most title companies and local governments, don't allow 300 people to all be on the same title and sign for it etc. As a result, an LLC is a better way to structure this. On top of this, it provides liability protection for the property investors. This is because if your own name was on the title, then technically, if someone slipped on your property or something, they could sue you personally, which means your person assets would be liable. That's obviously not a great deal for you, so typically people purchase investment properties using LLCs, because this way, the most they could be liable to loose is the assets held by the LLC, but not their own personal assets that weren't held by the LLC.

As for the ownership aspect of buying up 51% of the tokens and then screwing over the other investors, it's not possible, because we limit how much each individual or entity can purchase. Our goal is to open up real estate investing for the little guys and letting a single person buy the majority of the property is pretty counter to that. On top of that, most governing decisions, such as firing us as the default LLC manager require a ""super majority"", not a ""simple majority"". But yes, technically speaking, if a ""super majority"" of investors wanted to fire us as the manager of the LLC, they could and the LLC operating agreement allows them to do that legally. All documents related to the properties and the LLCs are disclosed not only to existing investors, but to the entire public. There are urls in the metadata of each token that links to documents associated with that respective property and LLC. An example of this is https://asset.lofty.ai/LFTY0002.

So I hope these answers help clear up the questions you had. I will also add that we're not super active on Reddit at the moment. We don't have an official company sub-reddit for example. As such, you may see unanswered questions on there. That's not us trying to avoid answering them, but more so that we don't have the time right now to monitor Reddit threads super closely. People may post about us in the unofficial Lofty subreddit, the official and unofficial Algorand subreddit, as well as a number of other ones. As a result, I would encourage you to join our official Telegram group that's open to the public, which we monitor a lot more closely and have the ability to pin posts and past answers. This is especially useful as many of the questions on Reddit have already been answered at one point or another, either on Reddit itself or in our other groups. You can also ping us on the online chat service we have on our website. Reading our FAQs would also help clear up a lot of things and we are constantly getting feedback from token buyers on adding new answers to FAQs to make things more clear for investors.

Best,

Currently renting an apartment for $1800/mo plus pet fees, garage fees, and utilities. Our renewal is coming up and I’m expecting them to come back with a rent increase to $2400/mo. This is option 1.

Option 2 would be to move out and find another apartment for ~$1800/mo, but we’re going to sacrifice location, amenities, and/or safety.

Option 3 would be to move out and rent a townhouse, condo, or single family home for ~$3000/mo plus utilities. Rentals in our area start ~$2500 and go up to ~$3500, with a few outliers. Obviously, you get what you pay for, so we’re looking around the middle-ground.

Option 4 would be to buy something soon. We’ve been approved for up to $545,000, which could get us a /decent/ single family home in our area. We can only put down around 3% at the moment, which isn’t ideal. We’d like to put 5% down and finance through Navy Federal to avoid PMI, but we just don’t have the liquid capital yet. Google’s mortgage calculator says we’d be looking at ~$3400/mo with taxes, insurance, PMI, and HOA fees. There are a couple of fixer-uppers in the $425k-$500k range, which may also be Option 5.

The main issue is that my 2 roommates can only afford ~$700/mo, which would leave me with the remainder. Providing $2k/mo + utilities myself isn’t impossible, putting me at a ~30% DTI, but I’m not sure that it’s the right decision. I’d like to start building equity, but is it worth it to keep renting instead?

TIA

Edit:
I should clarify that I’m in a long term relationship with one of my roommates, so I’m expecting them to be around indefinitely.

Also, even if I had to take on $3400/mo, it would still be an acceptable DTI, but it would be tricky.",finance
personalfinance,"Expecting a child, need help planning towards Financial Independence","posted in a different sub megathread but didn't get any response so I thought copy and paste it here:

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for some advice in the right direction, there are some life changing events coming up so I want to assess my financial situations.

**Intro:** I'm 33M my soon to be wife 36F are about to have a child together and it will be a huge change for us so we want to be prepared financially. We will be combining our 100% of our finance once we are officially married, right now I'm paying for mostly everything while her income I have her just keep in savings/emergency for now and we can budget for the child later once we have a feel for child expenses. So some of the budgeting numbers below are not 100% accurate until we combine our finance fully.

Using the template from another sub.

**-Age / Industry / Location:** Age is mentioned above, I'm a project manager wife is self employed in the beauty salon industry. I prefer not to specify my location but we are in HCOL.

**-General goals:** Our goal is to be able to reach some sort of CoastFIRE and work up from there to reach FIRE as soon as able. Now that we're expect a child, the goal stretched a bit further.

**-Target FIRE Age / Amount / Withdrawal Rate / Location:**

* Target FIRE age is 50 but sooner the better.
* The amount is where I'm still figuring out since now since we're expecting child but we are spending roughly 40k/yr on expenses and that number is doesn't include vacations/fun stuff yet due to covid. We can compromise on the vacation/fun stuff if need to but would like to at least travel or do something fun 1-2x a year to avoid burnout.

**-Educational background and plans**

* I 33M has BA degree and is currently looking into pursuing PMP by next year.
* She 36F has BA degree as well but left corporate world to be self employed doing what she enjoy which is the beauty industry. She has a few cert in beauty and is now getting some decent tracking in clientele. We'll see how things play out with the pandemic but it did hurt her due to the pandemic closure. 

**-Current and future income breakdown, including one-time events**

* I make 85k before bonus, my bonus is 20% which pushes my income close to 100k but given the pandemic it hasn't been guaranteed so I prefer to go by the 85k income to be conservative.
* I plan to stay with the company for as long as I could but recent changes in management is not making my job the same, I plan on getting my PMP while I am still employed there and start looking after.
* She makes 40k since switching industry but it should go up once the pandemic ease up but given that things are escalating we are expecting her to make the same 40k or less if she has to close down due to covid.

**-Budget breakdown**

* Mortgage/HOA/Utilities/Phone/Groceries - $3500 (this is the number we can get by comfortably, we can shave 500 off if we have to cut down on some luxury grocery items if need to)
* $500/mo towards our Roth IRA to max every year (we front load).
* $100/mo towards vacations
* $100/mo towards gifts (Birthdays/Xmas/Weddings etc), Extra rolls into our savings after it reaches 1k
* $300 into Brokerage account. Yes, I've maxed 401k/IRA)

**-Asset breakdown, including home, cars, etc.**

* House - 325k left to pay off. Interest rate is 3.1%
* 2x Honda, 1 Toyota, no car payment.
* Emergency Fund: 20k
* Savings: 15k (wife's income goes here for now, we will put this towards investments later)
* 401k - 118k currently on target to max out for this year, I've only taken this seriously in the past 3yrs so I feel like behind.
* ROTH IRA - 16k (already max for 2021)
* Brokerage - 7k (any extra money aside from emergency fund goes here for 5-10yr growth)
* HSA - 4k
* Crypto - 5k

**-Debt breakdown**

* No debt other than house, 325k
* Credit cards are used to pay utilties/groceries etc (included in the budget breakdown) which we pay off fully every month.

**-Health concerns**

* I'm borderline prediabetic / high cholesterol but doctor said I don't need medication yet just keep staying active, which I am working towards. I've lost almost 20lbs now so I think if I can keep up I should be OK brining those numbers down.
* Expecting a baby soon so this will be hard to say... but no other major concern at the moment.
* Having a child on the way I am planning to look into buying term life insurance for 25-30yrs. If rates looks good. Holding out until next year to get my cholesterol levels back to normal first. 

**-Family: current situation / future plans / special needs / elderly parents**

* My elderly parents are retired and live with us. Easier for me to care for them. This is also why our expense is on the higher side...
* My brother live with us and is no burden he actually helps with the bills. When he moves out (soon, after the baby) the wife will replace his portion. But for now her income is our savings/splurge/emergency money.
* No intention to push any of my family members out as we are very close and I wouldn't mind taking care of them even if they don't contribute to rent/bills.

**-Questions**

* For parents out there how much more do you budget with a child? 
* Do you think reaching CoastFIRE is possible at 50 given the current finance? or is that too unrealistic?
* Do you think I should put more money towards my house and pay it off sooner? I am leaning towards putting it in index funds on my brokerage account since my mortgage interest is only 3.1%. I like the idea of having a paid off house but the math doesn't check out if the market can return more.
* I am expecting a child, what's the best way to set her up for the future (college, etc). I looked into 529 but seems restrictive, brokerage account would have to pay taxes but at least it's more flexible. Any other ideas that is more efficient? I want to start putting money aside for her but don't want her to access the money too soon as I'm afraid she might blow it. Hopefully I can teach her about money early and don't follow my footsteps. 
* We want to upgrade to SUV, it would make life easier with a baby and safer for the wife to drive (she's short, SUV high clearance helps) But I'm hesitant on the idea of spending money on one, even if used... what do you guys think? should I? or suck it up and drive the sedan to save money ?",finance

personalfinance,Housing Loan Approval Help,"I'm trying to get approved for a conventional housing loan (\~550K) with a 20-40% downpayment depending on the house we buy since interest rates are so low.

I make \~350K a year, my wife makes 100K. We have no debt. Our credit scores are both above 760.We've never been late on rent or credit card payments.

We were just denied approval for a loan because I can't show three lines of a credit - I've only ever had one credit card (for the last 13 years) and I've never had any loans. This was intentional because I hate debt and my credit score was ""good enough"" at 770ish so I didn't see a reason to open more credit cards. My wife's had a few different credit cards so her credit report is fine.

The lending agent I was working with recommended I provide three non-traditional sources of credit history to supplement - I used my rent (\~$5K monthly), utility bill (\~$150 monthly), and comcast bill (\~$100 monthly).

I autopay all of my bills except Comcast because anyone who's ever dealt with Comast knows you just don't do that. I've had a couple late payments with them in the last few months by a few days since I do it manually - basically forget to do it (my fault), they send a reminder email, I pay, no problem. These late payments are what's disqualifying us from getting a loan (according to the lending agent).

My question: Is there really no work around here? The lending agent is saying I'd have to go with an FHA loan and that I could never be approved for a conventional loan because I can't show three ""good"" lines of credit over the last 12 months. I guess I'm just shocked given everything else is pretty darn good and our debt/income ratio feels ridiculously low.",finance
stocks,The Coming Crisis.,"**TL;DR at bottom.**

Here's your obligatory bear post for the day/week/whatever.

I'm not an expert but I do have some qualifications that lead me to believe that the global economy is in for some trouble.  I could be wrong, of course, and actually my entire theory is predicated on that fact.  Still, I feel I am sure enough in my convictions to the point where this statement is worth making.  You may disagree with the worthiness of this post, and of course, the premise behind it.  That's fine;  I'm just here to share the way I see things.

What's certain is that, even if one may see the warning signs of a looming crisis, it's near impossible to tell when that crisis might be.  I have no idea.  All I know is I see some precariousness and warning signs right now.  So, without further ado:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Uncertain Nature of the World**

The world is uncertain.  Black swan events happen, and they happen frequently.  Again, some people may have some inkling of them, but it's hard if not impossible to predict these things with any degree of certainty.  Some examples that come to mind (please excuse the lack of chronological ordering): the Covid-19 pandemic, September 11th, the Global Financial Crisis, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Columbus discovering America, the Challenger/Colombia space shuttle disasters, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to WW1, the Great Depression, the Black Death, the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada, the Wehrmacht crossing the Ardennes, the smart phone / internet revolution, etc.  The last one is interesting if you ever saw *Back to the Future: Pt. 2.*  The most they predicted were flying cars, but not smart phones or internet.

But I digress.  These events are part and parcel of life, and the major events of history do not happen in a linear fashion.  Sure, we may be able to connect the dots after the fact, but when they happen it's almost unbelievable: we seem to be taken utterly by surprise.  Just think: apart from Bill Gates or someone like that, which one of us normal folk thought we'd be dealing with a pandemic this time 2 years ago?  I certainly didn't imagine it.

And it happens in our personal lives too.  You meet someone.  You have a break up.  You get injured.  You get sick.  You lose a loved one.  You fall in love.  Who knows?  Life is very, very unpredictable.

Don't get me wrong; that doesn't mean I don't think we should try.  Science helps. We can form hypotheses and test them.  This adds a lot of certainty to a world that is very uncertain.  But even Einstein would admit that some things are simply out of our grasp:

""What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.""

**The Folly of Economics**

I studied economics.  I was very interested in Econ 101 and decided to make that my major.  Later, however, I was disappointed in what I learned.  I don't know.  There was just too much mathematical formulating and analysis.  I didn't feel, really, that I had learned much of anything that was actually relevant and applicable to the real world.  To be honest, at the time I just thought I was an idiot and bad at math, blaming myself rather than the field (as a young, lost kid might be prone to do).  Looking back, however, I think there were serious shortcomings that I had picked up on but did not have the tools to express.

I'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of analysis in the study of economics: I imagine there is.  I just don't think that it should be the singular focus of the whole field.  Indeed, while mathematical equations are imperative for pure math and even for practical applications like physics and chemistry, can they really be applied with the same rigorous veracity to the study of something so complex and changeable as the economy?

Former economic advisor at the Bank of International Settlements William White argues that instead of looking at the economy through equations and equilibria, we should be viewing the economy as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#:~:text=A%20complex%20adaptive%20system%20is,the%20behavior%20of%20the%20components.&amp;text=The%20Complex%20Adaptive%20Systems%20approach%20builds%20on%20replicator%20dynamics).  You know, like a garden.  You have an idea in mind of what you want to plant and where, but some plants die, some don't, weeds pop up, there might be an infestation.  The whole thing is quite unpredictable because it depends on an enormous amount of variables interacting with each other.  Well, that's a lot like the economy.  (Read more here: [Recognizing the Economy as a Complex, Adaptive System: Implications for Central Banks](https://williamwhite.ca/2018/04/22/recognizing-the-economy-as-a-complex-adaptive-system-implications-for-central-banks/))

&amp;#x200B;

**The Folly of Modern Central Banking**

The folly here follows naturally from the aforementioned ontological error in the field of economics: we think the economy is predictable and controlable.  Cut interest rates here, buy assets there, and we're good to go.  If only it were that simple.

Look at the data we're looking at right now.  Despite absolutely unprecedented amounts of liquidity being pumped by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world), we're still unable to get people back to work.  Check out the [ADP numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/private-companies-added-330000-jobs-in-july-according-to-adp-far-short-of-the-653000-estimate.html) today: 653,000 new positions were expected in July, but the actual result was a miss by just over half (330,000).  If you've been paying attention to the data in past months as well, you've noticed consistent misses in employment.  And how about inflation?  YoY inflation hikes are expected due to base effects from the pandemic last year, but MoM inflation has been coming in consistently higher than expected.  All of this makes you wonder: does the Fed really have things under control?  *Could* they have things under control?

I would argue that you can't solve structural employment issues by throwing liquidity at the markets.  The problem is not liquidity, there's plenty of it: the problem is structural mismatches, as well as other factors like people preferring to take extended unemployment rather than working.  You can't fix that with more liquidity.  One of the most respected modern economists, Paul Krugman, would probably say ""well, it can't hurt"".  And according to their models, it can't.  Unfortunately economists and central bankers seem to do be doing their absolute best to turn a blind eye to obvious asset bubbles.  SPX is up nearly 48% since pandemic lows less than 18 months ago, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 58% in the same period. Meanwhile the real economy has been absolutely hammered.  The [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is at 38.25 at time of writing - a level unseen since prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  It is clear that there is a severe disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices due to excessive liquidity in the system.

If the Fed manages a controlled walk down of interest rates, and earnings continue to grow into current valuations, then no problem, right?  Right.  It's possible.  But that would be hoping for the best.  William White argues that it's more rational to prepare for the worst rather than naively hoping for the best.  A long series of things would have to go according to plan for this bubble to be ""defused"", and any number of unforeseen events could arise in order to knock the whole plan off track.  Some examples come to mind (and these are just the ones that we can fathom... the whole point is that there are more that we probably can't): Delta variant or other Covid-related scares, geopolitical tensions with China/USA/Taiwan, inflation running hotter than expected, etc.

And speaking of inflation, why in the world is the Federal Reserve so confident that inflation is transitory?  As I mentioned above, YoY and MoM inflation expectations have come in consistently higher than expectations over the course of the last few months, oftentimes to the tune of 70-80%.  If whoever is making these predictions is getting it so wrong in regards to the numbers, who's to say that they aren't getting it wrong in regards to it being transitory?

Look, it very well may be: the supply chain disruption argument is a valid and strong one.  But nobody has a crystal ball. The Fed is not an all-seeing eye where they can simply predict exactly what is going to happen.  One might hope that the Fed would be more prudent and humble in their analysis of the situation.

And certainly the Fed has a long history of getting things wrong.  In early 2007 Ben Bernanke famously declared that subprime was ""contained"".  Just a few months later, when the crisis did begin to arise, Jim Cramer called out Bernanke for ""being an academic"" and for being out of touch with the situation on the ground.  Look, I don't really like Cramer, but I do believe he was in the right at this particular moment.  This sub won't allow me to link it here, but I recommend looking up ""Cramer tells Bernanke to wake up"" on YouTube.  It's worth a watch.

Let's not forget either that even before these two events the Fed absolutely failed to anticipate the crisis in the first place.  Later they would say that such a crisis was unpredictable, and totally based on panic.  But they forget the fact that people like Dr. Michael Burry, of Big Short book and film fame, did see it coming.  All of the people in that book saw it coming.  Even [William White saw it coming, and warned Alan Greenspan of it at Jackson Hole in 2003.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html) The Fed, however, did not see it coming.  Bernanke would also claim that the crisis was nothing more than old-fashioned financial panic, and that if not for the panic it would have been the equivalent of merely ""a bad day in the stock market"".  This is a convenient view for him to take, as it alleviates him of all responsibility for completely bungling the situation.  Even [Paul Krugman challenges Bernanke's assertion that it was all related to financial panic and not at all tied to fundamentals in the housing market](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paul+Krugman+Great+recession+bernanke&amp;oq=paul+krugman+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l3j35i39j69i60l3.2811j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

Of course, Bernanke and those around him would hold on to their view that nobody could have seen the crisis coming, and go on to congratulate themselves for rescuing the country and the world from a crisis that they themselves had failed to prevent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where We Are Today**

And that brings us to where we are today, with massive monetary stimulus coming from the Fed and all major central banks as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  The response to 2008 was seen, rightfully in many ways, as a success.  By injecting liquidity into markets when they needed it most, the Fed and other central banks were able to stave off the next Great Depression.  Unfortunately, however, apart from their failure to prevent the crisis in the first place, central banks have also failed to take into account the limitations of their policies.  Not only have their policies become less effective, but they've also opened the door for a dangerous array of unintended consequences (William White talks about both issues [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).  William White also says that, contrary to what the Fed seems to believe, monetary policy ""is no free lunch"".

Recovery since 2008 has been asymmetric: we seem to be trying to fix deep, structural problems via simple injections of liquidity. Meanwhile, [inequality grows](https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s), the poor get poorer, and political and social unrest continue to grow as a result.  It's a dangerous path to go down, and rather than try to explain it myself, I would recommend reading the White paper I linked above.  One clear and present danger I see today, which White mentioned in the paper, is the presence of serial bubbles: the dot-com bubble led to the housing bubble, and the housing bubble has led to the current stock market bubble, only to be aggravated by the Covid crisis and the Fed's response to it (ironically causing a new bubble in the housing market as well).  If something unforeseen were to happen, these bubbles could pop, causing lasting damage to Main Street.

Another issue I see now is that, if we were to have another crisis, what more could be done?  How much higher can the Fed expand their balance sheet?  How much more deficit spending can the federal government engage in?  I believe that we are dangerously close to exhausting our policy options.

If everything goes according to plan, it's possible that everything works out just fine.  The issue, however, may be in assuming that everything will go according to plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**What To Do as an Investor**

I'm not an expert at this, but I would not tell anyone to go cash right now.  I would say, however, that it may be wise to hold a larger cash percentage than you're normally accustomed to.  If you normally hold 5% in your portfolio, for example, then maybe you'd consider holding 10-15%.  This will provide for buying opportunities in the event that we do have a major correction, and it will also help to preserve capital.  That said, full cash does not seem to be the way to go.  If you're waiting for a crash, you may be waiting forever.

What I would recommend, and this seems pertinent to a lot of what I see on this subreddit, is diversification.  I see people with dangerous allocations into overvalued tech stocks (""buy Microsoft at any valuation""), holding 3-4 tech stocks as their whole portfolio, a 2-fund portfolio with levered funds UPRO and TQQQ, etc.  I see people holding large allocations of ARK funds and other ""disruptive"" tech with unproven track records.  I see people recommending lump sums right now, because, ""on average"", they do better.

If it were me, I would diversify and play it more conservatively.  VOO would be infinitely better than UPRO, for example.  A diversified portfolio of blue-chips which very well may (and should) include stocks like Microsoft would be infinitely better than *only* holding Microsoft.  Patient dollar cost averaging would probably be wiser than dumping one's life savings into an S+P 500 index fund at the moment.

I would also encourage people to look at fundamentals.  One should never, IMO, feel the urge to pay for a stock at 30, 35, or 50+ times earnings just because of ""future growth potential"".  It's a gamble.

In the end, all of these strategies that I am opposed to may end up working out and may even end up doing better than my conservative approach.  The problem, however, is what happens if they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR, Summary, and Final Thoughts**

As humans we seem to have a problem with humility.  In some ways I think it's painful for us to accept our limitations and fragility.  Thus, it's easier for us to pretend that the world is predictable, orderly, and within our control.  This fallacy has made it's way into the field of economics and by extension into central banks and the Federal Reserve.  Current policies, encouraged by the ""success"" of 2008, operate under the fallacy that the economy is orderly and able to be controlled with surgical precision, rather than accepting the unpredictability of the economy as a complex adaptive system and taking measures to be prepared for black swan events which will inevitably occur.

As a society and as investors, we can certainly hope for the best, and sometimes the best does manifest itself, and in those cases such optimism does tend to lead to better outcomes for those who profess it.  However, perhaps a more prudent, realistic approach would be to prepare for the worst, or at the very least recognize our limitations and put measures in place in order to mitigate the damage which can be caused by unforeseen disruptive events.

personalfinance,"Struggling college student w debt, thinking about utilizing 401k funds - would appreciate advice!","Hi all, just humbling reaching out for advice here.

I am 24, and about a year out from finishing my bachelors. I have been working for my current company for 2.5 years and investing into my 401k with my employer for that time. Just as I started my adult life, I was forced into some unfortunate circumstances that left me with a lot of credit card and medical debt. I have been slowly and painfully chipping away at it, but without the possibility of extra income I have been struggling to manage it. For my personal situation, I am considering using a portion of my 401k balance to pay off the high interest credit cards.

This past year, I have moved back in with my dad, and it is the first year I have been able to start saving. My current financial situation looks like this:

Monthly income: $2000
Expenses (including car payment and credit cards): $1400
401k balance is at $8,000
Credit card debt: $9000
Medical debt: $2200 (sent to collections, not worried about paying this urgently)

I am desperately trying to take care of the credit card debt, first and foremost. Each card has an interest rate hovering around 18-24% APR. I would like to withdrawal $5200 from my 401k to put wholly towards the credit card balance, and I can still focus on accumulate cash for my savings. I am in a low tax bracket (12%) and have calculated the total cost of the withdrawal to be around $1100. Do these calculations sound correct?

Looking at the bigger picture for me, I feel that I am young and still have a considerable amount of time left in my journey to retirement that I would be able to max out contributions at another point in life once I am financially stable to recoup some of the losses of this withdrawal. I find that the taxes and fees would be comparable to what I am paying in interest every month. It also gives me a mental break from worrying about my inability to get back to a place of good financial health.

Would anyone be able to talk this out with me? Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Cash out of 401k at 51 years with 38% tax+ penalty to buy a home?,"This post is about my dad. he left his job last year and started at another place in a different state with a new 401k plan. He wanted to take the 10% penalty and the 22% federal tax and a 6% state tax to use as a down payment which will be almost 60% for the new home. He wants to pay off 60% of the house because he cant afford a high monthly payment as he moved from a high paying job ( hence the high 401k amount) to a low paying low stress job.

Is it a good idea to take the 10%+22%+6%=38% loss of 401k to pay 60% down payment on a house in the new state he wants to retire in or just pay 10% down payment and try to pay the high monthly  mortgage. He mainly wants to have a low monthly budget as the new job has lower pay.



He has other sources of income in retirement and the 401k is not his only retirement option. His current home (fully paid off) is going to be a rental property. Him and my mom will get a social security check equal to how much they use for daily life already. He will also receive a pension at his new job when he retires. SO the 401k is not the only nest egg but it is pretty big.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr should my dad at age 51 take a 38% loss on his 401k to pay 60% down payment for a new home in a new state for a low monthly mortgage.

Edit: thank you so much for the people that have commented that have talked about how the tax would be higher since the extra money would bump my dad up a tax bracket causing him to lose more money. I will try to convince my dad that this is a bad idea. Many thanks for all the helpful people.",finance

personalfinance,"Husband has an excellent credit score (760s), but is having a hard time getting approved for a credit card. We are trying to figure out why.","Hi there /r/personalfinance, 

We have a riddle on our hands, and I'm hoping someone can help us solve it. 

We are looking to get a new credit card for my husband (we are looking to get new computers as anniversary presents to each other, and since his starter credit card has a high interest rate and the benefits aren't great, we were going to take advantage of the opportunity to get a better card with 0% for a year). We thought it would be easy to do since we both have really good credit, but the first credit card he applied for only gave him an $1800 limit and the maximum interest rate, and other credit cards wouldn't approve him at all.

We just checked his credit score again and there was nothing weird on it. In fact, it was even higher than we expected. 

Some factors that might be playing a role (I will admit that I don't have full knowledge of everything that goes into the credit score):

1) Salary is ~45k. I don't think this should be a factor though, as I got approved for a higher limit when I was at the same salary.
2) A few years ago, his budget was a bit tight and his credit card got shut off a couple of times. It hasn't been a full seven years since the last occurrence, but it has been a few (probably 2-3).
3) He is paying his truck loan off ahead of schedule (as with salary, I don't think this is a factor, but it might be).
4) My salary is ~73k, and I've literally only ever been a day late on a credit card payment, so my credit should not be affecting him.
5) [additional insight after comments] He currently is completely paid up on his credit card. His limit was increased from 5k to 13k when we got married on the first card about 2 years ago. Loan is down to ~8k on the truck loan.

What factors am I overlooking? Is it the fact that he's had shutoffs in the past? What can we do to fix this?

Any advice would be appreciated!

Those words opened a door in my mind to a room I never fully realized I was locked inside of. It had never really occurred to me that I had created limitations for myself that I was worth no more than to spend the rest of my life working in a factory. I had been convinced my life was worth $0.0736 a minute and nothing more. Keeping in mind, that's before taxes, wage garnishment for an old credit card debt and child support. I'm making much less now after changing jobs. My old job paid better but was 12hr shifts and flipped from days to nights every 28 days. It was awful and left no time with my family. If it weren't for government assistance we wouldn't be able to survive on my income alone. Every year groceries cost more. Gas goes up. Everything seems to go up little by little. Our state has a plan to raise minimum wage to $15 over the next five years. That's great but it doesn't do me any good because the cost of everything will go up right along with it. The companies will scramble the numbers in the paperwork so the federal committees and appointed financial advisors will say things are much better but they aren't here on the ground. They don't see that nothing will actually change for me and for so many of us. But I don't care anymore.

I found my way out. Cryptocurrency investing has saved me and my family many times. There was an eight month stretch recently where I wasn't working because of a maternity leave and then, during maternity leave I broke my arm. My SO had to take care of our newborn almost singlehandedly and nurse me as well. She was a godsend. The only way we got by was selling off my holdings. The newly implemented restrictions on my 401k because of covid-19 prevented me from extracting my retirement fund. We were very lucky I had investments of my own that I was able to liquidate.

It seems to me that every system in place to help me is actually covertly designed to work against me and extract value from me instead of protecting it for me. I will never trust the ""trust"" system again. Everywhere I look it's corrupted, the banksters are all lying crooks, the hedge funds manipulate the market while the SEC looks the other way, the government just prints of whatever money they need and people like me get stuck with the bill for all of it. Billionaires are paying 3% in taxes if at all and I'm paying 19%. The price of everything keeps going up and the value of the dollar keeps going down. I refuse to be the victim of a broken system any longer. I will make $10 billion dollars in crypto or die trying because the alternative is spending the next 40 years in a factory until my body is too weak to work and I spend my dying days in a State funded nursing home because the social security I paid into my whole life is gone and corrupt corporations stole my 401k. If I'm gonna be poor it will be at my own hand, not because I trusted a government that lies to my face and steals money from my pockets to give to greedy billionaires. Fuck your bank note.

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

28. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

personalfinance,Withdrawing a portion of an old 401k - wanting to move those funds into my new account soon-ish as well.,"I'm terrible with these things so that's why I'm here.

Brief background - I recently rediscovered a very old 401k set up at a job I had many years ago that I just fully neglected so it's been accruing this entire time. I decided I want to withdraw a portion of it (almost 25% - it isn't a massive account) to deal with a few immediate expenses and invest some of it elsewhere. I'm aware that there are certain penalties both on the federal and state level by default for making an early withdrawal (for those below 59 1/2 years old or so I read).

Forex,#EURUSD,"**#EURUSD Is Possibly Bearish**

**#Technical analysis**

The EMA(100) is higher than the EMA (50), which is beneficial for bears

The RSI is below 50

The MACD line is below 0 and shows a possible uptrend.

**#What the possible outcomes are**

Yesterday the Fed’s official gave a hint about the interest rate hike in 2023. That led to the U.S. dollar strengthening. Thus, the EURUSD pair declined to 1.18360.

In our most likely scenario, EURUSD may experience a downward correction towards the first support level of 1.18170.

If the price passes the first support level, we can expect a continued downtrend towards the second support level of 1.17872.

Conversely, it’s possible to see the pair rise towards the first resistance level of 1.18919.

If the pair surpasses the first resistance level, we should expect a continued surge towards the second resistance level of 1.19231.

**#Key levels**

**Support 1.18170 1.17872**

**Resistance 1.18919 1.19231**

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or car first?,"**Hi everyone**,

I'm trying to figure out what's best to do with my money. Since student loans payments have been paused due to covid and some talk of possible loan forgiveness, I've been keeping my student loan payments into a separate bank account until I'm required to start paying again. As of now that will be November. I know that I can't rely on student forgiveness, and I'm not. My original plan was to make a $12,000 payment to pay off a good portion of the unsubsidized student loans with higher interest rates in October, with the money I've been saving for it.

**My debt:**  


* Student Loans - $52,000 (unsubsidized, and subsidized) - 3.5% - 6.5% interest
* Car -$18,000 - 3.5% interest - 5 year term
* Credit Card 1 - $1300 - 0% interest rate. Making minimum payment, will be paid off when promo period ends.
* Credit Card 2 - $4000 - 0% interest rate. Making minimum payment, will be paid off when promo period ends.

Now the credit cards I'm not worried about, because I'm not accruing interest on them. I believe that since I'll be accruing more interest over the life of the student loan, that I should put the whole payment towards that. Is there any other reason that I should choose to put the money towards the car? Just looking for others opinions to see if I'm thinking correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,HR Block has trolled me hard,"First time poster. This /r came as a suggestion from a friend who hangs out here a lot and suggested I share what's been going on.  
   
The Situation: I don't make a ton of money, especially when I was living in Denver and getting murdered with rent and taxes. Point being, I've used HR Block free software to file my taxes since I qualified and they allowed multiple states without having to pay extra. Therein lies the problem; they don't charge you to file in multiple states but their free software doesn't handle multiple state situation well.  


Between 2017 and this year I moved between Wisconsin, Colorado and Montana being a part year resident of each state all but 1 year. I noticed on the software it was taking my money from both states, and adding them together as my total income in whatever the 2nd state I chose to fill out was. Between CO and MT it just caused me to pay in $12 to MT. Instead of fighting it, I just paid the $12. Whatever.  


This time around, I noticed the software doing the same thing even though I only earned $5k in WI (moved November 8th so very close to the end of the year). I talked to our Director of Finance at my new job for some advice and she pulled up the document from the state of WI that I would need to fill out deduct my CO wages which were significantly more. I dug through the software, with all its prompts and questions and finally was able to deduct my CO earnings from the grand total and CO, Fed and WI seemed to even out. All ending up as positive returns, the largest of which being a whopping $300. I'll take what I can get at this point.  


I tried talking to HR Block before, and they were demanding $70 to even discuss the situation with me. After ""fixing"" it (or so I thought) I gave up trying to talk to HR Block. That is until CO sent me a letter in the mail saying I owed them $300 from 2018 from the software filling things out (apparently still my fault as I'm the user even though it's guided software for a complicated subject) saying $188 or something was ""double taxed"" in MT and CO. They demanded a $30 inconvenience fee for me making this mistake, the $ amount that wasn't in fact double taxed and interest which I can only assume had been accumulating for the past 3 years.  


Another letter came in the mail from the Feds saying the taxes were wrong and I owed them $500, At this point I called the HR Block office asking for someone in person to look at this and help me. She confirmed I owed the fed. HR Block lady told me that it was due to the fact that I changed jobs my new job didn't withhold enough tax for me or something. Confusing. She also told me the time and money it would take to fix anything having to do with this but especially the 2018 CO thing, would be more trouble and money than I would actually get back. She told me to pay both. I did.  


Then I get a letter from WI saying I owe $2,500. WHAT PLANET AM I ON? She did inform me that they would probably be contacting me because although the HR Block software correctly selected me as a part year resident of CO, but put me down as a full year resident of WI even though I moved a month before the end of the year. What a crappy time to move and get screwed with taxes over and over. Anyway, she told me to come back and see her and she'd fill out the proper part year resident thing for WI for free and we'd get it taken care of. So I went back and we filled it out with her asking me questions and taking info from my W2s etc.   


What she didn't tell me is that it would cost $199 to file this ""amended"" form. She informed me I would be getting $89 back from WI. Well, the cost to submit this document is more than 2x what I would be getting back. She printed out a blank copy of the part year resident form and said I could fill it out myself and submit it and said good luck. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed, especially as I just purchased a home so money has become a pretty tight.  


I have been trolled over and again by this. Further financial stress has been my insurance company from my last job not covering a $2,200 dental bill when they said originally they would cover more than half of it (I even had the high option, federal govt. dental plan) then my health insurance premium (which I never used in 3 years to make matters worse) ""wasn't deducted from your paycheck because you were in a non-pay status"" when I was leaving my previous job and starting my new job.   


I also got nailed with the $500 trump tax thing where he allowed social security money not taken from your paychecks automatically as some stupid pathetic effort at some ""covid relief"". As a federal employee I don't even recall getting the option to opt out of it, and to make matters worse I don't recall my paychecks looking any bigger really. An unwelcome surprise bill after the 1st of the year. End rant, sorry.  


tl;dr HR Block's free software sucks for multiple states and tries to make you feel better with ""accuracy guarantees"" and ""maximum refund guarantees"" as long as you're not a bottom feeder who qualifies for their free file and you're willing to pay them lots of $ for such guarantees. Looking for some advice.",finance

Do you all think it’s worth it to do so? Refinancing (from 3.5% to 2.75%) and removing the pmi would save $250 a month in payments, and with the car loan added it goes down to saving $195 a month. In the life of the loan I would be saving money, but in turn would actually be paying more for the life of the car loan because the remainder will be spread out in 30 years.

stocks,Biden to push for 50% electric vehicles by 2030,"President Biden is set to announce his aim for 50% electric vehicles by 2030. Yahoo Finance’s Rick Newman shares the details.

### Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: The Biden administration is setting ambitious targets to reduce the country's carbon footprint, calling for electric vehicles to make up half of all new US car sales by the end of this decade. Some climate activists, though, saying the goal doesn't address the urgency of the crisis. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman, who is following this story for us.

And Rick, you know, we're talking about 50% by the end of the decade. And yet, today, EVs only make up about 3% of new car sales. So how realistic is this?

RICK NEWMAN: It depends on what the government does, honestly. If the industry were just left to itself, I don't think there's any way we would get to 50% of new vehicle market share by 2030. The cars are still more expensive than gas-powered cars. There's still range issues. But the Biden administration plans to do a lot to incentivize people to buy these vehicles.

So there's going to be billions of dollars for new charging stations. So there will be charging stations, in theory, wherever you might need one. That's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that's now in Congress. Biden wants about $170 billion in addition to that. He wants new subsidies for anybody buying an electric vehicle, electrify school buses. He wants subsidies for building battery plants in the United States and all this kind of stuff.

So this-- these are the reasons that the auto industry really seems quite happy to go along with this. Because they're going to-- they think they're going to get so much funding from the federal government to help them reach this target. By the way, we should point out to everybody watching, this is a target not a requirement. There's no penalty for any automaker that does not get to 50% of all new vehicle sales being electric by 2030. That's just the goal.

AKIKO FUJITA: And Rick, you've also got some additional measures here laid out in that plan, including limits on tailpipe emissions. I mean, walk me through how significant of a bump that is. Because we all - there were standards set under the Obama administration. The Trump administration rolled that back. Where do things stand now?

RICK NEWMAN: We don't know exactly. Because Biden has not yet said what he plans to do on that. I mean, just the very briefest history here, Obama, in 2012, raised fuel efficiency standards really aggressively. That would have required about a 5% improvement in fuel economy every year. And then Trump came in, and he slashed that down to about a 1.5% improvement in fuel economy every year.

Now the reporting is that Biden is going to split the difference basically. He's going to raise fuel economy standards above where Trump left them to what would amount to about 3.7% increase in fuel economy every year. But that- they have not announced that yet. And that takes a long time. That is the-- that's changing a federal regulation, which has to go through months and months of review and things like that.

And I think one of the things we're probably going to hear the Biden administration say, well, yeah, his guideline for fuel economy is not as aggressive as Obama's was back in 2012. But if we have all these new electric vehicles on the road, that is something that we didn't have really back in 2012. So that should make it easier to reach the 3.7% annual increase, or whatever it turns out to be. But that is down the road still.

AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Rick Newman, staying on top of the details. Of course, you can read his story on YahooFinance.com as well. Thanks so much for that, Rick.",finance

personalfinance,Setting up a loan agreement with family,"Hi all,

I have plans to lend money to an immediate family member in the US for help through their last two years of university for an amount up to $25k. Their savings have run dry and they will continue to be working part-time so we will be supplementing expenses their income can't cover.   However, we don't feel comfortable sending a lump sum payment estimated between $20-$25k and will instead send over a monthly amount based on an established budget, their income (varies based on internship or working on campus), and a small emergency fund. This way, they will learn better budgeting practices and we can manage the transfer amounts as part of our monthly budget. Please don't suggest a student loan, private or public, as they aren't able to qualify without a cosigner as a nonresident with no assets and decent credit. We do not want to cosign a loan as this family member has been forgetful about on time payments in the past and we don't want to potentially jeopardize our credit. 

For tax purposes, I've read about the IRS rules requiring a minimum applicable federal rate. Most templates I've seen online for this type of agreement between family members is meant for a loan that starts off with a lump sum.

I have a question about refinancing. 

We bought our house in February of 2018 for 300k, I believe we had around a 4.5% interest rate on a 30 year loan.  In August of 2020 we refinanced to a 30 year loan with  a 3.250 interest rate.  When we refinanced, we had a ~276k balance, after the refinance it was ~285k.

Currently we owe ~282k and are considering refinancing for a second time.  This time we'd like to consider a 15 year loan with the rates being between 2-2.25%.

Am I making a mistake by refinancing a second time so quickly?",finance

I am currently a rising senior in college, studying Computer Science. I am currently interning at a software company, and if all goes well, can work there fulltime next year upon graduation. From what I heard, the salary for fulltime is 92k.

I am living with my parents, and have no debt. Due to existing health issues, I will be living with them for the next few years at home. I will be on their health insurance until I turn 26. I already am driving a   
 20yr reliable used car.

I started college early, so I am an year or so younger than my peers.

I have a little over 10k in savings, and 1.4k in emergency funds. 

Using a calculator, after federal + FICA + California state tax, I am left with about 66k.

I am thinking of putting 7k in bonds, 18k in stable investments (such as QQQ, S&amp;P 500, Apple, Amazon, etc.), and 5k in crypto trading. I could save somewhere around 20k, both in savings, 401k, and IRA/Roth IRA. Because I am an intern, I do not know my company's 401k policy/matchmaking yet.

The rest of the 16k I can use for spending, saving for a new car, and saving the rest.

The company I am interning at has a fairly relaxed workpolicy, so unless there is a major production deadline, the weekends are entirely free. I will be using that time for exercise, volunteering, and honing my software engineering skills in order to move onto other companies in the future (such as interview prep + passion projects).

personalfinance,Student aid &amp; debt,"I am happy to say I'm headed back to school! In my state, tuition is paid for, and I am eligible to receive financial aid. My grant is giving me $3000, and I'm eligible for loans.

My question is, would taking out a student loan to pay off my credit card debt be a good idea? I'm not swimming in debt, but I'm definitely not a payment or two away either.  My interest rates are nuts on the card, and I see my subsidized loan would cover most of the debt at around a 2% interest rate. I'd get the payment in 2 installments, and assuming I can save up some additional income over the course of this school year to put towards the card, I may not even need the full second installment.

personalfinance,Exiting mortgage forbearance,"I'll try and keep this short. My wife and I own a home with 25 years left on a 30y fixed at 3.375%

I own a business and it accounts for about 70% of our family income. Last summer as covid was settled in for the long haul my wife and I decided to enter into mortgage forbearance so that I could stop drawing a full salary if needed for the business. As several major clients closed we ended up needing to defer about 20k in escrow and principal payments. 

Our business is now back to normal and we are looking to exit forbearance. Our lender presents three choices:

Pay off the deferred amount (not possible)

Apply for a loan modification that would roll the unpaid escrow money into the loan, potentially lowering the rate, and running the loan back out to 30 years. (I am not sure how much of the deferment is escrow vs principal)

Utilize a FHA program that apparently freezes the deferred amount and puts a lean on the house to pay that back on sale or refinance. Apparently this is interest free? 

I'm looking for guidance since I have to apply for option 2 before an underwriter comes back with a modification offer. 

3 sounds like a home run, unless I'm missing something. It's also possible that future legislation could effect money in this program, where option 2 would probably be a permanent choice.


Side note, this home is intended to be our forever home, and I have no intention of selling at until at least retirement. (We are in our early 40s)

Edit: From the FHA:
Federal Housing Administration Mortgages
FHA does not require lump sum repayment at the end of the forbearance. FHA has developed the 
COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim to assist with repayment. If you were current or less than 30 
days delinquent as of March 1, 2020, you may be entitled to this option. A partial claim is a zero 
interest, no fee, junior lien on your property that will become payable when you sell your home, 
pay off your mortgage or your mortgage otherwise terminates. If you do not qualify for the 
COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim, FHA offers other tools to help you repay the missed payments 
over time. For more information on Federal Housing Administration Mortgages: visit www.hud.gov.",finance
personalfinance,Refi Question - 1.75% 15yr vs 2.99% 20yr w/ AMEX payoff,"Hello, I purchased my first home a little over 2 years ago and I’m looking to refinance to lower my interest rate and term length as well remove my PMI.  I also have a high interest credit card with a balance of around $20k that might be nice to get cash to pay off so I am debating between a couple of options but would like the opinions of our experts here if you could help a girl out, I’d appreciate it!

Purchase price: $266k

Current estimate: $330-340k

Current mortgage balance: $243,600

Mortgage payoff amount: $245,300

Current monthly payment: $1,866

That includes $199/m in PMI 

I pay an additional $189/m extra on principle and have for the life of the loan so I pay around $2,075 per month now



*Option 1*

Better.com

15 years @ 1.75% fixed

$248,686 loan amount

$2,029 / month payment

$0 origination fees

Purchase .5 point for $1200

Total loan costs: $2,136

Current cash to close is $2,208, but I’ve asked if they can roll that in too.

No AMEX payoff but a lower interest rate and in five years I will have paid $96,628 on my mortgage and of that $75,762 would have gone toward principle.  

Extra perks: waived appraisal &amp; a $2k AMEX statement credit as a promotion




*Option 2*

LoanDepot

20 years @ 2.99% fixed

$272,000 loan amount

$1,964 / month payment

$1,595 in origination fees

Waived $2,800 in point fees

Total loan costs: $3,748

Estimated closing costs financed: $8,059

Closing costs cash to me: $1,054

AMEX is paid off but over 5 years I will have paid $94,777 and of that only $53,605 will have gone towards principle 

Cons: high fees, the new loan is higher that my initial purchase price, higher interest rate, longer loan term, have to prep for an appraisal and if it doesn’t appraise I’ll have to take a lower loan for 80% LTV
Pros: higher interest loan consolidation, a little more flexibility with payments


I am torn between the two, I was initially excited with Better’s rates, but then thought it might be prudent to consolidate at the same time; I’m just not as excited about the LoanDepot offer...  


Has anyone had any similar experiences or have any recommendations on which path or lending company would be better to go with or things to consider?  Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!!

solar,Enphase battery quote evaluation,"I am working on selecting a company to install solar and a home battery at my home in the Bay Area. After doing some reading about inverters (SolarEdge and Enphase), I decided I want to go with Enphase microinverters on my solar array. As I understand it, using microinverters means the battery should be AC-connect (not DC-connect).

I really have 2 constraints when choosing the home battery:
1. Should be AC connect, not DC connect, due to microinverters
2. Should be installed outdoors (due to local code).


It seems a reasonable battery to use for this scenario is the Enphase Encharge 10. I know its energy storage (10 kwh) and its power (3.84 kw) are modest compared to some other solutions, but I analyzed the loads that I want to backup, and it seems that this will do the job. 

So, I have 3 quotes. All have approximately the same price for the solar and other wiring. But, they vary quite a bit on the cost of the Enphase Encharge 10 battery (including both the parts and labor to install).

Company 1:
- $12,900 for the battery
- terrible Yelp reviews - several folks say the install job was terrible, or worse

Company 2:
- $14,900 for the battery
- decent Yelp reviews

Company 3:
- $15,400 for the battery
- Stellar Yelp reviews

These prices are before the 26% federal tax credit.

How are these prices? Have others seen better pricing?",energy
Bitcoin,Listen to Me Extremely Carefully on The Second Portman Bill Amendment Banning DeFi,"&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may be tempted to go along with this last minute backstab by Portman and Warner where they completely remove protection for anyone in the space who is not a PoW miner or provider of software and hardware to secure private keys. 

You need to understand that the future of this industry is DeFi layer 2, whether that is on Bitcoin or something else. It is going to be a combination of layer 2 defi and lightning technology. There is a very clear ethos of censorship resistance for the most disenfranchised built into smart contract based systems, just as with bitcoin.

I struggle to make this argument to bitcoiners because of ignorance about how US law works. Ignorance specifically concerning the Patriot act, Facta, The banking secrecy act, Fatf,  SEC laws, and CFTC laws. Rest assured, they can and will carry these laws forward to use against any lightning application or DeFi product based on native bitcoin, any business operator or coder or facilitator of such technology, anywhere in the world, no matter citizenship can and will be federally prosecuted and extradited. If they find you they will extradite you. No one is safe.

This is a direct ban on DeFi. On smart contracts in general on permissionless systems, to ensure that the only smart contracts offered are on permissioned systems they have backdoors to, full patent control over. I.,e banks controlling them as de facto censorable Centralized Exchanges.

Do you want to live in a world with no DeFi? Do you only want centralized exchanges and the absolute guaranteed censorship on the global south that that entails? 

You cannot collect KYC on smart contract. They know this. They know it is impossible, and that it turns non compliant non us citizen into felony offenders. They will come for you. How do you think they intimidated Binance and Bitmex? How do you think they caught Mcafee? It is impossible for a normal smart contract to ban US citizens. Backends can't censor people.

This means it is illegal by default. *No one in the world can safely operate DeFi without KYC if this bill passes.* 

*No one in the world can safely operate DeFi without KYC if this bill passes.*

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top.  While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees.  We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment.  Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

3. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.  This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry!

Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

CryptoCurrency,Tokin’omics: Marijuana &amp; Cryptocurrency,"As I took the last pull on a bowl of Sour Diesel, I pondered… surely there must be a way to combine two of my favorite things: weed and crypto. Then the idea hit me like a 3’ bong. Stay with me here, this could be long. 

Seeing how herb is (federally) illegal in the US, it puts dispensaries in a sticky situation. It doesn’t allow them to have normal access to a bank, as the banking institution would be engaging in illegal activities. Zero bank access makes it quite difficult to operate a business. 

What if there were a separate marijuana based blockchain? It could have its own version of a stable coin, pegged to the USD that dispensaries could then transact on their own - pay employees, farmers, suppliers, taxes, etc. 

Each dispensary could have their own TOKIN, which could be used to get access to special deals, early/limited releases, incentives for local customers, etc. 

Each grower could use blockchain to prove authenticity, track supplies, sales, etc. I’m sure NFTs fit somewhere in here too. 

Each user could then buy the crypto tokin’ of their local dispensary, invest in certain strains, growers or farms, trade strain tokens or collect little baked cryptard NFTs.

Parts of the article How Biden’s E.V. Plan Could Help Tesla and Squeeze Toyota

Mr. Biden framed his push in part as a geopolitical competition in an emerging technology. The initiative is part of an effort “to drive the electric vehicle future forward, outcompete China and tackle the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet.

The president’s declaration could also help start-ups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, both based in the United States, that are expected to deliver their first vehicles this year.

By comparison, the Biden administration’s goals are modest, which has earned it criticism from some environmentalists. Plug-in hybrids, which have internal combustion engines in addition to batteries, would count as electric vehicles, giving Toyota some breathing room because of its leadership in that technology. And in 2030 half of the vehicles sold in the United States would still be powered by gasoline or diesel. Because cars typically stay on the road for more than a decade, that means the country will probably not be rid of internal combustion vehicles or gas stations for many years.

The White House’s caution may reflect recognition of the scale of the industrial transformation that lies ahead. The president’s plan also calls for construction of a nationwide network of charging stations and money to help companies retool factories to produce electric cars and components. One major risk is economic dislocation and job losses if the businesses that make parts for gasoline vehicles can’t adapt.

America also lacks enough battery factories. The European Commission is providing financial support to build battery factories in the European Union to reduce its reliance on Asia, where most batteries are currently produced.

Automakers expect the government to provide substantial help.

“Federal and state governments — and all stakeholders — will need to provide significant support for consumers, infrastructure and innovation,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group, said in a statement.

The U.S. government has previously played a critical role in kicking off the transition to electric vehicles. In January 2010, the Obama administration granted Tesla a $465 million loan to help the company develop and manufacture its Model S sedan.

“Without that $465 million, the Model S would have never happened,” Peter Rawlinson, who was chief engineer for that car and is now the chief executive of Lucid, said in an interview in June. “Tesla probably wouldn’t exist today. Really, the U.S. government made Tesla the success that it is today. That is a hell of an achievement.”

Companies that are already building electric cars in significant numbers have an advantage, Mr. Wells of Cardiff Business School said, because they have collected years of data on how owners use those vehicles. That includes not only Tesla but Nissan, whose battery-powered Leaf has been on the market for more than a decade, and G.M., which introduced the Bolt in 2016 and made the EV1 back in 1996.

G.M. is building two battery plants in the United States and has said it aims to phase out production of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. The company says it will spend $35 billion in the five years ending in 2025 to develop electric models.

“We are very committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and moving to an all-electric future as soon as possible,” the company’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said on Wednesday.

Ford this year started selling an electric sport utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, which has done well and been praised by critics. It plans to add an electric Transit van this year and an electric F-150 pickup truck next year.",finance

You ought to support Senator Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis’s amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684). 

This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. 

**How do you even vote on thousands of pages of spending?**

The federal government should not consider legislating technology it does not understand, especially after destroying the value of our dollar. What do you want to be remembered for?

personalfinance,How to ask for a raise when the entire call centre is paid the same “award salary”? (Aus),"Clarification: An award sets out the minimum pay and conditions for a particular industry or occupation.  
  

&amp;nbsp;

I have been working for an Australian insurance company in a call centre as a Sales Consultant for the last 8 years. 

  

&amp;nbsp;

 

 

In the beginning, I had ambitions of becoming a manager or working in a support role for my department but came to the realisation that my current role was perfect for me. I have often been told that I have a silver tongue and that I could “sell snow to an Inuit”, but most importantly, I have ADHD. So, the fact that my role doesn’t have any report deadlines, or projects that require self-motivation/keeping myself focused, is great. The phone rings, I do what I do best, the call hangs up, I do maybe 2 minutes of after call work, and then happily amuse myself with other things until the phone rings again. I thought it best to establish that I’m not wanting to get promoted, or move up in the company, to head off suggestions of looking at other roles. Also I am not really interested in looking for a job in another call centre, as from what I've been told from co-workers, my company is one of the top call centres to work for.

  

&amp;nbsp;

 

Over the last 8 years, I never thought of asking for a raise, as the company has a rewards system, where if you achieve one of your sales targets (we have about 6 in total), you will receive a $5 bonus, and then $2 for each additional sale. On average I get about $85 a month in bonus’ from this. So, my thinking has been, that if I approach upper management for a raise, they will highlight the reward system and say that there’s no need for raises, because the better I am at my job, the more money I would be getting as a bonus.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

I relayed this to my partner, when she suggested I ask for a raise, after sharing with her the second customer commendation I had received that week. She scoffed and pointed out all the extra non sales things that I do, should make me a much more valued employee, compared to the average employee, let alone some of the employees I have shared stories with her about, and it’s not fair that I get paid the same base rate as them. 

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

I’ll go through some examples of these extra things I do in a comment, so as to not unnecessarily bulk this post up. 

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

Next day at work, I pulled my manager aside to discuss with him. He and I are very relaxed and casual with each other and are good friends. He started off with the disclaimer that he is in no position to make those decisions and would have to be a discussion with his manager. He went on to say that he empathised and agreed that I do go above and beyond, but that we are all on the same “awards pay rate” and shared the anecdote of when he first became a manager, he was surprised to find that he would be put on the same pay rate as someone who had been a manager for 9 years. Saying it’s all well and good for the new managers, but a bit of a snub for the long-standing managers. He theorised that his manager’s response to me questioning would be something along the lines of: “do you think you are the first person to come to me to ask for a raise?” and laugh it off but amended that if anyone could do it, I could.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

I think I am in a prime position to discuss this with the manager, as I have had two customer commendations this week, that resulted in an email pat on the back not only from the big manager in question but even his manager (that I’m friendly with), not only that, but my team has also just been announced the sales team of the quarter.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

However, I’m not sure how to overcome the “it is what it is” mentality. I have been feeling apathetic over the last few months, and I feel like a pay rise even if it was $2 an hour would do wonders in making me feel appreciated and valued. Should I go to the third-tier manager that I’m friendly with and ask him if I can speak to him unofficially for advice?

 

&amp;nbsp;

personalfinance,What should I be doing with my income?,"Looking for general advice on what steps I need to be taking to get out of debt and build up savings/investments. 

My current income is about $49,000/yr (Take home pay of $2,712/mo)

Current savings is about $6,500

I owe $12,000 in student loans, which haven’t been accruing interest the past year or so due to COVID, but interest will start up again in October. My thoughts were throwing a chunk of savings (thinking $4,000) at these loans before October, leaving me with $8,000 in debt with interest rates between 3.76% - 4.29%.

If I took this route, leaving me with only $2,000 in saving and $8,000 in debt, what would be the best strategy to both build up my savings and get out of debt as quickly as possible? 

My monthly expense total about $1,000/mo.   And right now I’m saving $400/mo on top of that, so leaving me with roughly $1,315 extra a month that right now I don’t exactly know where it goes. My budgeting hasn’t been the best lately, but I can definitely work to reign it in.

Now I'm 33 and have seen my salary grow to $110k (including a job change earlier this year which bumped me up 23%). I've paid off all my debt, have an emergency fund in place, and bought a home earlier this year (for which the mortgage payments are 21% of my gross pay).  

I track every penny I spend and most months I'm left with $1k to $2k extra which goes into general savings. I currently have $95k in retirement savings, and I'm adding 20% each month, plus another 4% in employer match. My calculations show that if I continue this contribution rate, with 2% salary increase and 6% stock market return per year, I'll have somewhere around $4 million at retirement (that jumps to nearly $6.5 million using a more optimistic 8% average return).

I'm kind of left wondering ""What now?"" The flowchart basically says ""save for other goals"" which I guess would be fun things and vacations at this point.

Zillow reported $1.3 billion in revenue Thursday for the second quarter, slightly beating analyst’s expectations.

Expected revenue was $1.28 billion, with earnings per share of 24 cents.

  Consolidated net income was $10 million.

The company’s Internet, Media, and Technology (IMT) segment grew 70% in revenue year-over-year to $476 million. Premier Agent revenue grew 82% year-over-year.

The Homes segment reached record revenue levels at $777 million.

The mortgages segment revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $57 million.

Zillow Group co-founder and CEO Rich Barton said the company expects recent housing market trends, including low interest rates and location-flexible job opportunities, to continue to fuel interest in Zillow.

The company’s mobile apps and websites saw 229 million average monthly unique users in the second quarter, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. This drove visits to 2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year.

The company ended the quarter with cash and investments totaling $4.6 billion.

personalfinance,How would this affect credit,"I keep getting emails from a loan company (not naming names) about their new credit card that only sort of works like a credit card and I'm curious as to how it would affect someone's credit.

The way it works is they give you a limit and an interest rate. Whatever you spend is then turned into a 36 month loan at your interest rate (which is credit card interest, so high compared to other options). 

So, for example, if you spend $1000 on the card this month and your rate is 15%, you have a 36 month loan with a payment of about $35. 

My question is, if they report, presumably, 12 small loans per year on your credit, would that be good or bad on balance? 

Obviously, if you have 12 loans that you're actively paying on, it's not good. But if your August ""loan"" gets paid off in September and September in October, what would the cumulative effect be?",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Refinancing Questions,"With rates going down I've been looking into refinancing our mortgage but had a few questions since it's our first time doing this. For a little background, we bought our first house one year ago in a LCL area for $192k and (at least according to Zillow), it's currently worth \~$230k. Our credit score is 800+ so we should get good rates. I anticipate a large income increase in 2-3 years so we'll probably either pay off the mortgage within 5-7 years and hang onto the place as a rental or sell it and move into a bigger place. Until we get that raise I need to keep our monthly payments around where they are now though. Here's our situation:

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Loan:** 30 year fixed (only 1 year in), 3.25% interest rate, monthly payments $1000.75 (principal + interest + escrow)

**Best Offer:** 30 year fixed, 2.75% interest rate, monthly payment $617

&amp;#x200B;

My first question, is it even worth the hassle to refinance for \~0.5% rate reduction if we'll either pay it off or sell within 5-7 years? Also ,how is that monthly payment so low? Is that not including escrow or something? This was just from a generic quote generated on NerdWallet so it doesn't include specifics (I'm holding off on getting inundated with spam calls until I actually pull the trigger and apply for real quotes).

financialindependence,Reasons for young people to consider starting with Roth over Pre-tax/Traditional,"Common wisdom on here is that pre-tax &gt; Roth, mostly because people expect to have a lower marginal tax rate in retirement than working.

I'd like to point out a number of reasons that this likely isn't the case:

1.We currently have  the lowest tax rates since the Reagan administration(80's), but this likely won't remain the case for a number of reasons:

A) The GOP tax cuts of 2017 automatically expire in 2025, unless congress comes up with new legislation. This means higher tax rates.

B) The U.S government has been on a massive spending binge and will likely continue to do so, with the national debt growing substantially faster than GDP. These programs will need to be paid for at some point

C) Surging inflation may require interest rate hikes, which increase interest on debt the federal government must pay.

2.Your income will likely grow throughout your career as you gain experience. This means your tax bracket will go up. 

3.If you invest in taxable accounts, your marginal tax rate will grow over time as well due to compounding returns. Maybe 2 years into getting started  you only receive $1000 in taxable dividends a year from your VTI shares, but 20 years in, you might be pulling $25,000 in dividends a year that push up your tax bracket.

I'm not saying to avoid pre-tax entirely- you'll want some money in there eventually to fill the lower tax brackets. I'm simply saying that it can make most sense to build up a Roth account when you're young and lower income, and then as you approach retirement and are near peak earnings, pre-tax makes more sense.",finance

These are staff members of algorand inc. This was encoded in UTF8, if we copy the 'HEX' in the message into a [HEX to UTF8 converter](https://dencode.com/en/string/hex) we get the above text.

Some of the names are very familiar 'Silvio Micali' 'Keli J Callaghan'

Some are going to be more familiar 'Jing Chen' is an incredible cryptographer.

I've directly communicated with one name on another forum before I cracked this 'Will ""ZeroMicron"" Winder' . /wave Hi Will .

Note it is sent from a named address [Algorand1](https://algoexplorer.io/address/I3345FUQQ2GRBHFZQPLYQQX5HJMMRZMABCHRLWV6RCJYC6OO4MOLEUBEGU)

Where next? Let us take a closer look at the [algorand address](https://algoexplorer.io/address/ALGORANDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN5DNAU).

Here we see some other interesting transactions. But first something that isn't a transaction. See the box at the bottom. When a blockchain starts it must have a genesis block that allocates the 'coin' to various addresses. This address has one algorand allocated to it. Another thing is its ridiculously long vanity address. Anyone who has played around and fished for a vanity address realizes this one would take longer than the age of the universe to generate. It is not that instead it is a burner address, which is an address with no key. Algorand can be sent here but no one will ever be able to get that algo. So algorand burned an algorand at its very genesis! Quite a frugal burn.

Now the next transaction 3rd box down.

[The second transaction](https://preview.redd.it/l6sn103x2sf71.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18deeddd588081fd3bb9ae273894936d11f1db7b)

This is the [transaction](https://algoexplorer.io/tx/NOXQWFHT4ZPO7UKTQ2VYCQRTTH3LCV62K7PBRGW2Q6IVOHOUYRLA). In it is another list of names. Repeat the above.

""Amy Fleming ; Craig Gentry ; Fabrice Benhamouda ; Fangfang Chen ; Federico Demicheli ; Hugo Krawczyk ; John Bridgewater ; Massimo Morini ; Shai Halevi ; Tal Rabin""

Again some are familiar 'Massimo Morini'.

Some will become more familiar. I hope we hear from 'Tal Rabin' soon. She is another famous cryptographer.

What about the 4th transaction. Surprisingly this isn't data. It is a payment between 2 accounts

This transaction does have data but it isn't like the other data. '0f80e1ab595fc180c88220c22db03b1b   ;   8ed5e20af4d8f5fc068f3d8e271d305c'

It is sent by [Algorand 21](https://algoexplorer.io/address/3P3CHL4M5JTDJKEL3ARLUZRXY23BWWPX6SZDC2NIBALL3SKE7JBIFOVOAY) the same one that sent the payment.

These are two hex encoded bits of data.

* '0f80e1ab595fc180c88220c22db03b1b'
* '8ed5e20af4d8f5fc068f3d8e271d305c'

What are they? It took me time to figure this out. I thought it was maybe encoded Kanji. It wasn't.

The first is a ['hash'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). The second is a ['signature'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature)

There we have it. Now you know the lesson they left for us.

**Why?**

This is a lesson in how blockchains work.

The first 3 messages are to generate some randomness, a [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed).

The randomness is used to choose a random sender to add a block to the blockchain and a random participant is rewarded.

The sender then hashes the information and adds it to the blockchain. Then everyone knows it was them who added this block.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my speculation. Take this with a pinch of salt.

I think Algorand has left a lesson here as some of us need to learn cryptography if we are going to take over this thing. Not all of us but some of us. 

A second lesson is they want some of us to explore the chain to find the lessons and puzzles.

So who wants to learn? I am happy to point you in the right direction. I have seen people on this board who do so. This should be encouraged, especially in the young who will be able to use this knowledge for a long time.

Immediately after I post this message I plan to thank them for the lesson and link this post.",cryptocurrency

They say that they already have 20,000 orders at over $1 billion.

A couple questions I have though.  Can you sell your stake before the company goes public?  How would that work?  Is there a way to prevent people from selling their stake?  How does the 10% interest work?  Do they pay that out each year or something?  Or does it get rolled into the stock?

personalfinance,I'm an Ontario student with amazing credit and savings that can't get approved for financing because I have no income. Help please.,"Sorry if this is in the wrong sub. As title says, I'm in my final year of university for a program that requires me to drive often. My car is fully paid off but on its way out so its not worth fixing things anymore. I have been looking for a replacement and decided to go with new because the interest rate was lower and it would have its full warranty. Its the model and colour I like - this vehicle is the one. 

So I go to financing without a worry because I'm financially stable and have a good down payment and excellent credit, and then the finance guy starts asking me the questions. I realize quickly that hes only asking about current income: I report my OSAP and sponsorship which brings me in on average about 2k/mo. Low and behold the computer spits out a no because my income doesnt count and neither do my savings. We try my finace as a cosigner but hes also declined because he just bought a vehicle so the ratios dont lean in my favour. 

Finance guy says the only other options are a different cosigner or to go with a high-risk lending company which will have ridiculous interest. I'm angry. The banks dont think I have enough money so the solution is to charge me more money? Any way, I said no, and I dont have another cosigner. 

Now idk what to do because my car is about to die but its mandatory to have a vehicle for my program. It makes me mad to think I'm going to have to buy some piece of crap waste of money vehicle that I dont even like because I can't get financed. Hoping there is someone out there who knows of any place I can get approved without a cosigner or steady income? I swear I've seen 100 commercials of dealerships saying ""Come in! Everyone is approved!"" I need to find one. For reference I live North of Barrie. TIA",finance

I wasn't planning on refinancing at all back when I got it, but the large amount of equity I now have along with the laundry list of repairs and improvements I'd like to do is making a cash out refinance very tempting. 

My hangup is that my rate will almost certainly go up, and I'm not sure how much more that would cost me in the long run. I'm not planning on moving for a while, at least until the housing market calms down which doesn't seem likely anytime soon.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, August 6, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 6, 2021**

Stocks were mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) underperforming, while previous laggards like financial, industrial, and energy stocks picked up the slack, driving both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) to fresh, intraday, all-time highs. While the past few weeks have been quite choppy, with concerns surrounding inflation and the coronavirus Delta variant weighing on the minds of investors, the overall market has displayed remarkable strength amid record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion. Today, market participants were encouraged by the July Job Report, which showed a stronger-than-expected rebound in employment last month.

The Labor Department’s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations
   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected
   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million
* Walmart (WMT) is offering special bonuses to many warehouse employees to work every hour they are scheduled and, in some cases giving temporary pay raises, as the country's biggest retailer ramps up for the holiday shopping season
* Target (TGT) said it plans to invest $200 million in education programs that would cover the cost of tuition, fees and textbooks for part- and full-time workers who pursue a qualifying undergraduate degree at more than 40 institutions. It will also fund advanced degrees, paying up to $10,000 each year for master’s programs at those schools. Just the latest examples of companies actively changing to become more attractive for employees. Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks (SBUX) have similar program to this in place. 
* The crackdown in China continues… Alibaba (BABA) told investors during a call that their tax rate will balloon to 20% by the end of Q3, according to a report by Bloomberg. This is likely due to the fact that the CCP has removed a 10% preferential tax break given to “key software enterprises”. This is likely to affect other Chinese technology and internet stocks. 
* In other news, food-delivery giant Meituan received a $1 billion fine from the CCP for forcing merchants to work exclusively on its platform. The market cap of this company has reportedly halved since February peak of $168 billion. 
* President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order setting a target for electric vehicles, hydrogen-fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 50% of U.S. sales by 2030 -- a voluntary goal that auto makers said necessitated federal support for vehicle charging stations and consumer tax incentives.

CryptoCurrency,The 4 Stages of a Shitcoin.,"Evening all, I hope everyone is well!

As the media circus and hype from the general populace is slowing down a bit from the recent bull run, so is the amount of new Shitcoins entering the crypto market (for now).

Unfortunately all is not well, like a bout of diarrhea, an influx of Shitcoins can and will happen again.

This is by no means a definitive guide on how to spot a Shitcoin, as some of them have been known to defy all known laws of common sense and rationality to suddenly appear in the spotlight, but this should help at the very least help the new people and your average crypto hoarder separate the good shit, from their Shitcoins.

Most analysis on specific Shitcoins tends to focus on the financial changes, data and all the lovely stuff you could possibly want to plot within a Pivot table. As a bit of a change, this analysis is mainly going to be focusing on the social reaction and response to a Shitcoin opposed to the financials HOWEVER there will be some overlap.

I would like to also state before begining that there is often deviation within the stages. You may see a Shitcoin enter one or more of the stages several times.

**Stage 1: The ""up and coming"" phase.**

I once went to NYC. In the four days I was sober and concious enough to be aware of my surroundings, I had at least 3 dudes hand me their mixtape.

The first stage of a Shitcoin is comparable to this, you'll see the developers (who won't be using their real names, or provide any form of credentials) going door-to-door to the various subreddits trying to promote their coin, token or product.

At this stage, you may hear phrases from the developers (or people who have bought in) such as:

- ""We're here to help rethink traditional financial options.""

- ""It's like BTC/ETH but better!""

- ""We're early, I missed out on BTC and I don't want to miss out on (generic Shitcoin name).""

- ""People are so obsessed about BTC and Eth they won't see the next best thing coming.""

- ""I heard my parents talking about it, that means it's just a matter of time until it moons!""

- ""I use Arch btw""

- ""I wouldn't trust what you read online, we've got (insert financial service) running scared!""

You may also notice:

- A lot of videos are going around on Tik Tok, YouTube, Yahoo Answers, Vimeo (so on).

- These videos contain an influencer or internet celebrity who wants to share with you how much of a good project it is because they want to help their audience.

- They absolutely have not been given $50,000 in a briefcase to promote this and they have faith in the project and understand exactly how it works outside of the script they were not provided.

- Some less-than-honest exchanges are artificially raising the price of buying to generate growth.

- There may be inflated amounts of discussion surrounding the project on social media, largely through bots and paid promotions.

**Stage 2: The realisation.**

It's two or three weeks later after the usual cast of people have promoted (Generic Shitcoin)

Let's say you bought in to (Generic Shitcoin). It's ok, people are still talking about it... Right?

At this point a lot of people begin to naturally drift away, however this is where the first decisive and arguably the first obvious signs of a Shitcoin begin to emerge for the average person.

Remember Bob who made four Tik Toks, a Fleet and a Vine about (Generic Shitcoin)? - He has just posted a Twitlonger about the developers of (Generic Shitcoin) not paying him for the promotion.

His accusations may be further supported by another influencer's video, which may be split across two 10 minute videos with monetisation on, but they both bring up a few good points.

At the same time, the white paper turns out to be copy and pasted from another Shitcoin with some of the words changed silghtly.

A few days go by and it turns out the white paper wasn't stolen, it was in fact from one of the developers other failed projects they wanted you to conveniently forget about.

It's ok though, after a few days of outrage people will move on.

(If you're still invested in (Generic Shitcoin) now, this is arguably the last realistic point of ""getting out"".)

**Stage 3: The denial.**

Ok so at this point it's been six months since the social media frenzy.

You bought (Generic Shitcoin) and outside the occasional post on Quora, the project is barely mentioned online. Everyone involved now just wants to forget.

It's in your wallet. You can't really afford the fee to move it out, without losing half of it in the process.

It will bounce back... Right?

There's been 0 word from the Dev's in the past few months, aside from one blog post attempting to address some of the stuff brought to light. 

You try and bring the project up on a discussion thread every now and then, but you get downvoted to oblivion or the comment is just ignored entirely. Was any of this even real?

**Stage 4: the regret, death and lawsuits.**

It's been a long time. This morning though is different.

The Developer of (Generic Shitcoin) has appeared in court. It turns out he took 10-15% of the total supply of the project and stuffed it in to various wallets before anyone really got interested in it. He sold it around the time the influencers were on their second or third video about the project.

Alternatively, they may not have broken the law. The project may have just failed, but fear not!

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021.

# **Inflation will be the sizzling topic for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/inflation-will-be-the-sizzling-topic-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-.html)**
*****
&gt; With fresh evidence the labor market is on the mend, investors’ focus shifts to inflation in the coming week and whether it will continue to heat up or show signs of abating.
*****
&gt; There is a series of inflation data expected: the consumer price index and the producer price index, released Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
&gt; Jobs and inflation are two key factors that influence the Federal Reserve in making its decisions on policy. Markets are hanging on anything that will help determine when the central bank will start to step away from the measures it took to support the economy during the pandemic, including its $120 billion per month purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
*****
&gt; Friday’s July jobs report showed a healthy 943,000 increase in payrolls. That gain is enough to spur Fed watchers into thinking the central bank could announce in the next couple of months that it will dial back its support measures. That’s important since ending the bond-buying program is a first step toward raising interest rates. It’s the Fed’s near-zero rate policy that has helped drive the liquidity feeding the stock market’s gains and keeping rates low.
*****
&gt; “I think the keys for the next week are going to be both CPI and PPI. We get some inflation data for consumers and for businesses. Those will be closely watched. Jobless claims as well,” State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone said.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has made it clear that the labor market is key to what they do next,” he added. “Jobless claims will continue to be an item that gets looked at every week. Then finally we’re going to get consumer sentiment. Those are four things that could be market movers.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has said elevated inflation, running over 5% at the consumer level recently, is just temporary. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect another hot reading for the consumer price index, with core inflation rising 0.4% or 4.3% year over year. The CPI is released Wednesday. Headline inflation was at 5.4% in June, and core, excluding food and energy, was at 4.5%.
*****
&gt; “That 0.4% follows a 0.9% rise in June,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said. “Then you get PPI Thursday and import prices Friday. Import prices have been running hot and import prices are expected to be up 10.5% year-over-year. That follows over 11% the month before.”
*****
&gt; Economists said if there is another strong employment report for August, then that would support the Fed moving to start tapering its bond-buying program. But one wild card for the economy is the course of the latest Covid outbreak and whether it will crimp economic activity and hiring.
*****
&gt; In making a case that inflation is fleeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pointed to what seems to be a temporary sharp jump in used car prices, and also the decline in lumber prices after a sharp run-up. The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, but policymakers said they will tolerate an average range around 2% before acting, as long as inflation does not stay too high for too long.
*****
&gt; “Used car prices are beginning to show signs of moderation. I’ll argue that ‘you show me used car prices, and I’ll show you rent [rising],’” Boockvar said. ”‘You show me a drop in lumber prices. I’ll show you a 10-year high in aluminum prices.’ Look at natural gas. It’s at a six-year high. It’s broad based.”
*****
&gt; A protracted period of inflation would harm the economy and negatively affect stocks. Corporations so far have been passing along rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices, but if they can no longer do that at some point, profit margins will shrink.
*****
&gt; # Fed speakers
&gt; There are a few Federal Reserve officials speaking in the week ahead. Market pros are looking to them to help clarify the central bank’s intentions on tapering. The expectation is that the Fed will announce in September or later in the fall that it will taper back its $120 billion a month bond program, starting at the end of the year or early next year.
*****
&gt; The tapering is expected to be gradual and continue for 10 months or more. The Fed’s own forecasts show its first rate hikes happening in 2023.
*****
&gt; More information could come from the Fed when officials gather for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at the end of the month. But action is not expected to be taken until the September meeting or later.
*****
&gt; “We have two voters Monday who are speaking and that’s important. Both lean toward tapering,” Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; “You could add a few more voices to this,” he said. “It could be a showdown between [Fed Governor] Lael Brainard and [Chicago Fed President] Charles Evans on one side and [Fed Governor Christopher] Waller and some of these Fed presidents on the other.”
*****
&gt; The bond market has responded to the idea that the Fed could wind down its bond buying policy. The 10-year Treasury yield crept up to 1.29% Friday afternoon, after hitting a low of 1.13% during the week.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had been moving lower on a number of factors, including concerns about Covid disrupting the economy.
*****
&gt; NatWest’s John Briggs said the 10-year yield may now be moving to a new higher range, following the jobs report. “Maybe you’re now instead of a 1.10% to 1.30% range you’re in a 1.20% to 1.40%. Maybe you’re shifting the range a little higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; Briggs said the bond market will be impacted if the inflation number is hotter than expected. “I think it will matter. I’ve always thought the inflation story is the real story anyway. We have rents picking up in the back half of the year. That’s going to keep inflation above 3%. That’s going to be a challenge to the Fed,” he said.
*****
&gt; As for stocks, State Street’s Arone expects the market to continue to “grind higher.”
*****
The Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed at new records Friday. The Dow gained 0.8% for the week, finishing at 35,208, while the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.9% to 4,436. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week to 14,835.
*****
&gt; Earnings continue to roll out in the coming week, but the volume of the releases drops off dramatically. Reports are expected from Walt Disney, eBay, Wendy’s and others.
*****
&gt; “Earnings season, we’ll be putting behind us. It was stellar. Then we have sort of a vacuum between earnings and Jackson Hole,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; “The market has seemed to take the variant news in stride, but investors are cautious,” he said. “The jobs number does help alleviate some of those growth scare concerns, concerns about the slowdown in growth. Numbers like this certainly help investors with their anxiety about that.”

&gt; # SPY Snoozefest Coming To An End?

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we noted how the major US equity indices have been a bit sleepy with each one having risen less than 1% over the five days ending yesterday. As shown below, that lack of volatility actually extends back to the prior week as well. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has generally trended in a sideways range over the past two weeks. That was until today. While yesterday's move higher brought SPY to the high end of that recent range, the reaction to the strong NFP report is marking a more distinct breakout.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-SPY.png))**

&gt; As for just how narrow of a range SPY has traded in, in the charts below we show the distance (in percentage terms) between the intraday high and low over a rolling ten trading day span. While today's move higher lifted the reading to 1.59%, as of yesterday's close there was only 1.34% between yesterday's intraday high and last Tuesday's intraday low. Going back through the history of SPY, there have only been 146 other days, or just 2% of all days, in which that range was less than 1.5%. In fact, the last time that there was as narrow of a ten-day range as yesterday's reading was the first trading day of 2018.

&gt; # Did You Know Stocks Historically Peak in Early August?

&gt; Hard to believe, but we are in August already! The good news is stocks are still firmly in a bull market, but the bad news is the calendar is a potential worry now. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, August and September have been historically two of the weakest months of the year. In fact, during a post-election year, August has been historically quite poor, with only February worse on average. Turning to September, it has indeed been historically the worst month of the year on average. Don’t forget that last year stocks saw nearly a 10% correction during this troublesome month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Taking this a step further, stocks tend to peak in early August when a new party is in power in the White House. August 6 is the day stocks peak and they don’t bottom until September 25.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Meanwhile, during a post-election year stocks peak on August 3 and bottom on September 24. Again, showing how the next several weeks potentially can be dangerous.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It isn’t all bad news though. With the economy rebounding and earnings soaring, should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use that as an opportunity to add to core equity positions. “The S&amp;P 500 is up an incredible six months in a row,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What most might not realize is that is a very bullish event. In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet.”

&gt; # Biggest Jump in Bearish Sentiment Since Last Spring

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been moving sideways around record highs over the past couple of weeks. As such, bullish sentiment from the AAII was relatively flat this week. After a sizeable 5.6 percentage point jump to 36.2% last week, bullish sentiment fell 0.1 percentage points this week. With that reading, bullish sentiment is still 2 percentage points below the historical average of 38%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Whereas bullish sentiment did not change much, bearish sentiment surged 7.6 percentage points. That was the biggest single-week uptick since June 18th of last year when it rose 9.73 percentage points. At that time though, just under half (47.78%) of respondents reported bearish sentiment compared to only 31.7% today which is only slightly elevated versus the historical average of 30.53%. In fact, the current level of bearish sentiment is now the highest since only February. Put differently, bearish sentiment has been muted recently, and while this week's increase was large, it does not leave sentiment at any sort of extreme level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; In spite of the large uptick in respondents reporting as bearish, sentiment continues to favor the bulls. The bull-bear spread remains positive at 4.4.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Given bullish sentiment went little changed, the rise in bearish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as neutral. Neutral sentiment fell 7.5 percentage points to 32.2%. That is the lowest reading since the first week of July, and it was the largest week-over-week decline since April 8th. This week now marks the first time in three weeks that neutral was not the predominant sentiment reading.

personalfinance,MIL was scammed out of $7500 from a wire transfer fraud.,"My wife calls me and says her mom, my MIL, was freaking out on the phone and had just been scammed out of roughly $7,500. She said that her mom had received a fraud alert call from USAA, her bank, about some charges in another state. 
The person on the phone asked her to verify a few charges which she one after the other said no they were not her. The guy said he needed to put her on hold and talk with the fraud department. He comes back on the phone and says he needs to have her confirm the number that was sent via the USAA app. She relays the number that was sent and he confirms it. He says something along the lines of he’ll get the charges taken care of and have her debit card shut off and a new one would be sent next-day via FedEx. As much as I know, the phone call then ends. 
The only information she provided was her member ID prior to being read the charges in question. 
Shortly after she notices a wire transfer of roughly $7,500 from her account to another account. She then contacts USAA to inform them of the fraudulent activity and they proceed to tell her that because it was a wire transfer from her savings account that it is not protected as it would be had it of been from her checking account and there is not a whole lot they can do. They said they would contact the bank in which the transfer went to and that that bank would reach out to the customer, but that it was basically on her. 
I can try and provide any other needed info. What, if any, are her next steps? What should she do to rectify this fraud?",finance
personalfinance,W2 Contract job vs Full time,"I have worked as a full time employee in my 15 years of career life. Now as i'm unemployed and looking for a job, I'm getting lots of job offers, most of them are contract opportunities (w2, c2c, c2h etc.) I did some research to get familiar with how contract jobs different from full time jobs. But I still have some doubts.

For w2 type of contract jobs they pay hourly rates. for ex let say $60/hr. Does that mean you get paid after all the taxes deducted from your paycheck and you dont have to worry about paying taxes (federal, state, social security tax) for this $60/hr rates? or do you still have to pay taxes from the $60/hr rates? (They dont provide any benefits which I think common for all the contract job types.)

If the contract job is 1099, then that means you have to take care of the taxes from the  money you get?

Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Pay off low interest debt vs save?,"Graduated in May and accumulated a large amount of low-interest debt. My current salary is 60k/year which comes to ~$42k after tax and deductions (3500 monthly). I am living at home and currently have 7k in a high interest savings account and 10.5k in an 100 percent equity ETF. My debt is as follows:

Federal student loans - 30k / 320 per month (Canada is freezing the rates to 0 percent until at least March 2022, likely around 5-6% afterwards)

Car loan - 22k at 3.2% interest / 470 per month

Loan to my parents (school &amp; housing) - 30k at 0% / 500 per month

Total of 82k / $1290 per month 

My parents gifted me 10k to get a car as a grad gift and I was not planning on taking on a car loan at all. However, they were adamant on me getting a new-ish SUV. Ultimately it was my decision but I do regret it. The current plan is to keep it and drive it to the ground.

After my monthly expenses (~$1000) and minimum payments (~$1290), I have $1200 left to divvy up between retirement and debt repayment. Would it be reasonable to save the min 15% of gross on retirement and the rest into debt? Or just save it all on retirement? The general advice I've seen and from what I've heard from my family is to continue saving/investing while paying off your low interest debt. However, the total amount is overwhelming for me. Thanks to anyone for your help. I am feeling very overwhelmed :(",finance
investing,My biggest concern for valuations right now,"The p/e ratio of the s&amp;p 500 is at a high since 2008. It peaked a few months ago, but I think it is still far to high. A P/E ratio is the ratio of market capitalization to profits. This indicates the average dollar in the stock market only turns a 3.3% profit on the books of companies. Obviously speculation is part of the stock market so one would expect a price to earnings ratio of greater than 12.5 or 8% yearly returns, however, there seems to be too much speculation. I don't think companies are going to become    profitable enough to warrant such a high level of speculation. There is definitely a bubble in many tech stocks in my opinion Tesla being the most extreme example in my opinion has a p/e of 365 and a market cap of nearly 700 billion meaning that they are not only a massive company, but also most likely wildly over valued. The feds ability to do market intervention is declining by the day due to the use of qe and near 0 interest rates. I am concerned about this bubble popping causing a significant loss in confidence which the fed would have a limited ability to react against. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Do I need to compare APR with Mortgage? Mortgage Broker with Online Institution,"I had a mortgage broker on my original mortgage ---- Skip ahead a year. Rates are lower and the housing market is booming. I want to get refinanced to also remove my BMI.  
Originally I'm going with Better Mortgages but out of the blue my mortgage broker messages me offering me the same rate

With both rates the same what do I need to compare between the two? I think Better Mortgage was waiving some additional appriasal fee and something else but I notice that prior to the refinance my mortgage rate APR was significantly higher than the mortgage rate.  
This time around my APR (At least with Better Mortgages is barely up from the quoted mortgage rate)  


What should I compare between two similar interest rates to save money on a Mortgage? Is the APR the real deciding factor as that takes into account fees and everything else? I'm not sure how my mortgage broker is benefiting out of all of this if he connects me with a lender he must have some fees baked in that he gets because I'm puzzled why he would even reach out himself",finance
personalfinance,While banking with Vio Bank my savings were stolen,"I opened a savings account with Vio Bank the on line division of Midfirst bank, I signed onto my Vio account on May 28 and saw 6 fraudulent electronic withdrawals totaling $58600.00 to another bank over a 2 week period. I had no knowledge of. Also I noticed another telephone number on this outside bank which was unknown to me. All of this happening with no notifications from Vio.  I called Vio the next day and reported the theft and was told to file a dispute, which I did. In Vio's bank disclosure and Fed law  it states  if there are fraudulent withdrawals and you report them  within 2 days of seeing them your liability can be no more than $50.00. I was shocked when I received a letter on June 10 that my dispute was denied and my stolen $58600.00 was my loss. I called Midfirst and was told to submit another dispute which I did. Shortly after I received a call from Vio saying they contacted the other bank, Sutton Bank, and Sutton was returning $16000. which they deposited into my Vio account, an obvious admission by Sutton that the account opened with them was fraudulent.  A few days later I got a call from Vio informing me that Vio denied my dispute again refusing to return my  $42000.  I was a victim of identity theft. How can Vio not return my money.

CryptoCurrency,Warning for people who think that having there phone hacked to steal your crypto won’t happen..,"I’m just putting this out there for people to be aware that just because you haven’t had your phone (Android or IPhone ) wallets hacked that it won’t happen.

The other day a friend I know who had about $10,000 worth of crypto on a Crypto.com wallet that he solely accessed through is current IPhone 11 Pro has had his IPhone remote hacked and his Crypto.com account accessed as the hacker tried to withdrawal all his crypto from his wallet.

No my friend was at home at the time and using his phone that was connected to his home Wifi, he then noticed that his phone was opening and closing applications and folders without him touching it, shocked at what he was seeing he was confused at decided to watch as his phone started to open his Crypto.com account ( that was automatically logged in) and then panicking as he watched who ever start to transfer his funds, he immediately turned his phone to aeroplane mode cutting all internet access to his phone just as the hacker hit transfer.

Still in a shock and up in the air as to what he should do next he immediately used his laptop to contact Crypto.com to notify them that someone unauthorised as just attempted a transfer of over $10,000 dollars worth of his crypto, Crypto.com immediately suspended the transaction according to what he has said as the transfer had only gone through 1 Confirmation so they managed to isolated the transfer. However he still doesn’t know wether or not he will be able to have all of his funds recovered.

What do you think my friend could have done to better protect himself and his assets in such a situation?? Apart from using a hardware wallet which would have been a more secure step.

Here is my take on what he and everyone could do to better protect themselves: -

- Do not at any point store your seed phrases/passwords or any important access information on your devices especially if you connect to wifi hotspots or access points on the regular

- Making sure your devices Bluetooth and wifi is permanently disabled when you are not using these features of your device especially when travelling around as it’s very easy for you connections to be Sniffed by hackers who are Wardriving for open access

- Make sure that your home wifi is secured with at least a third party Firewall in conjunction with any existing security protocols.

- Ensuring that your home wifi connections are protected with a well rounded a reputable VPN to ensure all connections made by devices through this connection will be Obfuscated from any prying eyes trying to Sniff and hook in to your wifi, my suggestion on this would be NordVPN although you can choose whichever VPN you like.

- Choosing to not have your device automatically logged into your crypto wallets/exchanges is something we should all think about doing, apart from being a little frustrating to not have a smooth and seemless access it’s one more step a hacker has to hurdle over in order to access your funds.

- If at any point you ever notice your device is behaving unusual and you think you may be compromised, using the Aeroplane mode switch as a kill switch for your device is the most effective safety measure you can implicate that will take effect immediately and possibly safe guarding you from any inherent losses.

If there are any other points you guys would like to add on this topic please feel free to do so in the comments 👍

Be safe out there guys and just remember just because your not using an android device dosent mean you are safer as all devices can and will be compromised at some point.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Fed’s Kaplan Calls for Gradual, Balanced Tapering Starting Soon","(Bloomberg) — The Federal Reserve ought to begin tapering its asset purchases sooner moderately than later and in a gradual method, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan stated, arguing that the huge bond-buying is resulting in extreme risk-taking.

“I’d be supportive of adjusting these purchases quickly, however as soon as we begin the adjustment course of, I’d most likely want to have or not it’s extra gradual,” Kaplan stated in an interview this week with Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway on Bloomberg’s “Odd Heaps” podcast.

The Fed ought to minimize month-to-month Treasury purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed safety purchases by $5 billion, ending its bond-buying program in eight months, Kaplan stated. Such a tempo would additionally imply that the purchases of the 2 property would decline in lockstep, because the Fed is at present shopping for $80 billion per 30 days in Treasuries and $40 billion in MBS. Some officers have argued for lowering the mortgage purchases quicker or first, given the surge in housing costs.

Kaplan spoke Wednesday, two days earlier than Friday’s report displaying U.S. employers added a greater-than-forecast 943,000 jobs in July, essentially the most in practically a yr. The unemployment fee fell by a half percentage-point to five.4%, marking an enormous step towards the Fed’s purpose of “substantial” additional progress within the job market that may add gasoline to the tapering talks.

Fed officers started debating when and the way they need to taper asset purchases at their July assembly. The central financial institution began buying bonds firstly of the pandemic final yr in an effort to inject liquidity into the market and buoy an economic system rocked by widespread lockdowns",finance
CryptoCurrency,This Sub is Saving my Life and Keeping me Alive,"This is my first ever post I am making on reddit and especially on this sub so forgive for typos, grammar, syntax, etc \*\*

Okay so some of you may know me as JawnxWick in the daily discussions on here but I wanted to make this post while literally half drunk right now with the mood being changed from deep-suicidal depression to a feeling of hope/joy for the better to write this as a shout out to this community for all of their love and support. 

Anyways, my name is Derek, and work in Radiology at a Hospital. I've lived with deep depression on and off since I was 13, I have a history of self-harm, I've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital before for self-harm and like I honestly thought for the longest I had nothing to live for or not future. I discovered options trading and made my way to wallstreetbets where I would gamble, winning and losing thousands of dollars on risky tradings and eventually quitting and leaving that all behind once I made $15K and subsequently losing that all in the course of a few months betting on shitty SPACS. Eventually I left that sub along with options trading and made my way into crypto where I found this wholesome community. 

I won't bore you with the details but like, I don't live in the best neighborhood in my city, I still live with my mother and older brother, and there's a lot I haven't accomplished for my age and depression always finds a way to bring up my negative attributes to keep me in a bad mood but until I found this sub something changed fundamentally. I began investing in ETH on April 29th of this year. My best friend from a different country who I knew since 2008 gave me european FIAT to invest with on her behalf and I can keep 50% and I put that into ETH during the run up in May. I was beginning to be active on here and learned how to DCA putting in whatever I could afford biweekly (every two weeks) into crytpo being mostly ETH, BTC, and a few selected alt coins such as COMP, AAVE, SOL, AMP, etc. I ended up falling in love with crypto the more I studied and learned about it and like, my life began to change. I started investing the max I could afford into it and wanted to quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigs which was what I've been doing for literally years in order to put more into it, but it was easier said than done given these habits were like the backbone of my psyche and well-being unfortunately. 

Anyways as extreme fear was kicking in, I was still DCA each paycheck, paying bills and buying food with food stamps instead of Fiat to help me get through two weeks til next check. Alcohol and Cigs seriously would consume me and several times I was selling my crypto to purchase these two and would feel like shit but would also tell myself to put that fucking money right back in next check to make up for it and more. I kept doing this but goddamn the darkness would really take over sometimes here and there but being an active member on this sub it helped me get through it since I would be on here day in and day out w/o a second though. I truly love this place and like fast forwarding to today I managed to finally hit a new portfolio high for the first time since June 10th and I couldn't have done it w/o you guys cheering me on and supporting me. 

For this final paragraph, I don't care if it doesn't make the front page or not. This isn't for karma, its a post dedicated to those who responded to my comments and truly seemed like they were concerned and cared for my well-being which I honestly never really had that wasn't in a condescending way in my entire life. Special shout out to user u/j-e-s-s-e , u/naji102 , u/milennial-snowflake for being there for me and a couple others. Tonight I was literally binge drinking on the brink of death since I haven't eaten all day but I pm'd Jesse and he like talked me out of it and I ended up pouring that fucking poison down the drain and well here I am writing this post at 11pm on a Friday. Not just Jesse but this community I believe saved my life. I want to be there when BTC hits $100,000.00. I want be here when ETH flips BTC in marketcap, I want to see the VET be listed on Coinbase, I want to see ICP go to $1.00 , I want to be here when the US FED reserve puts BTC on its balance sheet, I want to live and be here when our precious community native cultural tokens Moons hit not $1.00? but $10.00! and sadly I won't live long enough to see ADA have smart contracts cause that aint happening until 2095 (sorry ADA gang). I honestly love you guys with all of my heart and I'll be here to see all of this come to life. I promise.

personalfinance,Single Mom Struggling to Pay off Debt - No Luck with Consolidating Loans,"***UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF POST***
Reddit- Do your thing! 
I need advice. Probably shouldn’t be on the internet, but I’m hoping to get insight from people who have been in my situation. 
I made a bunch of dumb financial decisions in my 20s after having my son. 
7 years later and I’m still paying high interests on two personal loans. The problem is that after all my expenses and debt payments, I’m able to save $200 a month only. 
My two loans currently have a balance of $18,900 and I’ve been sending biweekly payments, and more than minimum. Still… the first loan won’t be done until April of 2024. And the second one won’t be done until May of 2025. 
Because of my debt to income ratio, no lender is willing to work with me and help me consolidate these two loans into one with a 36 month repayment term. 
I’m at a loss here… I don’t have a big enough emergency fund due to only being able to save $200. I have cut many of my expenses already. 

My other option is to pursue a debt relief program through Americor. They have promised repayment in 20 months, with me paying $600 to them (which I currently pay $630 to my two loans) in exchange of my credit taking a hit and paying off the balance faster. 
I’ve tried with many lenders to get these two loans into one, and nothing. 

Pros and Cons of going with this debt relief program?

UPDATE: THANK YOU ALL FOR NOT JUDGING ME AND PROVIDING INSIGHTFUL ADVICE! 
I refinanced the two loans through a local credit union! 17,900 with a 10.89% annual interest rate. Had to run 4 different credit applications, but this one credit union approved me. They were only able to offer me a 60 month term due to my debt to income ratio. But, I will be making biweekly payments and sending an extra $300 every month toward the loan, which means I’ll pay it all off in 2 years and 6 months.  

I truly believe you all sent good vibes my way and the universe worked in our favor. After being denied several times, it all worked out! 

Thank you Reddit!",finance
CryptoCurrency,The year is 2022,"The infrastructure bill has passed. However it's fate is held up by the supreme court case that is about to settle. Crypto friendly states pushback against the feds, and vow not to follow it. This moment highlights a key concept of America, state independance when it comes to governance within their own borders.

&amp;#x200B;

coming back to the present

We are at war gentlemxn make no mistake, but I believe America's system of checks and balances will see us through to the promised land. Crypto friendly states will not bow to such insidiousness. This fiasco will stir people into action which will in turn stir the political stooges to make changes so they still retain legitmacy. In the short term things may look grim but these moments are important for our history overall. Things dont change without a little bit of conflict. Ready up and call your senator!",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Understanding how the US government works in relation to the Infrastructure bill.,"There is a lot of fear and confusion about how the US infrastructure bill that is being voted on tomorrow and I hope to clear up some of this confusion with this post especially because this is a global community and many members may not understand how the US government works. There was a post that touched briefly on this, but I hope to give a more in-depth explanation.

Where are we now? The bill has been proposed with two potential amendments. One that exemptions most cryptocurrencies and the other that exempts mostly just proof of work. 

The senate will vote tomorrow and 60 votes are needed to pass. As Republicans and Democrats both have 50 seats, senators from both parties will be needed to pass the bill. Unfortunately, it does seem like there are enough senators willing to pass the bill.

What happens if they pass it? Is that it?

No, the bill will then go to the House of representatives to be voted on. The House has there own goals and will almost certainly add amendments onto the bill. The bill could also fail to get enough votes in the house. 

What happens if the House passes the bill with amendments?

Then it will go back to the Senate to be voted on. Both Houses of congress must agree on a bill for it to become law.

If both pass the bill is that it?
No, then it must be signed into law by the president. The president can also veto the bill in which two-third majorities in both the House and Senate are needed to override the president. Unfortunately, a veto is unlikely based on what the White House has said.

So after that, is that it? 
Technically, the bill would be law at that point but it still isn't final. Cryptocurrencies entities like Coinbase could sue and potentially have the bill be struck down in the courts. Pro cryptocurrency states like Wyoming and Texas could also sue to have the law overturned.

US states are also more autonomous that people realize. They may simply refuse to enforce the laws in their state or create conflcting laws. This is the how Marijuana is treated in the US currently. The federal government says that it's illegal, but many states have made it legal with their laws.

What if the lawsuits fail? 
The US midterms are coming up in 2022. The entire House of Representatives and one-third of senators seats are up for election along with other positions like governors of states. It could be possible to elect a more pro cryptocurrency congress that would amend or replace this bill. This current bill also won't even go into effect until 2023.

TLDR; tomorrow is far from the end there is much more that we can still do to stop this bill from passing.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Let’s Talk Best &amp; Worse Case Scenario for U.S. Crypto Regulation,"First things first, 
You can find and contact your legislator here https://fiscalnote.com/find-your-legislator

Give them a call, works better than an email. Also, be polite.

Anyway,

Best case: I’m a big believer that we need clear regulations in the crypto space. The current situation with the SEC vs Ripple (and therefor XRP) is a terrible example of what lack of regulatory clarity at a US federal level looks like. For all the XRP haters, if the SEC wins make no mistake, they’re coming for your favourite crypto next. It’s ridiculous that the DoJ and FinCEN have already declared XRP a currency years ago. That the SEC can then come along with their own version of events and cause such damage to the very people they are sworn to protect is ludicrous. I’d hope that the US Congress will finally step up to the plate and create clear regulations for the crypto space which foster innovation, empower cryptos and fintechs with legitimate utility and make it much harder for the pump and dump garbage which saturates the space today. The upshot would be the contraction of the number of cryptos from 6000 odd to perhaps 1000. But the 1000 which remain would be genuine projects, with real teams trying to create blockchain solutions for real problems. This sort of approach would see what some folks refer to as Cambrian explosion, with crypto rapidly fulfilling its potential, rapidly innovating and dominating every industry. I think it’s exceedingly unlikely any of the utility cryptos would be securities, and more likely currencies, utility token or hybrids of those two.

Worst Case: Honestly, if you want to see a worst case scenario, look at it right now and there you have it. Disagreeing and competing US regulatory departments. Individual departments (SEC) littered with senior members with deeply questionable corporate obligations, receiving massive payments from the corporate sector while in public office and applying vague, antiquated rules inequitably to individual cryptos and fintechs. Regulators effectively picking winners and losers, offering zero regulatory clarity for years on end then swooping in and regulating by enforcement, decimating the wealth of investors they are supposed to protect. I think the worst case scenario would be to allow this farce to continue. Obviously there’s a new administration, federally, and with it new chairs of most regulatory departments. It’s too early to tell whether the new teams will be positive or negative for the crypto space, but it doesn’t change the fact that the right thing for the space would be for Congress to do it’s job and regulate it properly to provide clarity and stop cross departmental disparity of regularity.

Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!!

51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML.

54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

91. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event.  The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC.  The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top.  While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees.  We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment.  Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

94. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.  This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry!

CryptoCurrency,We've Already Won,"I wanted to get on here and share my perspective on things. I don't claim to be an expert on anything, but I am probably older than most of you and I have seen what goes on behind closed doors in the halls of power. I just wanted to tell everyone here that crypto has already won. Most probably don't realize that. Many crypto enthusiasts probably don't know that, but there is no stopping this revolution; it is here to stay.

I grew up and witnessed first-hand huge leaps in technology and how quickly they took off. I remember the first time I saw a cell phone. Back then they were big and bulky and people mostly kept them in their cars. They called them car phones. I remember when they got small enough and cheap enough that almost everyone was carrying them in their pocket. There was no internet on them, no texting. Back then your phone had two purposes: telephone calls and snake. That's about it. I remember the first time I learned about the internet. Being from a rural area, no one I knew was talking about it. I heard about the internet from an AOL commercial. They called it the ""worldwide web."" But soon heard other terms for it. Later, I was confused as to whether AOL's worldwide web and the internet were the same thing. I begged my parents for a computer (it was a Pentium 3 with Windows 98) and I remember buying things on eBay used to be a big deal and was considered being on the ""cutting edge"" of technology (lol).

I watched as these things converged and grew. I was one of the first owners of the original iPhone. Before that I owned other tech stuff like palm pilots and other mp3 players. I was called a nerd by my friends. I would have never imagined that my mom and dad, and every person over the age of 60 would one day own an iPhone. The adoption was fast.

I have had the opportunity to meet and get to know many state legislators, state executives, and state and federal judges. I have on more than one occasion met with US representatives and senators and have had lengthy conversations with them. Do you know what I have realized guys? They are all just people, like you and me. It sounds crazy to have to say that, but it seems like it's something we often forget. They do not have any magical insights any more than you or I do. Most of them until recent years have known little to nothing about crypto. But what is more important, they do not have magical powers. To be sure, they can ruin the lives of their constituents, but they cannot change the course of technology.

Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks run on thousands of computers (or nodes) around the world. The infrastructure surrounding these networks is located cross-culturally and in many nations. We are now getting to the point where the infrastructure itself will be decentralized. Think dexs and defi. No one nation, including the United States, or even a majority of nations can wipe out this technology. It will continue to exist and thrive. Nation-states have a choice. They can adopt and foster this technology, or they can be crushed by it and be left in its wake. There is no stoping this wave. And any attempts to crush or snuff it out will only be a detriment to its populace, not cryptocurrencies. The blockchains will keep ticking along. Satoshi Nakamoto's trojan horse has been sprung and the Greeks are soon to flood Troy.",cryptocurrency

bonds,I Bond question on interest,"Hello all, I just recently came across I-bonds and am trying to understand the interest with them. Currently the rate is 3.54%

Hypothetically, If someone were to invest $10,000 in an I-bond, does the 3.54% of interest get added to the value of the bond each month? Meaning $354 is added to principal each MONTH to the bond? Or is $354 added to the bond once every six months?
 
Using the current rate for this calculation. And every six months new rate adjusts based on inflation?

I also read about the 1 year you can’t touch it and then for remaining 4 years you pay a 3 month interest penalty if you cash it in.

Just making sure I understand this. I am assuming my understanding of the interest is not correct, because you would have $2,000 at the end of six months in the example above.

Or is it that the 3.54% is divided by 6 months? Meaning 0.59% is the monthly interest rate.

Thank you all for helping me understand.

Also any good books to understand bonds? I read Bogle’s stuff on index funds which I like. Would like a general, brief thorough understanding on bonds- if that’s possible",finance

BACKGROUND

We know in the modern society, a bank account is a necessity for daily living. However, where economics studied are not focused nor prioritised within the education sector it is very easily overlooked on the importance of understanding how the financial system works and how over the long run, individuals will lose money within a bank account.

Of course I’m not talking about nominal value, $1000 5 years ago will still be nominally $1000 today. However, the real value isn’t the same. This is due to inflation (covered in the next topic post) that slowly eats away at the purchasing power of a currency. Due to the fact interest rates are exponentially lower than inflation, overtime you will lose money just being left in a bank account. This essentially is what encourages individuals to invest to maintain their wealth overtime. However, what does this have to do with fractional reserve banking? 

IN A NUTSHELL HOW BANKS MAKE PROFIT 

Many know that banks profit through lending money to individuals or companies and charging a higher interest. Banks know that money sitting idle within their control is wasteful and will capitalise on this fact to earn a profit. However, there are more ways for the bank to be making money from lending. 

FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING

Essentially when a depositor deposits an amount into their bank, many would presume that deposit is locked away for that customer, and although if you check your account you’ll see that amount of money within your account. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s actually there and here’s why. 

That deposit is essentially lent out through the bank to those looking for a loan. I would actually argue due to lack of economic education, if individuals realised their money may not actually be there in an emergency situation then they would probably question the reliability of the bank with their capital. 

The technique works by essentially taking the deposited money and only keeping a fraction of that deposit and lending out the rest. Banks need to ensure they have a certain amount of liquidity in their reserves to meet the demand for regular withdrawals, but the rest is essentially available for lending. 

If we use an example where Individual A deposits $100 into their bank. As I mentioned the bank only needs to keep a fraction of this. Let’s use an example of requiring 10% reserves. Therefore, only $10 of that initial deposit is required into the reserves, and then other $90 is lent out. In return for depositing money, banks will reward customers via low interest rates for holding capital with them. Hence, as previously mentioned the interest rates being lower than inflation will lead to an individual losing money overtime. When this money is lent out the banks will use higher interests for the borrower, but remember the bank is using money from deposits that morally they should be holding onto, this allows for the banks to gain even more in actual profit. Banks tend to earn interest on their reserves, so there is an incentive for banks to potentially hold more reserves than legally required to gain more profits. 

THE TRUTH ABOUT FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING 

The method is a profitable one for banking institutions and allows money that would otherwise be unused be put to use. This would be in the form of stimulating the economy as it encourages banks to lend money out for lending and spending. Borrowers are able to invest into their own companies for growth and individuals being able to take out mortgages for homes or purchasing vehicles etc. 

This financial system using this method  works well until it doesn’t. It’s built off the bet that the majority of customers will not need to withdraw all their capital at the same time. This leads to the potential of the biggest financial risk to banks via customers which is a bank run where the bank does not have the supply in reserves to meet the demand of withdrawals. Or simply the bank doesn’t have enough money if everyone wanted to take theirs out. A real world example of this is northern rock, 2008 in the UK that collapsed. Banks in crisis will utilise methods such as suspending withdrawals or limit the amount that can be withdrawn at a given time period (Greece has used this a lot in the past). Hence, why there is regulatory protections in place to insure a certain amount for each customer in case of a bank collapsing. 

You want transparency when using a bank and knowing that your money is safe or that their investments are risk managed and not over leveraged. However, with regulatory protection, it can encourage banks to take on riskier investments in the name of gaining more profits which essentially creates bad incentives, especially if the economy is starting to heat up. 

Another hard truth about this method is that it can and does overinflates the economy by adding more supply into the system. Using the previous example of individual A depositing $100, and the bank lending $90 of that deposit and alongside other deposits out to individual B. Individual B puts that money into bank B or individual B buys for example a car from which that company will eventually put that into the bank B. Either way, bank B will repeat the process of keeping a fraction in reserves and lending the rest out. So essentially despite only a certain amount of money being deposited, money out of thin air is being created. The opposite can also happen in an economic crisis where banks may be scared of lending due to risks of not being paid back and defaults and could reduce lending which in turn reduces that money supply so individuals struggle to get capital and can lead towards a credit crunch. 

Now if fractional reserve banking wasn’t used then banks would have to use other methods such as charging higher fees or significantly increase the interest rates on loans and increase the lending requirements and criteria. If you wasn’t given interest on your deposits, you’d be charged for storage. 

Economic education is important, and when a system is designed to favour a specific group of entities, it’s a system that’s unfair and needs improving. This is the entire concept behind why Bitcoin was created in the first place and the necessity of transparent blockchain technology. When you understand the legacy system and you educate yourself on the emerging system, you can see beyond just quick financial gains but rather the need for change and will reinforce your decision to take part in the cryptocurrency journey.

CryptoCurrency,Why Privacy is a Fundamental Requirement for Cryptocurrency to Truly be “Money”,"# Privacy

For most cryptocurrency projects out there, every transaction is fully traceable. Anyone can paste your address in a block explorer, and see the addresses where you received your coins, and the addresses where you sent your coins. Anyone can also see your balance. 

For example when you buy something in a shop, the owner can see how much more coins you've got left in your wallet. Or, if you're a robber, you go to the shop and buy something, immediately you have the receiving address of the shop's cash register, and you can choose to ask for a ""refund"" at gunpoint if there's more in the cash register than it's worth the trouble.

If you're a company, your competitors can track your addresses and see where and when and for how much you purchased your materials, and who bought your products.

Most projects lack any privacy whatsoever and in that regard they’re worse than fiat payments for everyday things through a debit card.

# Fungibility

Fungibility is a bit harder to explain. Fungibility literally means that 1 unit of account isn't equal to any other unit of account. Think of physical art, cars, houses, etc.

A lot of crypto projects aim to be money, and money by definition must be fungible. One gold coin is equal to another gold coin of the same mass and chemical composition. You might say that it's the same with crypto, but transparency of the chain leading to lack of privacy ruins the fungibility. Why? Because every single coin has a history that's forever stored on the blockchain.

Consider this: FBI catches a criminal who used your favorite crypto. His wallet is seized, and all addresses that he stored his coins in are blacklisted. That also means all other addresses which transacted with his own addresses are also suspicious and under investigation. Some even become blacklisted. Exchanges refuse to accept blacklisted coins, so suddenly your candy shop's wallet is effectively blocked from fiat ramps and centralized exchanges because that criminal bought a chocolate 3 months ago, and now you have tainted coins in your wallet.

But you still have to spend your tainted crypto, to pay your workers, to pay suppliers, etc. You think you're innocent, but Binance or Coinbase would still freeze your deposit for months until the feds clear you, because you sent them tainted coins, which once belonged to a convicted murderer. So what that means? Effectively, your coins are now worth less that ""clean"" crypto, because not everyone accepts these coins as equal. So unfortunately it sells at discount.

A real life analogy would be you going to a bank and depositing dollar bills that are stained by blood. Surely the teller would raise the alarm and security would apprehend you for questioning. Or going to a convenience store to buy a beer, and giving the merchant a dollar bill covered in mayonnaise. Would they accept your tainted bill? Surely not. Now your mayo dollar is worth less because it's different from other dollars.

The opposite also applies: super-clean coins sell at premium. ""Virgin Bitcoins"" are a real thing--these are the coins which have never moved once they were mined, so they have no history. To buy these virgin BTCs you have to pay more than for ""ordinary"" BTC on an exchange. Real life analogy would be walking to FED building and getting brand new freshly printed dollar bills, which have neither blood, mayo, or traces of cocaine on them.

Hope this is helpful to people and paints a picture as to the true importance of privacy and fungibility. This is totally not a Monero shill post.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Child tax credit to stop offsetting taxes paid at tax filing?,"The child tax credit used to be claimed at the time of tax filing, where the credit would offset the taxes due.

If I understand correctly, the child tax credit is now being paid monthly, and therefore does that mean that it no longer offsets taxes paid at tax filing? Half of the total child tax credit amount can be claimed next year, since the payments started halfway through the year.

However, does this mean in future years $0 can be claimed at tax filing, supposing that the monthly credit is paid each month, including the first half of the year?

For example, if your child tax credit is $6000, and your federal taxes to be paid at tax filing is $4000, then how the CTC has been working, you would have received a $2000 refund, but in future years, you'd instead pay the $4000 at filing?

Bitcoin,I posted in late May about taking my excess cash from my business and buying BTC. I started to dca every week for 2.5 months. Here’s how it’s working. Spammers don’t waste your time.,"I started out when BTC entered the upper 30’s and felt good I hadn’t started doing this in April. Instead of dollar cost averaging a set dollar amount I averaged buying .08 Bitcoin per week.(I know talking specifics is dangerous but I wanted other business owners to see the power of investing in BTC). I have accumulated .81 BTC in just under 3 months for $28,000. Today that investment sits at $36,000. Regardless of the current price, letting my money sit in a bank account was no longer an option. And luckily my partner agreed.

personalfinance,Next (wise) Move for Myself,"The frequenters of this subreddit seem pretty wise so I figured I would venture for some advice on my  situation. A few of my earlier career paths did not work out for a multitude of reasons that were mainly outside of my control, very long story(s), it's an ongoing joke among friends/family how notoriously bad my ""luck"" is. However, fast forward and I am 30, almost 31 working a decent job, federal, 65k/yr, but not great considering my area (NYC). Managed to accrue a decent savings +/- 80k and was planning on buying a multifamily to live in to get my ""own place."" I currently stay in my fathers old apt since he moved down south, however, he still comes up and stays with me a few months out the year with his wife, at least 3-4, which makes me feel like a kid again although we get along just fine most of the time and I pay almost nothing for rent. 

However, of course the housing market takes a shit and everything skyrockets throwing a wrench in my plans to say the least. I am considering a career change into healthcare that I should be able to pursue while working, but I am also not sure I want to stay in NY forever b/c of the weather, HCOL and overall burnout, nor am I sure when I leave I would not want to come back, since I grew up here and have most family and all friends here. Therefore my current plan is to buy a small place to rent out in NY since if/when I come back houses will likely be even more unaffordable, while also getting a place down south near my fathers' place, which are much better for the money as you can imagine. I just started using retirement accounts so I only have about 10k invested, but plan on dumping entire paychecks in to play catch up.

personalfinance,Credit card debt- is upstart a safe plan? Should I open another card?,"So I’m pretty clueless when it comes to the benefits of credit and overall personal finance outside of basic budgeting. I have one credit card with a limit of $8k with an APR of $16.99. I’m currently looking at around $6k in debt for that card. I don’t make much ($36k at a non profit in a not cheap city). 

My other debts would be my student loans, which are pretty tame considering I have a small federal loan and a large informal family loan without any interest, and at some point my car lease when I figure my shit out and can afford the payments (title is still under my dad and he makes the payments, when I feel financially stable enough I’ll take over the payments and I’ll pay the rest back to him over time after the car itself it paid off). 

I’ve been really stressed lately with how little wiggle room I have with my one card at the moment, but I’m really not sure what the best course of action would be. I really like the simplicity of having just one credit card, but I know most people have multiple (I honestly don’t understand why?). I’ve been seeing upstart ads all over YouTube videos and in podcasts, and I’ve read here and there that it’s primarily meant for credit card debt, but I definitely want to understand it more before applying. 

I feel like my situation is kind of unique- largely thanks to the kindness of my parents and how willing they are to help me out while I’m still just starting my career. But because of that researching this myself has been difficult. 

Thank you all in advance!!!


Edit: just to clarify- my biggest question is what is the best way for me to handle the credit card debt as fast as possible while avoiding crazy amounts of interest. I know that should be my #1 priority, I’m just not sure how to go about it. I’ve also heard folks recommend balance transfers (as opposed to personal loans like through upstart), but again I’m not sure if that’ll help or just dig me in deeper.",finance
personalfinance,Index Fund vs Car Payment,"Hey there, I’ve skimmed through a lot of the wiki material and wasn’t sure if I found a clear answer to my current situation. I’m fairly new to the finance world so I’m sorry if this is a dumb question.

I’m late 20s and have a 30k car loan with an  interest rate of 2.45%. Given that the interest rate is low, would it be more wise to spend extra income investing in index funds with 5-7% returns or just pay off the loan?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why to SERIOUSLY Consider Securing your BTC with Hardware Wallet! BTC to $1mil!,"The governments of the world, particularly the US, can print an unlimited supply. In 2020 the US federal reserve literally printed over 20% of the circulating supply of USD.

That being said.. what happens when the US government starts buying BTC? (if, or have they already? Idk) they can print whatever they want to buy a truly scarce asset (BTC capped at 21mil coins).

personalfinance,Quitting a nightmare job without your next one lined up?,"College-aged student so I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, just don't have anyone I trust to ask for good advice. Thank you so much for reading!

Alright, here's some context. I started working as a pharmacy technician about six months ago. Initially I was psyched-- I'm always super positive, optimistic, and generally happy to work in healthcare. I thrived in an understaffed homeless shelter at the start of a pandemic before this job, so I'm certain this isn't just an ""all jobs suck"" thing.

Only problem is, this job is miserable. The company actively does not invest in its employees. I make $17/hour when the average for this role in my part of California is $20/hour. Patients have screamed in my face and threatened me while my manager pretended to ignore it in the background. We have 3 people working a job site that fills 4000+ prescriptions weekly, which would need 6-8 people to be done effectively, which means most of my workday is fielding insults while I tell someone their medication isn't ready. I'm reprimanded for taking even ONE of my legally-alotted 15 minute breaks. I'm running from place to place constantly and my manager still has a half dozen things to tell me I'm not doing enough of. We lose 1 employee approximately every 6 weeks at most. I feel like I've physically aged from this job.

I went on a Leave of Absence about a month ago because I couldn't handle it anymore. My mental health was deteriorating rapidly. I started thinking about suicide on an at-least-weekly basis. I had lost my apartment down near my job site some months ago (it was sold), so I have had to move back in with my abusive parents 60 miles north. This means an 8 hour workday becomes a 10-11 hour work day: one and a half hour commute there, work for eight hours, one and a half hour commute back.

Only problem is, I'm also looking to move out of here ASAP. I've been living here for 6 months and it's a little unbearable.

I have 95% of two bachelors with just one semester left until I'm done. I'm a pre-med student. And places are desperate for candidates right now, right? I've seen at least one caseworking job offering a sign-on bonus for new hires. How bad is it for me to just....quit? Should I keep working? Should I bite the bullet and work 2 more weeks?

Key info:

 - I live with my parents and have no bills currently except therapy, medications, and a psychiatrist.

 - I have $4500 to my name.

 - I'm currently looking at rooms to move back south. The highest I would accept is $1100 total WITH utilities, which would have around a $1100 deposit. Assuming my total bills are $1700 (lots of wiggle room) + deposit, I could afford 2 months of rent before I absolutely must find a job.

 - Only looking at month-to-month places so I can bail out if needed.

 - My manager is horrific, and I'm not sure if she'd give me a good/decent reference even if I worked another two weeks. She usually insults and targets everyone the last few weeks after they put their notice in.

 - I'm studying for a national certification that would allow me to earn even more money at this job. I take it in a few weeks. I can't study for it if I'm working.

 - It's taken 2-3 weeks for me to become mentally stable again, so I'm terrified of going back.

 - I have a cosigner for a room, but if I don't have a job it might turn people off on me right?

Any responses are helpful!! Thank you! I need to make this decision soon and it's stressing me out so bad.",finance
financialindependence,"You need multiple streams of income, heres how","FYI: Long story ahead

Having one source of income eg. job is risky now. You can easily lose it or be let go, thats why its important to have a diverse set of income streams. 

My story:

So when covid hit in 2020, the business i work at, i saw a lot of people lose their jobs around me. And where i work, my boss was hiring so i had to go through a lot of resumes to pick out candidates. I saw people come into the office to be interviewed who seemed desperate for work. I remember a migrant from the Middle East who was looking for work for his family but it was difficult since he wasn't a citizen in my country. It was very sad and depressing to see people who were begging for a job because they didn't know how to pay the bills and had no other safety net or income source. 

Thats when I realized that have one source of income was risky because you could easily lose it. And that is what started my journey of building multiple streams of income. I knew that if i were to lose my job, i would have another stream of income coming in, if i needed. That i wasn't going to the streets or end up starving. I also knew that i didnt want to work a second job, because i've tried that before, and that crap is very exhausting and tiring cause you have no time or freedom. So i know that how i wanted to make money was online, that was going to be another source of income for me. But i didn't expect how difficult it was going to be.

I tried starting an online low content book, publishing business via KDP on Amazon but it failed, granted i didnt work on it for so long. I realized that the market i entered as over saturated and too competitive, it was difficult to find customers and give value because i didnt know how to sell or market. I know how to create the product but i didnt market it well. I also realised that i didnt actually enjoy doing it, while i liked graphic design of the book covers and interior, i knew that i wasn't going to be doing this in 5+ yrs.

Then I started writing online as an outlet for creative expression. I wrote blog posts and articles about my thoughts and opinions but then changed to writing things that gave value and practical advice to the readers. After around a year of my on and off writing posts, I use to be earning cents, now i earn dollars. Yet, I'm still trying to be consistent with it. Then I started freelance writing, created a website (something which i thought i could never do) and am in the process of finding clients (which is also damn hard). I also stared a youtube channel have put that on hold to focus more on freelance writing. I also got into investing in both growth and more so dividend investing after tons of research and reading books. The plan is to get my dividend income to a point where it surpasses my living expenses, then I'll financially free/independent. However, that will take lots of time. 

My other goal is for my lifestyle. I realized that i may not want to work full time 9 to 5 because i have to to pay bills. I want to work part time doing my job and then on the days that i'm not working do freelance writing or work on a side business/hustle or do creative work. Basically, i'm aiming for Barista fire atm. atm my income streams dont give me a lot of money but will be growing soon. 

There is honestly, so many lessons that i have learned in these past 2 yrs of trying to make meony online and create multiple income streams that this post would be a novel lol. But i'm going to keep it short.

1) Think long term into the future like 5+ yrs long term. what is your ideal week? how would you want to live your life? figure that out and then work backwards to reach your goal. this will be a process not an event. do you want financial freedom, choice and independence like me or not? don't follow the status quo/ societal script of school, work, marriage, job, house, kids, retire if you dont want that. everyone is different and this conventionality is becoming outdated in today's uncertain climate, particularly with the economy and inflation. 

2) Don't chase money, GIVE VALUE to people. but also know that the reason why most people want money is because it gives you a certain lifestyle. For me i want that lifestyle, to be freedom and flexibility to work wherever i want eg., travelling, to set my own hours but also work with people if i choose to. Ultimately, money gives you a choice to choose how you want to live. Money will give you a lifestyle of either luxury material possessions or freedom and choice. You choose.,

3) Understand how money works and the economy, investing and inflation. Our economic system is literally a mess. Learn to invest, particularly dividend investing that gives you an income stream because growth investing for wealth creation is not guaranteed. The market will crash one day. 

4) Starting a side hustle is hard, so make sure that it is mobile eg. online business. make sure that you love what you do and your interested in learning more. that you could do this for 5+ yrs. because making money online and starting a side hustle is a process, a journey that will stretch your limits and challenge you.  You will do things that you never thought you could do. It will be hard but preserve, that is why your goal aka your 'why' is so important.

5) All the ways to make money online work, they do, its you who needs to do the work. Google ways to make money online, they all work but they need a lot of effort and bloody hard work. Emphasis on you need to work for it. develop good habits, use your time wisely (remember you will die one day, so do what you love), create SMART goals and commit to them. 

6) Be patient and preserve, even if it doesn't work out the lessons and the character building it does for you is priceless. 

Some ways to make multiple streams of income

\- dividend investing 

\- freelancing a skill (if you dont have one, learn it eg., udmey is a good online course site for free, the internet is a wealth of knowledge

\- high interest rate saving account 

\- P2P lending - havent tried this but heard rates a good, you will need to research this 

\- create a website that meets a market need 

\- create an online business that meets a market need and gives VALUE 

\- look into the future trends that are coming, and look for opportunities to create a business from it (there are always new opportunities, you just need to be on the look out)

MOST IMPORTANTLY, this all comes down to your mindset, have a growth mindset that is open to learning and change. Fix your mindset first and improve yourself, get into personal growth first. But also enjoy your life, have fun along the way, dont work yourself, enjoy time with family and friends, trust that God will provide for you, there are much more important things than money, enjoy your life, look after your health, you only have one.

CryptoCurrency,Inflation isn't transitory. It's permanent.,"JPow was getting on TV for months and repeating the ""transitory"" adjective to describe inflation. Most recently, he had to clarify what he meant. He never meant that prices would go back to where they were after a while. Oh no. He meant that after prices rise 5-10% over the next months to years, we can all get used to the new normal.

After rising 10%, Jerome promises that inflation will go back to a 'reasonable' 2%. So what costs $100 will cost $110 and then continue increasing by \~$2 a year.

This is theft. JPow, leader of the Federal Reserve, is stealing from your Grandma on a fixed income to hand to his buddies at Goldman and Boeing/Raytheon. Your Grandad that was promised $1000 in social security now can now afford a little less food.

Guess what else? Let's assume that your salary keeps pace with inflation (it doesn't). So food costs 20% more and you make 20% more. Sound OK? Well congrats: you're in a new tax bracket. That extra 20% salary is getting killed at your highest marginal tax rate. Fiat is a trap.

This is what sold me on crypto. I started moving some of my gold buys into crypto long before I knew what a UTXO was. There is only 21 million, and the Fed can't rob us of our BTC without people knowing about it. No stealth inflation tax. 

It doesn't matter why you're in crypto. You are helping do something important: freeing the people from their well-respected oppressors. Be proud of yourselves. This isn't sending thoughts and prayers on Twitter or pressing a GD like button on Facebook. You're putting your money (and thus a portion of your life) on the line.

CryptoCurrency,SEC Charges Decentralized Finance Lender and Top Executives for Raising $30 Million Through Fraudulent Offerings,"**Case Is Agency’s First Involving Securities Using DeFi Technology**

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2021-145

Washington D.C., Aug. 6, 2021 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Florida men and their Cayman Islands company for unregistered sales of more than $30 million of securities using smart contracts and so-called “decentralized finance” (DeFi) technology, and for misleading investors concerning the operations and profitability of their business DeFi Money Market.   

According to the SEC’s order, Gregory Keough, Derek Acree, and their company Blockchain Credit Partners offered and sold securities in unregistered offerings through DeFi Money Market from February 2020 to February 2021. The order finds that they used smart contracts to sell two types of digital tokens: mTokens that could be purchased using specified digital assets and that paid 6.25 percent interest, and DMG “governance tokens” that purportedly gave holders certain voting rights, a share of excess profits, and the ability to profit from DMG governance token resales in the secondary market.

According to the order, in offering and selling mTokens and DMG governance tokens, the respondents stated that DeFi Money Market could pay the interest and profits because it would use investor assets to buy “real world” assets that generated income, like car loans.  However, the order finds that after publicly unveiling DMM, the respondents realized that DeFi Money Market could not operate as promised because the price volatility of the digital assets used to purchase the tokens created risk that the income generated through income-generating assets would be insufficient to cover appreciation of investors’ principal.  The order finds that rather than notifying investors of this roadblock, the respondents misrepresented how the company was operating, including by falsely claiming that DeFi Money Market had bought car loans that they displayed on DeFi Money Market’s website.  While the respondents controlled another company that owned car loans, DeFi Money Market never acquired an ownership interest in any of those loans. Instead, the order finds that the respondents used personal funds and funds from the other company they controlled to make principal and interest payments for mToken redemptions. 

“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws – no matter what technologies are used to offer and sell those securities,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “This allows investors to make informed decisions and prevents issuers from misleading the public about business operations.”

“The federal securities laws apply with equal force to age-old frauds wrapped in today’s latest technology,” said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. “Here, the labeling of the offering as decentralized and the securities as governance tokens did not hinder us from ensuring that DeFi Money Market was immediately shut down and that investors were paid back.”

The SEC’s order finds that the mTokens were notes and were also offered and sold as investment contracts, the DMG governance tokens were offered and sold as investment contracts, and the respondents violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by conducting unregistered offers and sales of both types of digital assets. The SEC’s order also finds that Respondents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC’s order, respondents consented to a cease-and-desist order that includes disgorgement totaling $12,849,354 and penalties of $125,000 each for Keough and Acree. In addition, prior to the issuance of this order, the respondents funded the smart contracts so that mToken holders could redeem their mTokens and receive all principal and interest owed.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Brent Mitchell, Stephanie Reinhart, and Gregory Smolar and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Ana Petrovic of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit with assistance from trial counsel Kristin Murnahan and the Enforcement Division’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics.

This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC.

92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top.  While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees.  We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment.  Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

Because Crypto is important and worth fighting for.","Earlier in the day, The Senate removed the Filibuster that held up the infrastructure plan, and moved in procedure to pass the $1 Trillion spending bill. However after all of the infrastructure bill procedure roadblocks were removed, it is now just the crypto amendments that are holding up this bill.

This is a really big week for crypto, not because the law is being decided, but because several Senators of the United States of America are now deliberating at the highest level about our magic internet bux economy. 

Words like proof of work, proof of stake, mining, staking, wallets etc have become part of US Government text. Irrespective of the outcome of these deliberations, it is clear that crypto is here to stay and it will be there to fight its battle. 

It is insanely positive to see several Federal Senators like Cynthia Lummis, Pat Toomey, Ron Wyden (who is also the  Chair of The United States Senate Committee on Finance) fight for positive crypto regulations. A big shout out to Lummis especially, as she has understood exactly what crypto is all about and her talk on crypto actually inspired confidence about the crypto markets's direction and the future of decentralisation. 

Outside the Senate, many big names have rallied around crypto, including businessmen, sportsmen, actors etc. Coinbase, Fidelity, Square, Twitter, Ashton Kutcher etc have supported the Wyden Amendment and called for positive regulations. These are people who contribute to the economy and have a right to participate in the US economic system of free enterprise.

CryptoCurrency,The American government has been playing the cryptocurrency game for longer than people realize. The infrastructure bill is just another play.,"There is soo much more to crypto than people realize, the flow of new people in this sub has greatly watered down the veteran content and lowered average post complexity, this sub used to resemble a conspiracy theory sub in the earlier days. 

Here’s my theory. Countries know crypto is inevitable and are playing a long and strategic game to have as much control as possible in the crypto future. 

The biggest play the US has made that I can think of is the Coinbase listing. Having an American crypto giant step means having some control over markets and even more important was slowing down Binance from getting market share in the US. 

The infrastructure bill is a play to add friction to the crypto purchasing process for retail investors to slow down adoption. Inflation is looming in the US economy and crypto is an obvious and exciting hedge for the average joe. However if everyone starts selling their dollars for crypto USD purchasing power will fall even more adding fuel to the fire.

Adding to this and the greater incentive for americas move to slow down crypto adoption is the effect inflation would have on the USD as the global reserve currency. Decentralized and secure crypto is an obvious replacement and inevitable in the long run. However today more US dollars are held by non Americans than by Americans, the US dollar is the currency of countries like Ecuador and the US stock market a store of value for wealthy people across the globe. (Which in turn leads to the absurd valuations of todays stock market.) All of this means that the printing of dollars by the Fed is a tax on non-Americans.

The US’s hold on global Hegemony is the weakest its been in decades, crypto is a catalyst for change and has way more potential impact than people realize. Mass adoption is faaar from here. Crypto is inevitable.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The road to mass adoption is paved with dynamite - Cryptocurrency has been regulated in the US since 2013,"###The revolutionary nature of the technology is a major reason why it cannot be easily fit into any existing legal frameworks. 

Each cryptocurrency has unique features, which present unique challenges for regulators. 

One of the chief legal difficulties with regulating cryptocurrencies is that they are incorporeal in nature. The intangible aspect of virtual currencies presents challenges for due process and comity jurisprudence. 

If cryptocurrencies are assumed to be stored on physical servers throughout the world, and if courts are able to pinpoint bitcoins to a specific physical location, then existing rules of civil procedure are applicable. However, the distributed data structure of blockchain technology makes pinpointing a specific location of any specific piece of data impossible. 

Furthermore, there is no such thing as a “bitcoin.” Even digitally, bitcoins do not exist as fungible coins with unique attributes and tracking numbers. Instead,
each“bitcoin represents a sequence of signatures made by cryptographic private keys controlled by bitcoin users. 

###A brief summary of federal regulations already in place

The pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency enables cross-border transactions to bypass Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation. 

The ability to track every transaction without the ability to track who sent the transaction will change the relationship between the citizen and the state. The ability to hide wealth from the government can critically challenge existing governance models. 

###Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

- The CFTC states that American retail investors can buy leveraged or margined derivative products on a regulated exchange but not outside of an exchange. Exceptions only apply to foreign exchange (forex) derivative products. The CTFC announced that Bitcoin and virtual currencies are not foreign currencies 

###Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN)

- At the federal level, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been very active in regulating virtual currencies. FinCen has released several administrative rulings on virtual currency cases online. In general, any firm that transfers funds from one person to another typically requires a money transmitter license.
- In 2013, FinCEN announced that the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) applies to consumers and businesses engaged in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This opinion means that exchangers and administrators of cryptocurrencies are expected to register with FinCEN as a Money Service Business (MSB) and that any firm working with cryptocurrencies are expected to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations.
- Exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini that receive large sums of money from users in suspicious patterns are expected to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on customer transactions that are over $2,000. 

###Department of Justice (DOJ)

- Although, the inner-workings of the Homeland Security's virtual currency task force are confidential, In an affidavit by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in March of 2015, an undercover agent of the Homeland Security Investigations team averred, “I [Matthew Larsen] am part of a digital currency task force focused on identifying the use of digital currency to launder the proceeds of criminal activity. As part of this task force, I have been involved in several investigations into unlicensed digital currency exchangers and narcotics distributors on the dark web who use digital currency to receive payment for the sale of narcotics. These investigations have brought my attention to numerous individuals who have been cycling through large amounts of Bitcoin.”
- The largest and most famous bitcoin related court case arose from the Department of Justice's prosecution of Ross Ulbricht, an operator of an online drug trafficking website called the Silk Road. The DOJ seized 600,000 Bitcoins from Silk Road's wallet, and subsequently, auctioned them off. Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to three life sentences in jail. 

###Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)

- Began investigating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as early as January 2014. First, the agency investigated two gambling sites, SatoshiDice and FeedZeBirds. The SEC suspected that bitcoin-denominated securities were being offered on these sites. Specifically, the SEC stated that unregistered stock exchanges were illegal even if they were only issuing bitcoin-denominated securities.
- On March 29, 2017, the SEC found that bitcoin markets are unregulated, which does not allow for investment vehicles with underlying bitcoin assets to be listed on any exchange.

###Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

- Gains from virtual currency investments are subject to the capital gains tax. Establishing that general tax principles that apply to regular property transaction also apply to virtual currency transactions.
- In 2014, the IRS issued a guidance document, IR-2014-36 that states, “an individual who ‘mines' virtual currency as a trade or business is subject to self-employment tax.
- the Department of Justice (DOJ) is also helping the IRS track down cryptocurrency users that do not pay income on cryptocurrency gains. 

###Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

- Regarding a case of a company misrepresenting the sales of mining equipment the FTC made this statement “Even in the fast-moving world of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, companies can't deceive people about their products .... These settlements will prevent the defendants from misleading consumers.”

###Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)

- In July 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has made clear that American national banks can custody crypto assets, provide crypto-fiat exchange, settlement and tax auditing services, amongst other crypto activities.

###Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
- Because the United States Dollar (USD) is currently the reserve currency of the world, its use is ubiquitous across traditional financial markets and the majority of economies. Therefore, most obliged entities – cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians etc – need to closely monitor the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) Sanctions List to legally cater to United States citizens or business interests to comply with USA cryptocurrency regulations. 

###Further regulation is inevitable. 

###The question remains and is ongoing - will the ideas of openness and freedom get warped by centralized powers to create surveillance money who demand absolute control? 

###TL;DR
- Buying, selling and owning crypto is legal
- Various cryptocurrency activities are regulated by different US agencies
- Cryptocurrency is defined differently by the various USA regulatory agencies
- The Bank Secrecy Act is the primary USA AML/CFT regulation
- National banks can custody crypto assets and run blockchain nodes
- Exchanges are classed as Money Services Businesses (MSB)

Disclaimer: This is not legal or financial advice. Always DYOR

EDIT - So many people seem to think any regulation at all is a terrible thing. I think this is unrealistic and those of us that live in less regulated countries are not so optimistic that zero regulations would be so great. Others are arguing for well thought out and workable regulations, created by working with the crypto community, which I think is much more realistic and preferable going forward.

stocks,US Treasury yields rebound after weak 20-year bond auction,"Yields on U.S. Treasuries rebounded for a second day on Wednesday, with a sale of 20-year authorities debt on the weak facet, as fears of latest COVID-19 lockdowns eased and a rally in fairness markets pointed to a sturdy financial restoration.

The Treasury bought $24 billion of 20-year bonds to yield 1.890%, which was a couple of full foundation level increased than the yield on the bidding deadline and a bit weak, stated Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Buying and selling.

The bid cowl at 2.33 to 1 was barely lower than common, he stated. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 7.9 foundation factors to 1.288%, after briefly crossing above 1.3%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7.8 foundation factors to 1.947%.

Buyers are grappling with when the Federal Reserve will start to take away, or “taper,” its assist for the U.S. economic system and whether or not a current hike in inflation is transitory, because the Fed initiatives, or might be persistent as many available in the market consider.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury plunged nearly 30 foundation factors from July 13, when information confirmed the most important soar of U.S. client costs in 13 years in June, to a low of 1.128% early on Tuesday.

Yields have rebounded nearly 17 foundation factors since then. Merchants are also ready to see the Congressional Price range Workplace’s newest estimate of when the U.S. authorities can be unable to pay its payments if Congress doesn’t approve a rise within the debt ceiling, at present at $28.5 trillion.

The federal authorities has shut down 3 times prior to now decade over debt restrict haggling in Congress.

“The primary occasion right now is the CBO report on the debt restrict,” stated Nancy Davis, managing companion and chief funding officer at Quadratic Capital Administration LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.

“A few of the 10-year transfer is forward of that occasion.” A carefully watched a part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the hole between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of financial expectations, was at 108.5 foundation factors.

The 2-year U.S. Treasury yield, which generally strikes in line with rate of interest expectations, was up 0.8 foundation factors at 0.202%.

The breakeven fee on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was final at 2.482%. The ten-year TIPS breakeven fee was final at 2.299%, indicating the market sees inflation averaging about 2.3% a 12 months for the subsequent decade.",finance

defi,Help extrapolating daily/weekly/monthly returns using the APY figure?,"I'm currently making a spreadsheet to work out theoretically how much I'd have each month based off of the APY figure and I'm having a hard time. 

Simply my questions is: what are monthly earnings on X amount deposited at Y amount stated APY? 

At first I thought it was simple, say I have $100 and deposit it somewhere that's giving a fixed 20% APY guaranteed. Obviously at the end of the year I'd have earned $20 and will now have $120.

But APY includes compounding, correct? So if I wanted to know how much interest is earned after say, 2 months, it's not as simple as dividing that $20 by 12 and multiply by 2 is it? 

While googling, the answer is: it's easy! Just APY= (1+r/n)^n-1 where r is the interest rate and n is the number of compounding periods in a year. 

But that's where I'm stuck, I don't know the real interest rate because only the APY is shown to us, and I don't know the number of compounding intervals in DeFi, it seems like a constant stream rather than daily or monthly payments.

I guess I need to just reverse the formula, I can derive the APY from the interest rate easily, but I wish to derive the interest rate from the APY

Is it compounded per day? Or even per block?

financialindependence,"Never Payoff Your ""Forever"" Home","Wouldn't it be financially optimal to never payoff your house, as long as you can lock-in a 30 year interest rate that is below nominal market returns?   

**Updates:**    
1. One of the biggest pitfalls I failed to include on the original post is the impact of mortgage payments on ACA subsidies and the impact on FAFSA for student aid qualification.  Specifically, many people who FIRE plan to minimize their taxable income using a combination of Roth conversions and taxable account funds to stay just above federal poverty limit to maximize those healthcare subsidies.  If you add a mortgage payment into the equation, you may have to take additional distributions, forcing you into both higher marginal tax rates and jeopardizing ACA subsidies.  Additionally, if you use this strategy to increase your taxable brokerage accounts, you may be penalized in FAFSA space for student aid when the time comes.  Some users pointed out that your primary residence equity is a great way to shield wealth from those aid litmus tests.  
2. For those not in favor of this strategy, the overwhelming basis was related to Pitfall #1 (peace of mind).  Understandably, some folks didn't want to carry such a large financial liability with them during the time they are supposed to be most relaxed.  
3. There was some good dialogue about setting up a revocable and irrevocable trust.  There was a discussion about both protecting your home from lawsuits and a potential workaround to item #1 (having the trust manage mortgage payments) to avoid the ACA issue.  Dig into the comments if you want the specifics, as I am pretty weak when it comes to estate planning.  
4. Overall, thanks for the great dialogue!   

**Proposal:** Enter a 30 year fixed mortgage at current rates (sub-3%) with a 20% down payment.  Lock in your housing costs for 30 years with low interest.  Pay the minimum payment monthly.  When you reach some pre-defined amount of equity (let's say 50%), you perform a cash-out refinance down to minimum equity to avoid PMI (20%).  You want to time the cash-out refinance properly because they have a cost (several thousand) so you don't want to do this too often.   You invest the equity pulled out back in the market, your own business, real estate, etc.  Clearly the strategy is predicated on interest rates staying low relative to market returns, which is true the last few decades but there is no guarantee based on historical numbers.     

**Benefits:**  
1. The equity in your home can generate a much higher ROI in the capital markets.  
2. If you itemize tax deductions, you can write-off the interest.  
3. If you run your own business that takes place in your home, you can write-off home office expenses.  The write-off will be more substantial if the home is not paid off.   

**Pitfalls:**  
1. There is an ""intangible"" benefit of having the home paid off.  Most people assume no mortgage payment during FIRE to reduce their monthly expenses.  The work-around is that your FIRE number will need to be higher to account for the mortgage, but you will reach that number sooner as you don't need to assume a paid off home.   
2. Need to be crisp in estate planning, as if you run this plan to ""the end"" you want to ensure it is clear in your ~~living~~ will how the mortgage liability will be settled.   
3. You actually need to use the capital that would pay off the home in an asset that will generate more than your interest rate!  No free lunch.  
4. Perhaps this exacerbates your sequence of returns risk more?  Since your annual expenses will be higher with the mortgage, your nest egg will be more vulnerable to a large market drawdown.  You will still need to make withdrawals for your mortgage payment, which could be problematic.   


**Background:** Lately I've been thinking of doing a cash-out refinance with rates so low because I paid way ahead on my mortgage and in hindsight I could use that extra capital in my personal business to generate a higher ROI and actually accelerate path to FIRE.",finance

Igor and Grichka Yourievitch Bogdanoff are French twin brothers who are TV presenters, producers, and scientific essayists. The two have been involved in a number of controversies, most notably the Bogdanov affair, however, their personalities, family origins, and physical appearances are often more than enough fodder for Internet forums. 

In December 2016, 4chan users ironically suggested the twins had an immense influence on French politics, and thus a meme was born.

During an unscheduled maintenance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the Binance CEO, tweeted out to users stating:

&gt;Funds are safe

After this, the phrase “Funds are safe” became regularly used by CZ to ensure users were aware that their funds were, in fact, safe.

Later, on May 19, 2018, a content creator named “Bizonacci” uploaded a video, titled “Funds Are Safu” on youtube. The video quickly spread and became a viral meme. The phrase “Funds are safe” was no longer used, and instead, the community began using the phrase “Funds are safu”

Originally an unintentional misspelling of the word ""hold"" in a Bitcoin Talk Forums post, “hodl” has become a common phrase in the crypto community. Hodl means to remain invested in crypto and not sell, especially in light of plunging prices. Following the term's popular use, the backronym ""hold on for dear life"" was adopted.

&amp;#x200B;

**THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN**

Originally, “this is good for Bitcoin,” was a common phrase in **r/ bitcoin** in response to news related to Bitcoin’s development. Once the phrase became overused, it took on a more ironic meaning, applied to negative issues whether they were related to Bitcoin or not.

Bitcoin,"Why the banksters are right, and wrong, to attack Bitcoin in the Infrastructure Bill","1. This bill is about ""infrastructure"" as much as The Federal Reserve is a part of the federal government.  That Bitcoin is so involved that a ""Infrastructure Bill"" stops the bill proves that the Infrastructure is not what this is all about.
2. Remember the last stimulus package?  Less than 10% of that money actually went to helping Americans.  Don't ask where the rest of the funding went. You don't wanna know.....
3. If I am a central bankster, and I have lobbyist buying off and blackmailing Washington, I would take shots at Bitcoin every chance I get, because I'm selfish,  I can't stand competition, or freedom of choice, and I'm afraid of losing my power over the masses.  Bitcoin decentralizes economic power, and the world is starting to figure this is a better way forward, slowly, but surely.

What attacking American miners and developers would do is it would take the technological base out of the US, and the laws that protect them.  The rule of law in the US are far better than most countries, and Bitcoin becoming a true American power source could be the death knell for my totally corrupt, destructive and anti-American system.

China moves Bitcoin out because they don't want competition for their digital yuan.  The same GLOBAL group that moved them out of China is working to move Bitcoin's power sources out of the US.  This is not a coincidence that China just moved Bitcoin out, so the infrastructure moves to the US, and the banksters are right on top of them almost immediately.  This attack is global, and coordinated.  it is not national.

IMO, the real plan is to push Bitcoin to smaller and weaker nations, who can be more easily controlled by economic sanctions, the military industrial complex, and general government corruption, found in every nation.

The best counter to this plan would be to not have miners move, en masse, to just one nation, being centralized in China, or the US.  Decentralization is Bitcoin's strength. Use it!  Moving in a group to one location is just not smart. Spread out!  There's a whole world out there of almost 200 nations.  Be the virus of economic freedom the world needs, and spread out, like a virus. We should have figured out by now that we are not good at stopping viruses. Bitcoin is the virus of global economic freedom.

Maybe set it up so you physically don't have to be in a nation you do not wish to live, but your node/mining rig/operation can be held in a safer foreign land?

financialindependence,"$500k NW at age 34 - annual income never higher than $65k (single, USA)","**objective:** I'm a longtime reader and occasional contributor wanting to share (throwaway account). Sites like this have helped me financially over the years. To help others, I want to share my current situation as an example / motivation. I have nothing against folks who make different choices and follow a different path (i.e. high earners, marriage, parents), but thought you may like to see a different example. Selfishly, I want to learn more and hear any suggestions to optimize my path. I'll try to keep the top sections brief and get more detailed as I go to avoid walls of text. These values are for a single person living in a LCOL city in midwest USA.

**current assets / liabilities:** (rounded to nearest $5k) investments - $290k ($160k in 457 plan \[about 50% Roth\], $65k Roth IRA, $40k taxable brokerage, $25k HSA), home - $200k (paid off, $160k purchase price in 2015 - typically I don't count this extra $40k toward my NW but I thought $500k would make a better thread title than $460k ha! Trulia says it's worth $70k more but that seems absurd to me), cash - $10k

**current monthly budget:** I gross $5,400. My taxes are around $1,090 (federal - $470, social security - $300, state tax - $190, Medicare - $70, health insurance - $50, dental insurance - $25). Saving is around $3,120 (457 plan (Roth) - $1,620, brokerage - $740, Roth IRA - $500, HSA - $260). Spending is around $1,210 (property tax - $225, utilities - $220, sports/hobbies - $155, restaurants - $150, gas / maintenance for car - $100, travel - $85, home insurance - $65, auto insurance - $60, etc) Note that my S/O covers grocery costs (my average spend previously was $300). We don't combine our finances but this (and a $300 monthly cash payment to me) is how she pays for living in the house. So my current savings rate (of gross) is 58%, I'd guess that the average of this since college has been around 50%.  EDIT: the values of saving have been similar since 2009, but shifted from principal payoff to investments around 2015.

**history:** I was very lucky growing up. To give an idea of affluence my father was a public elementary school teacher, my mother stayed at home, and frugality was valued. I did well academically and that resulted in the majority of state college being paid for. My parents contributed too and I graduated with a B.S. degree with a small amount of debt ... I don't recall this exact amount but probably something like $10k (unfortunately I don't have records on exactly how many scholarships I got and how much my parents paid). By working some jobs through college I'd estimate my net worth at graduation was pretty close to zero. After starting my career (2009) I moved back in with my parents and devoted paychecks to saving toward a home with a friend. Once we moved in ($200k purchase), we were focused on paying the mortgage off ASAP. I didn't start really tracking net worth until later so I'm not exactly sure how long it took to pay that off, but we lived together until 2015. Then we moved out (he was getting married) and I used some of the house sale proceeds to get a new place ($160k purchase). Between 2009 and 2015 I got turned onto FIRE and realized how much I probably missed out on by not investing. So the 2015 home didn't get paid off, I started really investing. Fast forward to Covid and I wimped out when I saw the balances dropping. During that summer I decided to pay off the mortgage (to have ""no"" liabilities - except real estate tax). That leads to the current budget you see above. Currently 4% of my $290k investments would be $11.6k annual spending - 77% of my current spending.  Here are annual investment values as of August 1 each year- 2021: $290k, 2020: $170k, 2019: $130k, 2018: $100k, 2017: $60k, 2016: $20k

**career:** I've worked for the same employer since graduation (2009), it's a public organization. Within the org if I sought higher pay I probably couldn't move much higher ($75k-$85k) but I enjoy my current role. It's technical and niche. If I went to a private company I could drastically increase my salary but have never really entertained that idea. Currently I get to problem solve and the results are fulfilling, tangible, and used by nearly everyone in the area. I assume going private would mean more stress/longer hours, more focus on company profit, a decrease in the amount of interesting work, and a decrease in the amount of impact I can have. The organization does offer a pension which I'll be eligible for at age 51 - it will be about half of my highest pay check. So for me the ""FI"" is more important than the ""RE"" although it would be cool to be able to leave prior to 51 if the mood struck - they say you're only one bad boss away from your enjoyable job becoming hell!  I need to research more about ""purchasing service"" and see if our plan offers this.

**suggestions:** I think one thing that makes FIRE ""easy"" for me is a lack of interest in ""keeping up"" - I don't really get tempted by advertisements for new cars / clothes / etc. While I certainly have interests and hobbies I do them for myself; impressing other people has never really mattered to me. The budget above may give the impression that I am very strict, but that's not the case. Those values are just averaged from the last few years of spending records (I love Personal Capital to track this - also cool to see progress) IMO if I were strict with myself on spending it would turn into a chore and be less sustainable. My choice to not have children has surely made it easier financially, but the decision wasn't driven by finances. I've had a few long-term S/O over the years- I suppose getting married would probably help finances a little. My current S/O and I are a good fit - finances are one of the things we communicate well about and we generally agree on avoiding excessive purchases. Of course we each have our own interests - I think it's important to be with someone who understands your loves and doesn't try to force you to change if you're not interested. Maybe my biggest mistake was the lack of early investing. It would be fascinating to know that my NW would be had I never paid an extra cent of principal. I guess growing up I was given the impression that the stock market was to be feared and huge sums of money could evaporate without returning for decades. As I graduated in 2009 it sort of makes sense that I heard those narratives in the news too...but man did it cost me! And in 2020 I suppose I did the same thing, paying off my current homes' mortgage when I could've invested those dollars. I'm sure the ""do or don't pay off your mortgage"" debate will never be settled, and in honesty I do enjoy not having a mortgage ... but I accept that mathematically I am wrong. On the bright side having this much NW in my home makes me feel like I can be more aggressive with equities vs bonds. As far as jobs, it does shock me how many people (especially in these communities) are willing to spend 40 (or more) hours per week doing something they hate. IMO the biggest message of FIRE is that ""value your time, you have a finite amount of it"", so I would never spend significant amounts of it in a place I hated.  Alright I'm afraid this has turned into too much of a wall of text! I don't think there's anything necessarily special about me, but I'd be happy to give thoughts on anything you're curious about.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Monero to 300, bullish breakout likely","Monero Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout to $300 Likely




Monero price has jumped by more than 40% in the past few weeks.

The coin rose above the key resistance at $250 on Thursday.

I explain why it might keep soaring to $300.

The Monero (XMR/USD) price continued its bullish momentum on Friday. The coin jumped to a high of $260, which was the highest level since June 20. It has risen by more than 43% from its lowest level in July, bringing its total market capitalisation to more than $4.6 billion.

Monero bullish trend accelerates

Monero is the biggest privacy-focused cryptocurrency in the world. Its technology is similar to that of Bitcoin, with the only difference being that its transactions cannot be tracked. That’s because the blockchain automatically encrypts all transactions. 


Also, unlike Bitcoin, Monero is widely used globally while Bitcoin is mostly used as an investment. A quick look at most dark websites show that many players in the sector prefer using the coin. At the same time, many cybercriminals prefer using Monero because of the vast security features. With these activities expected to rise, there is a possibility that demand for the coin will keep rising.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Monero price struggled in the past few months. This saw its price decline from a high of $520 to less than $160. This was a 160% decline. In the past few weeks, however, the coin has staged a strong recovery, rising by almost $100.

This price action has happened across the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin has risen from less than $30,000 to more than $40,000. Ethereum, on the other hand, has risen to almost $3,000. In total, the market capitalization of all coins tracked by CoinMarketCap has jumped to more than $1.5 trillion.

The recent recovery is partly because of the rising volume as volatility resumes. It is also because of the rising Covid-19 cases, which has led to fear that the Federal Reserve will maintain its easy-money policies in the near term.

Monero price prediction



The XMR price has been in a strong bullish trend. On Friday, the coin managed to move above the key resistance level at 250, where it struggled to move above several times before. It also rose above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. At the same time, the price remains steady above the 25-day and 50-day exponential moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been on an upward trend.

Therefore, it seems like momentum has returned to the crypto industry. As such, there is a possibility that it will keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $300.",cryptocurrency

I work for the federal government and also contribute 5% to my Roth TSP (for a 5% match), and invest $100/week in ETFs (VOO and VTI using Robinhood for now, plan on moving to Vanguard mutual funds once I meet the minimum $3000). Rent and investments are deducted from my bi-weekly paycheck and, after paying my credit card bill in full each paycheck to cover other expenses, anything left over (usually varies between $100-500) gets put in the house savings account.

This means that $61+ billion (EDIT: $62.3 billion) ""dollars"" invested in the crypto market are fake, ie. $61 (62.3) billion worth of value will evaporate overnight when Tether gets shut down. The US government is hot on the heels of Paulo Ardoino and Stuart Hoegner, principals of the Tether fraud, so it won't be long now before Tether goes tits up. Ardoino and Hoegner stopped printing for a few months, but now they've gone YOLO and are printing again, which is vaguely logical if they're going to jail anyway.

Wall Street traders do NOT generally invest in scams. They only invest in scams like mortgage-backed securities (MBS), credit default swaps (CDS), or precious metals derivatives (paper gold) when  they have inside information. This inside information typically gives them a guarantee that they can sell off their investment to a Greater Fool (MBSes), the price of the scammy asset will be artifically rigged by market makers (PM ETFs) or that the Federal Reserve will bail out their losses (CDSes).

**The US government MUST control the global crypto market, otherwise Dollar hegemony is over, and the US empire cannot halt its slow decline.** Therefore it would behoove USG to take over Tether, perhaps even making it whole with freshly printed FedBux$. If they control Tether supply and accompanying USDT/BTC wash trading, they can move BTC price to whatever they like.

personalfinance,Additional Payments to Remove PMI - Math Sanity Check,"**Disclaimer**: I'm only concerned here about maximizing long term value. I'm assuming servicing the loan is not going to be an issue, and purposefully ignoring any other points that are often raised about taking on more debt than one can handle.

We're currently in the process of purchasing a new home, and I'm going through the math of what makes the most sense over the long term. We're putting 10% down, which means we'll be paying PMI for the first 60 months of the loan (roughly, I know it technically doesn't fall off automatically until LTV hits 78%).

I had just assumed that, over the first several years, allocating some additional money towards our principal made the most sense, since I often see that advice here about PMI. What has always been in the back of my mind, though, when I read those posts is, yes the effective APR over the period during which PMI is being paid may be fairly high, but over the whole life of the loan, given where interest rates are right now, that same money invested should still beat out paying down the principal early.

Specifics about our situation:

* Purchase price of $775000
* 10% down translates to a loan of $697500
* Loan interest rate is 2.99%
* PMI is $87/month

So, for argument's sake let's say we have $500/month to allocate somewhere

**Scenario 1**: Pay an additional $500/month towards the principle, to get PMI to drop off earlier

Pay an additional $500/month towards the principal until LTV hits 20%, after which these additional $500/month payments are ended

* LTV hits 20% by 44 months, translates to $1392 in PMI savings
* Mortgage is paid off \~16 months early, which translates to \~$27,415 in interest savings

**Scenario 2**: Invest $500/month for this same period of time

Invest $500/month invested for the first 44 months of the loan, after which no additional contributions are made

* Assuming a 5-7% interest rate, by 44 months investment of $22000 has grown to \~$24000-$25000 (so, marginal at best)
* Over the remaining 300 months of the loan (360 – (44 + 16)), assuming a 5-7% interest rate, this value will have grown to somewhere between \~$83,500-$143,000, translating to a total of \~$61000-$121000 in investment growth

For fairness, let’s also include the hypothetical of investing the $87 saved each month from month 44 through month 60, at which point the PMI will fall off without additional payments. For simplicity’s sake, I calculated this as what $1600 (about what $87 invested monthly will grow to in 16 months, assuming 7% interest rate) will grow to over 300 months. This comes to a total value of \~$9200, translating to a total of \~$7600 in investment growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

So, in summary, $22000 (500/month \* 44 months) is allocated in one of two ways, producing these results:

**Scenario 1:**

$1400 in PMI savings + $28000 in interest savings + $8000 in investment growth

= \~$37400 in total value beyond contributions

**Scenario 2:**

\~$61000-$121000 (from investment growth) in total value beyond contributions 

What am I missing here? It seems to make no sense to try and pay off more of the loan to get rid of PMI, at least in our situation.",finance
investing,do you think booster vaccine approval will skyrocket or crash the US stock market?,"I heard that trials are going on now and experts are recommending covid vaccine boosters for older people or some people soon. So if we expect some kind of vaccine booster do you think that will skyrocket the stocks or crash the market? or is it priced in?

reasons for skyrocket:

it means that the vaccines still work for the most part and this is the way, instead of shutdowns and job losses and too much social distancing, the vaccine will be free and all we have to do is we export less, but still have enough production.

reasons for crash:

it means that they think the pandemic will go on longer than expected, and much of 3rd world countries still not close to vaccinated, they will have to delay some shipments to those countries. also it can make some people refuse to take the boosters.

reasons it will be priced in:

this is because i think it depends on how urgent they think it is. if they expand approval for 12 yr old and under first i think its just priced in because we know its going to be around that time anyway. also i think most people only care about the fed, the congress, thats why it's priced in.

what do u think is most likely scenario??",finance
personalfinance,"Where should I put extra savings, knowing I'll have future expenses such as grad school within a couple years and a pipe dream to purchase a house in 5-10 years?","28/M. I am a teacher. I make $60k a year and have relatively low expenses. My salary increases by about $3k per year. I usually am able to save $300-1000 per month, but I have to budget some of that for summer. I lived a couple years at home, which allowed me to get ahead on my student loan and put more in retirement/savings. I have some leftover cash, and I'm unsure how to prioritize it based on my future plans. 

I will be getting a Master's in a couple years (recommended in the field of education), and my pipe dream is to buy a house within 5-10 years. I will also have a spouse then to help contribute, but she will be immigrating here in 2 years and I'm not sure what type of employment she will be able to get. Plus, she might need a car and to take some classes as well, which also cost money. This makes me scared to spend away the cash knowing I have future expenses.

**Savings (Total cash): $33k** 

* E-fund: $15k
* Vacation Fund/Remaining Summer Budget: $5k 
* **Total Liquid LEFTOVER:** $13k

**Loans: $20k**

* **Car Loan (just started):** $15k at 2.59% for 48 months ($319/month)
* **Student Loan:** $5k at 3.49% (but due to federal loan payment suspension, I've had no payments and no interest extending until early 2022....so I have been upping contributions towards retirement instead)

**Retirement: $35k -** currently overshooting by putting 28% of salary ($17k/year) into retirement for now (only started Roth IRA 3 years ago and started 403b last year, so a bit of a late start. I will get a pension if I stay a teacher, but I don't want to necessarily depend on that as I get no Social Security)

* **Roth IRA:** $24.5k (maxed at 6k/year for the past 3 years)
* **403b:** $10.5k currently contribute 11k/year ($550 per paycheck)

My question is: what do I do with this leftover $13k cash? My current plan was to put $6k to max my Roth on Jan 1, then just keep saving because I'll have to spend a few thousand on a Master's in a couple years. But would that money be better used to pay more on my car loan (and eventually my student loan once those have to get paid again)? I'm a bit scared to get rid of the cash knowing about all of the future expenses, such as Master's, potentially another car, and eventually a house. But I also know I can vastly reduce my retirement account for a few extra bucks per month. Would love to get some thoughts - thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Is it wrong to go all Roth now if I expect a decent pension?,"I've read a lot of posts on the Roth vs Traditional argument, but how is this decision affected if I expect a decently large pension which will keep me in a higher tax bracket upon retirement?

Employer: California state government  
Age: 35 (working for 10 years and plan to stay until retirement)  
Salary: $95k (22% federal/9.3% state tax brackets)

Pension formula: CalPERS 2% at 55

As a hypothetical, if I retire at age 60 (with 35 years service credit), I will receive a pension of 80.99% of my highest salary. As of right now, besides the potential pension, I've been putting the max into a Vanguard Roth IRA every year since I began with the state.

I want to start saving extra in addition to the Roth IRA, and the state offers a Roth 401k or Traditional 401k (I haven't opened one yet - the state does not do any 401k matching.)  Is it wrong to continue to contribute to the Roth 401k (as opposed to the traditional) with the likely pension?  Given that federal taxes are low now, I was thinking of continuing all Roth until perhaps when the current federal tax rates sunset in 2025 (and I'd probably be in the 28% federal bracket at that point.)

Friend's parents are about to get divorced, have lived paycheck-to-paycheck for 37 years, and the one who is in shock by this does not work a lot at minimum wage and is unsure how to get things in order/what to do moving forward.

A friend's parents are about to get divorced after 37 years of living married paycheck-to-paycheck right out of high school which came about very suddenly 2 days ago after parent B packed a few things, left, and said the next day they plan to file for divorce. Parent B brought in most of the money working a factory job while Parent A is in utter shock and, due to various surgeries over the last few years, works minimum wage about 2 days a week, although prior to now had been debating quitting altogether due to the medical issues.

Parent B seems content to immediately cut all ties with Parent A.  
On Parent A's sole income, they are unable to afford the house they are renting and is also unsure how to go about affording basic necessities.

I am unsure on the details of their finances currently such as if there are individual/joint bank accounts and/or how the coming divorce will tie into any of this as well since this is all new to me. I do know both of them had quite a list of bills, many medical, and Parent A does seem to like to buy quite a few lottery tickets which doesn't help their financial situation, especially now.

My friend and I plan to help out how we can for the immediate future but all of us are in the dark as to what we are supposed to do to attempt to recover from this so any help at all on how we can get Parent A's finances in order/look for any local/state/federal options available to Parent A is gravely appreciated.

personalfinance,Advice for Recent Graduate (Job Offers + LT Goals)?,"I know this sub definitely has had posts like this before but I am really not finding anything similar to my situation. I saw something somewhat similar, but the person had debt and a few other factors that influenced their decision.

Background: Graduating with a master's in accounting soon, F24; blank slate: no debt from school, brand new car (gift), no credit card debt, working during school (hence why I have no debt), good credit score, and I have a thousand or so in savings. I am getting job offers from the federal government in low cost of living states at about 54k, but I am also considering mid sized and big 4 accounting firms with offers around 60k (I technically only have 1 year of combined accounting related experience + a masters, no cpa yet, hence why my offers are all entry level). At the federal position, I would automatically be promoted to GS11 (about 10k increase in salary) in a year, then GS 13 (\~100k) three years after depending on performance. I am being pushed to go into a federal position, because it's long term job stability. I do value that greatly, but I also know the salary caps out at (benefits not included in this figure) \~150k. I also keep hearing that the benefits make up for the salary ceiling, but I really don't know the full figures on that. I don't think I would mind either work environment, because I have worked in a state level agency (9 months/current job) and in a large firm (summer) working 70 hour weeks.

Long Term Goals: I would like to buy a house or have a substantial retirement fund by age 30. I'm not looking to retire early, but I would like to have a large amount of liquid assets or to continue building money in an index fund. My yearly expenses are roughly 19k (includes discretionary and mandatory spending using the FAQ resources pinned on the sidebar of this sub) in said low cost of living area. I am fairly responsible with spending but I also don't fully know what I'm doing. I just spend what I allow myself based on a basic Mint budget. I would also like to continue being debt free for as long as possible and do not have any upcoming large expenses (relocation costs would be covered).

Based on what I described, what recommendations would you give or which resources would you suggest looking into? I have read majority of the pinned FAQ type of articles on this sub, but I likely missed some.",finance
Bitcoin,How Governments Mining Bitcoin Could De-Risk Cryptocurrency,"There’s seemingly a constant conversation, particularly with those involved in legacy financial institutions, about how cryptocurrency can be – to a certain degree – “de-risked.” Can government mining, or merely taxation structure, address this? While many traditional financial players that are not crypto-first, but are crypto-adjacent (take Visa as a prime example) are relying on the use of stablecoins like USDC as their main pillar of transactions, there are other conversations happening about how crypto risk can be managed. Government bodies are always looking to get a piece of the pie; a large pitch of the state-by-state legalization of marijuana or sports gambling throughout the U.S. was the substantial tax revenue that states wouldn’t be seeing otherwise. In fact, just last month the Wall Street Journal published a piece outlining how governments across the globe are getting more involved in mining royalties and taxation, including a new silver and gold tax for mines in Nevada that went into effect last month. Taxation is the root of the domestic discussion around crypto for U.S. policy as we speak. Government Mining: Is It Feasible? Feasibility is of course, the first question to come to mind. Would governmental bodies have the capacity and know-how to truly execute crypto mining? The red tape is flowing. However, some argue that in fact, Bitcoin (and broader crypto) mining is becoming more and more adjacent to the likes of utilities and traditional mineral mining. Independent investment writer Natasha Che argued that indeed, crypto mining could be “the easiest way to de-risk Bitcoin.” Che makes some apt comparisons between the industries at that, noting that all of the aforementioned categories: need heavy capex investments have large economies of scale and have strategic geographic importance Che goes on to show that Bitcoin mining and gold mining actually have very similar geographical distributions. Furthermore, state involvement actually ends up getting deeper than sheer taxation. Che notes that because governments often own underlying natural resources and land, government bodies can directly control substantial portions of mineral mining resources. The same applies for utilities like gas, water, and electric as well. For many regions across the globe, there are more publicly-owned utilities than privately-owned ones, Che shows. The final point Che presents is that arguably the most intensive resource needed to mine Bitcoin, or any crypto really, is capital. “From both revenue and public-good motives, there are strong reasons for governments to get into the game, by either increasing taxes and royalties on miners, or by owning mining facilities directly,” says Che. Feasibility aside, the biggest pushback here from long-time crypto advocates has been that this arguably runs against Bitcoin’s very decentralized nature. However, with increased exposure and adoption over time, some degree of the discussion here is inevitable. As the old adage goes, “life, death and taxes.” Bitcoin and crypto taxation has been a focal point in domestic legislative discussions in the United States recently. | Source: BTC-USD on TradingView.com Related Reading | Bitcoin Accumulation Pattern Shows Rally Might Only Be In Its Early Stages Government Shifts: Looking Forward At the core of the broader mining and geographic discussion is of course, the long-time dependence of miners existing across China. However, the tides seem to be turning given China’s policy shifts towards mining, as our team covered just last week. Before China’s substantial crackdown, however, the share of miners throughout the country was already on the decline. Shouldn’t governments be looking to take advantage of what is seemingly an open door for a strong geographic distribution of crypto miners? Despite no substantial discussions domestically about crypto mining on a government level, there has been an increase in U.S. miners during the departure of miners from China. Arcane Research found that from September 2020 to April 2021, U.S. Bitcoin hashrate increased roughly four-fold, from 4.1% to 16.8%. Many would argue that government involvement in mining could allow for better usage of clear energy to mine, better processes and opportunities, and more – at the expense of taxation to government bodies.  Despite the apparent radio silence from most federal and state legislatures, government controlled funds could be holding an open door to crypto: earlier last month, our team also wrote about the New Jersey Pension Fund investing in two Bitcoin mining behemoths – Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings. Furthermore, Wyoming state representatives have been vocal about being as crypto-friendly as possible. State senator Cynthia Lummis has been one of the loudest pro-crypto political figures recently, tweeting last month that “if you are in the #bitcoin mining space, please reach out. We WANT you in Wyoming.” Of course, we can’t forget about the tech and crypto hub that is constantly in the conversation too – Miami, FL. Could state-managed pension funds in the U.S., and broader political advocates, be the first entry for more formal governmental integration with crypto mining? Possibly, but we’ll need to hold our horses until at least more mainstream crypto ETFs find their way to mainstream markets (which are currently in the works). Even then, we’ll likely still have more miles to cover down this path. Arguably the biggest question mark around it all? How does this impact risk levels compare to past and present days? There’s no hard and fast answers here, though many believe that with increased acceptance, institutional buy-in, and a splash of governmental regulation, mainstream cryptos will likely see more “de-risking” as reliability on them increases.

personalfinance,Preparation for a large bill,"As I lay down from a stressful day, I'd like to ask this question to hopefully be able to get some plan started tomorrow. 

So long story short our central heating broke. They finally fixed it, however that's mostly a bandaid solution. Any replacement parts went out of production a few years ago and secondhand is yucky at best. Since the thing is old anyways and using oil we figured we should switch. We got an offer for a new one using gas. Brand-new and all that stizzle and -- compared to our 40 years old one -- exceptionally good. Automatically releasing air from the system! What an invention. 

Here comes the bad part: it will cost us roughly 25k€. I've luckily upgraded jobs a few times recently which means that I can make this sum in about a year. The issue is though that we don't have a year. 

From my calculation when the bill is due I *can* have about 75% saved up, give or take if something else breaks. That's a lot of money, but not enough. 

My question is now essentially how to structure the loan. We're in the EU so (un)fortunately the interest rates are fairly low. Would it make more sense to take out the loan on the whole sum, potentially with the house as a security, in order to have a bit of free cash in case something else happens? Or would it be more prudent to try to pay as much up front and only take out a loan on the part that's missing, potentially not needing to offer up the house as collateral? 

For context in case it's needed: I'm 22, living in Germany (EU), house is (still) in my mother's name and roughly 50 years old. The old heating was also from roughly 40-30 years ago (nobody knows) and was only upgraded when we moved in with a control unit in order to comply with newer laws.

&gt;“What you’ll see is the flight of innovation, and investments related to innovation, to offshore locations around the globe.”

&gt; ""You are trying to adopt many-decades-old regulatory policies to a completely new form of exchange — one that, by the way, values very highly the privacy of those who exchange in it.”

confusing title i know, let me break the steps here.This is my method of generating some secure passwords mixing known algorithms already accepted as secure so no new systems here. I was wondering about best practises and possible weaknesses it might have - improvemets to be done.

1rst A know text by both the ""attacker"" and me gets fed into the padding scheme.2nd the result of that is encrypted using AES with a totally random password(the best randomness i can get using secure methods for crypto and many digits)3rd the encrypted now bytes are salted and Hashed  with either PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt4rth The result of the hash turn into characters using base85 and i used as a password.

Yeah i know it is completely weird as a sytem but it provides a convinience for me and that's why i chose it.Now my questions, What would be a good padding scheme to use in the first step? obvisously i rely on the randomness of AES-256 encrypted data for security here(with a very good password), the random password is to guard against list based attacks, the hash after that is to make bruteforcing a random pass from a TB/sec to waaay less as they are slow hashes. My thinking here is that the 2nd step outputs something almost random and that fed into the 3rd step guarantee an almost random pass in the end.

Between PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt is there a clear choice for my case? my reasearch showed each have pros and cons.Is base85 from the pseudo-random output of the hash predictable(could be base64 i figured more digits=more combinations)?Should i change it to something else?I am not going for perfect security against hackers or something here just a good overall system to use(this one is easy to use).I know i can use password managers or 2FA which is a better solution but right now i am asking about this one, and about the theory not implementation attacks such as keyloggersmemory search etc.

Just like that..


 If you were a scalper and were good at it you could do that in 20 minutes. Sigh.


Now it is not so easy. But then again, it is.. Provided you know what your doing..


.. You can scalpt. . but it does require some preparation.


There was a man in prison who in 93 was considered the grandmaster of currency.. Before he caught a life sentence on something unrelated. He used me as a proxy in 2014. He had me scalpt for him over a prison phone. 


Based on an economic calander of events. Our goal was to trade the prerelease, release and after the release of the Australian trade balance and right into the opening of the Japanese stock market opening. At 7.30 pm.


Because he was a legendary client I had to prepare extensive intelligent reports. 


I had m3 money supply figures. Figures pulled from the Austrian reserve bank bulletin..The overnight cash rates, libor, interest rates differentials, potential unwinding of carry trades, Intel from the bureau of economic analysis, the misery index, Intel from the organization of economic cooperation and development, the us federal reserve, and correlations from mataf.


He used this and complex math to make projections about if the number would be in line with expectations or radically different. 


He explained that when he traded realestate he could see things breaking down or building up a mile away.

By examining over 65 statistics. Not just mortgage application rates but home affordability rates, consumer spending, unwanted real estate owned by banks, lending rates, lumber and cemeny prices, home equity loan delinquency. And he did something similar with currencies. 


Then he had me put on many screens, oil, gold, copper, newzealand currencies, various stock markets, the dollar yen, the Australian dollar, the dollar index..treasury yields. And several more. And he had me call out where each price was as they changed.. The whole time we counted down to the release of the target number. GMT.


Now before I conclude. I must explain his mindset is pure predatorial. He is not a scalper. He's a positional trader in line with dual policies. But he was a notorious stop hunter. Hed look at a chart and determine where if a person got in at this point where would their loss point be that would force you to quit the trade. I never knew professional analyzed such things because then they maneuver the market to those ruin points before turning around.. 


Well 10 minutes before the hour and the announcement other markets took off in anticipation   and other markets woke up to make adjustments.. He had a premise that the smart money always knew the number before it was announced and would get in first then burn the public who jumped in late.. Who traded the fact. As I'm screaming numbers he's has me jumping in and reversing trades over the next hour. Monster positions. .  no graphs. Pure price action. Just numbers.


 Wed see gold move then oil take off and the dollar yen make adjustments and the Australian follow behind . it was an eye opener. He's on a prison phone calm with a notebook and calculator.making calculations asking thw whereabouts of markets

.playing the money flows. As prices ping pong about a state of equilibrium. Hed point out states when markets were out of line. And at what price would equalbrium be achieved. After an hour he was done and took a week off so he could view the market with fresh eyes and without preconceived ideas.


The lesson: develop your plan and trade your plan. Have your contingencies worked out in advance. Take breaks from trading

This is going to be a lot of information, so there are a few key themes to keep track of as we go through this timeline. 

1. Corporate Personhood: Should corporations be afforded human rights? 

2. Does limiting money = restricting speech?

3. Corporate PAC and super PAC spending limits

4. Campaign and PAC donation limits (and ways around them)

# 1886: Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. 

The case itself is not as directly relevant to us as the headnote, which carries some important implications regarding Corporate Personhood. Corporate Personhood is based on the idea that people have the right to govern their own community (eg. Corporations). Taken a bit further, if corporations are people, they should be afforded the same rights and protections as people, like the right to free speech (The First Amendment). And they should have the power to file lawsuits alleging constitutional rights violations. 

&gt;Before argument, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said: The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.” 

This idea of Corporate Personhood was not new. But this quote from Chief Justice Waite set the stage for Corporate Personhood in later court cases.

[History.com, corporate personhood](https://www.history.com/news/14th-amendment-corporate-personhood-made-corporations-into-people)

[Santa Clara Blues: Corporate Personhood versus Democracy](https://reclaimdemocracy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/santa_clara_blues.pdf)

Tl;dr. Chief Justice’s quote sets stage for corporations = persons 

# 1907: Tillman Act 

The Tillman Act prohibited all corporate contributions to political candidates. However, it was almost impossible to enforce. And it didn’t stop corporations from running political ads or smear campaigns of their own. 

[The Act (pdf is huge, the act itself is on page 894 of the pdf or page 864 on the actual doc)](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llsl/llsl-c59/llsl-c59.pdf)

[Tillman Act Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907)

Tl;dr. Corporate political donations banned. But not enforced, and there are loopholes.

# 1971: Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA)

FECA introduced limits onto campaign donations and campaign expenditures. It also introduced public funding via the income tax checkoff which allowed US persons to allocate $3 of their federal income taxes to a presidential candidate. Lastly, it mandated disclosure of campaign donors, which is what makes opensecrets.org possible. The 1974 amendment established the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to enforce these laws. 

[FECA and Amendments](https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/legislation/)

[Searchbar your favourite politican or big bank to see who's paying whom!](https://Opensecrets.org) (don't just use this to reinforce your biases, look up the candidates you like as well)

Tl;dr. Limits on donations and spending; introduced public funding, disclosure of donors, and the FEC. 

# 1976: Buckley v. Valeo **

This landmark case challenged the FECA on the grounds that it violated rights to freedom of expression. The supreme court held that contributions and expenditures were first amendment issues and struck down the limits on campaign expenditures and on individual expenditures. But it upheld limits on campaign contributions as a measure against corruption. 

There are several implications of this ruling. Firstly, it made money a lot more important in elections. Political campaigns and Political Action Committees (PACs)\* had no cap on spending. Secondly, by treating contributions and expenditures as first amendment issues, it lay the groundwork for equating limiting donations with restricting speech. 

\*PACs are political organizations that pool donations. They’re generally built around certain issues or candidates and they run ads or events to further those ends. Corporations can form PACs, and cover fundraising expenses, administrative costs and staff salaries, but can’t donate directly to them. 

[The Case](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/1/)

[Why corporate PACs have an advantage](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/02/why-corporate-pacs-have-an-advantage/)

Tl;dr. PAC spending limits removed. Groundwork for establishing “limiting money = restricting speech”.  

# 1978: First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti

Tl;dr Corporations have First Amendment speech protections. 

[Here's a nice pre-2000s summary if you want a recap](https://transition.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

# 2002: The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA)/The McCain-Feingold Act

There are two key issues that the BCRA was designed to deal with: soft money and issue advocacy. Soft money being ""money raised outside the limits and prohibitions of federal campaign finance law.” Ie. Money outside of campaign finance regulations, used for party building activities but not in coordination with any candidates. The BCRA prohibited receiving and using soft money in elections. 

Issue advocacy is political advertising on broad issues rather than specific candidates. The BCRA defined issue advocacy as ‘electioneering communications’ and banned corporations and unions from issuing these ads. The BCRA is also the reason they always say “I’m \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I approve this message.”

[BCRA](https://ballotpedia.org/Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act)

[Khan Academy video about soft money, PACs and BCRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPfNgTrWKyE)

Tl;dr BCRA banned soft money and political ads by corporations. 

# 2010: Citizens United v. FEC**

Alright folks, this is the big one, the infamous Citizens United case. Citizens United was a conservative organization that wanted to air a film called “Hillary: The Movie” A documentary critical of Hillary Clinton. But because it was within 30 days of the 2008 democratic primary election, it was considered “electioneering communications” and thus not allowed. Citizens United challenged the BCRA restrictions and the supreme court struck down restrictions on independent expenditures from corporations.

The reasoning for this decision was that if ‘limiting money = restricting speech’ and Citizens United was restricted, would that mean the government could then restrict broadcast ads on the internet? Or book publishers? The government attorneys responded by saying that they could restrict these things, and the Supreme Court Justices found this problematic. (Note that the press has some exemptions)

The implication of this, however, is that now corporations can spend as much as they want on political ads and smear campaigns. And so all that’s left is for lobbyists to align the interests of politicians with the corporations these corporations with unlimited spending capacity. 

[Khan Academy Video on Citizens United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1co7bMQplwQ)

Tl;dr Political spending by corporations = 1st amendment-protected speech. =&gt; unlimited spending for corporations. 

# 2010: Speechnow.org v. FEC**

This case removed limits on donations from individuals to independent-expenditure only groups (ie. They don’t donate directly to candidates). Thus, the Super PAC is born. As long as they don’t donate directly, they have unlimited capacity for individual donations and unlimited capacity for spending.  

[The Case](https://ballotpedia.org/SpeechNOW.org_v._Federal_Election_Commission)

Tl;dr. No limits on individual (read:whales) donations to super PACs. 

# A Path Forward**

So the problem is that we have corporations and super PACs, which have no cap on money in or money out. How can the average person compete? Well the obvious solution would be to overturn Buckley v. Valeo, Citizens United v. FEC, and speechnow.org v. FEC. 

Another way would be to amplify the little guys’ voices. This can be done by democracy vouchers, where residents are given a voucher that they can delegate to the candidate of their choice. It’s a way of publicly financing elections, its currently implemented in Seattle, and its been proposed on the federal level by Andrew Yang. Similar to that would be donation matching from government bodies. I believe it’s already been implemented on the federal level and in NYC. The next step here would be for other states/counties/cities to adopt this. 

The most significant bill for campaign finance reform out there now is H.R. 1, or the ‘For The People Act’. It includes donation matching, stricter limitations on foreign lobbying, requirements for super PACs to disclose donors, and supports overturning Citizens United v. FEC. It got stuck in the senate but I don’t think this is the last we’ve seen of that bill.

Okay, so its one thing to understand things theoretically, its another thing to actually do something about it. In the same way that you’ve used your voice to support the crypto amendment in the infrastructure bill, you should voice your support for policies that would effect positive change in campaign finance. Email or call your representative to tell them you want them to support the democracy vouchers or the For The People Act or whatever. We have power, we should use it.

Of course, I have my biases for what I want to see implemented, and these solutions are by no means exhaustive. That said, it would be great to see you all bring forward different solutions. Crypto PAC? Crypto lobbyists? Digital currency/blockchain in PAC spending? Let's hear it.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

49. Apparently “unsigned Phalices” are a thing in the Cardano ecosystem now. [https://twitter.com/unsigned\_algo/status/1416909454100992000](https://twitter.com/unsigned_algo/status/1416909454100992000)
50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that! [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-aba-derivatives-futures-law-committee-virtual-mid-year-program-072121](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-aba-derivatives-futures-law-committee-virtual-mid-year-program-072121)
56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream. [https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135)
57. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp)

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

88. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC.

90. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas.

91. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

93. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

94. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

98. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill on Aug 7. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

CryptoCurrency,The obvious similarities between the War On Drugs and the current War On Crypto.,"Disclaimer:-I am not an advocate of all drugs, BUT i am a strong advocate and supporter of psychedelic drugs as i have seen their beneficial power first hand and in those around me. 

💉War On Drugs
The war on drugs was and still is a global campaign, led by the U.S. federal government, of drug prohibition, military aid, and military intervention, with the aim of reducing the illegal drug trade in the United States.

As per June 18, 1971 president Nixon started his famous campaign against the counter culture to ban drugs and stop people from having egoless and love full transformations, making them more at one with the world and others. This cou ter cture was a HUGE threat to the Vietnam war success as more and more US citizens rose up against the war and avoided conscription. 

💎War On Crypto 
Similarly as we all know by now: As of this week the US congress is having an important vote on crypto and talks of strict regulation are looming. Where is the connection with the war on drugs you might wonder. 

Well the US government and its financial system and institutions are being threatened by the rapidly emerging crypto market. It is a HUGE threat to the balamce of power and maintenance of the 1%. Crypto is a financial weapon that ofcourse is not perfect but it can be used by every individual to chieve massive returns and create a new system, a decentralised one in which everyone is their own bank. 

Not only is crypto a huge powerful tool to make the less forunate rich, but it can also be used for different applications including the prevention of corruption. I believe this is a big reason as to why the governemnt wants to halt crypto in its tracks. 

Governemnta are extremely corrupt and the open ledger style of the blockchain can help prevent this and possibly make a fully decentralised system the power of which lays int he hands of all citizens. 

This is a big No No for your government believe it or not, and they will use their classic propaganda tactics and regulations to make it as difficult as possible for us and at the same time give them as much control and money as they can get from this market. 

I still believe and always will believe in the crypto movement and the positive chamges it can bring. 

TL:DR
The government is applying their classic tactics just like with the war on drugs for the same reasons as they didnin the 70s. To prevent crypto and maintain balance of power

Bitcoin,"Open letter to Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Janet Yellen.","Your smoke and mirror politics have been exposed over the last week.  The “card trick” you just tried to play on cryptocurrency didn’t slip past the American people.  In the name of improving infrastructure, you tried to slip dozens of non-relevant regulations into the bill in order to further your control and tyranny.  One of which was a weak attempt to kill crypto, largely Bitcoin.

As I type this message, we are pushing toward $46k/Bitcoin and have risen 7% in the last 12 hours after Chuck blocked senate voting on a critical amendment.  You see, you cannot kill Bitcoin.  You may slow down broader crypto industry growth on U.S. soil.  But Bitcoin itself is at a point where it cannot be stopped.  The more you try to block it, the stronger it will get. 

This “problem” that the Federal Reserve and Treasury now have on their hands was created in response to decades of mismanaged fiat currency, corrupt central banking, and Wall Street puppetry.  And now the problem you created is fighting back.

Even if this bill passes in it’s current language, what you will see over the next 1-2 years before it becomes law is millions of people buying MORE Bitcoin, storing their coins privately, and “holding on for dear life”.  

You can take our guns, you can take our freedoms, hell you can even imprison us or kill us.  But Bitcoin is the one thing that you will never be able to take.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The bittersweet feeling of mass adoption,"A very small part of me misses when I was the only one I knew (besides my internet buddies, of course) who was interested in crypto. 

There was a time this hobby/interest of mine was unique and odd, now it’s no longer those things. It felt like I was part of some exclusive club, a club in which I was proud to be a member. Now all of a sudden, anyone with at least 100 bucks in the latest meme coin is an expert and considers themselves a member. 

Shit, even the old lady down the street from me has a wallet full of DOGE because her grandson “knows crypto.” Friends who’ve scoffed at me for years are now calling me up and telling me about their poor “investments.” If I breathe one word about any legitimate altcoin to my family, the conversation gets steered to shitcoins like SHIB and Safemoon.

Don’t get me wrong. I AM ELATED that crypto is becoming more mainstream than it has ever been. It’s what we’ve been trying to accomplish all along. And I understand that this is what mass adoption looks like.

I looked a bit into their website ([https://safedatapass.com/](https://safedatapass.com/)), I have joined their Discord and it seemed like there is a small community around that project. People were chatting on the Discord server and expecting the pre-sale that was supposed to hold on KickDex. People were asking about the pool address and Admins were just responding that it will be announced on the day of the sale.

So it happened, the address was announced and the pre-sale started. I didn't invest much, coins were pretty cheap (0.02) so I thought: Since I have never tried pre-sale before, I can risk 30€ to the hell with it. I invested 30 € converted to BNB and was waiting to the sale end because they said we can claim the SDP tokens only at the end.

When the sale ended, the Discord server disappeared, I couldn't log in anymore. I have tried to contact them on a mail that is set on their website as a contact but Gmail returns the mail because it claims that email is non-existing.

Does anyone here know anything about this project?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Legislation: Everything You Need to Know (for Now),"Tl;DR: The two competing cryptocurrency amendments have now turned into one ""compromise amendment"", which clarifies some rules, punts a few more down the road, and will probably be acceptable to most senators and crypto.

\-

Don’t feel bad if you’re having a hard time keeping track of the crypto legislation winding its way through D.C. right now—I spent my whole weekend following crypto twitter and barely kept my head around it myself. Here’s everything you need to know:

**The Infrastructure Bill**

Crypto stakeholders and crypto doubters alike have long asked for clarity around tax reporting standards for cryptocurrencies and associated businesses. As part of the [$1 trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-edges-toward-passage-1-tln-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-08/), lawmakers wrote in text placing stricter requirements on “digital assets” and the tax implications around them. It requires “brokers” to report 1099 gains as well as transactions of over $10,000.

The issue is the lack of clarity around the word “broker.” The definition is not clear in the existing amendment and could lead to confusion while potentially requiring DeFi applications, node validators, and even crypto miners to report transactions. Two camps emerged to clarify the amendment.

**The Crypto Allies (Wyden-Lummis-Toomey)**

Leading the charge for the crypto industry is senator Ron Wyden, a long-serving (elected in 1996) Democrat from Oregon. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Senator Pat Toomey (both Republicans) also take part.

Their amendment makes it clear that these ‘broker’ reporting standards **do not** apply to miners, wallets, or individuals developing blockchain tech. It’s seen as a tech- and innovation-centric approach. It also provides clarity for brokers, raising tax revenues. Most cryptocurrency exchanges are in support of this approach.

**The Crypto Opposition (Portman-Warner-Sinema)**

On the other side, the proposed Portman-Warner-Sinema amendment does not clarify the definition, meaning that any entity (potentially including miners, hardware, and software developers) may have to track and report transactions of individuals that aren’t direct customers.

Crypto advocates say this will push innovation offshore and create unnecessary, inefficient, and unfair burdens on crypto stakeholders that could have to report transactions that don't have much to do with them at all.

**Wait, Why is Janet Yellen Here?**

Former fed chair and current treasury secretary, representing Joe Biden and the White House, signaled her support for the Portman-Warner-Sinema amendment.

**How Might This Affect You?**

Crypto markets have appeared relatively impervious to all of this political movement, up nearly 10% on the week, although most top cryptos dived over 5% on Sunday night.

This probably means one of three things:

* Crypto investors continue to believe that no one country can affect the future of crypto enough to stifle long-term innovation
* Crypto investors think a reasonable compromise will be reached
* Crypto investors simply don’t care about the legislation and the market is behaving irrationally

If you could potentially be directly affected by this legislation from a business or tax perspective, you’re probably following along pretty closely, but here's who this might affect:

**Who This May Directly Affect:**

* Crypto exchanges
* Crypto hardware and software developers
* Crypto miners and staking node operators

**Who This Probably Will Not Directly Affect:**

* Cryptocurrency investors who hold crypto on an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, Robinhood, eToro and do not
* Cryptocurrency investors who hold crypto in hardware or software wallets
* Noncustodial wallets
* Cryptocurrency investors who stake their crypto
* People or companies that work on blockchain validation
* Other areas of DeFi

**Where Are We Now:**

Things are hard to keep track of in part because the infrastructure bill falls along party lines in some ways, but in other ways causes bipartisan rifts. Crypto is unique in that sense.

Discussion on the crypto amendments has largely ceased because of partisan disagreement on whether the entire infrastructure bill should be passed along ASAP as it is, or if discussion on amendments will continue. The existing bill probably includes miners and devs as ‘brokers,’ so it’s important that some type of amendment is included in the final text of the bill.

**The Compromise Bill**

Just about an hour ago (10:30 ET, 8/9/2021), a new bill (being referred to as the Toomey-Lummis-Warner Compromise Crypto Amendment) was introduced that somewhat clarifies the definition of broker and makes exceptions for both validators and crypto wallet makers.

This helps with the direst of possibilities and also punts future interpretations and regulations down the road and to the Treasury (they’ll have to issue a lot of clarifications on how these rules will go into effect). It’s probably a compromise that most of the crypto world and most senators will be happy with, and it clears the way to the passage of the infrastructure bill. Senator Wyden’s name is notably absent from the amendment.

**Stay Woke**

Keep in mind that this is merely an update: no consensus has been reached and many things could change in the coming hours or days that may represent a tremendous win or a history-altering loss for crypto.

One thing is clear: **cryptocurrency is here to stay**, although America’s role as the epicenter of development may be at stake.

If you’d like to affect the outcome, [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/muldermk/status/1423662345440698376) is a great place to start and represents actionable steps that are will continue to be relevant in the coming day, weeks, and even months.

Bitcoin,How you can help support the Bitcoin network (Hint: it's not by running a node),"I see a lot of posts about wanting to ‘support the network’ by running a node. In reality, your motivation to run a node should be to use Bitcoin in a more sovereign and private way, not to ‘support the network.’ Running a full node particularly in the configuration that projects like umbrel utilize, does almost nothing to support the network. 

There are, however, multiple ways you can support the network. What has been increasingly clear through the negotiations of the infrastructure bill is that the Treasury department explicitly wants very broad, open ended definitions of the term ‘broker.’ This is so they can have widespread and sweeping control if necessary on stopping certain areas of development and use. **Keep in mind this: Is it not the value or the price of Bitcoin that threatens the traditional banking and financial structure. It is the ability it affords individuals to be sovereign over their wealth.** If individuals can hold their wealth outside of banking institutions, not only does this pose a great threat to the commercial banks ability to profit from holding your money for near worthless interest rates, but more importantly, it completely undermines the ability of central banks to exercise capital controls. Whether it’s obvious or not yet, the government and regulators will fight, tooth and nail, for a world in which only regulated exchanges and banks can offer and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bitcoin is nothing if it’s not permissionless, borderless and censorship resistant. 

If you really want to ‘support the network’ then contribute towards the sovereign, circular Bitcoin economy. Focus on making individual, non-custodial holding of bitcoin the standard so that the supply of Bitcoin is so widespread and so distributed that the genie cannot go back in the bottle. 

A few steps that EVERYONE should take: 

1. **Take all your money off exchanges.** At some point all exchanges will function like Robinhood where you can only buy and sell. Don’t be caught without the ability to control your wealth. 

2. **Coin-join your Bitcoin.** This is IMMENSELY important. The power the government and regulators have to exercise control over aspects of the protocol rely on the ability to have directly associated identities to addresses and transactions. This is a herd immunity situation. If a large percentage of on chain transaction are coin-joined, it will break the heuristics they use to follow and trace payments. I recommend Whirlpool or Join-market implementations. Hopefully I can recommend Wasabi once the details of their WabiSabi implementation is available. 

Here is a great series on understanding on chain privacy by the Samourai team: https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-1-4-8177a40a5923

3. **NEVER sell to an exchange.** If you want/need to sell your bitcoin then use a P2P platform such as Bisq OR find a friend/neighbor to sell to. Every satoshi you sell to an exchange is another satoshi that can, at anytime, be locked up and taken out of the Bitcoin circular economy. Don’t do it. 

Here is a good intro to using Bisq: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LyEKA5Iq9I

4. **Mine your own Bitcoin.** The trend towards institutionalized mining operations in the US is a dangerous one. More and more these miners are becoming regulated, publicly traded entities. Regulatory arbitrage mitigates this risk but the more we can create a network of off the grid, small time miners, no matter how small, the better. 

Here is a great resource by Diverter if anyone is interested: https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/

Keep in mind that all of the steps I’ve listed are perfectly legal ways of interacting with Bitcoin. This is the fight that was always coming. While shitcoins will incentivize 3rd party custody of their token to collect staking rewards, you can help to ensure that Bitcoin will always be a sovereign asset. 

Keep up the fight",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoin Giant Circle Plans to Become Federal Bank,"This is bullish news as it gets;

**Circle Aims for Federal Bank Status**

Circle's proposed move would see it come under broader regulatory oversight.

Key takeaways:

- Stablecoin issuer Circle has detailed its plans to become a National Digital Currency Bank operating under federal oversight.

- Circle's USDC has seen explosive growth in 2021, with a current market cap of $27.5 billion.

- The move would see Circle comply with federal banking rules, which are much stricter than state banking regulation


In Circle’s latest company update, CEO Jeremy Allaire detailed the stablecoin giant’s plan to become a National Digital Currency Bank under federal oversight.

**Circle Aims for Federal Bank Status**

- The company behind the second most popular stablecoin, USDC, has outlined its plans for growth in the next few months. In a Monday blog post, CEO Jeremy Allaire revealed that the issuer hopes to become a federal bank.

- In three years, USDC has reached a market cap of $27.5 billion. While Tether, the issuer behind USDT, has run into its fair share of legal challenges, Circle’s USDC has a reputation for being proactive with regulators.



To become a federal bank, the most notable change in Circle’s strategy would see it level up in terms of oversight.
 At the moment, Circle works under state banking regulations.
 The proposed changes would see Circle become a bank under the supervision of the Federal Reserve and other relevant U.S. authorities.

State banking regulations are less stringent than the federal regulations that would come with Circle’s announced move. 
Federal oversight will inevitably see the company under more scrutiny, but Allaire is not worried. He wrote:

&gt;“Since inception, USDC reserves have been bound by the permissible investment rules under state money transmission regulations, which is how we are regulated today. These rules, and Centre’s standards, are designed to protect consumers and ensure 1:1 dollar liquidity. To give the market additional reassurance beyond the fact of our regulatory supervision, we have consistently and voluntarily published monthly independent third-party attestations as to the sufficiency of the USDC reserves.”


*The company’s CEO remarked that Circle has always held itself to the highest regulatory standard, exceeding the Basel III regulatory requirements. Maintaining high standards with regulators will certainly make the transition smoother for Circle, and Allaire added that the firm would continue to work in close collaboration with regulators. “We will proactively work with our national regulatory counterparts on the ultimate commercial adoption of new dollar digital currency standards,” he wrote*

personalfinance,Take the hard inquiry for CC at my preferred CU or take the pre-approval at a less ideal CU?,"I'm in the market for a new credit card (CC) - one I can use for household expenses.  Currently, I manage my household finances (with my fiance), through Credit Union 1 (CU1). We have two shared checking accounts. One of the accounts serves as a savings account with a better than average interest rate. The other account serves as an everyday checking account that we use for rent, groceries, etc. I'm interested in opening a CC with CU1 to be used for regular everyday expenses (groceries, etc.) so that I can take advantage of their points/cash back. CU1, however, does not do ""pre-approvals"" and any attempt to obtain a CC with them will require a hard credit pull.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pre-approved for a CC at Credit Union 2 (CU2) with a pretty good limit and rate. I've called to confirm that accepting the offer will not incur a hard inquiry.

&amp;#x200B;

My credit report varies from source to source, but I have between 1 and 4 hard inquries in the last 2 years (financed a vehicle purchase and other large purchase). I'd rather not have to pull a hard inquiry, but am willing to consider it. I prefer CU1 for convenience only. I'd be nice to have the card linked to my household checking accounts. However, I doubt they will match the same limit/rate as CU2. If I go with CU2, I'll have to move money around which kind of defeats the purpose of getting a CC specifally for household expenses (I already have personal CCs that I'm currently using for these expenses).

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 9, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 9, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both pulling back from all-time highs last week, pressured by a broad decline in crude energy stocks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose modestly. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.55%.  Like I have been saying the last few weeks, I expect the market to be quite choppy moving forward, as market participants continue to balance record-breaking corporate earnings and the expectation for economic expansion with rising concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. 

Oil prices fell over 2% to a three week low, extending recent losses in the sector as concerns that pandemic-era restrictions may be reinstated across Asia, especially China, which would reduce demand. In the face of rising cases, the world’s second largest economy has extended its border closure and implemented new travel restrictions between areas of high transmission and imposed widespread testing. China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 125 new infections as of Sunday - the third straight day it reported 90 cases and above. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called “zero-COVID” approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is feasible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, this week we've seen airline seat capacity in China plummet 32% compared to the week prior, the most since the early days of the pandemic. In an article circulated throughout state-sponsored media, Former Health Minister Gao Qiang wrote, “Is it feasible to ‘coexist with the virus’? The author believes that it is definitely not feasible. The ‘coexistence with the virus’ \[seen in\] Britain, the United States and other countries has already brought serious consequences to global efforts to contain the epidemic. We must not repeat the same mistakes.” I wouldn’t be surprised to see more and more restrictions implemented across China, despite the relatively low numbers they have so far. 

Neil Shearing, Chief Economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note, “Virus numbers are still very low compared to other countries. But the spread of the Delta variant calls into question China’s ‘zero-COVID’ approach. Whereas most governments are now starting to acknowledge that we are likely to have to live with the coronavirus for the long term, China’s ambition remains to keep it out of the country altogether. Without a shift in approach, this suggests that China will have to continue with occasional local lockdowns and restrictions on movement. This in turn will prevent a full return to pre-pandemic norms of consumer and business behavior, and is likely to mean that restrictions on foreign travel remain in place for some time to come.""

In response, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) slashed their growth outlooks for the near-future. For example, Goldman slashed its third-quarter real gross domestic product forecast to 2.3% from 5.8%, but lifted its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 8.5% from 5.8%.

However, while the Delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, in the US, the economy continues to recover at a remarkable rate. The Labor Department’s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

As of Friday, 89% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported earnings, with 87% of those topping estimates for earnings-per-share, according to data from FacSet. If this proportion holds, it would be the highest percentage of companies beating earnings since at least 2008, when FactSet began to track this data.

Under my Available Balance window, I only see Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement Fund). Then I see ""Total credits and debits."" From the other thread, it seems like the settlement fund is a ""parking lot"" that holds your money until you decide where to invest it. Someone else mentioned a target fund? Is there a primary fund that my money should be in or is leaving all my contributions in the settlement fund okay? It's not super important for me to have a high interest rate back right now since I'm still learning about investing but I just want to make sure I'm not losing money or at risk of losing money at this moment.

If I were to want to invest in another fund, how should I go about that? I remember seeing a page with a pie chart asking about ideal percentages your investment is split, but I don't think my money has been split in these different ways.

CryptoCurrency,"My grandmother's story: from ""Hitlermädchen"" Führerin to crypto millionaire","This is the story of how my grandmother, or to be completely correct, my wife's grandmother, or to sound epic, my children's great-grandmother, became a crypto millionaire.  


To all scammers and hackers:  
she has a cold wallet, it's in a safe deposit box and I don't know her key phrase.

Please excuse my English, as I am German.  
Long read, but I believe it's worth it.  


A brief background on her:  
she was born in 1932 in Germany, where she still lives today. She was born into the Third Reich, was a leader of the ""Hitlermädchen"" and was almost killed as a 13 year old trying to save her horse from the stable next to her parents house during an Allied air raid. The house was completely bombed out, as was the rest of her hometown, and she somehow made it out alive. The rest of her family, or at least those who survived the bombing (mother and four siblings), came to live with an aunt, as her father was away at war and became a prisoner of war by the Russian by then. Grandma did not go with her aunt, but instead at her mother's request to a boarding school run by Catholic nuns. 

When her father returned home from captivity after a few years (as one of a few), he took over the family business again: slate siding. But the father was no longer the same and died a short time later. She had to take over the business when she was 20 years old, but before the economic miracle in Germany really took off, the company was bankrupt. She trained as a medical assistant and shortly afterwards met her future husband. An engineer and later manager at Mercedes Benz/Daimler. 

They had a son and built their wealth piece by piece during the years of the German economic miracle. Mercedes became more and more successful and so did her husband, who soon rose in the ranks and traveled halfway around the world for Daimler. So the years passed until her husband became ill in the nineties. He held out for a few years, but then finally took his own life because he could no longer bear his illness (Parkinson's). There she was, alone again, having to deal with the loss of the most important man in her life once again.  

Grandmother had always been good with money. Lived frugally (apart from a few fur coats) and invested her money, or that of her late husband, conservatively with her house bank. This actually always worked quite well (except for 2008), even though the bank took commissions of 4-6% a year. The returns and interest rates were so high, however, that it didn't bother her. She still made bank.  

Eleven years ago, I met my now wife and thus grandmother. We got along great from the beginning and she was always very interested in what I was up to. When I told her and her new husband, who was born in 1931, about cryptocurrencies in around 2012, they were politely interested, but no more.  
To be honest, I didn't really understand the technology myself at the time, but I invested nonetheless.  

Time passed and when the first big gains were there and I told Grandma about it at her almost weekly lunch, she perked up.  
She said, ""if you're so good with money, why don't you take a look at my investments?""  
So I did, and found that her long-time bank advisor was hawking all sorts of papers that all had one thing in common: huge commissions for him and high annual management fees for the bank.  
I brought this to her attention and it took another couple of years and a bull run for the topic of cryptocurrencies and specifically Bitcoin to come up again. 

I explained to her that she was wealthy enough to invest a small percentage of her assets in Bitcoin without getting into to much risk. Her new husband was extremely skeptical and refused. However, the woman has already survived Hitler and doesn't take crap from any man, so she invested. I helped her with that, of course, since she is not very good with computers. I was extremely proud that she trusted me so much.  

The years went by and we almost never talked about her investment. The woman has a good pension and doesn't care much about money. Then came the time from 2017 on, where Bitcoin as a topic suddenly also became a topic in the mass media in Germany and she asked me if the interest for her Bitcoins would still arrive regularly. I tried to explain to her again that there is no interest, but her investment is developing very well.  

Well, now it's 2021 and grandma is still HODLing.   
Whenever she sits in front of the TV with her husband and the BTC price runs through the stock ticker, her husband gets upset and yells, ""now sell this crap already"" and grandma always reacts the same way. She replies, ""not yet, not yet my dear"" and then has a big grin on her face.  
To be honest, she was a wealth millionaire before, but her bitcoin investment was by far her most successful investment of her life.  
So far. She's 89 and doing very well. Let's see what else she's up to.  
Last week she asked me about all this digital art that is talked about on the media and how to invest in that. I told her not to bother and just to HODL.  
She asked me then what that means and I just said: „Never mind, Nana! Your cake is delicious.“

personalfinance,Leveraged investing vs regular contributions,"Say I can invest a $25000 loan with a 2.99% interest rate, which I will pay back over 5 years, in the stock market. I ran this through a compound interest calculator and assuming a 6% return per year, my investment would grow to about $33745. However, if I were to not take the loan and instead use the roughly $500 that would have gone toward paying off the loan and invest those instead, over 5 years I would have almost $35k. Granted, I think the payments would be a little less than $500 and that would make some difference. However, I was always under the impression that it is better to take on low or be in no rush to pay off low-interest debt considering that the stock market on average outperforms those low interest rates, but when I crunch the numbers, this doesn't seem to be the case.

Other info:

I'm in my early twenties. I have no pressing use for my investments, and will contribute most to a Roth IRA account and a Roth TSP (probably). I will be investing aggressively in a blend of equal parts small cap US, large cap US, and international ETFS.

solar,What's cheaper....?,"My house has been targeted by solar people. We have big fields and good sun exposure. Trinity and Sunnova stopped by this week. Door to door types. I let them shoot their shot, whatever.

Basically they say I need 7-8kw system to cover my electric bill. Their sales tactics seems rather stupid - or I'm stupid - who knows. They talk about my electric bill going up 5-10 percent per year to track with inflation. Then talk about how theirs is federally capped at 2.9 percent. Which overall doesn't make sense, because 30 years ago my parents weren't paying 3 dollars for an electric bill... So why would I be paying 350 in 25 years?

I'm just not seeing what the savings actually is. Especially when they're throwing around numbers like 50k+ dollar loans at 1.99 percent. Etc.

I also have little to no interest in owning panels that will have degraded 20 percent over the life of the loan. And the rental program is even more dubious sounding.

So here's the real question that they won't answer when I ask. If I install solar am I actually going to save money now and 25 years from now? Or would I just be better off conserving electricity and buying energy efficient appliances and items as needed?

I don't know anything. Never researched it. Just knew that it was expensive and couldn't afford it. Payback on investment is too long term for me, at least that's what my electrician told me, and I trust him. Now these people are trying to convince me otherwise.

Edit: okay so get this. The guy just sent me his little document official quote thing. Says ""total amount financed 53k."" Next page says, ""total sales price if financed 71k."" I asked what that garbage even means.

The response, ""Total amount financed is the bottom line  initial principal amount financed for the solar system and the roof.
Because of Massachusetts Truth and Lending disclosures they have to show worst case scenario - so the “total sales price” is the amount with max possible interest over the 25 yr term and if you chose to pay each month by check and not to take advantage of the 10% off discount given for using the auto-pay system.""

We live in Portland, OR, so property taxes are quite high and the market itself is pretty crazy right now. Hence why we are thinking about putting less down on the house and just getting into the market sooner rather than later. Realistically, our price range is capped out at $600k for the type of house/location we want to be in.

Our joint income is $150k per year, both have steady jobs and are content with staying put in Portland. I guess what I’m wondering is where is the best place to start in determining which decision is best for us? Is it getting in front of a loan officer and playing out the various scenarios based on the different down payments/interest rates?

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

CryptoCurrency,Staking at a loss -- with basic statistics,"A lot of people preach at the benefit of staking, how if you have 1000 cardano and earn like 70 ada a year back, imagine if ada goes to $10 and you get a lot of money! (can ada even hit $10 lol)

&amp;#x200B;

 reality is disappointing, let's imagine a scenario where you bought during early 2018, you saw the market drop, so you buy 100 of coin X for $10 each, $1000 total... your mindset was it's on sale.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years later you're down 50% and your 100 of coin X is worth $500. 

&amp;#x200B;

But with the power of staking, we can alleviate the pain and suffering of your idea of buying the dip going awfully wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

[funni spreadsheet \(compounds yearly\) ](https://preview.redd.it/egq6u7a2phg71.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9295119634803de800215d9e815b37e96a2b27)

so what does this mean? well if you somehow got 14% interest a year in coin X then you would save yourself about $150\~ of pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

[money saved](https://preview.redd.it/k541ztpwphg71.png?width=381&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a9faa1fb8ef3b62af98cfdab79f824b9f42fd3)

this really speaks for itself. Even coins that never reach their ath, as long as you stake them in a safe trusted wallet or exchange (try to stick to wallets or staking platforms that still gives you your keys) then a 50% drop could be a ""huh. that's my college loans I bet on. lol. rip my reddit finance degree"" situation to a ""huh, that's my college loans I bet on, just got kicked out of college, but now I can afford ramen for this month :)""

&amp;#x200B;

for anyone that needed a more visual representation. 

&amp;#x200B;

* A lot of things to note, every coin is different, some have 20, 40, 100% interest rates. some have 2, 4, 5%. Stay in the range that generally that coin follows or you will get scammed. 
* Staking has more benefits when the native coin you bought goes up.. but (assuming you don't leverage you degenerate) staking could be a cushion from an otherwise deadly bear run.
* be safe, use only addresses you have whitelisted.. check your xlm memo, i actually accidentally sent the wrong memo to my receiver address the other day I legit have no idea how I got my xlm back lol",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Financing a car through a dealership,"I recently financed a car through a dealership. My credit score wasn’t terrible, however the issue is that I did not have enough payment history for a bank to approve me. I was asked to get a cosigner. I found said cosigner and was approved for the loan with a $1000 down payment on the car. 

When me and my cosigner went back to the dealership to sign paper work, they listed the cosigner in the purchaser spot(first) for all the paper work and listed me(the actual purchaser) second. We are both considered “co-buyers/co-purchasers” but it appears my cosigner’s name is on the title instead of mine. This is an issue because the cosigner did not want their name on the title as it isn’t their car, nor will they be paying a single dime towards this vehicle. 

When I asked the dealership why they did it this way they explained to me that by “default” whomever’s credit score was better would have to sign first because that would allow me a better interest rate, and better/longer payment terms. Is this correct? I will be enlisting in the military hopefully by the end of the year and I intend to take out a USAA loan and refinance the vehicle in my name only. The dealership explained that my cosigner will have to authorize their name being taken off the loan.

I’ve never heard of something like this, so I just wondered if this is correct or if the dealership kinda screwed me over. Any explanation, advice, or knowledge on the matter is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",finance

Trading,"Unique staffing solutions in high demand ( $PIXY ) 100%+ potential upside, low float 8M shares","As Food Service and Other Companies Climb Toward Fuller Capacity, ShiftPixy (PIXY) provides staffing solutions for a wide array of businesses. You do not have to look far to see that many businesses are having issues staffing their facilities.

Good day everyone,

Initiating coverage on **ShiftPixy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PIXY),** a company providing a human capital management platform, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen mobile engagement technology to help businesses with shift-based employees.

Current price                                 $1.82 per share

We reported on PIXY a year ago and want to bring it to you again because the company’s value has dipped to irresistible levels, and it appears revenue growth may be on the horizon. With only 8.7M shares in the public float, a swing in the company revenue/value could happen quickly.

When we look at the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=PIXY), we see a 2021 history of dips followed by a significant swing and the shares are in a dip right now. PIXY shares have consolidated to a level below their 50 DMA and 200 DMA of $2.29 and $2.59 respectively. The current RSI (14) is 41.32.

PIXY shares experienced significant gains this year after dips in their value. In March that gain was 67%, in May that gain was 95%, and in June the gain was 70%. The current dip in the company value is somewhat deeper and longer than the previous three this year creating the potential for a bigger swing to the upside.

PIXY specializes in providing temporary staffing in the food industry. To say 2020 was a challenging year for the company would be an understatement. Revenues plummeted as most of their restaurant clients were shut down due to the pandemic. Thus far in 2021, food service client establishments have only been open for business on an intermittent basis.

On Wednesday of last week, PIXY CEO Scott Absher [did a video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVlO4WKPBi0), and we recommend you view it as a part of your due diligence. Mr. Absher discusses the Gig economy, the PIXY model and app, ghost kitchens and the impact of covid.

The PIXY process is accomplished through the ShiftPixy platform where employers and workers are connected through a mobile app. Employers post their shift needs and workers post their availability.

As of February 28, 2021, the company had 84 clients with over 3,000 WSEs (workers) and processed annualized payroll of over $72 million during fiscal period ending on February 28, 2021. According to the 2018 and 2019 MBO Partners State of Independence in America Reports, 24% of independent workers used an online platform to find work and 52% of the U.S. workforce will be independent by 2023.

In late June, Florida based ShiftPixy hosted the first in a series of recruiting events called MIAMI WORKS to help shift workers find job opportunities that offer living wages, a sign-up bonus, and flexible schedules, as well as healthcare, workers’ compensation, and 401K benefits. We want to note that PIXY also offers food service, and food delivery companies, experienced delivery drivers. ShiftPixy’s delivery platform is called ZiPixy and allows multi-unit food service operators to assure a brand-intended customer experience for mobile orders while keeping 100% of their sales.

PIXY has a FYE of August 31st, so they are currently in their Q4 2021. The timing of the PIXY FYE and the pandemic has had a chilling impact on the company revenues for two consecutive fiscal years. That’s the bad news, the good news is a new fiscal year begins September 1st. Revenues for the trailing twelve months were $9.93M and we think FYE 2021 revenues may be significantly higher.

We’re all aware that staffing for restaurants is a challenge now and PIXY may be able to thrive in that situation by helping keep food service staffed. We note that Q3 2021 revenues were 9.4% higher than Q2 2021 indicating that revenue momentum may be growing.

As there may be a swing in PIXYs value in the near term, we want to point out the company’s modest share structure, (outstanding shares (est.) 25.8M, **float (est.) 8.7M)** is important as these low numbers may facilitate a rapid movement in the PIXY share price.

Insiders hold 51% of PIXY shares indicating strength in the management’s view of the future for the company. And they are holding on to that equity as there have been no insider trades in 2021 thus far.

It looks as though everything is lined up for a near term gain in ShifyPixy’s value. The food service sector gaining momentum, the chart set-up, a new level of food delivery all could combine to impact PIXY’s value.

I will have more on PIXY soon,

The superior tech coupled with true autonomy and democracy is something very close to divine.  And this will have almost nothing to do with the massive bull run that we are likely heading into.

Real interest rates on government bonds are negative in almost every major economy on earth.  Stimulus packages and central-bank asset purchases are the new normal.  Where is all this cheap, depreciating cash going to go?

I'm not saying that this is bad for crypto or for adoption.  I'm just saying that institutions will pump it and crash it over the next several months, and I hope that you fine folks enjoy the ride.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance mortgage for lower rate?,"I'm a new homeowner, just bought my first house last year. I got a pretty good interest rate (2.25%) on a VA loan.

I've been getting letters in the mail from companies supposedly offering 1.75%. That seems far-fetched to me, as even the 2.25% number has been described as ""unheard of"" by a lot of people I met. I assume their system is automated and they just by default send letters ""potentially"" offering a rate lower than what they know I have.

I also love that there will be no taxes involved for selling or using BTC which is another great step towards BTC utilization rather than investment.

Sending and receiving funds will be cheaper than ever. My buddy spends at least $10 to send money back to his family in India every 2 weeks through Western Union. Now, he spends a fraction of a $1 to send money back home and he is so happy. I think this is a huge savings for anyone sending money back home, especially to underdeveloped countries.

Just with the plans for no capital gains tax for BTC and the cheap and quick method of sending money, other underdeveloped counties will be quick to follow El Salvador as soon as El Salvador becomes the guinea pig in September and work out the kinks from their learnings and experience.

This post lists out other great reasons why other countries might follow El Salvador's move to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. 

**I'll save you a click:**

* **Breaking USD Dependency**

&gt;Many other countries use currencies with fixed exchange rates to the USD while users of crypto worldwide has risen to 221 million according to Crypto.com’s onchain research.  
&gt;  
&gt;While dollarization was implemented to reduce currency risk and increase international investment and trade, the consequence for these nations is that they are effectively outsourcing their monetary policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve. This has created a hierarchical relationship that forgoes many of the tools required to influence their own economies by adjusting the money supply or exchange rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;This dollar-dependent system results in the loss of a national symbol, can increase inequality through the reduction in purchasing power caused by debasement, and gives up seigniorage income that reduces GDP and passes it to the U.S.

* **El Salvador Leads the Way**

&gt;El Salvador, one of the eight sovereign nations using the USD, broke from the pack, passing a bill on June 9 that will see bitcoin become legal tender in the country in September and join the USD as its official currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;This marks the first time bitcoin has been adopted as a legal tender in a sovereign nation, attracting praise from politicians in Latin America, Africa, and other parts of the developing world.  
&gt;  
&gt;El Salvador’s economy relies heavily on the remittance market, representing over 20 percent of GDP, or around $6 billion annually, with 95 percent of remittances sent from Salvadorans working in the U.S. to their families back home. Existing remittance services charge fees for these transfers that can make up a significant proportion of the value sent, particularly for smaller transfers. Funds can also take days to arrive and often require collection in person and given that an estimated 70 percent of the El Salvador population are without access to a bank account, this increases time and costs further. 

* **Open Source Money On The Public Network**

&gt;Remittance is one reason why the country is turning to bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Bitcoin provides an open monetary network in which anyone can participate without permission from a central authority. The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol, meaning that it offers a scaling solution built on top of the bitcoin network that allows for near-instant transactions with near-zero fees.

* **Alternative Technology for Developing Nations**

&gt;Whether through second-layer solutions built on top of bitcoin or through alternatives in the world of decentralized finance, there seems little doubt that the nation-state era of blockchain technology adoption has begun in the developing world, providing an alternative monetary solution to support growth, financial inclusion, and escape from poverty.

* **China Leading Central Bank Digital Currencies**

&gt;While developing countries led by El Salvador are opening up to the opportunities that bitcoin can bring, CBDCs projects are on the rise with the G20 economies, alongside finance ministers and central bank governors from other countries, many working with the IMF, World Bank, and BIS on their development. Over 80 percent of the world’s central banks now researching their implementation according to the BIS. Though widespread deployment of CBDCs does not appear imminent, get ready - it is coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;Arguably the most progress has been made by the People’s Bank of China, with pilots for the new Digital Yuan taking place in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong'an, and Chengdu. Richard Turrin, author of bestseller Cashless - China’s Digital Currency Revolution, believes that China has stolen a march on the West that politicians and policy makers better wake up to.

* **Advanced Economies In Pursuit Of CBDCs**

&gt;The Bank of Japan's CBDC project is not far behind and the U.S. Federal Reserve is currently working alongside the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a Digital Dollar with a research paper exploring a move to a CBDC expected this summer. The Bank of England recently announced the creation of a task force to explore a potential Digital Pound and is credited with coining the term CBDC back in 2016. Other advanced economies considering introducing CBDCs are Switzerland, Israel, South Korea, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and Singapore.  
&gt;  
&gt;In July, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it was progressing with a project to further evaluate a Digital Euro. Ulrich Bindseil, ECB Director General, Market Infrastructure and Payments, commented at [The 19th Financial Services Conference 2021 in](https://vimeo.com/562901421) June, that a Digital Euro would (ultimately) be central bank money made available to citizens and businesses and would seek to co-exist with cash. He noted it would also be important for the Digital Euro ‘not to crowd out private industry’ and that the project must seek synergies with industry. If the Digital Euro project were eventually to move ahead Bindseil estimated it would be four to five years to implement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though CBDCs could introduce several benefits, including reduced costs, more efficient payments, greater transparency, improved financial inclusion, and enabling of direct monetary policy, their detractors are wary of the drawbacks. There are concerns that CBDCs could lead to a system of complete financial surveillance of citizens and an erosion of privacy in contrast to pseudonymous peer-to-peer networks like bitcoin, even with fully controlled and regulated KYC / AML on and off ramps deployed to access bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless of the path of nation-states, the stage is set for the growth of both fiat and non-fiat digital currencies. Let us hope we focus on the practical use cases for citizens and businesses and that they can co-exist peacefully. The world’s monetary system looks like it may undergo the biggest changes since the Bretton Woods agreement that led to the USD becoming the global reserve currency. Whatever the outcome, financial history will invariably be written by the victor(s).

Due to the large population in India and increasing immigration volume, and personally knowing a lot of Indian people who send money back home, I see India to be one of the next countries to make the official currency a cryptocurrency. Brazil, Venezuela, and Africa may be quick to follow also.

CryptoCurrency,"Staking, Lending, and Learning. A Guide to Free Crypto.","There are a ton of ways to make money with Crypto, and not all of them require investing and trading. If you spend time researching, planning, and choosing the options that work best for you, you can make a decent amount of Crypto for free. And with an asset like Crypto, earning a decent amount now can mean a large amount later, so it's important to make sure you take advantage of as many opportunities as you can.

Each of these opportunities offer differing degrees of rewards, complexity, and risks. I’m going to try to summarize them, and get you started on whichever methods you decide are worth your time.

(NOTE: I'm providing links in this post to try and make things easier. None of these are affiliate links or anything, but its still a good security practice to enter the address yourself. In general you shouldn't trust random links connected to anything Crypto.)


**Centralised Lending Platforms**

These are lending services that offer Crypto-backed loans on a centralised platform. These platforms have two types of customers: lenders and borrowers. Borrowers are people who need liquid funds but don’t want to sell their crypto. They can get a heavily collateralized loan, which means that the amount they can borrow is always less than the value of the collateral they supply.

We are more interested in lenders. Lenders are users that deposit their Crypto and allow the lending platform to lend it out and generate interest. This is very similar to what banks do with the money you deposit with them. The difference being that with Crypto lending, the majority of the interest earned is paid to the users supplying the Crypto, rather than being paid to the bank doing the lending. Most lending platforms offer payouts to users on a weekly or monthly basis. The best interest rates tend to come from lending stablecoins, because most people taking out loans want their loan in stablecoins, but you can also earn a healthy return on most of the major Cryptocurrencies.

This is arguably one of the riskier ways to earn passive income with Crypto. With a centralized lending platform, the service doing the lending is in complete control of your Crypto. It's exactly the same as keeping your funds on an exchange. They control the keys, not you. So far none of the platforms listed here have had any hacks resulting in lost funds as far as I know, but that doesn’t mean it is impossible in the future. If you decide to use these platforms, be aware of the risks they pose.

The biggest centralized lending platforms that I know of are Blockfi, Celsius, and Nexo. I don’t have any experience with Nexo, but I have used both Blockfi and Celsius and I’ve never personally had issues with either of them. Be sure to check the interest rates for each coin you want to deposit on each service, because some will offer higher returns on specific coins than others. It is also a good idea to spread your coins out between different services, rather than risking them all to a single point of failure.

[BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/)


[Celsius](https://celsius.network/ )

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/)

In addition, many exchanges offer lending and interest rewards. These will generally yield lower returns than lending or staking directly, but also tend to be easier to use for beginners.

**Staking Crypto**

This is probably the most well known way to earn free Crypto. You can read more about Proof of Stake (PoS) and how it differs from Proof of Work (PoW) if you want, but for this post I’ll just say that you are using your coins to help maintain the consensus for a PoS blockchain. In exchange for your help to secure the network, you earn a percent return on your coins, usually paid out either weekly or once your rewards reach a certain threshold. 

One of the great things about staking is that you almost always keep control of your Crypto. It stays in your wallet, rather than being sent to a service or third party. For this reason it's usually better to stake coins when available, and only lend out coins that don’t use a PoS consensus. 

With more control comes more complexity, however. Some coins, like Cardano ADA can only be staked using certain wallets. Some coins can be staked, but will be locked up for a certain amount of time after staking, meaning that you won’t be able to withdraw them until the lockup time has ended without losing some of your staking rewards. Some coins can be staked with the click of a button, some will require setting up multiple wallets and downloading software. Some coins can be staked directly, others require choosing a validator. Each coin will be different, but here are a few tutorials for some of the more popular PoS systems.  

[Cardano ADA](https://medium.com/cardanorss/staking-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide-6dda110b2454)

[Polkadot DOT](https://stakingfac.medium.com/polkadot-staking-guide-87f93f45a828)

[Avalance AVAX](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/staking-avax-by-validating-or-delegating-with-the-avalanche-wallet-f4d9adc182a6)

[Cosmos ATOM](https://medium.com/coinmonks/cosmos-atom-staking-guide-4a4e703c998a)

Like with lending, most coins can be staked with an exchange as well. This is almost always easier to do, at the cost of lower rewards to you and less decentralization to the network. And it once again means not being in control of your Crypto. 



**Coinbase Earn**

With Coinbase Earn, you get rewarded with Crypto for watching short educational videos about a project and then answering a couple of simple questions about them. You get paid to learn about new projects, and on occasion you’ll even find a project you’re interested in. It's one of my favorite ways to get free crypto. Sure, each coin will only give out a couple of dollars, but right now you can make about $50 by doing all of them. Plus you get to learn a bit more about Crypto, which is never a bad thing!

And if you’re just really shit at taking tests, you can always find the answers to each quiz posted online somewhere. 

[Coinbase Earn](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

CoinMarketCap has a similar feature, but the rewards tend to be lower and the effort to collect tends to be higher. Not worth IMO, but you can judge for yourself

**Airdrops**

Depending on who you want to ask, airdrops are somewhere between an attempt to increase trading and awareness for a coin, and a blatant marketing move. Airdrops involve sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses, usually at random. 

There are two types of airdrops. The first simply gives tokens to people with an address that has interacted with a platform before. Uniswap and 1inch, for example, have airdropped their respective tokens to thousands of random users on more than one occasion. Some of these airdrops have been worth considerable amounts of money, especially if the people who received them held on to their coins. The problem is that, aside from using these protocols and hoping for more airdrops in the future, there isn’t much you can actively do.  

That's where bounty airdrops come in. These reward you for doing straight-forward tasks on social media to promote the coins. Things like joining a Telegram group or following a facebook page or retweeting things from the team. You are basically getting paid to market the coin. If you decide to take part in any bounty airdrops, it's a good idea to make a fresh email and new social media accounts specifically for participating in the airdrops.

**Brave Browser**

Brave is an internet browser created by Brendan Eich, inventor of Javascript, and co-founder and former CEO of Mozilla, the company behind Firefox. Brave is an internet browser that focuses on speed and privacy, by blocking all unnecessary trackers and advertisements by default. Instead of seeing ads everywhere, you instead (if you turn on the Brave rewards option) see advertisements that are nonintrusive and not targeted using personal information (they way most ads on normal browsers work.) And in exchange for viewing the ads (not clicking on or interacting with, just viewing) you are paid a portion of the advertising money in BAT, the Brave reward token. Because the browser blocks all trackers and shows you only simple unobtrusive ads, it uses less memory and less data than other browsers.

Its a great browser on its own, but the fact that I’m the one getting paid to see ads rather than websites getting paid to shove ads in my face makes this a must use for me. No, the amount of BAT you’ll earn won’t be huge, but I’d be using the browser for its privacy and speed anyway so the BAT is just a nice bonus.

**Crypto Faucets**

These are websites or apps that reward users with very small amounts of free crypto. Some will simply give away a certain amount per day, others require you complete certain simple tasks. Things like solving captchas, taking surveys, watching videos, and playing simple games. You are never going to make a ton of Crypto by using faucets, but if you’ve got spare time and nothing else to do, consider checking them out.

Here are a few faucets that have good reputations

personalfinance,"Cant work, can’t afford my CCD payment.. need advice.","Well, the shame monster is huge, but it is what it is. I racked up a big ccd debt before starting a graduate program. (20k) My ccd payment is $700/mo. I’m a professional student that will graduate into the workforce in 2023. I’m halfway through my program, so leaving is not an option. Currently, I’m living on loans and unable to work due to the rigorous course load. Plus, I will be entering clinics in January. I took a $20/hr pay cut over the summer, so my savings didn’t get bulked up like it had the last two summers and it left approximately a $8,000 deficit. Of course, with federal regulations, they cannot adjust/increase my budget for student loans to cover it because I’m a graduate student. (Don’t get me started.)

I really want to pay this card off when I finish my doctorate, but right now, I legitimately cannot afford to pay this payment plus my other bills on my fixed income. I’m looking for a roommate to help offset costs as well. 
The only thing I can think of is letting it default and go to collections and I *really* don’t want to have to do that, but I’m not seeing another option. 

Is there another way for me to limp along till graduation so I don’t ruin my credit completely?

Obviously, my finances need a complete overhaul and I will hire a financial advisor when I graduate, but it’s hard to do anything without income right now.

stocks,Senate Passes Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill,"The Senate passed a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package with broad bipartisan support Tuesday, advancing a central piece of President Biden’s economic agenda that would amount to one of the most substantial federal investments in roads, bridges and rail in decades.

The vote was 69 to 30, with 19 Republicans joining all 50 members of the Democratic caucus to pass the bill.

The product of weeks of painstaking negotiations between a bipartisan group of 10 senators and the White House, the legislation both reauthorizes spending on existing federal public-works programs and pours an additional $550 billion into water projects, the electrical grid and safety efforts, among many other projects. Of that $550 billion in spending above previously projected federal levels, $110 billion would go toward roads and bridges, $66 billion to rail and nearly $40 billion to transit. A $65 billion infusion would fund expanded access to broadband, including by providing low-income households a $30 monthly voucher to pay for internet service.

The bill includes several measures aimed at avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, with $65 billion allocated for improving the electrical grid and energy production and nearly $50 billion set aside for making infrastructure more resilient to both cyberattacks and natural disasters like floods and wildfires. Roughly $7.5 billion is dedicated to building additional charging stations for electric vehicles, while another $7.5 billion would help fund swapping out current school buses and ferries with lower-emission replacements.

financialindependence,Using bond ETFs as a savings account,"Let's say you have a chunk of cash, and you don't want to tie it up in equities. You also have bills and rent to pay.

I don't fully understand the risks here. I do know that rising interest rates have an impact on this type of investment. In the USA, we are going to see rising interest rates at some point, correct? 

What are the issues to be aware of with this strategy, including theoretical risks. How dangerous is to have 100% of your cash in a bond-ETF?

BLV is currently priced at $103. On the 3 year chart, is has dipped as low as as $83. But if it dips that low, wouldn't the monthly ""dividend"" (probably not the correct vocabulary) be higher? And if you just hold long enough things will balance out as this type of investment should keep up with inflation, as opposed to cash which is guaranteed to lose value?

Basically - forget cash-savings accounts, and instead, put all your available cash into BLV. When will strategy be a horrible a decision, and how likely is this a horrible decision in the current climate?",finance

DaddyB was revered within the safemoon community for his consistent daily analysis. He was very informative and positive when interacting with the subreddit.

He wasn’t wrong. He was then eviscerated by the community and left altogether.

The best part is he said he still was going to hold safemoon, but that wasn’t a fitting enough message. Rabid community fed on empty promises and pure hopium cannot function when prompted with the message they don’t like, and one of their best ambassadors was shooed away.

While this did not match their roadmap vision it did make sense to some for saving time.

(Again, months to develop and they have still released nothing. Other projects are moving REALLY fast nowadays.)

In early August, when the wallet was released, most realized it was riddled with bugs and missing features the team had promised. Bonfire, another new cryptocurrency, had released its wallet app within 3 days while Safemoon took nearly half a year. Many also found out that when you decompile it you will find that it’s just a reskin’d trust wallet . The user who wrote [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoonInvesting/comments/p12cg4/safemoon_wallet_beta_a_retrospective_of_red_flags/)

They will exercise their trademark [even if it’s something as small as a tiny safemoon logo in the corner of the video.](https://twitter.com/RobsCryptoYT/status/1425036522235912192 )
Targeting criticism on youtube obviously showcases where their time is going; they are trying to hide anything negative to continue their charade. 

The copyright system they are using doesn’t actually cover what they’re trying to do as well, they’re blatantly overreaching in a pretty high effort to silence dissent. Of course you’re allowed to use a company logo in your video otherwise corporations would be running amock smashing negative press left and right. **The irony of a ‘decentralized’ coin standing behind a tech giant to crush any bad words they see is as good as it gets.** The cult will rave they’re “fighting FUD”! But now their full effort is clearly not on development, but turning towards quelling any opposition. 

And finally, the r/safemoon subreddit itself has cracked down into banning any negative post or comment, but I’m not even sure if they’re connected to the team. r/safemooninvesting was created for more open discussion as a result of this.

**Basically:**

It’s hard to find a solid comparison to 2017 outside of Waltoncoin or maybe Bitconnect (which didn’t even hide the Ponzi). A team has never been so dedicated to milking a community dry of their money while keeping the horse-blinders in front of them. None of them clearly have any idea how to do app or web development, but they seem very good at leashing the community along with cryptic messages. Crypto has given me a fantastic perspective on how people can build their entire life around their expectations, and I hope you all enjoy it as well. The best part about this post is they can’t take it down.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Home Crypto Crypto Market Cap Inches Closer To $2 Trillion, What To Expect From The Market","Crypto market inches closer to a $2 trillion market cap with each rally. The total market cap had crashed following its peak back in May when the entire market saw a crash across prices. Since then, the movement of the market cap has wavered between slight recoveries and dips. The total crypto market cap had crashed to as low as $1.2 trillion at some point in June.

The market cap has now resumed its upward climb, seeing the price of top coins post tremendous gains in the market. Getting back up to $2 trillion remains a big point for the market in general. The total crypto market cap has gained over $500 billion in the past three weeks. Culminating in the present market cap value of over $1.8 trillion.

Price Surge Following $2 Trillion Market Cap
A price surge is sure to follow the crypto market hitting a $2 trillion market cap. The last time the total market cap hit $2 trillion saw the price of bitcoin pass $60K. With Ethereum shooting past $4,000.

Market cap numbers are calculated by multiplying the current circulating supply of an asset with the current price of that asset. The total crypto market cap is then gotten by adding up all of the market caps of the active cryptocurrencies in the market. This means that the higher the price of an asset goes, the higher the market cap of that asset.

By extension, this leads to an increase in the total market cap. As coins continue to see increasing prices, the total market cap is going to continue to grow, which, so far, has continued a steady climb towards $2 trillion.

Crypto Getting More Valuable
As inflation rages through countries and wages, interest rates not going up to keep up with the inflation rate, individuals and institutions will continue to look for alternatives that will provide an adequate hedge against growing inflation. Investors have now turned their attention to crypto.

Coins like bitcoin have a deflationary nature which means that they are designed to become more scarce over time. With only 21 million coins programmed to ever go into circulation, bitcoin provides the perfect hedge against inflation. This has sent investors running into the crypto market to own a piece of an asset that will appreciate at a rate faster than the inflation rate.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Buying a car (w/ loan) from a spouse,"My wife purchased a new vehicle last year and we have a 5.25% interest rate on it, which I know is high. My vehicle is paid off completely. We have looked into trying to refinance but the one time refinance fees often outweigh the potential savings we would get overall on the interest rate.

I came up with the idea of applying for a used car loan myself and then purchasing the car from her at the amount that’s remaining on her loan balance. That would allow us to lower the interest rate and avoid the refinance fees. I have a high credit score in the 780 range. We share/combine our finances completely anyway.

Anyone ever done or tried this? What are the downsides that I might be missing? It would have ripple effects on title, tags and insurance that would have to be updated accordingly is the biggest hurdles I could come up with.",finance

With adoption by corporations and institutional investors paired with a loose monetary policy and high asset inflation will definitely propel Bitcoin to $160,000 figures before the end of this year.

So when the gold flippening happens and Crypto replaces the gold reserves it will surge to $345,678 per coin! 

Other experts were notably not as bullish, predicting the price of bitcoin would drop to $22,500 as more countries adopting BTC as legal tender could negatively affect its price if they drop it as soon as it plunges.

And when the forthcoming regulations by the House of Septuagenarians takes affect It will almost be certain that even thinking about Cryptocurrency will land you in jail, the price will absolutely crash to an estimated $15.47

CryptoCurrency,If you’re still on the fence after the bear market remember fiat only been going DOWN in value since 1980. Use fiat as a tool to buy valuable wealth.,"This is for the newbies wondering about jumping in. Not you die hard warriors HODLing the line!

Since 1980 the value of the dollar has DROPPED down. Today a 1980’s dollar is worth about .31 cents. And inflation is rising even faster now!

Even a meme coin like DOGE, as worthless as it is has seen gains from .0001 and lower to settle into .25 cents today after 9 years of existence. Think about that and the thousands of times it doubled.

Now think of the tried and true Bitcoin. A powerhouse today on an upward green candle. Worth as much or less than Doge. Now each one is worth 45k today!

Politicians, nay saying economists and financial advisers, banks and others in the money world poo pooed crypto just a few months or years ago. Now they are whales buying millions to billions! Meanwhile normal conversation is crypto is bad. Fake!

My own boss scoffed at me for buying crypto. Said it wasn’t as real as the dollar. That at least his dollar is backed by gold - the fuck it is! We haven’t been on the gold standard since the 60’s or so! These are the extent of financial savvy the average naysayer has. When I made $9.4K in three days he was silent and never spoke of crypto again. Don’t fall into the naysayer world. Evolve!

The world around you wants you right where you are. Towing the economy in the way that benefits them the most. Employers see you as cattle. Banks see you as fiat to add to their investing pools. Politicians see you as tax income to be used and abused by those that pay them. The status quo wants you compliant and will say anything to keep you as a cog. Middle class or poor they don’t care.

Be it crypto, baseball cards, stamps - know any invest looks way better than HODLing fiat. Use fiat as a tool to get wealth. Fiat alone will never grow on its own with its 40+ year track record of going down.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - I wrote an university essay which got my into crypto. Hopefully others can profit from it!,"Hey Folks, (sorry for the tipo in the headline)

ive written an university essay in my IT Projectmanagement class where i could pick the topic. This essay is the reason i got into crypto. I got a perfect grade (1.0) and im very proud of it. Im from germany so i translated the essay using DeepL. Hopefully the translation isnt to bad. (I've only translated the cryptocurrency relevant parts) . The Topic in my essay was: ""Cryptocurrency as an alternative paymentmethod -Basics, opportunities and risks of digital currency."" Check it out here:

**1. Term and definition of cryptocurrency**

The term crypto has its origins in Greek. It can be translated as crypto with the adjectives ""hidden"" or ""secret"". Cryptocurrency means encrypted currency in a broader sense. An essential common feature of all cryptocurrencies is the use of a decentralized system. In 2009, the pio-nier among cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, was traded for the first time. Today, there are over a thousand different digital currencies based on the technology of Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form, but only in digital and encrypted form. The decentralized system is independent of banks and institutions. The original goal of the digital currency is to create an alternative to conventional fiat and book money. So far, the implementation is difficult due to the volatility of cryptocurrency and therefore the comparison to a speculation and investment object is obvious. Besides Bitcoin, all digital currencies are based on blockchain technology, which will be explained in the course of the paper. It has been proven that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and the price depends on supply and demand as well as the interest of the users in the market.

**2. Legal classification of digital currency**

Digital currencies are subject to legal requirements based on EU law. However, their novelty ensures that many countries do not have a uniform framework for dealing with cryptocurrencies. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, has classified cryptocurrency as a unit of account. BaFin believes that the term e-money should not be associated with the currency because it simply lacks third-party acceptance and cannot be exchanged for money in standard commercial ways. From a private law perspective, cryptocurrency is not a form of money. This is also signaled by the fact that no region has yet recognized the digital currency as legal tender. The openness for disposal transactions is basically tolerated or guaranteed by the private autonomy in German civil law. The special features and diversity of cryptocurrencies make it difficult to deal with them in a legal and appropriate manner and still require adjustments and optimization of the legal basis.

**3. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**

The anonymous author with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper called ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" in November 2008. The publication laid the foundation for today's blockchain technology. To this day, it is unclear whether Satoshi Nakamoto is an individual or a group. The true identity is unknown despite investigations by a large number of journalists and cryptography experts. Bitcoin as a decentralized system as well as the possibility of anonymous and encrypted transactions are based on the ideology of the Cypherpunk movement in the 1990s. In summary, participants of the movement advocate uncompromising protection of privacy and anonymity. The main goal is to offer a decentralized, digital payment system as an alternative during the economic crisis in 2008. The idea of a decentralized payment system is by no means new. However, a secure and robust system succeeds for the first time based on the blockchain technology used in BTC. The technology is open source and is available to anyone for further development and use for their own projects. Bitcoin is now the most popular cryptocurrency that can be bought, exchanged or sold internationally without the influence of third parties. Our society has not dealt with an alternative of banks until the release of Bitcoin. BTC now provides the impetus to question and critically assess the entire banking system. The cryptocurrency has received strong attention and popularity in the media. The reasons for this are the high volatility and the enormous price increase. Digital currencies such as bitcoin are stored in electronic wallets, so-called ""wallets"". The choice of wallet should be made depending on the intended use and area of application. Examples of wallets are hardware, mobile and desktop wallets.

**4. Fundamentals and emergence of blockchain technology**

Blockchain technology has its origins in the invention of Bitcoin by Sa-toshi Nakamoto. The technology enables data and transactions to be distributed in a decentralized manner across an unlimited number of computers in the network. First approaches of the Blockchain technology were published in 1980 by Ralph Merkle in his literature: ""Protocols For Public Key Cryptosystems"". In a blockchain, information and data are stored within blocks. New blocks are attached to an existing blockchain and cannot be subsequently modified. If a transaction occurs between two participants, the transaction is transferred to a network and stored in a block together with other transactions. This block is then validated for correctness by the remaining participants with the help of computer capacity. After successful validation, a link to the previous block is created and the block is added to the blockchain. Finally, the transaction participants see the processing of the transcation. Blockchain technology actors can be divided into participants, nodes, and miners. Participants are transaction-authorized individuals who initiate a transaction. Nodes act as control entities, are ordinary computers and verify the correctness of the miners' calculation. The main instance, called miners, are powerful computers that solve cryptographic puzzles and are essential for creating blocks. The blockchain differs from traditional databases in that all participants have equal rights and there is no administrative authority. The blockchain can be compared to an electronic register, which secures data transparently, permanently and trustworthily. Participants possess a randomly generated public and private address, called a key. Cryptographic puzzles are constantly adjusted, so that the solution takes place within ten minutes on average. Participants in the blockchain system control each other, making it impossible to manipulate the blocks. In addition to monetary transactions, the transfer of digital contract terms, so-called smart contracts, is possible. Bitcoin is based on the secure but resource-hungry Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The fastest miner receives payment in BTC for solving a cryptographic puzzle. The high level of security is ensured by the majority principle in the verification of transactions. The remuneration in the form of cryptocurrency is halved every 4 years for Bitcoin. The distribution of Bitcoin is constant and was set by Satoshi Nakamoto at a cap of 21 million Bitcoins.

**5. Bitcoin as a payment method**

The use of cryptocurrency enables payments worldwide with low transaction costs. Until now, financial service providers ensured that transactions were undeniable and not carried out multiple times. With cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, the blockchain takes care of this, decentrally and without the influence of third parties. Despite all the euphoria, Bitcoin is so far only suitable as a speculative object due to its volatility. Comparable electronic payment methods such as PayPal are bank-related, unlike cryptocurrencies. BTC as a means of payment has considerable potential in countries with a dysfunctional financial system. At the end of 2014, circa two billion people in the world did not have a bank account. In many undeveloped countries, the administration of accounts by banks is simply too uneconomical due to the lack of a legal framework of identification and ownership.45 Unbanked people, referred to in the literature as ""unbanked people,"" can make a significant contribution to strengthening the economy and global trade by using the Bitcoin network. Other benefits include transaction cost reduction for global money transfers and stabilization of the economic system. Consumers in developed countries prefer to use debit cards and credit cards. Since the cost of using exemplary credit cards is usually free or involves minor fees, consumers have no incentive to engage with a new, complex payment system such as bitcoin. The cost of credit card transactions is usually passed on to businesses and merchants. Businesses and merchants benefit from lower transaction costs when using Bitcoin as a payment method. Furthermore, transaction times can be reduced and the exchange rate risk can be eliminated. The aforementioned advantages are decisive for the fact that payment in BTC has been available in more and more online stores since 2013.

**6. Limitations of Bitcoin**

The lack of scalability and the strong price fluctuations are challenges of the modern payment method in the form of cryptocurrency. The decentralization ensures that a user bears the full risk of loss in the event of an error when executing a transaction. There are no insurances such as standard bank deposit insurance. Blockchain technology can be criticized for the high resource consumption due to mining and the slow transaction rate. Another issue is the reward of the miners. They are credited with compensation in cryptocurrency and a portion of the transaction costs. As long as this bill is economical in relation to energy consumption, this system works. Adjustments to the difficulty of cryptographic puzzles can trigger an imbalance, making mining no longer profitable. Satoshi Nakamoto always envisioned a demographic with the introduction of bitcoin. Due to the development of industrial mining capacities, this has not corresponded to reality for years. The blockchain would be vulnerable to manipulation and misuse if 51% of computing capacity is taken over, which makes the concept of decentralization fail. Bitcoin is created in a fixed algorithm. Satoshi Nakamoto decided to limit the number of Bitcoins to 21 million. This artificial scarcity is a thorn in the side of critics in the wake of deflation risks. In summary, the slow, social acceptance is due to the complexity of the entire crypto ecosystem.

If any translations are off feel free to ask further questions. I would like to have an open discussion and some feedback!

I know I can only recast once in the life of the loan but don't see the need to do it again once PMI is gone.

Lender A: 0.5 point buydown (I put in 0.5 point because my relocation package is covering some of the closing costs so might as well), after that the origination fess are almost negligible. Appraisal is required.    
  
Lender B: Same interest rate as lender B (they matched), also 0.5 point buydown. They waived appraisal, but origination fees are a lot higher (around 0.5%, so together with the 0.5 point it's 1% of loan amount in total).     
  
So overall lender A has much lower APR, as well as it's the preferred lender from my relocation company. Lender B has high APR (by around 0.08%), however they are local in Austin and is waiving appraisal, so could close faster.

CryptoCurrency,Why Token Economics is different from Economics 101,"# General Conclusion

Whilst there is no holy grail of model to design (token) economics, there is a framework that you can use. I developed this after researching for 2 years. Basically deconstructing economics to its principles and then using that to apply to the new world order that governs our lives today.

This framework comes in 3 pillars, Market Design, Mechanism Design and Token Design. Within each pillar, there are variables and sub-variables to consider. Not every variable is important to your ecosystem design and each variable has different importance level. For instance, governance can be very important for most ecosystems.

Ps: This framework can be used for blockchain and non-blockchain based ecosystems.

# 1. Market Design

Market design is the design of the environment, where your participants and tokens interact. It includes thickness (pre-requisite to network effects), no congestion (majorly solved in the network layer) and safety. A badly designed market does not capture the value from your participants. That means people rather transact outside your network. This is bad because you lose the value-add of your ecosystem.

# 2. Mechanism Design

Mechanism design is also known as ""reverse game theory"". Game theory is about making decisions and finding the right one. Mechanism design is, based on the decision we want, what rules need to be embedded in this ecosystem.

Mechanism design can be roughly split into 2 main *categories*: non-automated (humans) and automated.

It includes governance, non-financial incentives and structure.

# 3. Token Design

Token design is the design of the token itself. Tokens is the incentive of your ecosystem. If your ecosystem does not have a token, you can ignore this pillar. Just like economics is more than money, token economics is more than just tokens.

It includes token policy (like monetary policy), financial incentives (since they are the main incentives of your ecosystem) and architecture.

# What Does this Mean

As much as we want a holy grail and ""one size fits all"" model for token valuation and token economics design, there is **no such thing**. However, we can still design token economics in other ways. This framework serves as the first step towards designing your ecosystem, before the math model parts.",cryptocurrency

Forex,Fundamental Analysis &amp; Macroeconomic Data tools with Trading..,"I wonder how many people actually have a fundamental analysis or understand how to interpret macroeconomic data? if you don't understand what I just said there is a good chance that you have more to learn in regards to the foundation of the Foreign Exchange Market... Don't worry I'll be providing my tips on how to interpret the data and how you can understand those calendar events &amp; why Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde have speeches... :) 

We're all here to learn!

&amp;#x200B;

So the vast majority of forex traders only use Technical Analysis and there's nothing wrong with that, you can 100% make a career out of it and make money without a doubt! But why lift weights and not understand the science behind how the body works, how muscles are formed, what you need to eat, what routine you need in place, etc. These are the foundations... Technical Analysis isn't everything about the market it's literally just astrology, drawing trendlines, fibonacci, moving averages, bollinger bands, RSI, buy/sell indicator lol. Do I recommend disregarding technicals completely? No, if it works keep doing it! What I'm proposing is to understand why fundamentally your precious resistance/support is broken &amp; understanding buy/sell side liquidity, you will find out why price is moving bullish/bearish and it's all in relation to Macroeconomic Data &amp; Central Bank members. Firstly let's look at Macroeconomic Data, you will see on forex factory, daily fx or your broker will send what data is being released and it's scheduled for a set time every week, month, year. For instance for **Tier 1 data** you have Interest Rates, Employment (Employment Change, Unemployment Rate, NFP), Inflation (CPI, PPI, PCE) which are the most impactful data for each currency &amp; equity (Stock Index). To briefly state **data is released to understand the health of the economy** and some data can be released every week, month, quarter. The ones mentioned above are released every month, So what happens when the data is positive/bullish it's intended to push the price up and to confuse you that's not always the case, sometimes you'll see it's already rallied if the data was positive cause as we know investors buy the rumor &amp; sell the news, but here's the thing **price will most likely have a consolidation, range, order block** as the report is about to be released and **there's always a safe &amp; high risk entry**. You've also got Trade Balance, GDP, consumer confidence, retail sales, investor sentiment, PMI, production, etc. Which come down as **Tier 2** data and are impactful just not as much as the tier 1 data, so you won't get 50 pip whipsaws on gold in the mater of minutes lol. So when the US has strong employment, inflation anchored at around 2-3% &amp; Europe is having manufacturing data and requires fiscal assistance from the ECB, please **don't be surprised why EURUSD broke your precious support**... Lastly **Central Bank members**, these guys will make or break you, they will use sophisticated words so the majority don't know what they're agenda is, it's like speaking to your co-worker who has a 2 x PHD's &amp; 1 X Master degree, they talk to you like you're a peasant &amp; you will forever be below them Lols... So to state **these guys are the market sentiment**, whatever they say investors will follow, Jerome Powell downplays high inflation &amp; says the economy is getting closer to reaching it's monetary objectives, DXY will fly and your risk currecnies will decimate, Federal Reserve is getting close to Tapering and are forecasting interest rate hike by 2022, equities fall &amp; DXY starts to Moon I'm just having a joke here, but if you listen to what the central bank members say they all follow one group and that's the Federal Reserve, so whether you trade Aussie, Kiwi, Looney, Sterling, Euro, the Central Bank members for those economies all have the same tone, so listen to what the Federal Reserve is saying they all follow and reiterate the same thing over &amp; over again, literally just rinses &amp; repeats. I mean there some discrepancies but overall they all have one sentiment, as for your emerging markets they're a different beast, So I encourage you to read daily on what the central bank members say &amp; understand their agenda, if you're really keen! look at when they spoke and see how that impacted the currency, the same goes for macroeconomic data. You can wait for the high volatile moves, but if you interpret the data correctly you'll understand why currencies move certain ways, you will also understand the short/long term bias where currencies &amp; equities will trend, you'll see through the BS when central bank members speak... Who knows you might consider yourself more of an economist than a trader if you learn these principles, but here's the thing if you've read this far, imagine what you can do if you understood fundamental analysis and had a good technical understanding of the markets...

The sky is the limit my friend..

Polkadot,Crypto Interest Rates - Summary Table For August.,[removed],cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need advice on creating a financial game plan for the next 8-12 months.,"Apologies in advance for the long post. I’m 29 and currently starting a long journey to get my finances in order. I’m hoping to get advice on the best way to tackle things, particularly student loans and retirement. 

Background info on my situation:
- I have 8 student loans in default (7 federal loans and 1 Perkins loan, about $42k total). Both are currently being set up on rehabilitation programs so that the defaults will be taken off my credit history. 
- Bad credit (mid 600s) due to loans defaulting and having a lack of credit history. 
- Two credit cards: Capital One Platinum that recently got upgraded to Quicksilver ($500 credit limit). Also just got approved for a Discover It secured card yesterday and put down a starting deposit of $500 (but I may slowly add more every month or so to increase my limit to $1k-$2k and keep my utilization under 10%).
- No other debt besides student loans. I don’t have any bad spending habits, I have never missed a credit card payment and I always pay it off in full. And I only recently got the Discover It secured credit card to build credit and earn cash rewards on basic everyday purchases like gas. 
- Checking and savings account with BoA. Might move over to Ally to take advantage of their savings interest rate, TBD. 
- Started a new job that offers both a traditional 401k and Roth 401k. Company matches up to 6% but ONLY after I have been with the company for a full year. 
- New salary is about $108k. About $60 of each paycheck goes towards various benefits (medical, dental, etc.). 
- Moved back home during the pandemic to save money, so expenses are relatively low since my new job is WFH. Mainly food, gas, car insurance, and misc monthly charges like Prime, Hulu, Spotify (around ~$500 a month).

Due to the recent extension on pausing student loan payments, I will technically not have to start making payments on my federal loan rehabilitation program until February 2022 (August - January will be covered by the “$0 monthly pay” benefit as a result of the extension). After that, I will have a monthly payment of $770 until I finish the program in April/May. The Perkins loan does not qualify for the student loan pause so I will be paying $100/month from August to May for that one. 

Since moving back home, I have thankfully saved enough to pay my loans off in full once I finish the rehab programs and get the defaults off my credit history. It will deplete a big chunk of my savings though, so my boyfriend has offered to pay them off instead so that I can avoid accruing interest and pay him back in my own time. Not sure if I feel comfortable doing this though and if I do end up going this route, I plan on having a written contract between us to ensure he is protected and would pay him back within 2 years. 

So my question is, how should I approach the next 8-12 months? 

My savings currently sit at $45k. Since I will not be making rehab program payments for the next 5 months, should I put any new earnings towards my 401ks? Since I can’t get company matching for a year, should I open a Roth IRA and contribute to that instead? Or should I just keep adding to my savings/emergency fund to soften the blow for when I eventually pay my loans off in full? 

And should I take my boyfriend up on his extremely kind offer to pay off my loans so that I don’t lose $42k all at once? My pride is telling me to just pay it all off myself, but I want to do whatever is the best choice for me financially. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Overall I haven’t been proactive about my finances and I’m very late to the game, but I’m hoping to change that now. Any advice or similar anecdotal experience on student loans, retirement, credit cards, etc. is greatly appreciated, thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Best car loan comparison interest rate,"Wanting some advice/thoughts: on car loans in Australia.

What's the best deal people are got through Toyota Finance Australia in the current climate for a new Camry?

I've got Toyota down to a 4.43% comparison rate but that's the lowest they say they can go even with a few better deals out there.

Finance Ezi: 3.93% comparison rate
Stratton finance: 4.05% comparison rate
360 Finance: 3.75 comparison rate. But may only be for ABN holders.

Toyota do have deals for other models at 3.95% comparison rate but not the Camry models.

Any suggestions to get Toyota to match/beat the other rate or is it better to apply and go through the other finance companies?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off parent student loans - need help,"Hello! A few years after graduating from college, I am thankfully in a position where I’ve paid off my personal student loans. Now I’m in a position where I can help my parent pay off the student loans they took out for me. 

I think there are three ways to do this:

1. Send my parents money each month and have them pay directly 

2. Add me as a secondary payee on their loans and I pay directly

3. Transfer the ownership of the loan into my name and I take over the entirety

I want to do this in a way where there is not an extra tax burden on my parents and ideally me. 

Any advice?


Edit: for my info, my parents and I both live in the United States and the loans are from the federal government",finance
Bitcoin,Wow,"I can't believe it, but I'm at the acceptance phase. Accepting that most people are in the denial phase.

1. We've just gone through the largest recession in recorded history.
2. We have lost reality with any type of debt management.
3. Technological revolution is replacing jobs at a rapid clip.

So what are people doing?

1. Taking equity out of homes to put in pools.
2. Vegas baby!
3. No worry lifestyle

I am reminded of 2007. I was in my early 20s and I saw NO fear. Everyone had a nice german car, was renting a luxury apartment or doing a neg am loan, and life was good. The difference this time is that the government can't let it be 2008 and on the next piece of bad news we are going with negative rates. Not for shock value, I think the Fed balance sheet will be 20 trillion by 2028.

Most of your friends, colleagues, bosses, customers, etc, won't buy bitcoin. The smart ones won't tell you they have.

I have no clue what millenials without bitcoin are going to do unless they are wealthy.

CryptoCurrency,"Naked corporate influence in US politics, or how banks can legally donate 8 MILLION DOLLARS via lobbyists to congress to buy political decisions","The Slimebag Six from [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1xa1p/the_6_us_senators_attempting_to_kill_crypto/) received their dirty money 100% legally because of Citizens United and unlimited soft money.

Poor corporations, they couldn't spend like they can nowadays in 2009. There used to be these little things called ""soft money"" contribution limits. Follow me here:

* [Soft money - cash contributions to a group, Political Action Committee (PAC) or SuperPAC, that performs services for the benefit of a politician or political cause](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/hard-money-soft-money.asp)
* Hard money - cash contributions directly to political funds and politicians (limited to $5,000/candidate/election) 

In 2010 the Supreme Court of the USA ruled in *Citizens United v. FEC* (Federal Election Commission) that **soft money contributions from corporations are unlimited** because it's free speech under the First Amendment. 
### Misusing the first amendment
But wait, doesn't the First Amendment apply to people? Yes. Which means that **the Supreme Court decided that corporations are people and have free speech in how they spend their money.**

You think politicians don't care what the people think and want? You are correct! They are beholden to their corporate masters who have been allowed effectively **UNLIMITED** influence over US politics in the last decade. We see all these PACs so BIG MONEY can buy influence EXACTLY how they like.

We are living in the digital version of the Gilded Age from late 19th century, early 20th USA. Crazy wealth disparities, people ground beneath the wheels of capitalism, naked corporate deals in politics. Citizens United is one of the causes of the acceleration of greed and corporate fuckery we see in politics more and more. Wonder why it feels so similar? Well, [**Citizens United overturned political spending reform rules that have existed SINCE THE LAST GILDED AGE OVER 100 YEARS AGO.**](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained)

If we want to prevent the fuckery like [The 6 US Senators Attempting to Kill Crypto Received over 8 MILLION Dollars in ""Campaign Contributions"" From Banking Lobbyists](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1xa1p/the_6_us_senators_attempting_to_kill_crypto/), then we need to reform Citizens United.

## tl;dr We're in the digital gilded age which has the same corporate political fuckery because the Citizens United ruling overturned campaign spending restrictions that had existed for over 100 years since the last Gilded Age at turn of the 19th century. We won't make any progress with politicians without getting this money conduit out of politics.",cryptocurrency

1. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that!

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

57. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

91. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

94. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry!

Mr. President, this is very different than securities. These aren't just stocks. It's something very different. It's a medium of exchange that, if adopted more widely, could facilitate a lot of economic activity and a lot of innovation within united states of america. If in fact we pass this bill, mark my words, it's going to have a chilling effect on innovation within this sector. And what you'll see is the flight of innovation and investment related to innovation to offshore locations around the globe, places outside the united states may well be the ones to reap the benefit associated with the loss here in the united states if we adopt an unproven, untest, unknown strategy for dealing withing is, trying to adopt many decades' old regulatory policies to a completely new form of exchange, one that, by the way, values very highly the privacy of hose who exchange -- of those who exchange it. So if you're going to take away that value by requiring it be publicly disclose and by giving the federal government the ability to peer into it it you're going to stifle innovation, make a lot of people up set and makes americans poorer.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Sanity Check: Take a loan out of my TSP for my credit card debt?,"Good morning everyone. I’m going to lay out my financial situation and make my case for why I’m thinking about doing this:

I’m currently about $39,000 in debt from credit cards, due to going back to college (I already had a bachelors and masters and couldn’t take out student loans), moving out of my home state to take a new job, and (unfortunately) living outside my means. I’ve been a federal employee for over 10 years, and I’ve amassed a decent amount in my TSP. The current interest rate on my credit card debt is roughly 18.99% across all my cards. According to credit karma, my score is 640 and according to my cards fico score, it’s around 667-672.

I’m tired of tiptoeing around my situation, and I need to take control of it. It’s been causing my massive anxiety, and now that I’m applying to law enforcement positions, I need to take it much more seriously. I can’t express how ashamed I am of having amassed the debt, and I’m committing to paying this off entirely with 3 years. I make $68,000 a year, not counting overtime. Due to my HCOL area, I spend $1500 a month on rent, the areas but no means ritzy, but it’s safe and I feel comfortable here. I’m spring down my expenses to as little as possible, and I’m cutting up all but 1 of my cards (just in case of a catastrophic emergency).

Currently, a 3 year TSP loan has 1.5% interest rate and I could put my regular TSP contribution towards it ($250 a pay period), and the payment would be $500 a pay period. If I went with a traditional loan, it would be at least 12% and a much higher payment. The way I look at it, it will cost my TSP investment 3 years of growth (optimistically at 7% a year), but as bad as that loss is, it’s not as bad as the interest I’d pay on my debt.

Sorry about how scatterbrained my post is above, but my anxiety is making me type faster than normal. I’m looking for honest insights in to my situation. Should I take out the TSP loan? Thank you for your advice",finance
personalfinance,Should we refinance for lower rate considering our situation?,"There was a post here last week about someone asking about refinancing mortgage that piqued my interest regarding our mortgage...  Here's the details...

My fiance is a family medicine doctor (this is important for details).  We are both 40 years old.  We wanted to buy a house together last year and consolidate our lives.  Since covid hit we felt safer if we were all together.  We looked at dozens of houses and almost decided to wait, until we found the one.  In May 2020 we bought the house together and are living happily ever after.  Here's the details of that mortgage:

1. $480,000 financed 100%.  Bank offered us a fully financed loan with no PMI because she was an MD.  That is why we jumped on it (she had just paid off student loans).
2. Rate is 3.875%.  
3. Monthly payment is approximately $2800 (including taxes and insurance).
4. We have no other debt. We pay our credit cards off monthly.

Over a year later, I'm seeing interest rates drop significantly.  If I'm reading right, the average rate now is 2.9%.   It hurts my feelings to keep paying 3.875%.  I have been researching refinancing, and using rough calculators I figured we could save a couple hundred a month off payment.  That isn't the goal, ideally we'd like to lower total interest over the life of the loan and pay it off faster.  I'm thinking we could save at least 100K in interest if we refinanced around 3%.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm no expert in this.

We texted our mortgage advisor at our bank that setup our mortgage and asked about this.  She claims we can refinance 30 years at 3.25% for the 100% MD loan or do a MD 100% loan to value 10/1 ARM at 2.875% (not really interested in ARM).  I honestly feel like we could get a better rate somewhere else.  We could even put some down if we refinanced but from my understanding it wouldn't be required.

Should we just keep our current mortgage?  Should we look around?",finance
personalfinance,Series I bonds interest rates,"hello, I'm a minor right now with about 4-5k in savings. I am planning on going to college and would like this to help finance it, so putting it in the market isn't really an option especially with the heightened potential for a pullback right now. I was looking into a US bond called Series I bonds, it's basically a bond that you must hold for at least 1 year and can sell after 1 year at a small penalty. it gives about 3.54% interest, and that jumps up and down every 6 months. As I understand it, the interest is adjusted every 6 months and stays in tune with inflation. Now, the current rate is 3.54%. if I bought now, does that mean that I would keep getting 3.54% interest(1.77% since the holding period is 6 months) for the next 6 months, or is it monthly interest up until the next interest switch which is at the very end of October/November I believe.   


TLDR - if I bought a Series I bond right now, would I get 3.54% interest for the next 6 months after purchase or simply up until the next readjusting period?(October/November). If it's only for the next 2 months, I may hold out and wait for the updated rate in October/November, and if it's over 2-3% I'll buy it to lock in a guaranteed 1-1.5% return over 6 months and whatever comes later will just be a cherry on top.",finance

vet,Looking for help - new puppy has had diarrhea since we brought her home - over a month,"Cross-posted from r/husky:  
We got our dog (4 month old SH female) on June 28th of this year. Her first stool was mostly normal the day we brought her home, then it just got more and more liquid from there. We were feeding her what the seller said they were feeding her - Health Extension chicken and rice dry kibble with a scoop of wet HE chicken canned food on top.

First visit to the vet - positive for Giardia exposure (not actual infection) - put on panacur and metronidazole

Diarrhea continues, also notice she has a nasal infection with discharge, vet initially passes it off. We switch vets.

Next visit - positive for active infection giardia and toxidia (sp? - also I can't find this online, maybe someone mistyped coccidia on the record?) - put on panacur, metronidazole, tylan, and albon. Also given Hill's Prescription i/d canned food.

Over the next week, the stools get less liquid. Never quite normal like our other dog, but keep their form.

Once meds are done, we tried to slowly switch back to the kibble we were told she was eating at the store we got her from (Health Extension). This results in diarrhea within 48 hours.

Vet suggests another kibble - Purina One Select Puppy. We try this - no luck. Back to the Hill's Prescription canned i/d. Vet also suggests 2mg imodium tablets every other day.

Call the breeder and she says she feeds all her huskies Black Gold Puppy food. Slowly start transitioning our pup to that food - right back to diarrhea.

Vet suggests it may be inflamation that just hasn't had a chance to work itself out. Prescribes Prednisolone. We go strict canned food. Over the next few days the stool goes back closer to normal, though still soft-ish (which I keep reading is common in the breed).

However, just yesterday she got aggressive with our other dog over a snack. Three cans a day and she cleans her bowl within minutes of being fed. Vet says could be her metabolism is up due to the steroid and/or she is just still hungry. We ask about adding something mild to the food to fill her up and he suggests plain cooked brown rice. I add a small amount last night to her food and this morning her stools are more liquidy though not straight liquid.

She has been gaining weight each visit to the vet. She is not lethargic (since the nasal infection was cleared up with antibiotics). She has lots of energy and runs around all the time. The aggression was just yesterday but she got nasty with her brother (7-month old aussie doodle, bought on the same day as her). We have small kids in the house, and there is some nipping we are addressing with training but nothing out of the ordinary as far as puppies go.

personalfinance,Sell the car or keep it ?,"My lease was up in April on my 2018 Corolla. I paid $11k to buy it out, but could resell it now for $17k or so. I barely drove it much like only 18k miles in 3 years. I now live in an area that is urban, walkable, good transit, etc. 

I could sell the car, pay down some private student loans that are at 3.5% interest rate $10k total. Then the rest I could rebuild back my emergency fund savings now I used to buy the car (I rebuilt it half way now and have more to go, I figured it be better than taking out a loan). I'd save I estimate $200-$300 (roughly $125 parking, $50 gas, $100 maintenance and property tax, I'd keep my insurance though with just none owner car insurance) a month by not owning a car. $125 more if you count the amount I won't be paying in loans anymore. 

The downside being some trips will be more inconvenient. I.e two in particular, going back to my parents house and seeing my boyfriend at his place on occasion will be like...an extra 30mins to 1hr to get there and possibly relying on them to pick me up or using Lyft.

stocks,Thesis against inflation FUD?,"No doubt inflation worries has been the top-line news for months now, driving questions if and when to divest away from high growth companies into perhaps more defensive plays.

In general, while there is general consensus and reasoning in the subreddit that inflation will have a larger role to play in driving the markets (at least in the short/middle term), perhaps some injection of counterpoints can be helpful in striking a more balanced and helpful conversation.

Some inflation antithesis after some basic readings:

*  Inflation from monetary policy/pressure is a function of both money supply and velocity of money (ie, you can have a lot of money created but if the majority of which is sitting by doing nothing, inflationary pressure is limited). Large income inequality and wealth concentration has a large deflationary pressure. New money created doesn't matter when the rich don't spend and/or not actively consuming. 

* Demographics. Almost all major high income developed economies and China (the fastest, largest developing economy) is rapidly aging. The aged consume significantly less and contribute less to the economy. Likewise, the US' shrinking labor force put strong structural deflationary pressure when the total number of middle class and working class shrinks.

* US trade deficit. Record trade deficit means that everyday more US dollar is exiting the national economy circulation during import. The receiving country either uses these US dollar to purchase from the US, or is kept as reserve. The strengthening US dollar against the basket of currencies since the start of 2021 may indicate that most countries continues to favor holding the US dollar, even with the QE from the FR.

* Technology. Technological advancement and increasing productivity are inherently deflationary. Technology creates efficiency, which increases productivity which reduce costs. Technological innovation is not a trend that will plateau or reverse, technology is exponential. 

All the above presents a structural deflationary environment that even loose monetary policy will struggle to balance against. I am of the thinking that growth play shouldn't be discounted merely because of inflationary forces. Beyond 2021/2022, low inflation (as was the case prior to the pandemic) will be the norm again.

INFLATION 

Everyone will have at least a basic understanding of what inflation is. It’s the very reason why we tend to say to ourselves “remember back in the day when “x” item cost “y” amount but now it’s so much more expensive”. However, essentially inflation is the measurement of how much the purchasing power of a given currency declines overtime and occurs when the supply of that currency moves into circulation, the more it increases the more that currency is devalued. As this devalues occurs, the price of goods and services rises. If this balance of supply and circulation is not monitored then economic consequences can ensue. Therefore, the financial authorities or central banks will closely monitor and control the supply and interest rates. Typical average inflation target rates are around 2-3% and the CPI (consumer price index) helps gauge this. You may wonder why it is needed though, well simply a moderate amount of inflation can lead to economic growth by encouraging individuals to spend their money, therefore, stimulating the growth of the economy. If a person knows an item will be more expensive in the future, they are more likely to spend it now.

Here are some benefits of inflation: 

- Inflation allows economic growth 
- Inflation allows adjustments of real wages 
- Inflation allows adjustment to prices 
- Inflation is a better alternative to deflation which can lead to an economic recession

However, a negative is inflation will overtime devalue an individuals wealth and savings  and is even more affected through poor interest rates on saving accounts, also if wages fail to keep up with the rate of inflation then  real wages fall. Furthermore, the larger issues surrounding inflation occur when it’s not controlled effectively and will be discussed next. 

HYPERINFLATION 

Hyperinflation occurs when there’s an excessive amount of circulating money supply within an economy within a relatively short time period and can be caused by excessive printing or by demand pull inflation where there is an imbalance between supply and demand. This in turn increases the prices of goods and services greatly, a loaf of bread for example may cost “x” amount 1 day and then a few days later is more expensive. Increased consumer spending or a loss in confidence within the currency can also lead to hyperinflation and tends to occur during an economic crisis where economic growth is decelerating and standards of living is lowered. However, hyperinflation can be beneficial for those in debt as it essentially eats away at that debt. An example of a country suffering from hyperinflation can be Venezuela which in 2019 saw an inflation rate of 65,000% or Zimbabwe that actually printed a 1 trillion dollar note. 

Some ways of reducing inflation include increasing the base interest rate which in turn raises the cost of borrowing for other banks. This encourages them to raise their own interest rates, meaning that companies and consumers will find that saving gets higher returns and borrowing is expensive.
This lowers spending in an economy, causing economic growth to slow. With more cash held in bank accounts and less being spent, money supply tightens and demand for goods drops. This lowering in demand for goods should make them cheaper, therefore, lowering inflation. An alternative is to alter the currency basis by switching to another currency, an example of a country doing this will be Venezuela adopting BTC as legal tender to try and reduce hyperinflation and the reliance on the USD. 

In periods of hyperinflation investors will tend to move their wealth away from assets such as cash or certain stocks as the real value is decreased and move towards investments such as real estate and REITs as property values increase with inflation and gold due to its deflationary fundamentals as a limited supply asset. This is also where Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold and a hedge against inflation due its deflationary properties and known maximum supply. 

DEFLATION 

Deflation is where the value of a currency or asset increases relative to goods and services and tends to occur from a limited supply of money or an increase of goods and services whereby the price is reduced relative to inflation. This economic downturn leads to a drop in prices for goods and services and of course inflation will be below its 2-3% target and into the deflation danger area. Due to the fact the currency value increases this prompts deflationary behaviour such as reduced spending and banks stopping lending which leads to a credit crunch. Deflation will make individuals hold onto their cash expecting an item to continue to fall in price and become cheaper. This stagnant growth means goods cost less and produce less value for the company that manufactures them. Consequently, this can lead to lower wages and unemployment rates rising as companies try to save money, and due to falls in wages and rise in employment, this also means individuals reduce their spending. Deflation tends to lead to a recession and a deflationary economy can tend to last decades. An example of this is Japan which has been stuck in a deflationary economy for over 20+ years. Another negative effect will be for those in debt as it remains constant and the real value does not fall alongside goods and services but rather increases in terms of currency real value. 

At times of deflation investors tend to remain in cash as interest rates tend to be higher meaning storing your cash is more valuable, less risky and more secure. Investors that have alternative assets will tend to make sure they’re liquid assets so it’s easy to convert into cash as illiquid assets may be hard to get a fair value at times of deflation. Other alternative deflationary hedges can be dividend paying stocks or defensive stocks such as medical related stocks for example as these will provide protection regardless of the economic state as everyone will always need medical care. Finally, investors will tend to move towards bonds as the risk is minimal compared to assets such as stocks.

personalfinance,"""Career Starter"" Loan/ Career Kickoff Loan","I am a senior in college that will be commissioning in the Army this upcoming May. USAA and Navy Federal both have the option to take out career starter loans up to $25,000 within a year of commissioning to be repaid within five years. These loans have a relatively low average interest rate. My credit falls now at around 750, so think mine will be about the average.

I was considering taking out the loan for a few reasons,

a)  To buy a new laptop, I've had this one since 2017 and it's on its last leg (or anything else I need) -- like actual necessities or any expenses I incur with moving.

b) To build credit -- I intend to let as much as $20,000 simply remain in my savings just to have for emergencies. I'll simply pull from there to make my payments over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I should've left the bit about the laptop out. It was just an example of things I would be willing to spend the loan money on -- essentials for my career. My primary intention would be to build credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's info straight from Navy Federal:

Career Kickoff Loan

Get  a low 2.99% APR on a 60-month loan of up to $25,000. We’ll even defer your payments until 180 days after your commissioning or 45 days after your loan origination date if you’re already commissioned.[1](https://www.navyfederal.org/membership/rotc-ocs.html#MB14)

""Credit subject to approval. The first payment will be due 180 days after the applicant commissions or 45 days after loan origination date if already commissioned. **Example:** Recently commissioned member takes out a $25,000 loan for 60 months at 2.99% APR. Loan repayment starts 45 days after loan origination and monthly payment is $449.67.  Applicant must establish and maintain a Navy Federal checking account with direct deposit of pay within 90 days of the loan date and throughout the term of the loan. If not maintained, the interest rate on the loan will revert to the prevailing personal loan rate. 

[↵](https://www.navyfederal.org/membership/rotc-ocs.html#MB14-ref) ""

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a smart decision? Or should I  just continue as normal? I definitely don't need the loan to contribute to any expenses I currently have but think it would be a good opportunity to build credit. and expand my portfolio since after paying off my car and my student loans, I only have a couple of credit cards.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""Email your Congressmen"" they said, ""All will be OK"" they said","I recently watched the Charles Hoskinson [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcffJazqUHU) regarding the US infrastructure bill and his plea that all of us (in the US) reach out to our congressmen and congresswomen to ask them to not support the bill. 

Now I enjoy living in a democracy, but to be honest with you good people of Reddit, I have rarely voted due to a combination of apathy, cynicism and laziness.

However, Charles's message compelled me to take action. And by this I mean the minimum action to email my two senators (as a side note has anyone tried calling their congressmen's office and talking to their office on the phone? How did it go?)

So I Google to find out who my Senators are (like I said, I am very apathetic to politics). I find I have Senator Duckworth and Senator Durbin (for those non-US persons, each US state has two senators for a grand total of 100; 50 states x 2 senators per state for all those who want to check my math).

First I emailed Senator Tammy Duckworth (IL-D). Her website was easy to find and of course there is an option to contact the Senator so she can hear from the good people she represents.

I filled in a basic form and typed a message I found [here](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/) (but slightly modified for an email versus a call).

At the bottom of the form was an interesting checkbox asking if I wanted a reply from my congressperson. ""Well, sure"" I thought. Now, I am not so naïve to expect a self-written response from the Senator coming back to me, but what I got was a bit… shall we say…high level:

*""Dear WorldTraveller19,*

*Thank you for contacting me to share your views on the critical issues facing our nation. I appreciate you taking the time to make me aware of your concerns.* 

*I am dedicated to representing my constituents throughout Illinois and I truly value every opportunity to hear from you. Understanding what issues are important to you helps me better serve your needs and more effectively address your priorities. I will continue my work in Congress to address the important issues facing our country and work with members of both parties to solve them. I was sent to Washington to get results and to represent every corner of Illinois.*

*Please be assured that I will keep your comments in mind should legislation regarding your concerns be brought to the floor of the Senate. I hope you will continue to contact me about the many issues that this Congress may consider.*

*Thank you again for sharing your thoughts with me. Please stay in touch with me by visiting my website at* [*www.duckworth.senate.gov*](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov)*, where you can sign up for my email list, access my voting record and get additional information on important issues facing our country.* 

*Sincerely,*  
*Tammy Duckworth""*

\+++

Again, I was not expecting anything like a personalized response to my message, but if this is the same form letter reply any issue gets whether it is for gun rights, immigration, abortion, crypto, etc. I really wonder what the point of ""getting a reply"" is.

But, onwards and upwards. Next is Senator Dick Durbin (IL-D). I follow the same process and type our my message along with again a request to get a reply. Surely enough the next day I received the following:

*""Dear Worldtraveller19:*	

*Thank you for contacting me about cryptocurrencies.  I appreciate hearing from you.*

*Bitcoin is one of the most popular forms of cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrencies are decentralized virtual currencies that rely on open source ledgers (blockchain technology) to substantiate payments instead of third-party intermediaries such as banks.  In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has been particularly volatile, generating a lot of interest from those looking to buy and sell coins to turn a profit.*

*Bitcoin is not considered legal tender in the United States and is classified as property by the Internal Revenue Service.  The national currency of the United States is the dollar, which is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and circulated by the Federal Reserve System.  There are currently no discussions to replace the dollar with Bitcoin as the national currency of the United States.*

*The emergence of virtual currency presents a number of exciting new frontiers, but can also pose serious risks to consumers.  I will keep your thoughts in mind as Congress continues to explore policies related to cryptocurrencies.*

*Thank you again for contacting me.  Please feel free to keep in touch.*

*Sincerely*

*Richard J. Durbin*

*United States Senator""*

\+++

Now this reply, while still a form letter, was a bit better. Of course the first paragraph I found a bit condescending….you would think someone emailing about Cryptocurrencies would know a bit about Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrencies. Also, my message was not mentioning Bitcoin specifically so still a bit off the mark.

Moving on to the second paragraph, I was very interested to find out the currency of the US is the dollar. I had no idea.

Also good to know it is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing

To end his response, fine to hear there are no plans to replace the US dollar (if that is what it is called, I sometimes forget) with Bitcoin. But again not the issue I emailed about. But OK, like I said, I was not expecting a personal reply and if in some blue (reddit) moon I did get one, I would be amazed if they would actually understand the issue well.

""But hey, oh well right"". I tried to fight for crypto (as much as an email can do) and I also took a small active part in my democracy by asking my representatives to take action on an issue I care about (again, as much as an email can do).

Now my question to you guys. Have any of you reached out to your representatives (in the US or in other countries) and have any interesting and/or meaningful feedback to share from the experience?",cryptocurrency

I just wanted to check if my math is correct and if someone has a better insight on how I should map this out.

My salary will be $55,000 and my job matches 100% on the first 3% of deferred compensation, plus a 50% on deferrals between 3% and 5% (4% total) of total compensation each year. So If I max out during the two years and withdraw the money before I leave the U.S., wouldn't it still give me more $$ than I put even after the 10% penalty + taxes (approx. 25% for federal and 3.3% state)? Is there something else other than the penalty and taxes that I am missing?

personalfinance,Paid Student Loans in Two Lump Sums - One Cleared / Other Rejected?,"Hey yall,

Before I begin, I just want to apologize in advance if this is not the right section to post this. I just wasn't sure a better place to post this question / story. Now on to the story:

I could use a little advice or some insight into this problem I'm having with paying my student loans in lump sums. Okay, so last Thursday 8/5 I decided to pay the total for my student loan over at myfedloan which came out to around $49,000 and change. So I tried to pay the loan as just one lump sum but they kept prompting me to pay in no more $25,000 increments. So I made two separate payments of the same amount to equal the total $49,000 - so $24,500 and $24,500. After making these separate payments via a wire transfer from BOA, I get two confirmation emails of the two payments from myfedloan. It says that it will take a few business days and so I wait. On Tuesday 8/9 one of the payments were withdrawn from my account. However, the other was never withdrawn from my account and it is now Wednesday 8/11. I have almost $60,000 in cash in the account so I don't think that is the issue, but I was wondering what was going on so I spoke with BOA customer service to see if they could see the withdrawal coming on their end and maybe it is delayed. After explaining this situation, the customer service agent had mentioned that since the two payments were done on the same day and only minutes apart from one another, they should have been drafted the same day as well from my account - which doesn't explain why only one went through and not the other. The agent said that they only see the one attempt on their end and they didn't see any rejections of the wire transfer or withdrawal either. So the agent said, go back to myfedloan and talk to them about it because it might be a problem on their end. I call myfedloan and speak to a customer service rep there and explain the situation. Essentially what the customer service rep at myfedloan had told me was that the two payments were definitely processed and the account was showing a $0 balance of money owed on the loan. However, she said that it is likely that the loan could have been rejected. I assured them that I have more than enough money in my account and I'm pretty sure I input all of the info correctly on my account when I put in the routing and account numbers. I just find it strange because when I go back into my account on myfedloan on the computer the account won't let me look at the routing number or account number I input so I have no idea what was even put in during the wire transfer to verify it was input correctly or not. I was thinking also maybe because it is the same amount twice someone thought it was put in as an accident but I actually meant to do this. At this point I'm not sure what to do and I'm just getting fed up with going back and forth between the bank the loan servicer. Has anything like this happened to anyone else before? What would you do in this situation?",finance

This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!!

51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

91. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

94. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

98. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

104. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

105. Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema sought the required unanimous consent, but their attempt was thwarted by a disagreement over $50 billion in defense spending.  [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503)

**Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.**

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *–  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication —  not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology:

*TheStreet  Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares.

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered  the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.

**6. Piotroski F-Score**

The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.

**7. Moody’s Daily Credit Risk**

Moody’s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.

**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:

*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*

*A  low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

CryptoCurrency,Most used abbreviations in the cryptospace and top 25 coins explained (as of august 2021),"# This is an updated version from [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0jug3/most_used_abbreviations_in_the_cryptospace_newby/) of march. Which includes new abbreviations from the comment section and new words that popped up since then.

As we welcome newcomers everyday to this sub it's nice to have a all you need to know abbreviations guide to get them started. When i first started reading up things (because **DYOR**) i came across terms i've never heard of. So here are some of the most common abbreviations you will come across while doing research about cryptos. In this list you can also find the top 25 crypto as of **12 august 2021** wich are explained in mostly 2 - 4 sentences. I've taken some insparation from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) by u/Layneeeee as a guideline for some of the top 25 tokens. But also included some links to the white papers of them.

I hope this list can help new people coming in and maybe help some people that are just lost in all the jargon people use.  I've put sections in the list to also help make the list easier to read. Maybe i missed some, so if anyone want anything added, comment and i will update it.

CryptoCurrency,Why overcoming banks is an important goal for crypto,"Banks make money by giving out loans and collecting interest and a variety of charges (and also offer customization options, such as fixed/floating interest rates, insurances and other plans designed statistically to make you lose money).

We've seen lending enter cryptospace in the form of businesses and defi protocols. Whats common to these players in crypto, is that they only (to my knowledge) offer overcollateralized loans. Meaning that you borrow at a loan to value (LTV) of 25%, 50%, or something like that. So in 50% LTV case you ""lock"" your crypto worth say $1000 to get a $500 loan.

Whats missing in the crypto ecosystem are loans where you get more money than you have to lock in, such as mortgages. In mortgages you make a down payment for a house (or dish out collateral) of like 20% and the bank pays the remaining 80%. Loans for a car work the same way and of course there are completely uncollateralized loans.

I feel that having undercollateralized loans is important for the ordinary person, since buying a house or a car is far more relevant than taking a loan against your highly volatile assets.

If this can be done using a smart contract, I'd imagine loans originated this way would be much cheaper (less overhead) and it would bring lots of people into crypto.

I realize this is easier said than done. Maybe through extensive use of NFTs for property rights? Do we need a centralized entity to manage this or can we DeFi our way in? Discuss.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Tax withholding with multiple jobs,"My employment situation is changing this month, and I’m wondering what the best way to set up my tax withholding will be.

Previously, the vast majority of my income came from self-employment. I also had a second job that paid a very small salary, and I didn’t have any federal taxes withheld for that job. I paid my taxes quarterly, which worked out fine for me.

Now, I am still going to be self-employed, but I am going to have two new jobs starting this month, and I am going to be doing less self-employment work. I am still paying quarterly taxes on my self-employment like I was before (which means I will probably overpay by the end of the year), but my new job is also withholding federal taxes from my paycheck. I’m not sure if the second job will or not. Is it just up to my personal preference whether I want to consolidate the withholding into one job? Or is there some tax advantage to doing so? If not, I’m fine with spreading out the withholdings over multiple jobs.",finance

retirement,What are retirees using to draw from?,"Any retirees or near retirees thinking about this?  With cash and equivalents paying zero, it does not make sense to put 3-5 years of expenses into that and lose 3-4% per year of value due to inflation.  You cannot also put it into stocks or even a 60/40 fund and risk losing 20%+ when you need it.  Even a bond fund or index or TIPS could lose value in a rising interest rate environment.  So am considering having my draw money, 3-5 years, in a Target Date Retirement Income fund, i.e. FIKFX, Fidelity Freedom Index.  FIKFX is roughly 20% world stock indexes, 40% total bond index, 20% TIPS, and 20% cash.  IT is only 2 stars due to lower returns caused by the high cash content vs. others in the category.  I figured this fund automatically rebalances so I wouldn't have to keep moving between cash/bonds/stocks.  Expense ratio is only .12%.  You are about as diversified as you can be, with low risk, an historical returns over 4% which would cover a typical safe withdrawal rate.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on next steps,"Input on paying off federal worth of loans

Im trying to figure out whether it is worth it to pay off approximately $13,000 worth of federal loans.

24 years old, recently sold my Tesla Model 3, which had enough positive equity in it for me to pay off my student loans and be completely debt free and to leave some money for an E-fund. I also have a unique account that can earn me 7.5% on my money (of course, it isn’t without risk).

Breakdown of my finances:

Base Gross Income: ~$54,000/year, ~4500/month

Monthly Expenses

Groceries: ~$200 (total between gf and me)

Eating out: ~$50

Phone: $0 (payed off and on parents plan)

Rent: $550 (my half)

Federal Student Loans-
1) $3,000 @ 4.29%
2) $1,800 @ 4.29%
3) $4,800 @ 3.76%
4) $1,700 @ 3.76%
5) $2,000 @ 4.45%

Total monthly payment: ~$250/month

Car Info: 

i sold my Tesla Model 3 and now I will be receiving approximately $12k from my positive equity. This also frees up about $950/month (loan payment and insurance). *nervously laughs*

Savings/Investments accounts

~$5,000 in HYSA 

~$13,000 in Roth IRA

~$20,000 in Roth 401k 

I put 10% of my income into my 401k, starting to refill my E-fund, and have been contributing weekly to my Roth IRA

 ($6k/52=~$115/week)

So now the question again: when I receive my equity check, I will have enough to pay off my federal loans; should I do it or should I take an alternative route such as park it in the 7.5% interest account? Or other suggestions?",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Proprietary black-box ML systems for decision-making in society,"A product, NarxCare, [1] uses ML to predict whether a patient is likely to be abusing prescription medication in the United States. Doctors in several states are legally required to consult NarxCare, and potentially base their decision on the outputted risk score, when prescribing controlled substances to patients.

A recent article [2] (worth the long read if you have the time IMO) highlights some of the problems with this approach. Below is a small excerpt from the article.

&gt; NarxCare also offers states access to a complex machine-learning product that automatically assigns each patient a unique, comprehensive Overdose Risk Score. Only Appriss [the company responsible for this system] knows exactly how this score is derived [...] At least eight states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan—where Kathryn lives—have signed up to incorporate this algorithm into their monitoring programs.

&gt; Appriss is adamant that a NarxCare score is not meant to supplant a doctor’s diagnosis. But physicians ignore these numbers at their peril. Nearly every state now uses Appriss software to manage its prescription drug monitoring programs, and most legally require physicians and pharmacists to consult them when prescribing controlled substances, on penalty of losing their license. In some states, police and federal law enforcement officers can also access this highly sensitive medical information—in many cases without a warrant—to prosecute both doctors and patients.

&gt; Nearly all Americans have the equivalent of a secret credit score that rates the risk of prescribing controlled substances to them. And doctors have authorities looking over their shoulders as they weigh their own responses to those scores. [...]

&gt; But the most troubling thing, according to researchers, is simply how opaque and unaccountable these quasi-medical tools are. None of the algorithms that are widely used to guide physicians’ clinical decisions—including NarxCare—have been validated as safe and effective by peer-reviewed research. And because Appriss’ risk assessment algorithms are proprietary, there's no way to look under the hood to inspect them for errors or biases. Nor, for that matter, are there clear ways for a patient to seek redress. 

I thought that /r/machinelearning would be a good forum for discussion on this topic, as well as the wider question if it is appropriate to replace human decision-making with a data-driven black box ML algorithm for decisions affecting the lives of individuals.

Is this Appriss thing a response to America's idiosyncratic opioid crisis? Or symptomatic of wider acceptance that decision-making processes can be usefully offloaded to an algorithm? Personally, I think that an increasing portion of this sort of decision-making will be delegated to black-box ML systems in the future, whether we like the idea or not. One potential argument for this is that ML systems may be able to outperform humans on some objective metric by making 'correct' decisions on the bulk of the dataset. For this example, legislators may point at things such as (hypothetical) declining opioid addiction rates - is this enough to justify the cost of Kafkaesque false positive / false negative cases?

*TL;DR*:
Proprietary black-box ML algorithm used to control patient access to prescription medication in the United States. Is this sort of thing a good idea?

computers,Paranoid over Ebay Transaction and GPU - Is this even possible?? GPU spyware?,"I will try to make this weird store as short as possible.  Sorry if this isnt the right sub to post something like this in.

I recently purchased a graphics card on ebay from a seller (seller was located in japan)

Was a good price on the card with the current pricing and demand.  Card was a Nvidia GTX 1650 Dual used but with box

I recieved the card but upon opening it,  it wasnt the same card listed in the auction.  It was a very similar Asus GTX 1650 Phoenix.   A slightly underpowered version of the 1650 i thought i had purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to the seller to inquire, as this was a different card.   The seller responded very quickly, apologized and said they had made a mistake and that the dual card was no longer in stock.   He then told me to keep the item and he was sending me a full refund.  a 300 dollar refund.  Literally done through ebay, and is currently pending in my transactions as a refund to the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

This is VERY weird to me, and all sorts of warning signs are going on in the old brain.  I could understand if this was a cheap item, but 3 hundo aint cheap.  The seller also charged no shipping, but sent it from japan to me on the east coast of the USA as Fedex Priority International shipping.  That could NOT have been cheap.  i got it in less than 48 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

...  I pretty tech savy, but is there any new malware/spywayre/keyloggers  that can be flashed into a GPU?  I know these kinda tactics are usually done on cheap items like flash drives and such. but a 300 $ card?

&amp;#x200B;

Also looking at the sellers previous feedback,  about a month it go it seems the seller sold the same kind of card to another person whose feed back stated ""Seller sent wrong card and stated the 1650 dual was no longer in stock.  Seller did make things right! A+""

To everyone else that'll catch you up.

P. S. IT TAKES ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO REVERSE. and consider the human factor by reading the news and seeing what they're trying to get people to do.

Sorry for the lag it takes me a few hops to bypass the cluster ban.

Added: just like the guide says and has been mentioned before lots of times, look for bot thrashing as an obvious sign of steering and watch bot ceilings and floors by looking for trailing oughts on the bid or asks side. Not all bots do it but the bot in question that seems to have the most leverage does.

There are gonna be more tools to be released soon but this is a test to see if crowd intelligence is a real thing. And so far it seems like it might be. Regardless I'd rather the wisdom of the crowd prevail over the ""wisdom"" of the whales.

CryptoCurrency,I quit my job as a Federal Transportation Engineer to get into crypto investing!,"Hi folks, 58/m Transportation Engineer reporting for duty.  

Been working on Federal highway infrastructure for over 40 years.  Back when I started in the late 70s, people believed that long, sexy slabs of asphalt manicured to the most pristine smoothness would deliver us straight to the future by way of our gasoline-powered love mobiles.  I spent the hours in traffic on my way to work dreaming about the wider, faster highways that would someday kick the American economy into overdrive.

However, lately, a new form of infrastructure has come to my attention.  Namely, these funky computer tokens my youngest daughter (14/f/cali) told me about last week.  At first, I thought they were just a joke about dogs, and perhaps a Ponzi scheme at best, but now I see that they are in fact the next conduit that will transport us to a future of virtual prosperity.

I immediately put in my notice at the Department of Transportation, and have decided to bring my expertise in infrastructure engineering to the crypto economy.

I feel at times everyone needs to try and remember that a lot of people come to crypto for different things. Yes there are a lot of people looking for money. Sometimes in the wrong way, a quick turn around can be found but PLEASE do a lot of research first and don’t just FOMO. Others are here for the long burn, waiting years for that magic turn around. Others see the sense in holding your money somewhere away from the grabby hands of banks. Some prefer a 5% interest rate to a 0.01% (Who blames them?).

But I think the most important thing to remember is that some people are here because they want to see technological expansion. The idea that your money is your own money sounds like a simple concept, but it is only just being truly developed into a proper field.

personalfinance,Co-Signed on a Student Loan.. want to try and get out.,"About 5 years ago I made a stupid mistake and co-signed on a student loan of about $5k for a friend. She really wanted to go back to school and I thought it would be a nice thing to do… fast forward to this year I am trying to buy a house and my credit score took a huge hit because she was a few months late on the payment. My friend is a server and trying to get back on her feet after being unemployed earlier this year due to COVID. 

She is working with the loan company to try and lower her interest rates, but is there anything I can do to help speed this process along or even get my name off of the loan? I have asked her if she has a parent that is willing to co-sign instead of me. 

My other idea would be to drum up a basic contract between her and I, and make the monthly payments on her behalf and have her pay me back to make sure the payments are not late.  If she doesn’t pay, I can take her to small claims and post a lien against her. Of course I don’t want to have to deal with the situation in that way.

CryptoCurrency,Actual Unpopular Opinion: Decentralized Crypto will Never be a Universally Adopted Currency,"Sick of seeing the ""unpopular opinion"" posts that are actually absurdly popular, so I thought I'd state an opinion that will properly get hate. 

Decentralized cryptos are and will be extremely impractical and a step backwards as a mainstream (for example, dollar replacing) currency for the foreseeable future outside of niche/fun uses. This isn't about any other advantages of crypto, such as a store of value or DeFi or whatever niche use that crypto bulls come up with. It's specifically about adoption as a mainstream currency.

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Economic/Regulatory\]: **A deflationary currency is awful**

If it was at risk of becoming too popular, I would suspect that governments would ban it for economic reasons because deflationary currencies are awful. This rules out many popular decentralized crypto currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Economic\]: **Volatility**

It should be stable BEFORE it becomes universally adopted for people to be inclined to want to use it and flip their currency usage, but stability will (probably?) happen *after* it is universally adopted. The cart is before the horse, but unfortunately the horse is welded behind the cart. 

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Regulatory\]: **Governments won't like it (for damn good economic reasons)**

Governments with their own fiat currency are going to hate the idea of a decentralized currency. Manipulating the monetary supply is one of the best tools that they have to control the economy. This is usually a good thing. It undeniably mitigated a lot of the economic impact of covid. I know everyone hates inflation, but it does have the positive effect of encouraging economic investment.

There's a reason why economists like Yellen and the Fed are skeptical of crypto. It's not because of banks bribing them. It's because it would fundamentally remove their ability of doing their jobs, which is manipulating the monetary supply to ensure full employment. 

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Social/Regulatory\]: **No third party verification means that lots of people are going to get scammed**

Due to crypto's decentralization, scams have the potential of running rampant. Instead of having an authority like a bank shield people from scams, it becomes a free for all. I can't imagine trusting any of my relatives with handling their own crypto off of an exchange. If a third party remains as a conduit for trades, the question must be asked: what is the damn point of decentralization?

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Technological/Social\]: **Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work**

This isn't a fundamental barrier, but it is a social barrier. People have valid reasons for disliking either PoS or PoW. I know that not all cryptos implement these in such a bad way, but the major ones do (and still will with for example ETH2.0).

Proof of Work: don't give me that ""green energy"" BS. I've worked at a utility company. Unless you live in a handful of places (Iceland? Ireland I guess?), your grid has coal and natural gas plants on it. There is barely a distinction from the wind farm down the road and the coal planet a hundred miles away. Reducing power consumption is the way to go. Side note: the ""it heats my house"" argument is also ridiculous because a typical heat pump is about 300% as efficient as a resistive heater. You also need heat during peak demand in the winter which means more damn power plants. At the end of the day, the planet is always worse off due to Proof of Work.

On the other hand, Proof of Stake is pretty much the opposite of what you would want as a currency. It increases your desire you to hold your currency and not invest it into the economy. It is also terrible for wealth inequality as giving guaranteed wealth growth with zero actual investment might be the dumbest idea ever implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Social\]: **Harder to use in addition to being a change from the status quo**

It's hard enough getting people to change from physical cash to credit/debit. That's with pretty much universal adoption in addition to the financial system holding their hand every step of the way through that process. 

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Technological\]: **Scalability**

Decentralized cryptos are shit at scaling, often becoming exponentially more inefficient. A popular comparison is VISA. There is no decentralized crypto that will even be close to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Technological/Economic\]: **Transfer fees**

The gas/transfer fees for major decentralized coins are ridiculous and for most climb with scale. If you can send $50 million for $2.50 but it also costs $2.50 to send a single dollar then it is not helpful. ""But lightning network!!!"" Lightning network still has (lower) fees in addition to introducing new security risks. Granted, many smaller coins are better, but in many cases their scalability is questionable outside of a handful of good ones which leads me to my last point.

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Anecdotal\]: **But El Salvador is doing it right now!**

They're doing it primarily as a stunt to give foreign investors reason to invest in bitcoin mining to boost their flaming ruin of an economy. It's not out of practical use, and it's coming with a whole host of other economic squabbles. 

&amp;#x200B;

* \[Anecdotal/Social\]: **But won't the coins that are best as a currency rise to the top?**

Haha. I'll believe it when I see it. The ones that are best at being a currency (not perfect, but better than average) like Nano have actually been doing terribly. Nano has been dropping in and out of the top 100, which is worse than it was doing even a few months ago.

Previously in April, the Census Bureau had [released](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/nyregion/new-york-census-congress.html) a preliminary report indicating population shifts, but this was not a detailed review of the data. This [much more detailed data set](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/population-changes-nations-diversity.html) showed a far more nuanced view of the population data, with some highlights by the Census Bureau being:

* New York City remaining the largest incorporated city, but Los Angeles County remaining the largest county

* The fastest growing US Metro being The Villages in Sumter County, FL, which grew at 39% in the past decade to 130K people. The Villages is known for being a large retirement community, with the county as a whole having the highest median age of any county in the United States

* The non-Hispanic white population has declined below 60% from 72% in 2010, and declined numerically for the first time in US history

* Large population gains in urban areas and counties with populations in excess of 50K people, on average declines in population in counties with population below 50K

CryptoCurrency,My staking experience so far,"I learned about staking only recently, and decided to start moving my coins off exchanges into their respective wallets to take advantage of the passive income, and to see how the coins feel when moving and using them, just for fun. Here's my experience so far with ADA, ALGO, ATOM, ONT, SOL, VET and XTZ.

**ADA: Yoroi Wallet, ROA: ~5%**

To stake you need to go to their ""Staking Center"" page in the wallet and choose a pool to delegate to. Minimum of 5 ADA required. Doing so and switching staking pools costs a fee of about 0.17 ADA. Then you wait for one epoch to finish, those are about 5 days long, and then you start earning rewards each epoch, for 100 ADA you get 5 ADA per year. Your funds are not locked, so no need to unstake and you can move your coins at any time. The epochs are quite long but at least it's nicely displayed in the app, so all in all it's still quite fun to watch. The only wallet that doesn't display the value in FIAT. 1 ADA = 1 ADA, apparently.

**ALGO: Algorand Wallet, APY: ~6%**

Pretty simple looking app. Just a slim wallet. Funds transferred instantly. Instantly, the ""Rewards"" counter starts ticking up. Hilariously addictive to watch. 1 ALGO minimum. Doesn't compound automatically though. There was a [good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p14qbm/algorand_wallet_faucet/) about it recently. As with ADA, funds are not locked up at any point.

**ATOM: Exodus Wallet, APY: ~9%**

This one I chose because of the rather high interest rate. Needs to be staked and starts earning rewards immediately. Doesn't compound automatically either, you have to ""Claim Reward"", which you can do at any time, for a fee of 0.005075 ATOM. The unstaking period is a massive 21 days, but for that APY that's perfectly fine. The only crypto I got so far that requires a note to be sent with the transaction.

**ONT: Exodus Wallet, APY 10-20%**

Man, fucking ONT, man. Highest APY on Exodus, so without knowing anything about it I took a couple bucks from Coinbase rewards, converted them to ONT on KuCoin, then sent those over to Exodus. Great. All said and done I'm sitting on 3 ONT, worth a mighty 3 dollars at the time. 

So, ONT is a network for dApps, which are fueled by their secondary token ONG. Which you need to stake your ONT. Of which I have not enough to convert to ONG. So after looking for an ONT faucet or something, I stumbled upon a Reddit post that said to contact Exodus support, so I did and was like 

""Yeah I just transfered some ONT here but I don't have enough to convert to ONG, and, like, you never warned me or anything that there's a minimum limit of I think 10 ONT to trade so can you like manually exchange some of my ONT"" and credit where credit is due, Exodus support was pretty on point, email response within 5 minutes that basically said ""Yeah give us your full name and we're gonna send you some ONG"", so for some very light KYC I got 0.2 ONG from them. Awesome. 

Now, staking locks up your ONT for one ""Round"", and unstaking takes one ""Round"" as well. A round is comprised of 60000 blocks, and takes from 16 hours to 20 days. yeah. Fucking ONT, man. Does not compound automatically.

**SOL: Exodus Wallet, APY ~6%**

This one is fun again. Easy to transfer, staking rewards are automatically transferred to your wallet every ~2 days, which is also how long unstaking takes. Me not writing a lot about it doesn't mean it's bad, quite the opposite, this one just works. Short unstaking timeframe. Highest value increase in my portfolio even staking aside. 

**VET: VeChainThor Wallet, APY 1,33%**

This one I bought primarily for the long haul, but might as well look at their rewards. The wallet contains a list of assets, a page with dApps, and a pretty funky looking [Rewards page](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iUuBTojwYSxtpiKY0MyKPS0x-jkdBvlz6KHHR5gvSaoEgv97hedBIAEWCkM5xVxqdQ5d=w1680-h860-rw), which I guess increases the APY, but I don't have the 1.000.000 VET necessary to find out. Regardless, even without that you automatically earn their secondary token VTHO, albeit at an abysmal rate. Easy to use, but not necessarily my first choice for staking.

**XTZ: Exodus Wallet, APY ~5-6%**

This one takes a long time to get rolling, 35 days until you start earning rewards, but once those are done, you get a transaction into your wallet every three days. On the plus side, unstaking seems to be pretty much instant as your funds are not locked up at any time. As with Solana, not much to say because it just works. Also, and I feel like I'm shilling Exodus too much, their transaction sound is pretty satisfying and the timeframe between the rewards is relatively short, so this one is pretty fun to follow as well.

CryptoCurrency,How I'm passively stacking sats at 45k without a care in the world,"#**Goodbye, Bank of America. Hello, BlockFi!**

*Before we get started, I just want to point out the obvious. I'm bullish on Bitcoin over the next decade and I'm bearish on the value of the USD with our current Federal Monetary Policy so I would like to convert my cash into an asset that retains and increases purchasing power rather than keeping it in one that loses it.*

**So What's The Idea** (1) Open a CeFi account(BlockFi, Celsius, Nexo). Use it as my bank. Have a cash pile generating interest which is paid in BTC which then yields 4% APY. (2) Get a new credit card that rewards 1.5% back in crypto of my choosing. That's it.

Sound complicated? Nah, it's easy.

**How Does It Work?**

1) Transfer income bimonthly into BlockFi (or Celsius, Nexo, etc.) on payday

2) USD is automatically converted into GUSD stablecoin upon instant deposit

3) GUSD stablecoin starts instantly, passively and effortlessly generating yield at 7.5% APY (BlockFi) which is paid out monthly in the denomination of my choosing (i.e USD, BTC or ETH - You can change this whenever)

4) Use BlockFi credit card for all my standard expenses to receive 1.5% cash back on all purchases. This 1.5% reward is paid in BTC.

**So I receive three forms of passive interest payment** - (**1**) 1.5% from purchases (rent, food etc) (**2**) 7.5% interest on my USD pile (**3**) All BTC collected via interest payments then generates an additional 4% APY.

**So what can this look like after 1 Year** - ^(Assuming All Values Remain Constant)

Example:

(**1**) $500/month in expenses (food, rent. etc)

(**2**) $100/month cash saved to collect interest (cash saved: money remaining monthly after other active investments in crypto, equities or simply spent on entertainment/leisure)

After 1 Year: Interest on cash = ~$50. Rewards from expenses = ~$100

This $150/year has been passively invested into crypto of your choice every month without you even thinking about it. This is $150 that most of us would never have invested originally.

*(Originally had all the math laid out, but it really takes up a lot of room, so removed for the sake of time and cleanliness) [Calculator](https://www.trance-cat.com/electrical-circuit-calculators/en/apy-interest-calculator.php)*

Like many of you, I'm young and don't have a lot of money to lump sum invest, but I do have a lot of time. So let's for fun speculate how much interest would be generated if this plan plays out for 10 years with no pay raise and the cash pile is allowed to compound undisturbed.

**10 Year Potential Passive ""Free"" Investment**

$12,000 cash saved --&gt; $5,793.03 Interest Earned and Invested

$60,000 in expenses --&gt; $1,115.55 in Crypto Rewards Invested

**$6,908 invested passively through interest payments and no money of your own**

Yes, we really did just go from $50 interest on cash in the 1 year frame to $5800 total in the 10 year frame. Compound Interest is beautiful

**Are we forgetting the cherry on top?**

This potential $6,908 collected over 10 years could potentially be worth a lot more since it's effectively been DCAing into BTC over 10 years.

I hope some of you guys look into this yourselves. The amount may seem small, but its a great way for us little guys to keep accumulating in addition to all other strategies! Sorry for the length post!

**Notes**: You can use whatever CeFi you like. I chose BlockFi because it has a no fees card with good rewards. Yes, I'm aware these companies are not FDIC backed, I also invest in crypto so I'm willing to take some risk. Yes, I'm aware rates can change at any time, but it's better than the 0% my bank pays. Why CeFi and not DeFi? Tbh, I find DeFi pretty confusing and this CeFi method could not be easier. What about NYKNYC? - I'm using this is a supplementary strategy.

stocks,$GRBK - Green Brick Partners - Value Investment Company in Homebuilder Sector,"I’m trying my hand at writing DD, and I figured this would be a good test audience. Alright, so now let me explain to you why I still have a thing for the homebuilding sector – and more specifically: Green Brick Partners (GRBK). That’s right, these guys are so confident in their business that they named their company GREEN BRICK! They’re feeling themselves and so are the Market Analysts tracking them and their sector.

**TL;DR**

In case you don’t have time to read all of this or look at any of the pictures I included for you, then here’s the long and short of it: the housing market likely won’t letup anytime soon and builders will continue to keep churning out record profits for quarters to come. The safest play is to stay away from calls and look at shares. If shares aren’t your speed and you are only interested in options, then I suggest looking at ITM calls with a delta ≥.70 for any OPEX after August 2021.

**i.**  **Overview**

GRBK is a homebuilder and land development company that deals in primarily single-family homes. GRBK does this by working with their subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders in Texas, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida. GRBK subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders are either wholly owned by GRBK or have a majority stake of their business owned by GRBK; GRBK has a pathway to 100% ownership for all subsidiary and affiliate business where they maintain a majority stake in today. Moreover, GRBK has ownership stake in two mortgage lending businesses and one property title business.

GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Jim Brickman (henceforth referred to as “Big Jim”), plays an important part to my investing thesis and why I’m so bullish on his business. Since I don’t prefer to invest my money in companies ran by clown CEOs. Fortunately, Big Jim is about as far away from being a clown as you can get.

GRBK isn’t Big Jim’s first foray into running a homebuilder business. No, in fact Big Jim was part owner of a different Texas homebuilder during the ‘80s. During this period of Big Jim’s career is where he got to experience the joys and pains of leverage. Yes, that same kind of leverage WSB uses when buying deep OTM options on meme stocks with their margin accounts funded by student loans, credit cards, personal loans, etc. As you can imagine Big Jim might’ve also believed things literally couldn’t go sideways.

Enter the 1984 – 1990 Texas housing depression which caused things to go sideways. Now, to be fair, things went bad for everyone and not just Big Jim during this period in the Texas housing market. I’m not going to go into the details of how Big Jim managed to come through this with his head still attached, but he did.

The key takeaway from all this is Big Jim has experience playing with leverage and getting burned in the process. GRBK as a result of this is one of the lower levered homebuilders in the market. This is also why GRBK resolves to operate their business by keeping their debt-to-capital ratios at no more than 35%. Despite Big Jim’s insistence to grow without the aid of obscene leverage, the business is producing record financial results each year.

**ii.**  **Target Market**

GRBK has successfully diversified their business portfolio to target buyers at all stages of the homeownership cycle. These could be buyers looking for townhomes, luxury homes, and everything in between. GRBK does this by aligning a specific brand to their target market based on price, geography, and type of home. Here’s a snapshot from their recent Q2 2021 investor day presentation deck that outlines this well:

[https://postimg.cc/KRBDXyBj](https://postimg.cc/KRBDXyBj)

GRBK reported in their Q2 2021 8-K filing that their average home sale price is approximately $438K/unit averaged across all brands. Per their direction advised on their recent earnings call and investor day presentations, GRBK has spent Q1 &amp; Q2 of 2021 focused on their entry-level, detached single family product – Trophy Signature Homes (referred to henceforth as “Trophy”). GRBK has identified that Trophy represents a significant position in how they will look to achieve these tremendous growth figures for years to come, as well as CB JENI, their townhome brand product.

I won’t get into too many of the specifics surrounding the various geographies that GRBK’s brands are based in, but I will narrow into the Dallas Forth Worth (DFW) market. DFW is where Trophy and CB JENI developments are primarily located. As you might be aware, DFW is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. Although Big Jim wouldn’t provide many details surrounding their expansion plans for the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands outside of the DFW area, he did comment that they are actively looking at the Denver market for these brands to supplement their existing Denver brand product, Challenger Homes.

I’ll be foregoing the expensive market survey reports from some of the fancy real estate consulting shops and instead will use what is free and accessible – Zonda. The grid below gives a breakout of what Zonda is reporting for a given Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of where they’re seeing the highest number of housing build starts reported in 2Q 2021. This is great for GRBK since their two biggest growth brands are already established in DFW, which is seeing a 29.9% increase!

[https://postimg.cc/ygD0Lq7V](https://postimg.cc/ygD0Lq7V)

**iii.**  **Land Lots &amp; Supply**

Now, here’s where some of you folks might be thinking to yourself, “hey, housing build starts are great metrics and all, but what happens if they run out of primo land to build on?”. If this was you, congratulations because we’re going to talk about land lots soon and why they are ridiculously important – not just for GRBK, but for all homebuilders. Which now leads me to my next exhibit, which is not a graph at all but a tweet from Zonda’s Chief Economist, Ali Wolf (henceforth referred to as “The Wolf”), who has exemplified great understanding of millennial homebuyers; this is in addition to her already well documented knowledge and experience of residential housing economics (seriously, go check out her credentials). Here’ what The Wolf has recently said concerning the importance of land lots and their subsequent availability:

[https://postimg.cc/ts9PLn9v](https://postimg.cc/ts9PLn9v)

The Wolf goes on to share the following graph with us from Zonda’s New Home Land Supply Index (LSI) study. LSI aims to show how specific MSAs are trending regarding available single family vacant lot availability. LSI outputs are adjusted to provide greater weight of figures to vacant lots in MSA subdivisions showing higher building activity. LSI outputs an easy-to-digest scale of measurements based on the following score strata:

·  **125** – Significantly Oversupplied

·  **115 – 125** – Slightly Oversupplied

·  **85 – 115** – Appropriately Supplied

·  **75 – 85** – Slightly Undersupplied

·  **&lt; 75** – Significantly Undersupplied

[https://postimg.cc/ZWYBfkL1](https://postimg.cc/ZWYBfkL1)

Now, just focusing in on Dallas since this is where GRBK has stated is their primary development geography, we can see a reported LSI value of 48.2. Based on the above strata, this means that the Dallas MSA is significantly undersupplied. Here’s why, for me at least, this plays into my bull case for GRBK. GRBK has spent the better part of the last 16 months building up their lot position. Based on GRBK’s recently reported numbers, they’re stating they have either ownership or control of approximately 21,000 lots in their entire book. Their current lot catalog represents a 133% increase over the last 12 months, which is huge. Increase in lot size is a strong indicator for future financial growth.

Although GRBK doesn’t report out how many of those lots are secured for DFW, we can safely assume that a good bulk of these numbers are allocated for this MSA due to how much of a focus market it is for their growth strategy. GRBK is in a great spot with their lot supply and we can now look to their projections of lot pipeline delivery for the next 6 – 18 months. GRBK plans to be able to deliver to their builders an estimated 1,800 lots within the next 6 months. Moreover, they are projecting they will be able to deliver an estimated 4,600 lots to their builders in 2022.

Next to buyer demand, developed land lots are the single most important thing for builders. GRBK’s superior lot size and strict underwriting model is what they see most attributable to their growth results and will continue to play a role in their future growth. I already mentioned that GRBK has a unique internal control system on their debt-to-capital ratios that they don’t allow to exceed 35%; they’re currently below this threshold although not by much. Additionally, GRBK has a strict underwriting model that they adhere to which targets meeting a 20% un-levered return and exceeding 20% gross margins on transactions. GRBK’s operating model also aims for them to maintain these numbers without having to rely solely on passing the expense onto customers. This is a great segue into GRBK’s Operating System.

**iv.**  **Operating System**

It’s not uncommon for large homebuilders to have multiple different affiliate builder and subsidiaries that operate underneath them and GRBK is no different. Out of all of the subsidiary and affiliate builders that GRBK either wholly owns or maintains a majority ownership stake, they all utilize GRBK’s Operating System (OS). GRBK’s OS is focused on the following:

1. Accounting
2. Construction
3. Purchasing
4. Production Platform

So, what does this all mean? This OS is how GRBK handles and runs their entire business in an efficient and scalable way. GRBK’s builders are provided with an IT platform that allows them to easily track and manage their production pipelines from end-to-end. This in turn allows GRBK to collect and analyze real-time business analytics to identify any worrying gaps or trends within the various segments of their business.

For those unfamiliar with Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A), it’s an important metric for any business. SG&amp;A though becomes more important for businesses that deal in actual physical goods when compared to other businesses. The reason for this is that margin can be more easily affected by external forces. Companies that lower their SG&amp;A can generally expect to see a positive impact to their profit margins as a result. GRBK’s OS allows them to monitor their business channels tightly and efficiently to ensure that they are truly reducing SG&amp;A wherever possible. GRBK has successfully reduced their SG&amp;A YoY and is currently reporting an SG&amp;A of 9.1%, or $45K/unit. GRBK projects that they will be able to continue reducing their SG&amp;A and therefore add additional room for higher profit margins per unit.

GRBK has a solid OS which provides me with added confidence that they are managing all ends of their business responsibly and effectively. Additionally, it tells me that should GRBK look to acquire future builders into their portfolio this OS should help them integrate M&amp;A targets more easily and quickly. Lastly, I like their OS because it allows them to actively track and monitor their internal debt-to-capital ratios by providing access to real-time business financial performance.

**vii.**  **Financials**

We’ll cover some of the financial performance figures of GRBK in this section. GRBK has a profitable business and a balance sheet to support this. Let’s look at their recent Q2 2021 filing:

[https://postimg.cc/ZWqn88bm](https://postimg.cc/ZWqn88bm)

To me, this statement is nothing but beautiful. Out of the many great figures reported, their revenue and Earnings Per Share (EPS) are what jump out at me. When comparing this quarter’s results to Q2 of 2020, you can see that they increased their total reported revenues by more than 62%. Additionally, they saw their EPS grow by more than 53% when compared to the same period. Outstanding all around and absolutely above board what The Street projected.

In terms of where these revenues are being derived from, GRBK reports that they maintain four prominent revenue streams for their business (in no particular order): homebuilding, mortgage, title, and residential management service operation. I believe it’s safe to assume based on their financial statement that homebuilding represents their single largest revenue channel of their entire business. In the next section we’ll touch on how they’re poised to continue this growth by focusing their efforts on their Trophy &amp; CB JENI product brands.

In summary, nothing personally jumps out to me as being bad or worrisome about their financial statement. I will say both here and in the bear case section, that this level of growth is enormous and should certainly be viewed as a positive but could also prove to trap GRBK to meeting continuously loftier financial results YoY. One thing I will note is that later in their 8-K filing it is shown that GRBK has 100MM shares authorized of their common stock versus a float of roughly half that at 50.7MM.

**viii.**  **Growth Focus**

GRBK has stated that they’re looking to possibly expand into other MSAs but have not publicly identified which MSAs they’re currently eyeing except for Denver. It’s important to note that GRBK already has a presence in Denver with their Challenger Homes brand; I speculate this statement to mean that they will consider moving other brand offerings into this MSA with a focus on entry level home buyers via their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands. GRBK reported that their average unit home sale price was approximately $438K in Q2 2021.

Trophy &amp; CB JENI are already established brands in DFW. As noted earlier, we know that GRBK increased their lot size by over 133% in the past 12 months. Taking into consideration their strong lot size position and Zonda’s reporting that the DFW MSA is significantly undersupplied for available developed lots is key when contrasting the reported number of new home build starts for this same MSA. My interpretation of this is that GRBK expects to see tremendous, continued growth for the balance of 2021 and into 2022 based on how they have appropriated their lot sizing and development pipeline. I find additional confidence in my thesis knowing that a large portion of GRBK’s lot positions will be allocated to support the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands that cater to the entry level buyer group with an average purchase price below GRBK’s reported $438K average unit sale price.

Looking back to GRBK’s investor day presentation, it was reported that their Trophy brand of homes represented their largest portion of sales YTD. This is great news especially when considering that Trophy is one of GRBK’s highest margin brands. Let’s look at the following exhibit which supports this position:

[https://postimg.cc/G8vmLzQF](https://postimg.cc/G8vmLzQF)

Per the above, you can see that the majority of GRBK’s lot position is indeed allocated to support the Trophy brand in the DFW area. Moreover, when comparing their YTD units started being lower than their other brands but showing a higher allocation of total lots controlled for the same period makes me believe that they’re truly focusing in on driving growth at the entry level buyer segment and have big plans for the remainder of 2021. Unfortunately, GRBK didn’t provide as much information regarding their plans for the CB JENI brand outside of comments made by GRBK’s leadership team, and the President of CB JENI, that they would indeed be focusing on this brand as well. Lastly, look at the financial growth results produced by Trophy:

[https://postimg.cc/7C22z396](https://postimg.cc/7C22z396)

The key takeaway here is how GRBK has managed to so efficiently manage their Trophy brands product to secure such incredible results on its financial growth. Lowered SG&amp;A will lead to higher margins and GRBK has already stated that their OS is how they hope to continue improving upon lowering their SG&amp;A. Another interesting thing to comment on about Trophy is how GRBK has led with some market innovation by using pre-manufactured roofing trusses and pre-built wall panels. These strategies have allowed the Trophy brands to better control construction materials costs and decrease their skilled labor needs. Lastly, they’re able to increase their build cycle timelines by having these pre-manufactured and pre-built materials included as part of their home construction.

Overall, I think GRBK has a great strategy in place for their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands and will ultimately continue to see popularity amongst entry level homebuyers. One thing I will note is that we cannot turn a blind eye to the global supply chain disruptions that are plaguing the market end-to-end and as a result of GRBK using pre-manufactured and pre-built construction materials in their homes could open them to susceptible project overages if they must pivot to more conventional methods during the construction process; this would most likely create a negative impact to their brand SG&amp;A and profit margins.

**vii.**  **Competition**

Make no mistake, there is plenty of competition in this sector. When comparing GRBK to their competition you will find that they’re generally a smaller player in this sector in terms of market cap. For comparison, Lennar (LEN) maintains a market cap of \~$33.5BN vs. GRBK’s market cap of $1.35BN. However, of all the competitors there really are only two that have a similar market cap, float, and P/E to GRBK. Those competitors are Tri Point Homes (TPH) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC). Other tickers for this sector include: KBH, NVR, MHO, CCS, MDC, DHI, PHM, and LGIH.

I have not spent nearly as much time researching GRBK’s competitors, however a review of their overall performance seems to show that the sector in general is doing very well. I think there are some other sympathetic trading plays here to be made that apply to GRBK’s competition, too. If you’re interested in GRBK I think it would be worth the time to investigate some of these other tickers for investment consideration, too. Lastly, I’ll comment that you should look at XHB, which is the S&amp;P homebuilder ETF.

**viii.**  **Bear Case**

The primary concern that I have for not just GRBK alone, but this sector, is maintain buyer demand. Without buyer demand high there is little opportunity for GRBK to continue posting these record profits. Personally, I got interested in this space after having gone through the process of trying to buy a home myself and subsequently being priced out of where I hoped to buy. My response to this was to simply to just “wait and see” how the market responds. I’ll admit that I’m beginning to think my decision was a mistake based on what I’ve researched.

Another consideration to make is existing unit backlogs. GRBK reported a backlog of 1,876 at an average unit price of $519K for Q2 2021. By GRBK’s own admission, they are closely monitoring their backlog inventories but are not yet concerned of driving down these supply figures. There are two concerns here I recognize: if buyer demand drops off the backlog and spec home units will pile up and create a negative impact to GRBK’s bottom life and capital efficiencies. I will be closely watching GRBK’s backlog numbers reported for Q3 2021.

Mortgage rates right now are at historic lows but are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Low interest rates can offset some of the financial cost associated with purchasing a more expensive home – you’re robbing Peter (mortgage company) with a lower interest rate, to pay Paul (GRBK, other builders) for their higher priced products. The concern here is that if cost does not equally level out when interest rates eventually increase, then you can no longer expect to be able to rob Peter to pay Paul, which would effectively price more people out of the market. Again, it’s going to be critical to see what happens with the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brand lines of GRBK since they’ll be focusing on the cheaper entry level buyer space.

Lot availability is a concern. I’ve already pointed out how The Wolf has stated that homebuilder success is directly attributable to their lot positions. If GRBK is not able to continue to manage their lot pipeline to pace accordingly with their building timelines and schedules for the upcoming years, then they will face problems with meeting their high growth projections. Watching the overall progression of available lots for the MSAs that GRBK operates in, and their subsequent lot acquisition pricing will be huge to gauge whether they can keep up this performance.

I’m sure there are other bear cases to be made, however this is what I’ve come up with now. Please feel free to add and comment with your own takes and considerations. Overall, I feel as though the bull cases still outweigh the bear cases to be made for this ticker.

**iv.**  **Technical Analysis**

For those of you who place a considerable amount of weight to TA, then you can thank u/Fox_Technicals for reviewing this. I’m going to do my best to interpret what I see, however I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals chime in with any additional comments or observations they would like to make in the form of edits and updates to the post. We’ll start looking at the following:

[https://postimg.cc/dhT1NqyN](https://postimg.cc/dhT1NqyN)

This chart is looking to show us that GRBK may be on its way towards a breakout from the 2X.XX something share price it’s been trading at for so long. I’d also comment here that following their recent Q2 2021 earnings that most Analysts are maintaining price targets that range from the low to mid 30s; one such example is B. Riley raised their original PT of $35/share to $37/share on 8/05/21. This also shows that the lower trend could target somewhere in the 24s. Also, it’s important to note the comparison to XHB and that GRBK’s RSI is improving against XHB. The key takeaway here is when comparing GRBK against XHB is that GRBK has been growing faster than some of their competitor peers. Earlier I mentioned LEN as a competitor to GRBK, so let’s look at LEN:

[https://postimg.cc/4Hd46ZG5](https://postimg.cc/4Hd46ZG5)

Looking at this chart, u/Fox_Technicals is showing that LEN also appears to be on a breakout trend upwards. Now, admittedly I’m not as familiar with LEN’s business as I am with GRBK but based on what little review I’ve done they also seem to be doing extremely well as far as financial results are concerned. I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals provide any additional commentary on this ticker that they’ve identified. Next, we’ll look at XHB:

[https://postimg.cc/0rWy86GH](https://postimg.cc/0rWy86GH)

Looking back to the initial chart of GRBK, and then comparing it to XHB, you’ll recall that GRBK’s RSI was increasing against homebuilders (XHB). Well, when you look at this chart and compare XHB against SPY you can see there are higher highs being made against SPY. This action could signal that we’re looking at a potential breakout for leading the market

**x.**  **Strategy**

As mentioned in the initial, TL;DR, I think the primary play here is with shares. However, there is a way to play this with options as well, but we need to be clear on the risks as such. Fortunately, this section should be brief in contrast to the rest of this submission, but there really isn’t much strategy surrounding what I think is best or “safest” with respect to this stock and that’s holding shares. Truly, just buy shares and hold and I think you will see a great return especially around their Q3 2021 earnings call.

Now, about options there is a way to play this if you’re okay with the risk. Couple of things you need to know is that overall GRBK doesn’t have much volume in their average daily shares traded. Currently their three-month average daily volume is only 433K shares/day against a float of approximately 50.77MM shares. Additionally, you must recognize that GRBK’s options are extremely illiquid. The bid/ask spreads are tremendously wide, and you will run the risk of getting hammered on bad fills (or plainly just not getting filled at all).

That’s not a lot of daily movement and as a result the IV for their option chain is low – only currently showing \~48%. So, if you’re interested, you could look at picking up OTM calls for September &amp; November expiries to try and possibly benefit from increased performance in this sector over the coming weeks/months and make your gains from any increases in IV accordingly. Personally, I do not think this is a good idea and is well outside of my risk profile but I’m sure for some of you this is right what you’re looking for.

Now, the safer options play would be to target ITM options with a delta value of ≥.70 for expiries beginning in September at the earliest. If you can afford these calls, you would be able to (more or less) establish for yourself a synthetic long position without needing to hold shares. The caveat to this is that you’re going to benefit less from things such as IV expansion as the delta values of your calls become closer to a value of 1.0. The strategy here is to ride the calls for as long as you probably would if you were instead holding shares. Again, I still think shares are the better play, but you do what’s best for you.

**xi.**  **Conclusion &amp; Disclaimer**

I am not a financial advisor. I have made tremendously questionable investment decisions during my short time spent here on reddit. As a result, please do your own research. Please review what I’ve written and check into it for yourself. Essentially do not blindly take my word for anything and instead do a bit of legwork and figure out if you think you see the value in this ticker (hell, or even sector) like I do. These statements and writings are nothing more than my opinion and should not be interpreted as professional and legitimate financial or investment advice.

That now being out the way, I do believe in GRBK’s growth strategy and overall business model. I think that GRBK is an affordable, value play in this sector that will only look to see increased coverage in months to come. I also think that GRBK is uniquely positioned above their competition to be successful in how they manage their affiliate and subsidiary builders. Also, I’m quite pleased to see how GRBK was head of the curve in their decision to accumulate immense lot ownership to fuel their continued growth objectives. Lastly, GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Big Jim, has a great approach to manage debt-to-capital in a way that has successfully proven that you don’t need to lever yourself to the eyeballs to secure great profit results.

Currently I only maintain active positions in GRBK. My positions are solely in call options. Let me explain why that is. I’ve currently been holding 2x 8/20 25c since this past April to speculate on this stock before entering a long position. My intent was to see the share price rise to \~$27 sometime in June and then at that point make the decision to either cut away and STC my calls or exercise. I never hit my PT and therefore will most likely look to roll my calls to November OPEX or flat out exercise next Friday. I also picked up some lottery tickets this week when the rally began on Monday at 3x $30 strike – these calls are not doing great as you can imagine for all the reasons I mentioned above. Lastly, I have a single call for September OPEX at the $30 strike. Here is a snapshot of my positions:

investing,$GRBK - Homebuilder Sector Value Investment Opportunity,"I’m trying my hand at writing DD, and I figured this would be a good test audience. Alright, so now let me explain to you why I still have a thing for the homebuilding sector – and more specifically: Green Brick Partners (GRBK). That’s right, these guys are so confident in their business that they named their company GREEN BRICK! They’re feeling themselves and so are the Market Analysts tracking them and their sector.

**TL;DR**

In case you don’t have time to read all of this or look at any of the pictures I included for you, then here’s the long and short of it: the housing market likely won’t letup anytime soon and builders will continue to keep churning out record profits for quarters to come. The safest play is to stay away from calls and look at shares. If shares aren’t your speed and you are only interested in options, then I suggest looking at ITM calls with a delta ≥.70 for any OPEX after August 2021.

Either way, whatever you choose to do (or don’t, because that’s just as cool) please don’t interpret what I’ve researched and posted here as financial advice.

**i.**  **Overview**

GRBK is a homebuilder and land development company that deals in primarily single-family homes. GRBK does this by working with their subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders in Texas, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida. GRBK subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders are either wholly owned by GRBK or have a majority stake of their business owned by GRBK; GRBK has a pathway to 100% ownership for all subsidiary and affiliate business where they maintain a majority stake in today. Moreover, GRBK has ownership stake in two mortgage lending businesses and one property title business.

GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Jim Brickman (henceforth referred to as “Big Jim”), plays an important part to my investing thesis and why I’m so bullish on his business. Since I don’t prefer to invest my money in companies ran by clown CEOs. Fortunately, Big Jim is about as far away from being a clown as you can get.

GRBK isn’t Big Jim’s first foray into running a homebuilder business. No, in fact Big Jim was part owner of a different Texas homebuilder during the ‘80s. During this period of Big Jim’s career is where he got to experience the joys and pains of leverage. Yes, that same kind of leverage WSB uses when buying deep OTM options on meme stocks with their margin accounts funded by student loans, credit cards, personal loans, etc. As you can imagine Big Jim might’ve also believed things literally couldn’t go sideways.

Enter the 1984 – 1990 Texas housing depression which caused things to go sideways. Now, to be fair, things went bad for everyone and not just Big Jim during this period in the Texas housing market. I’m not going to go into the details of how Big Jim managed to come through this with his head still attached, but he did.

The key takeaway from all this is Big Jim has experience playing with leverage and getting burned in the process. GRBK as a result of this is one of the lower levered homebuilders in the market. This is also why GRBK resolves to operate their business by keeping their debt-to-capital ratios at no more than 35%. Despite Big Jim’s insistence to grow without the aid of obscene leverage, the business is producing record financial results each year.

**ii.**  **Target Market**

GRBK has successfully diversified their business portfolio to target buyers at all stages of the homeownership cycle. These could be buyers looking for townhomes, luxury homes, and everything in between. GRBK does this by aligning a specific brand to their target market based on price, geography, and type of home. Here’s a snapshot from their recent Q2 2021 investor day presentation deck that outlines this well:

[https://postimg.cc/KRBDXyBj](https://postimg.cc/KRBDXyBj)

GRBK reported in their Q2 2021 8-K filing that their average home sale price is approximately $438K/unit averaged across all brands. Per their direction advised on their recent earnings call and investor day presentations, GRBK has spent Q1 &amp; Q2 of 2021 focused on their entry-level, detached single family product – Trophy Signature Homes (referred to henceforth as “Trophy”). GRBK has identified that Trophy represents a significant position in how they will look to achieve these tremendous growth figures for years to come, as well as CB JENI, their townhome brand product.

I won’t get into too many of the specifics surrounding the various geographies that GRBK’s brands are based in, but I will narrow into the Dallas Forth Worth (DFW) market. DFW is where Trophy and CB JENI developments are primarily located. As you might be aware, DFW is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. Although Big Jim wouldn’t provide many details surrounding their expansion plans for the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands outside of the DFW area, he did comment that they are actively looking at the Denver market for these brands to supplement their existing Denver brand product, Challenger Homes.

I’ll be foregoing the expensive market survey reports from some of the fancy real estate consulting shops and instead will use what is free and accessible – Zonda. The grid below gives a breakout of what Zonda is reporting for a given Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of where they’re seeing the highest number of housing build starts reported in 2Q 2021. This is great for GRBK since their two biggest growth brands are already established in DFW, which is seeing a 29.9% increase!

[https://postimg.cc/ygD0Lq7V](https://postimg.cc/ygD0Lq7V)

**iii.**  **Land Lots &amp; Supply**

Now, here’s where some of you folks might be thinking to yourself, “hey, housing build starts are great metrics and all, but what happens if they run out of primo land to build on?”. If this was you, congratulations because we’re going to talk about land lots soon and why they are ridiculously important – not just for GRBK, but for all homebuilders. Which now leads me to my next exhibit, which is not a graph at all but a tweet from Zonda’s Chief Economist, Ali Wolf (henceforth referred to as “The Wolf”), who has exemplified great understanding of millennial homebuyers; this is in addition to her already well documented knowledge and experience of residential housing economics (seriously, go check out her credentials). Here’ what The Wolf has recently said concerning the importance of land lots and their subsequent availability:

[https://postimg.cc/ts9PLn9v](https://postimg.cc/ts9PLn9v)

The Wolf goes on to share the following graph with us from Zonda’s New Home Land Supply Index (LSI) study. LSI aims to show how specific MSAs are trending regarding available single family vacant lot availability. LSI outputs are adjusted to provide greater weight of figures to vacant lots in MSA subdivisions showing higher building activity. LSI outputs an easy-to-digest scale of measurements based on the following score strata:

·  **125** – Significantly Oversupplied

·  **115 – 125** – Slightly Oversupplied

·  **85 – 115** – Appropriately Supplied

·  **75 – 85** – Slightly Undersupplied

·  **&lt; 75** – Significantly Undersupplied

[https://postimg.cc/ZWYBfkL1](https://postimg.cc/ZWYBfkL1)

Now, just focusing in on Dallas since this is where GRBK has stated is their primary development geography, we can see a reported LSI value of 48.2. Based on the above strata, this means that the Dallas MSA is significantly undersupplied. Here’s why, for me at least, this plays into my bull case for GRBK. GRBK has spent the better part of the last 16 months building up their lot position. Based on GRBK’s recently reported numbers, they’re stating they have either ownership or control of approximately 21,000 lots in their entire book. Their current lot catalog represents a 133% increase over the last 12 months, which is huge. Increase in lot size is a strong indicator for future financial growth.

Although GRBK doesn’t report out how many of those lots are secured for DFW, we can safely assume that a good bulk of these numbers are allocated for this MSA due to how much of a focus market it is for their growth strategy. GRBK is in a great spot with their lot supply and we can now look to their projections of lot pipeline delivery for the next 6 – 18 months. GRBK plans to be able to deliver to their builders an estimated 1,800 lots within the next 6 months. Moreover, they are projecting they will be able to deliver an estimated 4,600 lots to their builders in 2022.

Next to buyer demand, developed land lots are the single most important thing for builders. GRBK’s superior lot size and strict underwriting model is what they see most attributable to their growth results and will continue to play a role in their future growth. I already mentioned that GRBK has a unique internal control system on their debt-to-capital ratios that they don’t allow to exceed 35%; they’re currently below this threshold although not by much. Additionally, GRBK has a strict underwriting model that they adhere to which targets meeting a 20% un-levered return and exceeding 20% gross margins on transactions. GRBK’s operating model also aims for them to maintain these numbers without having to rely solely on passing the expense onto customers. This is a great segue into GRBK’s Operating System.

**iv.**  **Operating System**

It’s not uncommon for large homebuilders to have multiple different affiliate builder and subsidiaries that operate underneath them and GRBK is no different. Out of all of the subsidiary and affiliate builders that GRBK either wholly owns or maintains a majority ownership stake, they all utilize GRBK’s Operating System (OS). GRBK’s OS is focused on the following:

1. Accounting
2. Construction
3. Purchasing
4. Production Platform

So, what does this all mean? This OS is how GRBK handles and runs their entire business in an efficient and scalable way. GRBK’s builders are provided with an IT platform that allows them to easily track and manage their production pipelines from end-to-end. This in turn allows GRBK to collect and analyze real-time business analytics to identify any worrying gaps or trends within the various segments of their business.

For those unfamiliar with Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A), it’s an important metric for any business. SG&amp;A though becomes more important for businesses that deal in actual physical goods when compared to other businesses. The reason for this is that margin can be more easily affected by external forces. Companies that lower their SG&amp;A can generally expect to see a positive impact to their profit margins as a result. GRBK’s OS allows them to monitor their business channels tightly and efficiently to ensure that they are truly reducing SG&amp;A wherever possible. GRBK has successfully reduced their SG&amp;A YoY and is currently reporting an SG&amp;A of 9.1%, or $45K/unit. GRBK projects that they will be able to continue reducing their SG&amp;A and therefore add additional room for higher profit margins per unit.

GRBK has a solid OS which provides me with added confidence that they are managing all ends of their business responsibly and effectively. Additionally, it tells me that should GRBK look to acquire future builders into their portfolio this OS should help them integrate M&amp;A targets more easily and quickly. Lastly, I like their OS because it allows them to actively track and monitor their internal debt-to-capital ratios by providing access to real-time business financial performance.

**vii.**  **Financials**

We’ll cover some of the financial performance figures of GRBK in this section. GRBK has a profitable business and a balance sheet to support this. Let’s look at their recent Q2 2021 filing:

[https://postimg.cc/ZWqn88bm](https://postimg.cc/ZWqn88bm)

To me, this statement is nothing but beautiful. Out of the many great figures reported, their revenue and Earnings Per Share (EPS) are what jump out at me. When comparing this quarter’s results to Q2 of 2020, you can see that they increased their total reported revenues by more than 62%. Additionally, they saw their EPS grow by more than 53% when compared to the same period. Outstanding all around and absolutely above board what The Street projected.

In terms of where these revenues are being derived from, GRBK reports that they maintain four prominent revenue streams for their business (in no particular order): homebuilding, mortgage, title, and residential management service operation. I believe it’s safe to assume based on their financial statement that homebuilding represents their single largest revenue channel of their entire business. In the next section we’ll touch on how they’re poised to continue this growth by focusing their efforts on their Trophy &amp; CB JENI product brands.

In summary, nothing personally jumps out to me as being bad or worrisome about their financial statement. I will say both here and in the bear case section, that this level of growth is enormous and should certainly be viewed as a positive but could also prove to trap GRBK to meeting continuously loftier financial results YoY. One thing I will note is that later in their 8-K filing it is shown that GRBK has 100MM shares authorized of their common stock versus a float of roughly half that at 50.7MM.

**viii.**  **Growth Focus**

GRBK has stated that they’re looking to possibly expand into other MSAs but have not publicly identified which MSAs they’re currently eyeing except for Denver. It’s important to note that GRBK already has a presence in Denver with their Challenger Homes brand; I speculate this statement to mean that they will consider moving other brand offerings into this MSA with a focus on entry level home buyers via their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands. GRBK reported that their average unit home sale price was approximately $438K in Q2 2021.

Trophy &amp; CB JENI are already established brands in DFW. As noted earlier, we know that GRBK increased their lot size by over 133% in the past 12 months. Taking into consideration their strong lot size position and Zonda’s reporting that the DFW MSA is significantly undersupplied for available developed lots is key when contrasting the reported number of new home build starts for this same MSA. My interpretation of this is that GRBK expects to see tremendous, continued growth for the balance of 2021 and into 2022 based on how they have appropriated their lot sizing and development pipeline. I find additional confidence in my thesis knowing that a large portion of GRBK’s lot positions will be allocated to support the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands that cater to the entry level buyer group with an average purchase price below GRBK’s reported $438K average unit sale price.

Looking back to GRBK’s investor day presentation, it was reported that their Trophy brand of homes represented their largest portion of sales YTD. This is great news especially when considering that Trophy is one of GRBK’s highest margin brands. Let’s look at the following exhibit which supports this position:

[https://postimg.cc/G8vmLzQF](https://postimg.cc/G8vmLzQF)

Per the above, you can see that the majority of GRBK’s lot position is indeed allocated to support the Trophy brand in the DFW area. Moreover, when comparing their YTD units started being lower than their other brands but showing a higher allocation of total lots controlled for the same period makes me believe that they’re truly focusing in on driving growth at the entry level buyer segment and have big plans for the remainder of 2021. Unfortunately, GRBK didn’t provide as much information regarding their plans for the CB JENI brand outside of comments made by GRBK’s leadership team, and the President of CB JENI, that they would indeed be focusing on this brand as well. Lastly, look at the financial growth results produced by Trophy:

[https://postimg.cc/7C22z396](https://postimg.cc/7C22z396)

The key takeaway here is how GRBK has managed to so efficiently manage their Trophy brands product to secure such incredible results on its financial growth. Lowered SG&amp;A will lead to higher margins and GRBK has already stated that their OS is how they hope to continue improving upon lowering their SG&amp;A. Another interesting thing to comment on about Trophy is how GRBK has led with some market innovation by using pre-manufactured roofing trusses and pre-built wall panels. These strategies have allowed the Trophy brands to better control construction materials costs and decrease their skilled labor needs. Lastly, they’re able to increase their build cycle timelines by having these pre-manufactured and pre-built materials included as part of their home construction.

Overall, I think GRBK has a great strategy in place for their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands and will ultimately continue to see popularity amongst entry level homebuyers. One thing I will note is that we cannot turn a blind eye to the global supply chain disruptions that are plaguing the market end-to-end and as a result of GRBK using pre-manufactured and pre-built construction materials in their homes could open them to susceptible project overages if they must pivot to more conventional methods during the construction process; this would most likely create a negative impact to their brand SG&amp;A and profit margins.

**vii.**  **Competition**

Make no mistake, there is plenty of competition in this sector. When comparing GRBK to their competition you will find that they’re generally a smaller player in this sector in terms of market cap. For comparison, Lennar (LEN) maintains a market cap of \~$33.5BN vs. GRBK’s market cap of $1.35BN. However, of all the competitors there really are only two that have a similar market cap, float, and P/E to GRBK. Those competitors are Tri Point Homes (TPH) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC). Other tickers for this sector include: KBH, NVR, MHO, CCS, MDC, DHI, PHM, and LGIH.

I have not spent nearly as much time researching GRBK’s competitors, however a review of their overall performance seems to show that the sector in general is doing very well. I think there are some other sympathetic trading plays here to be made that apply to GRBK’s competition, too. If you’re interested in GRBK I think it would be worth the time to investigate some of these other tickers for investment consideration, too. Lastly, I’ll comment that you should look at XHB, which is the S&amp;P homebuilder ETF.

**viii.**  **Bear Case**

The primary concern that I have for not just GRBK alone, but this sector, is maintain buyer demand. Without buyer demand high there is little opportunity for GRBK to continue posting these record profits. Personally, I got interested in this space after having gone through the process of trying to buy a home myself and subsequently being priced out of where I hoped to buy. My response to this was to simply to just “wait and see” how the market responds. I’ll admit that I’m beginning to think my decision was a mistake based on what I’ve researched.

Another consideration to make is existing unit backlogs. GRBK reported a backlog of 1,876 at an average unit price of $519K for Q2 2021. By GRBK’s own admission, they are closely monitoring their backlog inventories but are not yet concerned of driving down these supply figures. There are two concerns here I recognize: if buyer demand drops off the backlog and spec home units will pile up and create a negative impact to GRBK’s bottom life and capital efficiencies. I will be closely watching GRBK’s backlog numbers reported for Q3 2021.

Mortgage rates right now are at historic lows but are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Low interest rates can offset some of the financial cost associated with purchasing a more expensive home – you’re robbing Peter (mortgage company) with a lower interest rate, to pay Paul (GRBK, other builders) for their higher priced products. The concern here is that if cost does not equally level out when interest rates eventually increase, then you can no longer expect to be able to rob Peter to pay Paul, which would effectively price more people out of the market. Again, it’s going to be critical to see what happens with the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brand lines of GRBK since they’ll be focusing on the cheaper entry level buyer space.

Lot availability is a concern. I’ve already pointed out how The Wolf has stated that homebuilder success is directly attributable to their lot positions. If GRBK is not able to continue to manage their lot pipeline to pace accordingly with their building timelines and schedules for the upcoming years, then they will face problems with meeting their high growth projections. Watching the overall progression of available lots for the MSAs that GRBK operates in, and their subsequent lot acquisition pricing will be huge to gauge whether they can keep up this performance.

I’m sure there are other bear cases to be made, however this is what I’ve come up with now. Please feel free to add and comment with your own takes and considerations. Overall, I feel as though the bull cases still outweigh the bear cases to be made for this ticker.

**iv.**  **Technical Analysis**

For those of you who place a considerable amount of weight to TA, then you can thank u/Fox_Technicals for reviewing this. I’m going to do my best to interpret what I see, however I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals chime in with any additional comments or observations they would like to make in the form of edits and updates to the post. We’ll start looking at the following:

[https://postimg.cc/dhT1NqyN](https://postimg.cc/dhT1NqyN)

This chart is looking to show us that GRBK may be on its way towards a breakout from the 2X.XX something share price it’s been trading at for so long. I’d also comment here that following their recent Q2 2021 earnings that most Analysts are maintaining price targets that range from the low to mid 30s; one such example is B. Riley raised their original PT of $35/share to $37/share on 8/05/21. This also shows that the lower trend could target somewhere in the 24s. Also, it’s important to note the comparison to XHB and that GRBK’s RSI is improving against XHB. The key takeaway here is when comparing GRBK against XHB is that GRBK has been growing faster than some of their competitor peers. Earlier I mentioned LEN as a competitor to GRBK, so let’s look at LEN:

[https://postimg.cc/4Hd46ZG5](https://postimg.cc/4Hd46ZG5)

Looking at this chart, u/Fox_Technicals is showing that LEN also appears to be on a breakout trend upwards. Now, admittedly I’m not as familiar with LEN’s business as I am with GRBK but based on what little review I’ve done they also seem to be doing extremely well as far as financial results are concerned. I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals provide any additional commentary on this ticker that they’ve identified. Next, we’ll look at XHB:

[https://postimg.cc/0rWy86GH](https://postimg.cc/0rWy86GH)

Looking back to the initial chart of GRBK, and then comparing it to XHB, you’ll recall that GRBK’s RSI was increasing against homebuilders (XHB). Well, when you look at this chart and compare XHB against SPY you can see there are higher highs being made against SPY. This action could signal that we’re looking at a potential breakout for leading the market

**x.**  **Strategy**

As mentioned in the initial, TL;DR, I think the primary play here is with shares. However, there is a way to play this with options as well, but we need to be clear on the risks as such. Fortunately, this section should be brief in contrast to the rest of this submission, but there really isn’t much strategy surrounding what I think is best or “safest” with respect to this stock and that’s holding shares. Truly, just buy shares and hold and I think you will see a great return especially around their Q3 2021 earnings call.

Now, about options there is a way to play this if you’re okay with the risk. Couple of things you need to know is that overall GRBK doesn’t have much volume in their average daily shares traded. Currently their three-month average daily volume is only 433K shares/day against a float of approximately 50.77MM shares. Additionally, you must recognize that GRBK’s options are extremely illiquid. The bid/ask spreads are tremendously wide, and you will run the risk of getting hammered on bad fills (or plainly just not getting filled at all).

That’s not a lot of daily movement and as a result the IV for their option chain is low – only currently showing \~48%. So, if you’re interested, you could look at picking up OTM calls for September &amp; November expiries to try and possibly benefit from increased performance in this sector over the coming weeks/months and make your gains from any increases in IV accordingly. Personally, I do not think this is a good idea and is well outside of my risk profile but I’m sure for some of you this is right what you’re looking for.

Now, the safer options play would be to target ITM options with a delta value of ≥.70 for expiries beginning in September at the earliest. If you can afford these calls, you would be able to (more or less) establish for yourself a synthetic long position without needing to hold shares. The caveat to this is that you’re going to benefit less from things such as IV expansion as the delta values of your calls become closer to a value of 1.0. The strategy here is to ride the calls for as long as you probably would if you were instead holding shares. Again, I still think shares are the better play, but you do what’s best for you.

**xi.**  **Conclusion &amp; Disclaimer**

I am not a financial advisor. I have made tremendously questionable investment decisions during my short time spent here on reddit. As a result, please do your own research. Please review what I’ve written and check into it for yourself. Essentially do not blindly take my word for anything and instead do a bit of legwork and figure out if you think you see the value in this ticker (hell, or even sector) like I do. These statements and writings are nothing more than my opinion and should not be interpreted as professional and legitimate financial or investment advice.

That now being out the way, I do believe in GRBK’s growth strategy and overall business model. I think that GRBK is an affordable, value play in this sector that will only look to see increased coverage in months to come. I also think that GRBK is uniquely positioned above their competition to be successful in how they manage their affiliate and subsidiary builders. Also, I’m quite pleased to see how GRBK was head of the curve in their decision to accumulate immense lot ownership to fuel their continued growth objectives. Lastly, GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Big Jim, has a great approach to manage debt-to-capital in a way that has successfully proven that you don’t need to lever yourself to the eyeballs to secure great profit results.

Currently I only maintain active positions in GRBK. My positions are solely in call options. Let me explain why that is. I’ve currently been holding 2x 8/20 25c since this past April to speculate on this stock before entering a long position. My intent was to see the share price rise to \~$27 sometime in June and then at that point make the decision to either cut away and STC my calls or exercise. I never hit my PT and therefore will most likely look to roll my calls to November OPEX or flat out exercise next Friday. I also picked up some lottery tickets this week when the rally began on Monday at 3x $30 strike – these calls are not doing great as you can imagine for all the reasons I mentioned above. Lastly, I have a single call for September OPEX at the $30 strike. Here is a snapshot of my positions:

personalfinance,House hunt sanity check - would we be house poor?,"Hey everyone! So my wife and I have been trying to buy our first house for about 7 months now. We live in Nashville, and the housing market is just insane (last house we put in an offer 50k over asking and didn't get it, ha).

The worry is definitely there that we're getting priced out of our own city, but we're trying to be rational about everything and not panic just yet. After the last missed house, we are considering putting down offers that are a bit higher than we were initially comfortable with though. I wanted to post here as a sanity check basically and just make sure that this isn't a terrible idea.

So the financial situation:

I'm a freelancer so it's hard to say what exactly I'll make in a year. But 2019 I made 70k pre taxes, 2020 I made 107k pre taxes, looking like this year I'll make a bit more (like 120k-ish). My wife makes around 30-35k per year depending on overtime at her job.

We've got roughly \~110k saved up in the bank right now. I've been contributing to my IRA for the past 4 years so there's something like \~25k in that, and my wife has some in a 401k as well.

We've got no credit card debt (I just pay that off every week or two). She has some student loan debt that's about 280/month and a car payment that's about 270/month.

We're thinking about upping our offers to around the \~425k range, with 7.5% down. Chatted with our lender and it looks like with the current interest rates, that would come out to about $2100/month (including insurance and PMI).

Thoughts? Would this be a more-or-less responsible decision?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoins aren't backed by cash and that's ok,"Everyone has been wondering if their money is actually safe being kept in stablecoins recently. Although they aren't insured by the FDIC, they are still backed by cash **and cash equivalents**. This week, the news that USDC doesn't cite that they are backed by cash anymore was very unsettling for many and made its way into many headlines.

**Cash equivalent securities**

In addition to holding cash, stablecoins will hold other assets. These assets are still very low risk and also backed by the US government. All things you want to hear when holding a coin that is meant to follow the USD. Usually, this will consist of either U.S. treasury bills, U.S. Treasury coupons, U.S. government obligations, or repurchase agreements.

Treasury bills and treasury coupons are basically the same thing, just with different maturity dates. These are government debt instruments issued by the U.S. to finance government spending. Basically, the government will pay interest to the purchaser in order to borrow money from them. Government obligations are just another word for the same thing, it all goes toward funding the federal debt.

Repurchase agreements, known by many of you as Repo, is another way for funds to borrow money. Typically, an entity will obtain repurchase agreements from the government in order to sell more government securities to investors. It will cost the entity interest, but they will charge higher interest to the people they sell the securities to anyway.

**Examples of popular funds that aren't backed by cash**

If you have a money market fund or even just any money in a bank, most of that money isn't backed by physical USD. You've already seen this in movies when they show the bank vault holding gold bars. In reality, they all also hold these government-backed securities listed above. Yet, we trust these without hesitation. The only difference is that these are backed by the FDIC, so it's a lot less scary because of insurance that the customer can see. But these funds and banks don't want to lose their money either. So they're also holding these securities as insurance.

You can literally find this information online. [Vanguard money market fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vmfxx), [Fidelity gov. money market fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/31617H102), [Fidelity money market fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/31617H201), etc. These are all default funds that your cash sits in at these brokers when they're not invested in anything like stocks.

**TL;DR** Stablecoins following the USD are still backed by the government and safe if they're not backed directly by USD. Find one that's reputable and with little volatility and don't worry about it.

Edit: I'm not defending Tether and not any others. None of them are necessarily backing their assets safely. I'm just trying to explain that it's normal for something intending to follow the USD to not be backed by USD.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,You’ve got your opinions on the best coin ever. That and $2 can get you a Coke at the 7-11.,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and lord this sub is full of them.  Everyone is this sub has their favorite project, their moonshot hope, and the coins they despise.  But one truth seems to remain above all else:

#Opinions on crypto, both yours and mine, are almost guaranteed to mean dick.

BTC Is King.  ETH is then  Kingdom.  Both have pretty much become the benchmark of the entire space and have earned their places as the bellwethers of crypto.  Unless of course, the Tether bomb actually goes off and collapses the market.  After all, Tether is a Ponzi right?  Pretty much everyone in this sub agrees on it, it’s being investigated by the federal government, it is endlessly created out of nothing and is the driving force of bitcoin’s rise and hence everything else with it.  But it’s worthless.  And in being worthless, it will collapse right? Any day now… right?…

Speaking of collapse, how the fuck has shib stayed in even the top 100? Or worse, made it to the top 30? After all, it’s literally a parody joke coin *of a parody joke coin.* And yet some people made a -ton- of money off of that terrible joke.

Oh, and speaking of, then there is Doge.  Doge gets a lot of hate.  And I’ll be the first to throw my hat in and talk about how much doge deserves it.  118 billions coins and growing at 10k coins a minute.  Utter shit, obviously.

#Except, if you bought Doge in 2014 and BTC, and sold at both their tops, Doge would have been 3X the investment BTC was.

Yup, you can hate the data and it’s fucked, but math doesn’t lie.

So remember, when you’re discussing why your totally under-appreciated defi project is the real deal, when you talk about how Ethereum Classic is absolutely the garbage that it is, when you say Safemoon is going to zero (okay it totally is) or that your token is so great that it will change everything,  just remember, we truly do know shit about fuck.

personalfinance,Pay off 8.5% auto loan or keep saving for house.,"I’ve found myself with a choice to make. 


Right now I have what is left of an auto loan (10,000) at an 8.5% interest rate. I’ve been over paying the bill each month by about 200, principal only payments so I’m not upside down on the loan. I’m just about even on the loan. So I could sell the car and walk away at zero if I wanted. 

Or. I can pay off the car completely tomorrow. And just be done with it. (Immediate 8.5% return on investment?) 

Or, keep the 10 thousand in my house savings and use it as additional down payment towards a house. 




I should mention that my Roth IRA is maxed out for the year, and I have a full emergency fund. 

So this question is more about what to do with an additional 10k. 

Invest it? 

Use it to pay off the 8.5% loan? 

Or use it to give me a little more buying power for a house. 

Thanks everyone!!",finance
personalfinance,Where to put money with low risk/easy access?,"TLDR: Retiring military, selling house, paying off debt, moving and buying another house. Needs safe (very low risk) place to store remaining cash and make a little interest while maintaining ability to have access to the cash at any moment. 

Ok, so background. Retiring from military. Selling house, obviously making a lot of profit. Closing late August. I've been up to my ears in debt for years and am finally able to rid it all and have a large amount in savings afterwards. I know what i need to do long term: Pay off all debts. Max out roth. Build 6 months expense in savings. Start investing stocks. Here's the short term issue:

Im moving, so i need to buy a house. I dont know if i will be building new, or just buying a pre-owned off the market. I have access to a VA loan (and honestly just prefer to not make a down payment), but may need cash to offer over-ask price and cover due diligence/escrow/and potentially appraisal gap. 

Long story short, i may need to have access to the cash quickly if i find a home fast...so like 6/12 month CD's arent an option. I can't afford to lose ANY of it, so stocks aren't an option either. Sure, i could let it sit in checking...but i may as well make some interest until i solve the housing issue. 

So, what options do i have to make interest on a fairly large amount of money that is a higher interest rate than a checking acount, but still allows me to have full immediate access to it at any point while still being very low risk? I do underatand the interest will be very low...but it beats a checking account right?

Forgive me if this is a basic ass question...but i truly don't know my options. Thank you in advance!!!!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto As A Legitimate Global Currency Discussion,"I understand that many people investing in crypto are doing just that...investing.  Much like a traditional stock, it seems like a lot of people in the crypto landscape don't see it as a currency, but a volatile high-risk investment.  That is completely fair...thus far.

However, I feel like that mindset is a bit reductive.  I realize that I'm not as well versed on the subject as many are on this sub, but I'd love to start some discourse on this since I don't see much talk about it.

I feel like there have been some clear frontrunners in the crypto space as far as market cap etc...but those top coins have organically settled into their own respective spaces for different purposes.

For example:

**Bitcoin** \- Obviously the frontrunner from the very inception of cryptocurrency.  However, while people initially started using it to buy pizzas or weed or whatever, it morphed into an investment vehicle rather than a legit ""everyday"" expenditure asset.  Albeit expensive to mine etc., it's still a great investment opportunity in my (and many others') opinion.  \*\*NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just saying.\*\*

**Ethereum** \- What can I say...I love $ETH, and it really boils down to a few things...Vitalik is quite honestly one of the greatest minds and visionaries of where crypto can and will go from here.  Smart contracts, decentralized applications, the Dogethereum bridge, low mining costs (as opposed to the high costs associated with BTC mining, negatively impacting the global climate), low fee/gas costs...etc.  $ETH is not going anywhere but up in popularity from here.  I am anxiously awaiting the things that this coin/platform will be able to accomplish...and I'm not purely referring to the monetary value.  \*\*I hate to have to say it, but again...NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, merely conjecture.\*\*

**Dogecoin** \- I know $DOGE gets a decent amount of pushback on this sub, but let's be honest about it.  In my humble, and albeit fairly uneducated, opinion...$DOGE is very likely the frontrunner for a daily usable cryptocurrency.  It's cheaper per coin (and likely will be in the foreseeable future), which makes a lot more sense to the average consumer.  It's a lot easier to mentally compute 1 pizza = \~33$DOGE than 1 pizza = \~0.00022275$BTC.  It's also got the support of the people.  Crypto in general is often called ""the people's currency"" but $DOGE has got a &lt;&lt;RABID&gt;&gt; fanbase.  I actually love it.  Do you think that the people that work for the FED printing paper money every day love what they're doing as much as $DOGE hodlers?  Not very likely.

&amp;#x200B;

\~2M r/dogecoin subscribers

\~1M r/ethereum subscribers

\~3M r/cryptocurrency subscribers

&amp;#x200B;

That's a voice that can't really be drowned out...and that's only on Reddit.  Not to mention, that's just the people that want to read about this stuff every day.

Of course, there are a number of other top contenders in the cryptosphere, but what I'd really like to do as a SEMI-informed crypto supporter...I'd like to open up a discourse about realistic goals and real-world ideas as a basic roadmap of where we as a community want this thing to go.

What are YOUR thoughts on where we need to go with crypto?  Different types of coins have different pros and cons as far as what they're useful for.  Is $BTC the new 401k?  Is $ETH the new non-fiat transactional internet currency for digital apps and microtransactions?  Is $DOGE the next ""everyday purchase"" currency?

&amp;#x200B;

**The way I look at it is this:**

Would you hold onto a dollar instead of spending it because you thought it would go up in value in the near future?

If you spending that dollar in your pocket would increase the likelihood of it becoming the predominant currency in the global economy, would you do it then?

You can still hold onto savings while spending your preferred currency on things that need to be immediately purchased, yes?  We all need to purchase things from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also seen a TON of people wanting to get Amazon, Tesla, etc etc to accept crypto.  While I completely support this, I don't feel that is the most efficient way forward.  Rightly, the more businesses that accept crypto for payment will have more sway for credit/banks to decide to follow suit.

However, while I do believe that gaining adoption from large retailers is key, why not focus higher up the chain first?  Mastercard/Visa.  Paypal.  Apple/Google Pay.  Venmo.  If we could get credit/banks (or even widely accepted payment firms, such as Paypal) to accommodate crypto...it would be a game changer.  What would it take to prove crypto's worth to them?

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

91. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

98. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

104. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

I have been thinking about investment opportunities which will be massive in the future (10+ years). So companies in their baby shoes, being cheap too, which will boom massively. I have identified following themes:


Psychedelics - It becomes more and more obvious that depression, PTSD etc. can be treated with such. I believe it will play massive part in future health care

Cannabis - Once the US makes it legal on federal level the market will explode

Lab Meat - For environmental, ethical and efficiency reasons future meat will be produced in a lab

space travel - if you can spend a reasonable amount of time in space for a reasonable price, you will do so. Even if it’s a stretch.

The Feds: As of May, both the White House and central bankers have explored ways to look into the challenges of cryptocurrency. 

Popularity Downside: The growth and wild volatility for Dogecoin has fueled more speculation of regulation into the entire crypto market.

Final Thoughts: As of now, there’s no ban against Dogecoin in the United States, but new regulations could potentially factor in the future of this meme coin.

Bitcoin,Stable Coin Relation to Bitcoin,"Hello everyone, 

I am a HODLer who is convinced with the underlying idea of BTC. Recently I was researching about savings account for my BTC to increase my stacks. I was looking at ledn.io and found that they having saving accounts for BTC (6.5% APY) and USDC (8.5%). I was wondering, where they got such high rates from, especially for USDC. It doesn't make sense to me as USDC is pretty much just the greenbacks. Why would people give out such high interest rates, where commercial banks couldn't. So I delved further about stablecoins and I found out that Tether, which is a big issuer of stablecoins, seems to be quite shady about its reserve. Another article also points out that BTC trade is highly denominated in stablecoins. If the reserve of stablecoins is shady and its circulation is inflated, it means that the market price of BTC in USD would also be inflated. I understand that this could be addressed using a similar argument that BTC vis a vis USD is increasing because of money printing. However there might be two printers, namely the Fed and Tether Ltd. The former is printing what BTC is denominated against. On the other hand, if the latter doesn't have its reserve, it means that BTC has been pumped using hot air and could lose its value against USD. 

My question is, is anyone here knowledgeable about stablecoins, and can reassure me that stablecoins are truly backed by real greenbacks? And what do you folks think about my theory?

NFT,Modern Art: A New Way Billionaires Use To Evade Taxes,"Benjamin Franklin once said, “*In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes*”.

Unfortunately, the quote’s value has slowly begun to erode. While the commoners have no choice but to stick to their paychecks and small investments, the ones who hold assets with monstrous economic value are constantly taxed on a larger scale. 

Let me put it this way: **If the average U.S citizen pays 30% income tax, most billionaires should be paying at least 50% in federal income tax.** However, as the number of billionaires and millionaires increases, more tax loopholes are unearthed. Now, you must be thinking that most assets are already taxed and those that are ignored, barely have any growth potential. 

After all, the only investments floating around are none other than real estate and stocks, which can easily be taxed by the government. Even commodities like Bitcoin are under the watch of the U.S government! 

# The solution

The answer lies in the homes of painters and billionaires alike; Modern Art!

It makes work unbelievably simple for billionaires. You can transport it without inspection and easily store it in homes without being questioned. It can make millions for you with the help of incredible sales agents and auction placements. 

Although sales tax is an exclusion, due to the extreme volatility and incalculable economic value, the government has no justifiable reason to tax the asset. And because its price depends on each buyer, it also abides by the greater fool theory.

Similarly, this works for digital art too! I’ve explained the world of digital art in my blog ***‘***[***NFTs: Investment opportunity and the hype***](https://www.affordassets.com/blogs-nfts-explained-investment-opportunity-and-the-hype/)***’***, which is another way to evade taxes.

CryptoCurrency,Banks(Digital or Traditional) are Disgusting,"I just spent the past few half an hour trying to transfer fiat from a bank to a e-wallet. The experience is utterly terrible. It will cost 1$ just to transfer it directly. And jumping through a few hoops I can lower it to 50cents.


You might ask why even be bothered by such a small amount? Well, as a 3rd world dweller every bit of fiat means a lot.

You might also ask, why do you need to transfer it to an e-wallet? Well, aside from the e-wallet having a 3% interest rate compared to the banks 0.01%, the convenience of using an e-wallet over fiat especially in Covid times is just invaluable.

You might also ask, why not just use fiat? Bank atms charge a fee for ANY transaction and again Covid isn't really the best time to use fiat.

personalfinance,Question about CP22 for 2018,"Hi! I moved to the US in Aug 2018. I got a CPA to do my taxes for that year and was filing jointly with my wife. 

Because we were here (and I was paid) for only 4 months, my wages and return was pretty small. The withholding took care of it and I was taxed at 7% for that sum. 

I did not have any other US income (investments, etc) that year.

I got a tax refund for federal and state. 

Yesterday I received a letter from IRS saying that I owed them 8K (including interest over the years) and the letter specifically says the amount I reported does not match what was reported to them by my payers and trustees. 

The only income I got came from the W2. 

I tried calling them but they hung up on me (literally: we have a high volume of calls, try again, bye). 

In your experience, does this sound like it might be because of the differential in wages (my last tax return was 5-6x of that) the year I got here, or did my CPA / former employer make a mistake?",finance
personalfinance,Multiple credit cards questions...,"Sorry I didn't see anything regarding this in the wiki, maybe I'm blind though. &gt;_&lt;

So... some background first. My credit score is 800+. I have 3 credit cards:

- My oldest (~13-14 years old) through USAA.

- My second oldest (~9-10 years old) through Amazon/Chase.

- My youngest (~4.5 years old) through RoomsToGo/Synchrony.

I have a $0 balance on my USAA card and my RoomsToGo card.  Both of them just collect dust in my junk drawer and never get used at all.  I use my Amazon/Chase card for nearly everything and pay the statement balance every month.  So... couple questions:

1. Is this hurting me/my credit score in any way (not using 2/3 cards), or is *total* available balance and *total* utilization all that matters?  Literally have never swiped the RoomsToGo one, and haven't touched the USAA one in over a year.

2. How much (if at all?) would my credit get hit if I were to close the USAA card?  I've recently switched all my banking to Navy Federal, so I'm debating closing/getting rid of the USAA card... but don't want to if it'll *really* hurt me cause of its age.

3. Would question #2 be impacted further (good or bad) if I got an increase to my Amazon card to compensate for the loss, or opened a Navy Federal card instead?

Thanks in advance for any answers! :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,"If all you think about is market cap, you don’t actually believe in crypto. This is a volatile space and you need to know what you are dealing with. This information is crucial to you not blowing your investment","I see a lot of people buying coins based solely  on market cap calculations. I think this is foolish. Market cap is a useful metric, but this is not the stock market. This is a new technology for decentralizing executive control of energetic distribution.

Let’s talk about currency, value, price, and market cap.

#Currency - A thermodynamic IOU

Currency, in all forms, be it fiat, crypto, or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in your cells, is a way of guaranteeing that thermodynamics will be on your side when you need it. All nonspontaneous things in the world require energy to do. ATP gives your cells energy for chemical reactions by harvesting the force of an adenosine molecule bound to two phosphate ions electrochemically holding onto a third. That energy is guaranteed by one of the fundamental forces of physics, the electroweak force: no matter the context, the end of the triphophate bond holds a certain amount of energy that can reliably be extracted directly for application.

However, on the macro level, while thermodynamic still rules with an iron fist, we can’t rely on owning chemically trapped energy to use directly. We have to abstract it to currency. So we use dollars to say “I desire the application of energy to a task.” 

But there isn’t infinite energy in the universe. Unlike ATP, human currency assumes that the current total sum of IOUs for energy and their collective representation in our minds is smaller than the total energy we can harvest from all applications of all technologies on all resources for all tasks we want to accomplish.

Inherently, currency in a capitalistic system relies on there always being exponential growth. There’s no such thing as always in this universe, at least not for humans.

Still, we assume there will be enough energy, and that makes whatever we want to invest energy in valuable.

#Value - The Abstract Utility of Ownership

Warren Buffet says that price is what you pay and value is what you get. But what is value in its real sense?

Value is an abstract concept representing the material or psychological utility of a tangible or intangible entity. In other words, you get value out of a thing by having and/or using the thing. But how do you have or use a thing before you buy it? How do you know what the value of a thing is before you can actually extract it yourself?

You’ve heard BTC and all of crypto called a speculative asset because as of yet it holds no material utility that, if it disappeared, would suddenly be needed by the mainstream economic system. However, this ignores the fact that **all value is inherently speculative.** Value can’t be known before acquisition; it can only be speculated upon. Humans give value by speculation that there will be utility in ownership. 

If you don’t believe there is utility in ownership of a part of a network of freely exchangeable values, you don’t belong in crypto.

Still, the problem remains on how to assess value before acquisition - we can’t just throw our hands up in the air and give up to the whims of causality. Humans don’t do that, we kick causality in the teeth and shortcut our way around reality until reality works for us. That’s why we use a little thing called price.

#Price - A Time-Locked Snapshot of Appreciation of Value

Consider physics once more. Our equation for distance is the rate of travel in a normalized direction (velocity) multiplied by time. But what if we don’t know the rate? Well, we can get the rate by getting the distance and dividing by the time, but we started this by looking for distance. Luckily, we can also measure distance by simply taking two points and taking the linear differences in their positions.  

Think about that last part. We get data on distance from two points to *infer* the rate. What if our rate is changing over time? Two points won’t do it. A billion points won’t do it. **Much like value, we can’t know the actual rate just by observing history if the rate is known to change.** We can use mathematics to infer the rate in recent history and, with the advent of deep learning, we can approximate the rate from hard data.

Rest assured, whatever approximation you have, it is just an approximation. This is why they say past performance is no guarantee of future performance. We don’t know the rate of change in value, we can only infer it from context.

Naturally, anyone who buys something wants it to be for a good price. If someone buys something, their brain has convinced them that odds are good that the price now is lower than the price someone will pay for it later. In other words, they assume **the energy invested in acquiring the asset is less than the energy it will later take to acquire the asset.** If an asset requires more and more energy to acquire, it will appreciate. **If the value of an asset is what you will sell for it, then you only truly know the value when you are able to sell it.**

But knowing this, people will act on the assumption that other people are making this calculation. They will **speculate** that they are the one investing a lower amount of energy than people who have yet to buy when the asset appreciates.  This means that **understanding the nature of human speculation is critical to understanding the value of crypto.** 

Market cap can be a heuristic for this, but it’s not the be all end all.

#Market Cap - A Data Normalization Metric and Nothing More

As discussed earlier, price is a snapshot of value composed of different points of value extraction over time. With sufficiently many data points, we can approximate as real a value of a thing as we can manage. Market cap assumes that the amount of energy currently being invested for the most recent acquisition of one unit of the asset (i.e. the current price) is less than or equal to the amount of energy others will be willing to invest on other units of the asset.

Market cap DOES NOT MEAN that people have invested that much money into the market. It just means that the **value** of the market is currently at that point because **enough people are currently paying for that asset at that price.** 

Market cap **cannot be used exactly as it is in the stock market for a decentralized system.** We use market cap to value a coin because it’s a familiar system but the context of its use in stocks is important to understand. Apple’s market cap means that they have taken the value of all assets within their corporate structure, including stocks and real estate, and if liquidated simultaneously, the market cap would be all the money left on the table. This is similar to crypto in that if you liquidated all BTC simultaneously, you’d be left with over a trillion dollars. 

However, if Apple liquidated everything but used the funds to rebuild itself, Apple would still have value as people would still want to use it, even if their faith would be shaken by the liquidation. If all BTC were liquidated, the faith in the decentralized system would collapse. There would be no CEO or board to direct resources towards a unilateral response. There would be no new products. BTC would simply have failed to act as a store of value. Blockchain devs may try to augment the network to revitalize it, and it may work, but the circumstances of rebuilding the credibility of a blockchain and that of a company are different.

#Crypto works because inherently it is a **network**

The real value of BTC is, naturally, in the transactions on the bitcoin network. The value of an immutable ledger for monetary exchange is inherently appealing to the human psyche; the comfort of knowing that you and your resources will not be exiled should even some of the most respected parts of the network fail is impossible to quantify. 

In a way, it is like love: when people love each other, they assume that even if some of the things that signify love between them break down - if your partner snaps at you because they’re exhausted or if you forget to do the dishes because you got distracted, for example - the network effect of all the things combined will compensate for the presumed temporary malfunctions in one or more of its nodes. When a validation node goes down for BTC, the others pick up slack, and the users don’t assume all is lost based on a few lost nodes in the grand scheme. 

This applies to all crypto. The real value of holding all crypto is in having the capacity to leverage energy towards the support of the network for the guarantee that your network will yet remain standing and you will not have to do anything but own coin to do it.

#Additional Value - Speculative Technological Innovation and Tokenomics

BTC hasn’t been the only crypto out there for the better part of a decade. There are other features that give “real value” to blockchains. As we have discussed, it is impossible to know for certain the real value of anything, so we speculate. For all next gen coins, we can call anything beyond the aforementioned ubiquity of value for sustaining a transaction network added value. Ethereum’s added value is in the smart contracts; by holding ethereum you reserve the right to use the network to your whims. Staking, as will come with ETH2.0’s switch to proof of stake consensus, rewards this further.

Ethereum has been in the game for almost a decade now, and it too is no longer next gen crypto. The additional value granted by new technologies - the Proof of History in Solana, the Byzantine fault tolerance protocol of Stellar, the chains which are attempting mutual interoperability - is potentially vast. **However, realize that new technology does not inherently generate value.** You have to ask yourself what people who handle a lot of money - the whales, the governments, megacorps, banks  - gain from upholding this system which they themselves cannot own. If you find an answer, you can use that to make purchasing decisions.

#Tokenomics - Specialization of Non-Critical Features Promoting Growth of the Greater Ecosystem

However, not all coins come on new blockchains. Ethereum sparked a token generating gold rush, as new ERC20 tokens are minted and swapped every day on DEXs. Remember how earlier I talked about people’s speculation being baked into the value? Utility of the token itself can be a driver of value. Take exchange tokens like BNB or NEXO - these tokens directly reward you for engaging with the network by giving you more power to reserve the right to have a transaction. In NEXO’s case, you gain more reward for holding longer and, if your portfolio is &gt;=10%, you get access to the highest interest rates for savings and the lowest interest rates for loans. It’s nice when a company pays you to do business, isn’t it?

These are **emergent features** in the growing crypto economy of DeFi. In isolation, BNB and NEXO should be worthless - why would anyone use a company’s coin for the main unit of speculative energetic value exchange? Because crypto is an ecosystem now, and there is an evolutionary advantage to supporting the growth of the ecosystem even if you yourself are not the main driver. Remoras latch onto sharks to catch food the shark will leave behind, animals eat plants because plants gain energy from a limitless source and by definition can’t use it all, and further animals eat those animals. 

Tokenomics, like economics, is the study of scarcity, in this case as it relates to tokens. Evolution is a process which refines the components of an ecosystem which runs on scarce or limited fuel - namely, energy - and it operates on the core unit of information iteration: DNA. Humans evolved our big brains, stamina, manual dexterity, and a variety of other features because we experienced a great period of starvation in our history. As crypto relies on scarcity, non-genetic evolution will operate on its core units of iteration - the blockchains - and will so crypto will develop features that rest on bases of value we assume to be constant. 

In a sense, this is already happening with BTC and ETH.

#Conclusion: Supply and Demand Require Nuance to Fully Understand, Especially in Crypto

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations. You now know market cap is just a heuristic and that the real value comes in understanding not only the technology and not only the people who will want to use the technology, but also *the people who understand the people who will want to use the technology.* The market is made of people. AI can’t remove them; it operates based on our whims.

Use cases are all well and good, but they have to be something people want. Demand makes people want something from a supply; the supply has to be valuable for people to want it. Market cap may be good for helping us understand how much people want out of whatever is currently available of the supply, but it only applies to the specific asset in the supply. We can speculate about what if ETH flips BTC’s market cap or if doge can actually breach $10, but ultimately the value is unknown to us until we have the thing. 

In fact, even then, most of us probably only know the value when we sell it. You will have to approximate when your internally appreciated value matches the given price for sale. Make sure you have an exit strategy and DYOR.

I am wondering if there would be any tax benefit for filing as an LLC and electing to be taxed as an S Corp. 

I know it’s recommended to use the 60/40 rule, in which 60% of your income is taxed as a salary and the 40% is reported as a distribution to your employees(in this case, I would be the only employee of my corporation). 

If this would be beneficial, how would I go about filing this during tax time? Would I report $18600 (60%) as profits for the S Corp and $12400 (40%) as my W-2 income?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Reminder: Detractors who say cryptocurrency won't become mainstream because it's too complex are wrong. Crypto is simple to use. Difficult to understand? Sure. But so is fiat.,"I often hear detractors of crypto say that it's too complex of a system for mainstream use. ""My mom can't remotely understand it, what makes you think she's going to use it?"" or ""The only way crypto will gain mainstream adoption is if it's simplified by big tech companies... which will just operate like banks.""

*This is wrong.*  

Fiat is a perfect example.  
Walk up to the nearest adult you see. Ask them to explain how our monetary system works. Ask them to explain how inflation happens. How the government keeps track of dollars. How central banks set monetary policy. Why printing money doesn't tank economies.  

Most people have no clue how our financial system works, and often stumble over explaining concepts that they use every single day.  

But you know what's not difficult to understand?  

***I have money in the bank, and I can use that money to buy things.***  

That's all 90% of us really need to understand about money to use it on a daily basis. All of the other little things-- how a debit card works, how credit cards work, how to send $ to your friend who bought you a cab-- we learn as we go, and update as the world changes.  

Crypto is the same way. When someone first learns about hardware wallets (for instance), they're often confused about how they work. They ask questions like ""do i need my wallet to receive money?"" or ""is my money lost if I lose my wallet?""  

That's fine. Those questions can be answered as they arise, just like ""What happens if I lose my debit card, does my money disappear?"" or ""How does Venmo automatically take money out of my bank account?""   

But what is not complicated to understand is:   

***I have crypto in the blockchain, and I can use that crypto to buy things.***    

And that's what is important. All of the detractors who say the internal workings of crypto is too complicated for mainstream users to understand are projecting.  

As long as it's simple to use, convenient to use, and there is a reputation of trust built over years and years, every day folks will adopt it.

In the meantime, what we're doing-- sharing knowledge, testing the daily processes, developing and discussing best practices-- will benefit those users down the road.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Vehicle refinance before home purchase,"We are trying to refinance our vehicle. Long story short, we filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and then had to purchase a car. Due to our credit being in the trash, our interest rate is 12.5%.

We have since rebuilt our credit and are saving to purchase a home in the next six mo- 1 year. We have two offers for a refi. We owe $18k on the vehicle with 58 months remaining. 

Option 1: 58 months 4.6% interest would save $50ish a month

Option 2: 66 months, 4.5% interest, and saving $90 a month. 

I don't want to take on a longer loan. However, it will “lower” our DTI with the lower monthly payment. Regardless of which option we take, we will still make the same payments we are now. 

We want to pay off the vehicle in about two years or less.  Which option would be better, knowing we plan on purchasing our home—the smaller payment with the longer-term or the same term now, with minimal monthly savings. 


TLDR: which option should we chose for a vehicle refinance. Bankruptcy was filed in 2019. Planning on purchasing a home within the next 6mo - 1 year.",finance

CryptoCurrency,3 Good Things to Expect After A Tether Crypto Crash,"**DeFi with a lower barrier of entry:**  After a big crypto crash, we can expect low fees and faster transaction  speed. Hopefully, DeFi platforms are more welcoming to beginners that  way. 

**Less Rug Pull:**  Like after the 2008 crisis, authorities could introduce stricter  regulations toward crypto. It’s not entirely a bad thing, especially  when it provides ways for bad actors to be held accountable for their  actions. 

**Government embracing digital currencies:**  Tether showed us how it’s a slippery slope to let private entities print  fiat-backed stablecoins. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a good  idea to replace shady stables like Tether. FED isn’t perfect, but at  least it got an entire country holding them accountable.

personalfinance,Best credit card for my lifestyle,"Hi all,

No debt, only real expenses related to family matters i.e. mortgage, groceries, utilities, childcare, xyz. 

I current have a BOA travel rewards card and it kinda blows. I make a lot more now than when I got it so I know I'll get a credit increase regardless. 

Last credit score I had was near perfect, idk if that comes into play. 

We used to travel a lot we have family on both ends of the country and in remote places. But that's lessened due to everything and new jobs. 

My job has a travel card for large expenses but I use my card for gas and get reimbursed later and I travel probably like 30 percent of the time. 

I have seen alot about the Citi 2x points back on everything. Seems straightforward enough. 

Does anyone have reccomendations for something better or is that just the safest play? I'm having a hard time navigating everything. My current bank doesn't seem to have anything good offered (Santander) and the bank who holds my Mortgage (Navy Federal) has an OK card but personally I have had terrible experiences with them and would like to avoid using them further.",finance
personalfinance,Options for student loan repayment,"Hello all, looking for some advice on how I should approach my student loans. I recently finished grad school with approximately 140k in student loans. All of them are federal, 80k are direct unsubsidized at (received at 6% interest), 60k are Grad Plus (received at 7% interest). With the payment pause extended, I’ve just been saving money from my new job (I work in healthcare) My semi-monthly paycheck is a little over 3k and I’m putting most of it away right now because I live at home with my parents for the next year.

I’ve considered a few approaches and understand that there will be tradeoffs with all of them. I can be aggressive and pay them off as soon as possible which would most likely be 5+ years of living below my means and not enjoying a comfortable lifestyle in my late 20s and early 30s. I know the Dave Ramsay snowball/avalanche methods would recommend paying off my 60k loan as fast as possible then work on my 80k left.

Another alternative I was thinking of was to pay off the 60k aggressively over the next 1-2 years (especially while I’m home and can save more) and then refinancing the 80k to a lower interest rate. Of course, my monthly payments would probably be still relatively high if I pay it off over 10 years. With the two former options, I would not have much of a savings to stand on, especially a emergency fund.

My BIL told me to pay minimum and not be too aggressive now because then I can’t enjoy life, which is of course true, but also maybe not the most financially responsible thing to do for me with this amount of debt. I imagine it would be difficult to afford anything of value over the next 20 years with this amount of debt over my head.

Of course, debt forgiveness (to any degree) would be a blessing. But I am not going to hold my breath for it. A) I do not have faith the federal govt will do it at all. B) If they went through with it, who knows if it would extend to graduate loans. If they cancelled interest, well, I guess I would have to reevaluate entirely.

Before anyone recommends it, I do not think public loan forgiveness will be a good option for me as I do not plan on staying where I live beyond 3-5 years (the standard of living is too damn high on Long Island). I do plan on moonlighting in another job at some point to bring in more income.

There is also the NHSC program for healthcare workers that offer student loan repayment if you work for certain underserved populations that meet certain criteria. You commit to a contract of 1-3 years and the reimbursement towards your loans can be 25-100k depending on the facility. These programs, however, are selective and the best offers are in remote areas, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The one red flag, however, is that during the time that I work there, if the govt changes the designation of the facility and revokes it’s status, I am responsible to pay back everything I was given.

Please, let me know what you think and tell me if I’m missing something huge or not approaching this correctly. My biggest problem with all of this is committing to a strategy and sticking to it. I do not have a lot of experience with budgeting unfortunately, so this is all new to me. This doesn't even factor in 401k contributions, investments, future rent, etc.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, August 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 13, 2021**

Stocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.

Yesterday’s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. 

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It’s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. 

On the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. 

Earlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)

personalfinance,Recently moved and started working in the US and would appreciate advice on ways to save my money,"Hey Everyone,

So I [23f] recently moved to the US and started working. I have no debt. My take home after 401k and hsa contributions is about 4k/month. My rent is about 2k/month. 

I have a 401k setup that I am making about a 15% contribution to every paycheck. I have been reading up on other investment options but am not sure what my best path forward is. I plan to open a Roth IRA and max my contributions to that. I also already have an HSA that my employer makes contributions to up to 2000. My emergency fund is currently just sitting in my checking.

The main questions I had were:
1. What is a good HYSA (or alternative) to put my emergency fund in? (I read through a bunch of other posts about them, but with interest rates so low I'm not really sure if it's still the best choice)
2. After making monthly contributions to my 401k I likely won't reach the contribution limit (this year) since I only started working in June of this year. Should I prioritize maxing out my contribution over making other investments?
3. After hypothetically maxing out 401k, roth ira, and hsa contributions, then living necessities, what should I do with the rest of my money?

stocks,Investing in American Cannabis: the Essential Information,"I saw someone earlier here mention they’re down big on $MJ. Many others said the same, and it’s making me realize how little most understand about the developing American cannabis industry. 

I’ve spent the last couple months mainly analyzing MSOs (multi-state operators… you’ll be seeing this a lot), and there’s several crucial points one must understand before putting a single penny in cannabis. 

Point 1: $MJ is a Global cannabis etf with holdings in the both the US and Canada mainly. $MSOS, on the other hand, is a strictly US cannabis etf with holdings in MSOs. 

MSOs are called such because their operations are vertically integrated by state. For example, company A may own dispensaries in Florida and Massachussets, but any product in the Florida dispensaries must have been harvested in Florida. And any product in the Mass. dispensaries must have been harvested in Mass. This is due to cannabis being a schedule 1 substance, and therefore illegal to transport across all state borders (even if both states have legalized cannabis, as interstate commerce is regulated federally).

Back to my point - Most Canadian cannabis companies are yet to show profitability while most MSOs are already EBITDA positive. The MSOs are in a much better spot to benefit from American legalization, and if Canadian cannabis will do anything, it’ll be mainly M&amp;A. 

So, if you’re betting on American cannabis, buy $MSOS and check out the holdings.

Point 2: MSOs are going down because… there’s no reason for them to up. 

There’s a perfect storm explaining why MSOs have been bleeding since Feb 2021. Firstly, institutional investors are being barred from investing. This relates back to cannabis still being strictly illegal federally. There is no institutional backing into these companies, but once there will be, the price will follow. Secondly, with cannabis, no legislative news is bad news. The longer Schumer and co in the senate take to vote on banking laws/full legalization, the longer MSOs are going to bleed. People will take their capital elsewhere in the meantime. Thirdly, we saw MSOs jump as Biden took office. The months since have shown us that his administration is perhaps not as serious in getting through legalization as we once thought. Still, I have faith in legislation passing by midterms. 

But wait a minute - how would federal legislation disrupt the current vertical integration model that’s state by state? This will likely be the next question once banking laws are passed. My answer for that is starting a position in $GLASF, a glasshouse in California positioning themselves to be a supplier for MSO dispensaries once they can transport across state borders. 

In conclusion, buy $MSOS, not $MJ. I won’t be surprised if $MSOS keeps sliding short term… I just don’t know where the bottom will be. DCA and trust the process.",finance

personalfinance,"Being charged state taxes on unemployment payments from a different state, with taxes automatically withheld. Is there a way out without paying twice?","My wife and I were living in California until early 2020. She left her job to relocate with me to North Carolina, where we currently reside. Due to the fact that she left her work to relocate, immediately began searching for new work, and then the panalamadingdong happened, she received EDD unemployment payments from February 2020 until approx. October or December 2020. By contrast, I worked in North Carolina the entirety of 2020, excepting the month of January when we were packing and moving. As we always have when utilizing unemployment benefits in California, we elected to have state taxes withheld from the bi-weekly payments automatically to save ourselves some headache later on down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

When tax season came around, none of this really stood out to me in any particular way. We filed our federal and state taxes with CreditKarma, they were accepted, and we assumed we were good to go, awaiting our refunds. We filed entirely in North Carolina, as we filed jointly, had lived in the state for 11 months, and I was the only employed person during the year. We claimed both my income from my work as well as her EDD income, using the provided tax documents from the CA EDD. However, we received a letter from the NC DOR informing us that we had made an error in filing our taxes, had not paid any state income tax on my wife's income, and owed them approx. $1000.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't have $1000. We're both working again, and with our dual incomes we are slowly catching up on accrued debts, but we don't have enough to pay out a $1000 lump sum. I've been intending to just contact the DOR and start a payment plan, but a friend brought up that if we paid state taxes on the income in California, then our obligation should be complete in that regard, it's just a matter of getting CA and NC to communicate regarding this and effectively zero out the amounts. I have no idea if this is true, and while I'm somewhat financially literate, the complexity of the American tax system is nightmarishly confusing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm hoping to know is if this is in fact true, and if so, is there a specific department, either in NC or CA, or a tax form we can fill out to this effect? Or, will we essentially have to pay state taxes twice, first from automatic deductions in CA and again to NC? I'm just hoping to kind of understand how this happened and what the most appropriate next steps are before I essentially just give away $1000 I may not have to. Any and all advice and help is appreciated. I wasn't sure if this was more appropriate here or in r/legaladvice, so if it would be a better fit there let me know and I'll crosspost.",finance

# **The rally in recovery-focused stocks could depend on consumers and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/the-rally-in-recovery-focused-stocks-could-depend-on-consumers-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors bid up cyclical stocks in the past week, but the economy will have to prove that the reflation trade — a bet on economic growth — is the way to go as concerns about Covid linger.
*****
&gt; Markets are deep in the dog days of August. That means the Federal Reserve and key data, particularly retail sales, could provide some direction for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Major stock indices were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 hitting new highs and the Nasdaq flattish. But there was a clear move higher in cyclical sectors that gain when the economy is expected to improve.
*****
&gt; The moves also paralleled a jump in bond yields. The 10-year Treasury yield popped to 1.36% on Thursday but slipped as low as 1.29% on Friday amid a surprising drop in consumer sentiment. The metric fell to its lowest level since 2011 as consumers grew worried about the coronavirus and its potential impact on the economy.
*****
&gt; # The reflation trade
&gt; Materials were up 2.7% for the week in Friday trading, and industrials were up 1.4%. Financials, which do best when rates are higher, were up 1.9% for the week. Tech, which underperforms when rates rise, was flat with a slight gain of less than 0.1%.
*****
&gt; “I do think there will be a resurgence of the reflation trade. I do think you can buy some of the cheap cyclicals,” said Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research. Parker said he likes materials, metals, mining and some energy.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields had been moving higher after stronger jobs and inflation data. But they were kicked into a higher gear by comments from a parade of Fed speakers, who all shared their views on what it would take for the central bank to wind down its bond-buying program.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has been purchasing $120 billion of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to prop up the economy and provide market liquidity during the worst days of the Covid pandemic.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Fed will release the minutes of its last meeting. While that is viewed as old news, the release will be highly scrutinized for more details on the “tapering” process. The Fed’s move to slow and ultimately end its bond buying is important since it is the first major step away from easy policy and a step toward interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The views of central bank presidents have been varied. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan thinks the Fed should start paring back purchases in October, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans wants a few more months of jobs data.
*****
&gt; “I keep thinking it’s the Fed’s attempt at clarity, by offering a variety of options as to when they will start the tapering process,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “In a sense, it’s trial balloons to keep the conversation going so the prospect of tapering is in the forefront of investors, so when it does occur it will not come as even the slightest shock.”
*****
&gt; There aren’t many speaking opportunities for central bank officials in the week ahead. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold an event for educators and students on the central bank and education Tuesday. Fed officials will be at their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Aug. 26 through Aug. 28, and tapering the $120 billion a month bond-buying program is expected to be a big topic on their agenda.
*****
&gt; # Focus on consumers
&gt; A flurry of retail news in the week ahead will put market focus on the consumer, the driver of 70% of the U.S. economy. The Census Bureau will release July’s monthly retail sales report Tuesday morning, and Dow Jones forecast is for a decline of 0.2%. That same day, retail heavyweights Walmart and Home Depot report earnings.
*****
&gt; Macy’s, Target, TJX and Lowe’s are also among retailers reporting in the coming week. Investors will be watching for updates on what retailers are facing in the job market and how they are handling rising prices. They will also be listening for any update on consumer behavior with the spread of the delta variant of Covid.
*****
&gt; “You’ll get a sense of just how strong consumers have been,” said Michael Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo. “One thing we took out of the CPI [consumer price index] report was the inflation on some services was lower than it was in the prior months.”
*****
&gt; CPI was up 5.4% year over year in July, and producer prices were also hot, up a sizzling 7.8% in July over the past 12 months.
*****
&gt; Trivariate’s Parker said the market will focus on the data, including retail sales and industrial production on Tuesday and jobless claims Thursday. There are also the Fed’s Empire manufacturing data Monday and the Philadelphia Fed survey on Thursday. If the data continues to look strong, it supports the reflation trade.
*****
&gt; “I do think that trade will work again for part of the fall,” Parker said.

&gt; # University of Michigan Whiffs

&gt; The preliminary reading on August consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan was released this morning, and it was a major disappointment. The headline reading peaked back in April but this month's preliminary reading collapsed down to the lowest level since December 2011. That decline has been attributed to concerns over the Delta variant. As shown in the second chart below, the 11 point drop from 81.2 at the end of July to 70.2 today was the largest decline between two reports (either the preliminary and the prior final report or the final report and the preliminary reading) since the preliminary reading in April of 2020. The April 2020 reading was the largest drop on record at 18.1 points. Before that, October 2008 was the next largest and last double digit decline.

&gt; Not only was the release dramatically worse than the last update, but it was a huge miss relative to expectations. Using data from our Economic Indicators Database, today's release came in 11 points below expectations. The only other month going back to at least 1999 that even comes close was a 9.9 point miss in the preliminary reading in February 2004.

&gt; After seven full trading sessions, this August has been rather sanguine when compared to historical average performance for the full month. Major indexes continue to trade at or near new all-time highs and the VIX index has been drifting lower rather quietly. Historically, the VIX has typically hit its annual low sometime during the month of July. So far in 2021, the VIX’s closing low was on July 2 at 15.07. This VIX seasonal low can be seen in the chart above just ahead of a seasonal climb to a peak that has generally arrived sometime during the month of October before declining again as the typical fourth quarter rally gains traction. VIX’s spike in March of 2020 is also visible in the above chart, pushing the late Q1 peak higher.

&gt; Digging deeper into VIX’s historical tendencies in August we present the following table comparing the change in VIX in August to the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in August since 1990. S&amp;P 500 has been higher 54.8% of the time over the last 31 years, but its average performance in August has been a loss of 0.6%. VIX, as one would likely expect has risen 61.3% of the time in August with an average increase of 9.4%. Shaded in the table are the Augusts where VIX (on a closing basis) was up over double digits. Every double-digit VIX gain in August was accompanied by a S&amp;P 500 loss averaging 5.8%.

&gt; With the exception of 1995, every double-digit VIX decline in August was accompanied by a S&amp;P 500 gain. Single-digit VIX moves were generally not that well correlated with August’s S&amp;P 500 performance. This is also not that surprising as the VIX is attempting to estimate expected volatility over the next 30 days from the time of each tick of the index.

&gt; # August Seasonal Pattern Suggests Further Gains Mid-Month

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/77bb42beafca06e37f5266dee7a7f5cf/ea366aec60129de2-ef/s500x750/89765d670c5abb5b6112e4396ff3179f7e9aee6c.jpg))**

&gt; With about a third of August already in the record books, the market has thus far avoided typical seasonal weakness. August got off to a choppy start, but as of yesterday’s close DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 are all positive and well above historical average performance for the full month of August. Fueled by the prospect of more fiscal spending, in the form of a much-needed infrastructure bill, DJIA is leading the way higher this month, up nearly 1.6% as of today. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 are a close second up around 1.5%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are the laggards, both with gains just under 1%.

&gt; Compared to the historical average performance in August over the past 31 years, all five indexes are currently comfortably outperforming and are on course for a respectable month provided nothing pops up to knock them off their current course. Having already successfully sidestepped the usually weak first nine days of August, the market could be set for further gains to finish this week and next as mid-August has historically been the bright spot of the month. However, after a mid-month run the market has tended to stumble and drift sideways to lower through the end of the month. On average, only NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have managed to climb above their respective mid-month highs by month’s end.

&gt; # Value Catching Back Up to Growth

&gt; Up until the early summer, value stocks had consistently outperformed growth on a year-to-date basis. But once markets came back from the Fourth of July holiday, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks had overtaken value in terms of year-to-date performance. While the two groups have generally trended higher together since then, in the past week (save for yesterday), the two have diverged as value has rallied and growth has seen a minor pullback. As a result, there is only a 1.3 percentage point difference between the two factor's YTD performance.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081321-SVX-SGX-2.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at the longer term relative performance of value and growth, the past year's stint of value outperformance has pretty much been a blip on the radar. As shown below, since the mid-2000s the ratio of value to growth has been in a consistent downtrend (meaning growth outperforms value) that accelerated early on in the pandemic. As could be expected with such dramatic outperformance of growth, the ratio of the two bottomed in the early fall of last year and regained some ground before peaking this past spring. Since then, the ratio of the two has been making a move back down to its lows.

&gt; # Why Stagflation Isn’t in the Cards

&gt; The term stagflation has been increasingly circulating in the financial media as inflation readings have risen sharply in recent months. The term is often associated with the 1970s which saw runaway inflation—largely driven by sky-high energy prices—and lackluster economic growth. One way to gauge stagflation is to calculate what is commonly referred to as the Misery Index—inflation plus unemployment.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Misery Index today is nowhere near the extreme levels of the 1970s. In fact, not only that, the level of “misery” is near the long-term average of about 10 despite the highest inflation readings we’ve seen in over a decade. We expect inflation to soon begin to ease and the unemployment rate to continue its steady decline over at least the next year, which should bring this measure well below its long-term average and put an end to the stagflation fears that have been bubbling up recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.12.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “We don’t believe the current environment is anything like the stagflation experiences of the 1970s,” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki. “We think much of the elevated inflation readings we’re seeing now are transitory and related to pandemic bottlenecks and materials shortages. Meanwhile, the economic reopening and massive stimulus should provide a strong one-two punch to keep economic growth well above average through 2022.”

&gt; That said, after the boosts from the reopening and stimulus pass, the U.S. economy may resume its pre-pandemic growth trend in the neighborhood of 2% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Bloomberg’s survey of economists points to just 2.3% real GDP growth in 2023, after 4.2% next year. Given the limited population growth in the United States, demographic headwinds as baby boomers retire, and low immigration rates, the opportunity for stronger economic growth than that may be limited.

&gt; The other way to drive higher economic growth is through productivity enhancements which may also be tough to come by after all of the technology spending and efficiency improvements undertaken by corporate America during the pandemic. Slower growth isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it tends to keep inflation at bay which can limit increases in interest rates. But it may mean slower earnings growth and potentially lower stock returns over the next several years.

&gt; For the short-to-intermediate term, we remain comfortable staying overweight equities relative to fixed income. The economic growth and profit environment looks very favorable for the rest of this year and into early 2022, while we do not expect much return out of the bond market (though we like mitigating downside risk with bonds).

&gt; Clearly there are risks in terms of the Delta variant. China’s regulatory crackdown and slowing growth is a concern. Our benign view of inflation could be wrong The Federal Reserve could make a policy mistake, causing interest rates to surge. Not our view, but possible.

&gt; # Cyclical Sector Turnaround

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we noted the charts of the sector ETFs for Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), and Industrials (XLI) and how each sector has begun to catch a bid this month. Of the eleven sectors, Financials are up the most in August with just under a 6% gain. Utilities are actually the runner-up with a 3.09% gain in spite of the coincident uptick in rates this month. Materials and Industrials are also up nicely with gains of 2.42% and 1.55%, respectively. Shown another way, below are relative strength charts of each of these sectors from our Sector Snapshot. When these lines are rising, they indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa when the line is trending lower. Recently, each of these sectors have seen sharp turns higher after having been in downtrends for most of the spring and summer. In the case of Financials and Materials, those downtrends actually broke multi-month uptrends that had been in place since late 2020. The bounce in the relative strength line of Industrials, on the other hand, comes as it tested the past year's uptrend line. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options.

&gt; # Shorted Names Cool Into the Summer

&gt; This year has seen two bouts of interest in highly shorted names. The first in January when GameStop (GME) was the main stock in focus with a short interest as a percent of float above 100%, and again in late May/early June when AMC Entertainment (AMC) became the new poster child. As shown below, while those two stocks and a handful of other individual names have seen the spotlight this year due to massive short squeezes, in aggregate short interest as a percentage of free float across the US equity market has pulled back over the past couple of years. Some of that decline was erased from February to April, but since the spring, short interest has flatlined.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080921-SIPF-1.png))**

&gt; Below is a Bloomberg index that tracks the 100 most highly shorted US stocks rebalanced monthly and dating back to February 2020. The index remains well off the highs from this February when it surged on the initial squeeze in GME and various other names. The unwind since then has brought the index down to the longer-term uptrend line that has been in place in the index's year and a half history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080921-SIPF-2a.png))**

&gt; As for the two stocks that were the main short squeeze names earlier this year, AMC and GME, both stocks are still up huge on the year (1,571.14% and 823.19%, respectively) but have fallen well off their highs and have been trending lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080921-SIPF-3.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at what are currently the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 3,000, retailers take the top spot with the average stock having a 9.7% short interest as a percent of float. Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science stocks are the only other industry in which the average stock has a short interest above 9%. Autos in addition to Food &amp; Staples Retailing are the other two sectors with notably elevated short interest. Conversely, Banks, Utilities, Insurance, and Commercial and Professional Services have a relatively low short interest versus the Russell 3,000 average of 5.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080921-SIPF-4.png))**

&gt; Taking a more granular look, in the table below we show the stocks in the Russell 3,000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float as well as their year-to-date performance. Recent IPO Reneo Pharmaceuticals (RPHM) tops the list with just under half of its shares sold short. That is as the stock has gotten crushed since its debut having fallen 40%. GreenBox (GBOX), Skillz (SKLZ), Beam Global (BEEM), and Workhorse Group (WKHS) round out the top five, all with more than 37% of their float sold short.

&gt; Looking across many of the other highly shorted names, though, big losses are pretty common on a year-to-date basis with 60% of these names in the red. That was not always the case, though. Performance was slightly better two months ago during the AMC saga and performance was even more positive at the GME high one month into the year.

computers,Csn't find an answer on this one.,I have a HP G60 notebook. I was playing in the files one night. And found a video file. The video was real funny. It was about bubble wrap and Fed-Ex. Had people wrapped in bubble wrap getting stuck to each other getting on  and off the elevator. I closed it and can't find the extension of what it could be. I've tried Google-ing the video but there is no record of Fed-ex ever having a video. Because I have sat through every bubble wrap commercial that is on YouTube.

personalfinance,Car dealership calls us back over a month later saying they got us a “better deal” on our car,"I posted this on the Ask Car Sales Subreddit, but it didn’t really yield a lot of answers. I hope this fits here:

At the beginning of July, my wife and I bought a car. We weren’t exactly in the place to buy one, but our car broke down so we needed one. We ended up getting a halfway decent car, with an okay rate. Payments are high, but I want to be done paying for the car as soon as possible.

Almost non-stop since I bought the car, the dealership has been asking for more information from us- current pay stubs, proof of address, proof of insurance, binders, phone bills with our phone numbers listed on them, etc. We’ve had to go in and sign more paperwork as well. A little overwhelming, but not super out of the playing field when getting a loan for something.

Today, I got a phone call from the dealership asking us to come in tomorrow with 3 paystubs to sign a new set of paperwork, because they “Got us a better rate on our car.” That immediately seemed strange to me, because I’ve never heard of a dealership doing this. I obliged, and said we would be in first thing. Then a few hours later, they called back and requested that I send in my paystubs “immediately.” Which I also did. But shortly after that, my credit and my wife’s credit was ran 8 separate times, and I got emails from different banks letting me know my credit was ran through them.

Did the original lender back out of the deal? And now is the dealership trying to pull a Hail Mary and get us a new lender before tomorrow? It’s almost midnight and I’m still getting emails about my credit being ran. This just seems awfully strange to me. Or am I being silly?

I’ve bought 3 different cars through dealerships, this is the 2nd car I bought through this dealership.

Edit: So now that this is all sorted out, I figure I will report back!

Due to everyone’s great advice, I decided to see if I could get my own financing. I’ve previously financed two of my cars through a credit union in my area, and went in to see if they would approve me before I signed the updated paperwork. The loan officer was confused, because as it turns out, the dealer had contacted them on my behalf and gotten my new loan through the credit union.

So I went over to the dealership to talk to the finance guy, and he said that the old lender, Santander, backed out. But when they were going through my paperwork, they realized that I had financed two of my previous cars through a local credit union, and talked to them about issuing me the loan, which was approved since I’ve always paid car payments on time.

My interest rate dropped considerably as well, and the monthly terms didn’t budge at all. So I guess I did get a much better deal on the car.

Thanks for all the advice!",finance

14. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

28. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

29. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

35. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

50. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
51. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
52. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
53. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
54. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
55. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

56. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

61. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

67. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

69. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
92. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

investing,How/Will higher interest rates effect JEPI's dividend?,"I'm about to butcher some of the facts but my understanding is that JEPI invests 80% of its assets into S&amp;P 500 dividend paying stocks, while the other 20% are used for covered calls. I know I'm leaving out a few of the fancy transactions they're doing in the 20% but I feel that's a fairly accurate description.

&amp;#x200B;

My question in relation to the title is how or even will higher interest rates when the Federal Reserve raises them effect JEPI's dividend payment? Will this increase/decrease the cost of JEPI's covered calls or have a net zero effect (as in it will raise the cost but also raise the profit, or have no impact at all)?",finance

personalfinance,Opinions on buying new F-150,"Hi everyone, I’ll try to keep it short here and just hear what you guys have to say. To preface, I’m fairly confident I need and want to drive a truck and don’t think I’ll be necessarily talked into buying a cheaper type of vehicle, but I also want to make sure I’m not making a terrible mistake…

-I’m 26 years old, an R.N. and bring in around 80k/year 

-I work at a hospital and also have some side gigs using my healthcare background, I’m very confident in the stability of my career and potential to pick up more hours if I desire.

-Currently debt free, I have roughly $1000 in monthly expenses for rent/internet/etc, I’m about halfway through an apartment lease with a roommate. I have about $85k saved in the bank, and currently put a little over $1000/month into a 401k

-I do likely plan to purchase my own home/property in the next 5-10 years, just waiting for the crazy covid/inflation to come down.

-4 months ago I sold my 2016 Sierra for a $7,000 profit after buying it and driving it for about a year, with the intention of wanting to get into a nicer, newer truck with less miles/warranty/etc…I am currently driving my dads old work truck but reliability is becoming a serious issue and it was never a long term plan.

-We get Ford A plan pricing, I am looking at purchasing a new F-150 in the OTD price range of $55-65k, something with more bells/whistles…I have always wanted to have a nice vehicle, I suppose you could call it a goal or dream of mine. Used truck prices right now, even a low mileage CPO are really not far off new MSRP.

-I plan to keep whatever I buy for 5-10 years. Interest rates are 0% for 36 months or 1% for 60 months. I could put a huge down payment or just take advantage of the low rate..

Am I making a terrible financial commitment? I am reasoning with myself that trucks hold their value well, even after 5 years. It’s something I’m relatively passionate about, I know I could logically make a junker work if I had to but I genuinely do want to have a nice truck and unfortunately, they’re just really expensive no matter how you look at it.

I’m prepared to be roasted",finance
personalfinance,Used Car loan Vs New Car loan,"We are looking at two vehicles and need to purchase something due to my significant others commute. Shes doing 100+ miles per day.  Car prices are at an all time high and would like to wait but they arnt going down anytime soon. Used car loans typically carry a higher interest rate than new cars. With the used car market so high would it be better to pay 15 - 20k more for new vehicle loan/lease. We have the down payment for the new car loan/ lease. If we went with a lease we would lease then do the pay off. And advise is welcome. We are also in the northeast so 4x4/awd is nessissary.

Used car 35k
New car 55k

CryptoCurrency,The worst part and best part about hodling in Sweden,"So, as you all surely know, Swedes generally pay high taxes. That is all fine and dandy, I like having universal healthcare and free school. What is interesting though, is the tax that we currently pay on crypto. It is a flat 30% on gains, similar to the US.

But! When swedes buy stocks, we usually dont pay 30% taxes on our gains, as we have a special type of account called an ISK, short for investment savings account in swedish. This type of account is taxed only 30% of (state interest minus one percent), although lowest is 30% of 1,25%, and since interest rate is currently negative, we end up with 30% of 1,25% which is 0,375% taxes, yearly.

On these accounts you can buy derivatives called certificates which follow the price of crypto, my bank currently offers BTC, ETH and ADA. 

Great! So i can save huge amounts of tax money by *not actually holding any coins*.

personalfinance,Medical School Loan Advice During Residency,"Thanks in advance for any information or tips.

I started my medical residency in July of this year, bringing with me 200K in medical school student loans. I am married and my wife has about 35K remaining of her own undergraduate loans. My loans are mostly Federal Direct with interest rates from 3-5%. 

Long story short, during our transition from medical school to residency we accumulated quite a bit of consumer CC debt, 17k, due to overlapping rents in different cities, moving costs, not getting first residency income until end of July. Initially I was planning on doing the REPAYE program for my loans, but with my wife's income factored into the repayment plan I have quickly realized we cannot afford the monthly REPAYE payment and pay off consumer debt at the same time. 

What are yall's thoughts on putting my loans into forbearance for a year to tackle the consumer debt? I feel like my rates are pretty good, but thoughts on refinancing during residency?",finance

financialindependence,Eight Years Into FIRE and at ~$900K NW - Time to Slow Down and Let Compound Interest Work,"Greetings all!  I have been a long time subscriber to this sub, but I am first time poster.

I wanted to share my story so far and discuss the idea of slowing down on savings a bit and taking a lower stress job.

First, here's my background.

Currently 31 years old, married (wife also 31), no kids (yet) and we're renters.  Probably easy to guess, but we are living in the US.

I was lucky enough to meet my wife in college, and, thankfully, as soon as I pitched the concept of FIRE to her, she was fully onboard with saving more of our income than we spent (though she didn't quite believe it was really possible at first).

My wife and I were very fortunate to come out of college with minimal student debt (\~$3K).  We both had scholarships that paid for 100% of our tuition and most of our room and board.  Both of our families did help with living expenses, providing maybe $3000 or so per year in college.  This allowed us to avoid serious debt, which we are very grateful for and recognize gave us a leg up in our FIRE journey.

I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree in 2013 and started work immediately in the energy sector (equipment supply to be specific).  The wife also graduated that same year, but took a bit longer to find a job in her field.  She worked a retail gig in the meantime to help supplement our income.  Neither of us started with salaries that were out of the ordinary, so we focused on reducing our expenses as much as possible (or at least as much as we were willing) to get the most out of our paychecks.

I continued working for the same company I started with for nearly six years, receiving mostly modest raises throughout that time.  The wife eventually found a job she loves and has been with her company for five years or so.  She does well for her field and has received decent raises throughout her time there.

In early 2019, I moved to a new engineering company (still energy and equipment, but in a different part of the industry) and received a substantial pay increase (\~50%).  The position is in project management.  This new job came with a lot more stress to go along with the larger paycheck.  I have managed to work at this new company for two and a half years now and have been able to set expectations so that I have work/life boundaries I've been able to live with.  The main thing I dislike about my current job is that because I work with an international team (Asia, Europe, US), I almost always have 7am or earlier calls in the morning and at least once a week have a call at 9:30pm.  Usually in the middle of the day things are very relaxed, so I really shouldn't complain too much, but I am quite tired of the early morning schedule with occasional late night obligations mixed in.  The global scale of the business isn't all bad. It actually was almost all positive at first, because I enjoy working with other cultures and it allowed me to travel the world in a short time (pre-pandemic and, unfortunately, without the wife).

Below are our financial stats overtime.

**Current Household Income: $194K**

* 2013: **$90K** (Me: $65K; Wife: $25K)  My first engineering job out of college and wife was in retail.
* 2014: **$93K** (Me: $68K; Wife: $25K)
* 2015: **$89K** (Me: $74K; Wife $15K)  We moved to a new city and my wife was only able to do part time work for the first few months.

Other than housing, we spend most of our money on travel (usually two overseas trips a year and at least one ski trip per year) and food (takeout and groceries).  We try to eat as healthy (as little processed food as possible), so a our grocery bills tend to be a bit higher than average.

As I mentioned, I'm currently in a job that I am not in love with, but pays probably the highest end of the salary range for my experience level and industry.  My current job does not allow me to really ""turn off"" and if I were to take a vacation, it would not be possible to completely disconnect.  My previous job did allow this, and it made travel and work life balance so much more enjoyable.

The wife and I are at a stage in life where we want to travel as much as possible before potentially settling down to have kids in next couple years.  The pandemic year was supposed to be our year to get our international travel out the way, but you all know how that went.  We are looking to move back closer to family so that when we do have kids, we would be surrounded by our loved ones.

I was recently offered a position within the US government as an engineer.  The job would come with a substantial pay decrease, but is located near my family and the agency would pay for my move.  It also includes four weeks of vacation time and two weeks of sick time (plus an additional ten or so days in federal holidays compared to my current job).  From what I've gathered from talking to a friend who works for the federal government, the work life balance is topnotch, which is very enticing.

However, as I mentioned, the pay decrease is significant.  I'd be going from my current $129K salary down to $92K.  I am a bit conflicted about taking the lower salary for a, hopefully, more enjoyable work life balance.  With that said, after saving heavily for the past eight years it feels like the right time to start focusing on transitioning into a less stressful lifestyle.

Does anyone else have plans to put the breaks on savings to either use your income to enjoy life more, or take a less stressful job with lower pay?  Curious to hear other's thoughts on this concept and perhaps firsthand experience from anyone has already followed a similar path.

Any who, thank you to everyone who read through this rambling wall of text.  If anyone has any thoughts, comments, questions, or pointers on our FIRE journey/progress we'd love to hear them.

Be well and thanks again for your time!

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is dangerous! Beware!,"Let me start with some backstory here so you’re able to fully understand my position. 

One of my neighbors has been buying bitcoins and bitdollars for some time now. Every time I see him all he talks about is how Oprah keeps giving Lamborghinis to people on a chain block (?). Apparently his house his built on top of a bitcoin mine. I assume he has a mine shaft in his basement because that’s where he seems to spend all of his time. I’ve seen him purchase multiple fans on several occasions so he must really be working up a sweat with all that digging. 

Anyway, about a week ago, I awoke to the sound of sirens in the middle of the night. Upon initially opening my eyes, I noticed a bright orange light coming through my blinds. I drew my blinds to see what was going on and was shocked at what I discovered. There was a fleet of fire trucks parked on the street, and in my neighbors yard. A whole platoon of diligent firemen urgently working to extinguish my neighbors flame engulfed home. After several hours of our neighbors onlooking, clutching their children, the flames were bested. 

If I were religious, I would claim it was a miracle that everybody made it out okay. A big thank you to those brave men and women out there risking their lives everyday to save the lives of others. 

I spoke to the fire marshall the following day. They had determined the cause of the fire was my neighbor’s bitcoins! Apparently, he had too many bitcoins in his change jar and they had spontaneously combusted. I asked the fire marshall if this happens often and he told me yes. Apparently, instead of rolling their bitcoins and taking them to the bank, Bitcoin miners prefer to wrap their bitcoins in ether-soaked rags, put them in their wallets and store them in the freezer to keep them cold. The fire Marshall informed me that this will cause the bitcoins to catch fire 99 times out of 100.

At a minimum it would mean lots of different countries burning their money again. Just for the sport of it. It would mean more instability of the Nation State kind.

Meanwhile, crypto land is sturdy and shuttered, as best we can. Crypto is the honey badger of monetary policy. ""You guys have fun with your thunder sticks.""",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Quantitative Easing, Billionaires and why crypto is important","Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems (my country has 50%+ inflation). Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this to share knowledge/create good content. Hope you enjoy! 

First we need to define quantitative easing (QE) to the average redditor. QE ""is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy, and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also expands the central bank's balance sheet"". Basically the FED prints money to keep the stock prices and other asset prices up, so as to prevent the economy from crashing. 

This comes in opposition to traditional monetary policy in which direct transfers are made by the FED to the goverment, that uses this funds to increase spending and stimulate the economy. You'll be wondering, what's the difference?

On traditional monetary policy the money goes first to the average person, and then flows into the economy. With QE, that started in 2008, money goes into those that have financial assets (stocks, bonds etc). Those that have the most assets are billionaires who own banks/tech/manufacturing companies. You may have profited a couple thousands due to the stock prices growth during this last months (if you had enough invested), but I'm certain Bezos, Musk and Gates did much better. This is because most of the money went for those that have the majority of stocks, they are not the average person but rather the billionaires that also avoid taxes with legal loopholes. 

We can see the results by how the distribution of assets and savings changed during this last year and a half of pandemic. The poorest 50% of americans (people from USA) now have 30 to 35% less wealth. While the billionaires have gotten 20% or more richer. And this has all been because of an inefficient monetary policy by the FED. 

And this is were crypto comes in. Completely decentralizated, giving no power to the goverment to keep pushing inequality and benefiting those with money and power. That's why I think projects like BTC, ETH, ADA etc are so important.

CryptoCurrency,What will happen to bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies when the economy tanks.,"Tl;dr summary at the bottom

I have talked to a large amount of people who are very supportive of cryptocurrencies. They see the huge amount of USD and Euros that have been printed in recent history and think that this will lead to inevitable hyperinflation. The theory then goes that bitcoin will be seen as a stable asset, digital gold. This will cause a huge spike in bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies.

I am here on the crypto subreddit to tell you that this is unlikely to happen. First hyperinflation has been associated with the collapse of the underlying economy. Meaning that the production and supply of goods and services collapse. This is unlikely to happen in Europe or America in the near future. What is far more likely is that we will go through periods of high inflation. Normally to counteract high inflation central banks increase the base interest rate meaning that banks will start paying back money to the central bank. The problem is that many assets are now overvalued based on the near 0% interest rates. 

This will cause a sharp sell-off in everything from the stock market to houses. This could quickly spiral into the next financial crisis and governments know this. They basically backed themselves into a corner by having a near 0% interest rate since 2008 despite the economy showing stellar performance since 2012.

Bitcoin and crypto will be part of that sell-off. There will be a sharp decrease of 70-90% in the crypto market. That is your chance to buy. When Bitcoin falls to the 10,000 USD range you should start stocking up. At maximum there should be a retrace to 3000. After this bitcoin will spike upwards dramatically because by now it is becoming clear that the banks have again over invested in supposedly safe assets. Now we face two choices. First either let the banks go bust and pay the people directly or let the tax-payer bail the banks out a second time.

This will be the point at which crypto explodes and faith in traditional currencies fades away.

Tl;dr There will be a sharp drop in the value of cryptocurrency assets during the next financial crisis as liquidity for risky assets dries up. This is followed by a huge spike in it’s values as the banks need to be bailed out a second time",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does refinancing my car loan make sense?,"Hi everyone! Had a question on whether or not it would make sense to refi my car loan.

For background I purchased a $50k car back in June, but made the mistake of forgetting my checkbook. Since i forgot my checkbook I could only put down $5k of my intended $20k payment. I purchased the car with a 3.4% interest rate for 60 months, with payments being $840 a month.

I’ve just made my first ‘payment’ with the total principal left of ~$29k. The payments of $840 are not an issue for me to make and would pay off the car in about 36 months. 

Does it make sense to refinance the loan to get a lower interest rate closer to 2%? Or would it only make sense to refinance if I wanted to pay off the car in 48 months with lower payments?

gaming,Does early access make sense for AAA development?,"tl;dr feel free to skip to the last paragraph.

Against my better judgement as a patient gamer, I pre-ordered a game on Xbox One months before its release. You can fill in the blanks, we’re talking about a game so poorly implemented that the New York Times gave it a writeup during a global pandemic and an election cycle. When I promised CDPR my $60 I had just finished Witcher 3 (the GoY edition) and it was one of the best gaming experiences I’d had to date. The gameplay is polished, every side quest feels like a well written short story. Even the most menial of fetch quests is enjoyable to play. (Here’s your frying pan.)

Over the past couple of years I’ve only played two new releases. Red Dead Redemption 2 and Last of Us 2. Whatever your thoughts are on the narrative of the latter, these are perfectly polished AAA titles. The gameplay is balanced and well executed, the animation and voice acting are on point, and they were both virtually bug free on release. It’s not a surprise given the context. Rockstar continues to generate mountains of money from the most profitable product in entertainment history. Naughty Dog has the might and resources of Sony behind it, along with the technical advantages of first party development. They, like Daniel Day-Lewis, have ten or more years to perfect a product and don’t tie themselves to a release date until the games are close to finished. Hype comes from vague speculation as they keep the details of their games behind closed doors. Enter CD PROJECT RED, a much smaller developer, evidenced by the broken caps lock keys in their marketing department.

Early access it not for me. The narrative experience is what I play for, and playing a half-finished version of a game to have the story spoiled doesn’t appeal. I waited four years to play the 1.0 version of Subnautica, and it was great. I didn’t pick up No Man’s Sky until last year. But I’m just a grumpy old man with exacting standards, many people love early access. Now let’s imagine a world in which CDPR released the Game Who Shall Not Be Named five years ago in early access for $30. “Wouldn’t the story be spoiled?” A well-quaffed Swedish man asks me over palate of lingonberry jam. (My experience of Sweden is limited to frequent IKEA visits.) “No,” I reply. “Just expose the broken-ass sandbox, everyone already knows Keanu Reeves is in your game.” “What about our precious money?” He asks. “Shut off early access a year before release and charge $60 for preorders. You now have thousands of free beta testers. Maybe you can save some extra money by removing the beds you’ve installed in the office for your developers. I’m sure they would appreciate a chance to meet their children for the first time.""",technology

Crypto Offers a few ways you should always keep in mind that can generate you wealth.


Most common is Staking you're various coins that run on a PoS blockchain. there are many different types of ""Staking Blockchains""


When I was first introduced to crypto years ago, I simply thought Bitcoin was internet credits you bought with Dollars. In order to use them only and solely on the dark web ( or Like money you earned in your Pokémon game on GBA)


**Short story is I didn't get rich cause I was not informed or interested in learning at the time. Now I have this obsessive itch to learn as much as possible as I got older.  **🤬


***Knowledge Is Power***


So as I learned about staking and what not a while ago, I learned of the different ""styles"" of staking different blockchains use, and how they each come with their own rules of enjoyment.
Ill try not to make it too long for you I promise lol.

First Lets Start with Just the benefits and some Risks


Benefits of  staking


Staking benefits both the cryptocurrency exchange and the staker. For crypto stakers, it is a trusted means of earning passive income.
Compared to crypto mining, staking is more energy-efficient and economically viable. Staking crypto gives you a certain level of decision power to determine how things happen within the network. Staking is also beneficial to the crypto exchange or the blockchain network on which the staking occurs. It makes it possible for a proof-of-stake blockchain network to run continuously and ensure the network’s security. 


Risks of  staking


Staking crypto also comes with its risks, and it is important that you keep them in mind while diving into the staking business. Here are the major risks investors face when staking cryptocurrency, whether on an exchange or SaaS platforms:
The volatility of the crypto market

Low liquidity of an asset makes it difficult to sell
Longer periods of lockup could be risky, especially when the price of your staked asset drops substantially and you cannot unstake it.

If your validator node ‘mistakenly’ malfunctions or misbehaves, you could lose a substantial part of your stake.

 **Pure Proof of Stake (PoS)**

A plain or pure PoS network allows stakeholders to directly verify transactions and partake in the network’s governance without delegating responsibilities. In this model, the number of coins a stakeholder has gone towards determining their likelihood of being selected to create the next block. Coins utilizing a pure PoS consensus mechanism include Algorand (ALGO) and Ethereum 2.0.

In this model, the number of coins a stakeholder has gone towards determining their likelihood of being selected to create the next block. Coins utilizing a pure PoS consensus mechanism include Algorand (ALGO) and Ethereum 2.0.

**Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS)**


This is a staking model in which the network stakeholders vote for a delegation of stakeholders responsible for transaction verification, block generation, and network governance. This model is utilized in several PoS networks, including EOS, Tron (TRX), and Icon (ICX).

**Masternodes**

As the name alludes, Masternode is a blockchain server with more functionality compared to the normal nodes that only hold the full copy of the network ledger. It can be designed to offer additional functionality such as anonymizing transactions for privacy-oriented coins, partaking in governance tasks, and verifying transactions. The stakeholders maintain Masternodes. PoS coins utilizing masternodes include Dash, PIVX, SysCoin (SYS), and Energi (NRG).

**Federated Byzantine Agreement**


In this staking model, pioneered by Ripple then later adopted by Stellar, there is no reward to create and run a node. At least not from the network itself. In the Stellar implementation, node creators and maintainers are actual firms and individuals that require a cross-border payment solution. The incentive is to have a functional network through which to process your transactions. Once a party has created a node and invested in the infrastructure to run the node, they effectively have a stake in the network.
To achieve a consensus, each node uses a trusted set of nodes called quorum slices, pre-approved by each participating node, more like having a trusted set of friends who, together with you, verify the transactions processed through the node-set.

**Dual token model**


Most notably used by NEO network – the “Chinese Ethereum” network. NEO was nicknamed after Ethereum due to similarity in functionality. However, while Ethereum currently uses the PoW consensus mechanism, NEO uses the delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) model to achieve consensus.
NEO uses a staking model to incentivize governance participation. Two tokens are used within the NEO network. NEO, which is the native token for value transfer and GAS for payment of transaction fees. NEO stakeholders are also responsible for voting for their governance council – a 21 member council.
For every successful block created on the NEO blockchain, 5 GAS tokens are rewarded and split amongst the council members, NEO token holders, and the network voters.

Background:
- I have 3 closed credit cards with outstanding balances that I’ve been paying the minimum monthly payment on since they’ve been closed for the last two years. These are what I’m considering a consolidation loan for. 
- I also have 3 open credit cards with balances less than 50% of each credit limit that I’m aggressively paying off.
- I have two separate student loans (1 private and 1 federal).
- I have enough in savings to payoff the 3 closed credit cards, but I’d prefer to keep the liquid cash in savings as a rainy day fund, it covers approx 2 months of living expenses.
- Within the next few months, I’ll receive my annual bonus and vested stock (prefer to not sell the stock) which would be enough to payoff the 3 closed credit cards.

The most successful economies in the world are built upon oil reserves. Wars are fought for control of oil fields. Lobbyists bribe our government officials to restrain development of clean energy in order to perpetuate this horrific practice of polluting the earth with petroleum waste and byproducts. We use un-recycled bottles and bags when there are clearly better alternatives like hemp based biodegradable plastics. Commercial waste dumped into oceans, lakes, and rivers. So these companies can make more money. Every year they ask themselves the same question: “how can we make more money?” But the problem is that every year they have to get more and more creative on ways to make more money. Especially with the value of USD slipping. More and more often these solutions are at the expense of the earth, wild animals or even the populations of humans surrounding it all.

When making profits comes at the expense of the lives of the end users of the product, or even quality of life of the end users, the company should LOSE value, NOT GAIN VALUE.

These corporations have infiltrated the highest levels of government and have filled the pockets of law makers, intelligence officials, mainstream media, banks and every other form of regulation throughout our once great country So they are free to do whatever they please with not only no consequences, but instead funding campaigns to blame the end users and convince us that we are the ones who need to be more energy efficient, or that we need to band together to clean up the pollution that THEY caused. EVERY VOLUNTEER THAT'S EVER CLEANED UP AN OIL SPILL SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR TIME BY THE OIL COMPANY.

The founding fathers bore the weight of death to ensure that we could live free of corruption and tyranny. We have failed their vision miserably.

The system of value exchange all over the world is heavily weighted to the rich and powerful. There is no equality. There are too many middlemen, taxes, regulations, corruption, theft, inflation, control control control. Democracy is a faded dream that's being erased with every printed dollar.

Decentralized Finance will absorb value from all these corrupt systems and inject that value into a border-less global fair trade system of exchange where unnecessary intervention is eliminated completely and freedom is given back to the people out belongs to. The government does not have a right to monitor where all my money goes to and from. They do not have a right to be involved in every transaction I participate in yet they continue to give themselves permission freely to do so.

I should NEVER have to ask permission from a bank to move my own money. Pulling $10,000 or more of MY money from MY bank account should NOT require me to ask ANYONE'S permission. Once I create value from my job and pay my taxes, that value belongs to me and me alone and I will decide what I do with it and when I do it. I should never have to wait to cash a check because the bank is closed or their system is down. I should also never even be able to spend money that isn't in my account, much less be charged MORE MONEY I don't have for not having it there in the first place.

By creating cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, we are able to design financial systems that can transparently govern themselves without government oversight. Systems that do not require constant monitoring of individuals and that can ELIMINATE the possibility for corruption.

This is exactly what our governments around the world DO NOT WANT. They need to be able to lie and steal from us so they can fund their secret and not so secret wars for oil. There was something like $2 TRILLION dollars in the federal budget that is UNTRACEABLE. $2 TRILLION if tax money that can't be explained. How the FUCK is that even possible??

The only way for governments to avoid losing control of our hard earned money is for them to create their own CENTRALIZED cryptocurrencies. This way they will still maintain all encompassing control over anyone who uses it. They can sell transaction data to advertisers. Collect data of their own and even freeze assets or shut down financial accounts with their own CENTRALIZED cryptocurrency. CENTRALIZED CRYPTOCURRENCY should be avoided AT ALL COSTS.

My father used to tell me that locks keep an honest man honest. We need to lock corruption out of our financial systems by using DECENTRALIZED CRYPTOCURRENCIES and create an equal and fair global economy that anyone can participate in because absolute power corrupts absolutely. This has been proven over and over throughout history and throughout every single major body of power. Yet somehow, we never learn.

We all saw very clearly that the SEC, Hedgefunds, corporations, mainstream media and government officials turned a blind eye to the obvious and blatant market manipulation regarding GameStop and AMC stocks and dont forget the shit Robinhood pulled. Even the US SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Janet Yellen who was trying to blitz cryptocurrency regulations under the guise of an infrastructure bill was discovered to be accepting bribes in the form of ""speaking fees"", upwards of $7million from Citadel Hedgefund and Citibank alone. The same Hedgefund involved in the market manipulation behind GME and AMC (among many many others). Why the FUCK isn't she in jail?

It is obvious that simply exposing these sorts of corruptions is not enough to change anything because it goes as high up as it can go. Janet Yellen won't go to jail. Citadel will continue doing business as usual and RobinHood will keep screwing over retail investors. The entire system of government and finances is built on a foundation of corruption. There isn't an individual or an single organization that can stop them. Greedy people helping other greedy people be more greedy. They just tell the media to not cover it and it simply fades away under fake news after fake news. We have to actually evacuate our value from these systems and place that value in a system that works FOR THE PEOPLE. The only way to stop it is for everyone to unite together and HODL cryptocurrency. Every dollar we can spare gets invested in a crypto that we believe in. Because every dollar that goes into crypto is one less they have to use against us.

This is why we need DECENTRALIZED cryptocurrencies.

Consider this...

So lets say you work for Wal-Mart for example. You work for two weeks and get your paycheck. Then you turn around and put most of that money back into Wal-Mart in order to get your supplies for the next two weeks, groceries, clothes, food, soap whatever, and even the gas from the gas station out front that gives you a discount for using your
Wal-Mart card because they too, are owned by Wal-Mart or maybe partnered with them or whatever. Even when you pay rent, your land lord is in the same boat. It all goes back to the mega corporations. You make just enough to stay alive. Not enough to save up anything really. Even if you manage to save a little, something will come along, some unforseen expense like a flat tire or a medical emergency that takes that value away from you. But you didn't make any money with your savings sitting there so all that value that you earned is given right back to these enormous companies. Not enough to invest your way out your financial class (unless you get really really lucky). Not enough to retire early. Just enough to stay alive. Wal-Mart is barely paying you enough to keep yourself or your family alive and giving most of that value to The Walton Family instead. This is why people say “No one gets rich working a 9-5.” The only people in this economy that become wealthy, are owners. People who actually own assets, i.e. houses, property, gold, stock, etc.

Most of us don't earn enough money to save up for a house and buy it outright and rent is so expensive I'm actually paying twice per month what a mortgage would be. We cant earn money fast enough to buy a nice car either. We are expected to, instead, bury ourselves in debt with loans in order to pay for the things we need to live or to even qualify for a job that would allow you to EVENTUALLY be able to save any money. So now, we owe a debt to a bank that ensures we have to work at that company for the next 15-30
years while they use the money in our bank accounts to make money in Wall Street without cutting us in at all. All this just so we can pay off the things we need to be able to hold a job in the first place like a car and a place to live.

The current financial systems and corporations do not want the middle and lower classes to be own anything. Musicians don't even put out CDs most of the time anymore because it's more lucrative to pay per play. I bet you won't even be able to buy a Blu-Ray anymore in the next 20 years. They want us to owe them our lives so they can extract value from us and inject it into their companies. It's insanely disproportionate and a horrible way to take advantage of people who weren't already born into wealthy families.

I did the math the other day and my life is valued at about
$0.04/minute. That means all my income, divided across all the minutes I'm alive. Not just counting the time I'm working, every minute of every day. Based on my income, my life is worth $0.04/minute to keep me breathing and working where I'm working. Minimum wage. This is before taxes, child
support, student loan payment and wage garnishment for an old credit card and before all my bills and expenses. So the thought of there being anything leftover for savings is a joke. So, needless to say I am in a category, like many many others in this country that are living paycheck to paycheck.

Now this is the beautiful thing about cryptocurrency... I could
actually get rich with it. Even if I invest something small like
$25/paycheck. I OWN the crypto that I buy. The value from that crypto can't be used by a bank to be invested overseas while I sleep too make someone else money. I am totally and unequivocally the only one who has any control over that value, so I am the only one who can reap it's benefits.

I already know where the path leads if I just work and retire from my job eventually. I also know I can't rely on Social Security when I retire because even though it was written in that the government isn't supposed to be able to TAKE money from it directly, they decided that it would be okay to just “borrow” from it and never pay it back instead... I,
however, can do nothing to stop them from taking that money from the social security fund, or from taking it from my paycheck even though everyone knows that they are stealing from hard working Americans in plain fucking sight.

I know I also cannot rely on a 401k because we have already
established that all the financial groups and hedgefunds are working together to extract value from retail investors by manipulating the market. Back in 2018 I looked at my Q1 earnings from my 401k. It had made me a respectable 17%. However, my crypto investments had already earned me 126% that quarter. That was when I stopped contributing to my 401k entirely and took control of my own investments. It takes a lot of extra work to research and carefully invest but, to me, it is so worth it because I reap all the benefits and because even if I fail completely and lose all of my investments and get completely rekt, I'm no worse off than if I was stuck living paycheck to paycheck like I am anyway. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

I also know I cannot even rely on a traditional savings account because USD itself on average is actually LOSING value instead of gaining any. You're lucky to get 0.1% interest on a savings account and I have seen people in here complaining that 12% interest on their crypto staking is a miserable waste of time. It sounds crazy, but if you consider potential gains in this volatile market, it's kind of true. I read that Bitcoin on average is a 200% annual gain. Everyone knows it's the best performing asset in history. There are better opportunities out there than 12%, but it's all about risk management. I'm not a financial advisor by the way...in case anyone was wondering. I'm just telling you my own opinions about what has been working for me.

Even at my level of income, with proper research and analysis, I can OWN cryptocurrencies and gain value by saving them. I own actual value that is capable of growing in value enough to take me from being poor to being rich. With no interference from middlemen or corrupt institutions. I cannot, however, buy a fraction of a house and expect it to grow in value over time but I CAN buy fractions of cryptocurrencies that are suited to my level of income and I don't need any government deciding for me that I'm too stupid to figure out what a scam looks like. That's just a lie they tell us so they can take the reins and figure out how to keep the bulk of the valuable gains for themselves. Fuck THAT.

Even just by posting this seemingly endless article I could receive tips and karma that will translate into Moons and I could probably be making more per minute writing this than working at my regular job.

Cryptocurrencies allow me to be an owner. Cryptocurrencies are breaking the corrupt systems that are sucking the life out of the the Earth and everything living on it. The more we exchange dollars for crypto, the less power corrupt financial and government systems will have to manipulate us. Companies will follow value. Place your value in fair DECENTRALIZED financial systems. It's time we started taking back control of our lives. It's time we started working together to take back control of our government and it's time we stop letting Mega Corporations unfairly extract value from our economies and leaving us to fight over the husks.

It's time everyone unites together like everyone on r/WallStreetBets did. Think about whats most important to you. Like THE most important things. I bet it's not the color of someone else's skin. I bet it's not what genitals someone else has. I bet it's not who someone else fucks. I bet it's not who made your car or how you bought your hair. I bet its more like having high quality food to eat instead of leftover parts that aren't even qualified to be in dog food but somehow are sold in your favorite fast food restaurants. Or clean water to drink instead of some bottled water company claiming to be pure selling you bottles of fucking tap water. An affordable roof over your head instead of paying twice in rent what you would be paying for a mortgage. We all want the same basic things. We all want to be happy. Stop letting the media convince you that we are so divided. Don't let politicians convince you that someone is a bad person because they are republican or democrat. They want us to fight among ourselves so we don't fight back against the horrific things THEY are doing.

It isn't hopeless. We aren't cornered. We collectively have the power to change the entire world for the better by simply choosing to use a system that benefits the many instead of the few. Set aside your illusions of difference and come together to fix the world one dollar at a time. Take your value back.

personalfinance,Pay off debt first or wait until after applying for mortgage?,"We are selling our first home and moving to another state for my work. We estimate to make about $200k net after realtor commission, fees and mortgage on the house we are selling.

My dilemma is whether to immediately pay off those debts while going through financing a new house; will the credit score drop from paying off the debts and closing the accounts be significant enough to impact the potential mortgage interest rate we could get? Or would having those debts on our credit hurt a mortgage interest rate more?

CryptoCurrency,Guide to different exchanges through my personal experience.,"A personal guide to different crypto exchanges through my personal experience. I’d say I’m relatively experienced in Crypto now,  but these are just my opinions &amp; I hope they help someone out! This guide isn’t properly on-depth / intelligent but I do hope it helps people,  


Binance:   


\- Binance is my most used exchange. When I began using Binance I found its interface confusing, although after a while I came around to it. It is simple to deposit FIAT &amp; to buy crypto.  


\- It has a wide selection of crypto available on it, far greater than some of the others that I will mention below.  It’s relatively simplistic to deposit &amp; withdraw FIAT  


\- One of Binance’s biggest upside is that that you can place certain crypto into saving pots where they will earn interest making earning more crypto, this is straight forward to do. What must be noted is that the saving pots can be withdrawn from immediately, the % rates on these are usually very low so it is well worth looking elsewhere to see if you could earn more elsewhere (External Apps may offer better rates)  


\- Staking is also available on Binance &amp; it locks coins from 7, 15, 30, 60 or 90 days. Not all coins are available but the ones that are do have high % rates. So this is something worth doing if you are looking to HODL for a while, be careful when doing this with DEFI coins as I believe they do it via 3rd party &amp; don’t take responsibility if coins are lost. PLEASE DO LOOK UP FURTHER.  


\- I’ve never had any communications  with the Binance support team but have heard some bad stories.. as I’m sure there are with all exchanges. Worth suggesting that when withdrawing FIAT, maybe do it in stages if dealing with a large amount of money just incase something does go wrong.  


Coinbase:  


\- Coinbase was my first exchange. Now I’ve ventured into ALT coins I don’t use coinbase as much. It’s interface is simple as is depositing &amp; FIAT &amp; buying crypto.  


The amount of selection available on coinbase is a lot less. There are a number of coins (VET / ZIL) that haven’t managed to get onto coinbase. It can be a good way of beginning your crypto journey as you can go for some of the main coins such as BTC / ETH in an easy manner.  


Coinbase doesn’t have as many saving / staking account options as Binance which could be seen as a negative   


In all honesty my favourite part of coinbase is coinbase Earn.. it essentially gives you free crypto for answering lessons on crypto, you need to sign up to it &amp; wait on the waiting list, free crypto is good though so I like this feature a lot.   


I’ve had issues in the past with coinbase accounts team, they’ve given me nothing but grief and another Redditor actually gave me a guide to get my account unsuspended not the coinbase employee. So as always tread carefully.  


[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/):  


[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) interface is quite simple. I signed up for an account with the hope of getting the Credit Card &amp; the CRO. The issue is you must sign up, buy &amp; hold CRO for 180 days &amp; then you are able to get the card &amp; it’s all of its uses. I don’t like this about [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) but I must say I love the card.  


The concept I’ve been implementing is topping the card up with FIAT &amp; spending it on the card to gain crypto rewards.   


It’s easy to buy and sell crypto on the exchange so there has been no real issues for me there.  


Staking seems good on there with good interest rates; although I’ve noticed that they offer a lot of incentives to stake &amp; the rates then drop considerably. (Just something to be aware of)  


Support team. This is important. I know that all exchanges seem to have below standard support, I’ve seen some true horror stories with [crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) so just please be careful!  


As a whole it’s a useful exchange if you are willing to jump through hoops to make the most of the benefits.  


Ku-Coin:  


Doesn’t require verification to use the account or buy crypto in the UK. I’ve not finished my verification process yet (lazy) i mainly use it to trade coins that aren’t available on Binance / Coinbase such as EWT. It’s interface is about as easy as Binance’s one, there is a trading account &amp; main account on Ku-Coin which is nice to keep separate  


Fairly recently they have introduced a Trading Bot that I have found very useful, you can pair coins together &amp; the bot buys &amp; sells within certain ranges.. ideally gathering you a profit,   
It’s cool &amp; fun to use &amp; interesting to watch you make more crypto.   


I’ve found it a useful exchange to have because as said above there is some coins it has that other exchanges don’t.  


It does also have some staking available.. coins included are LINK / DOT / ZIL.   


Not had any dealings with the support team.. so can’t pass any further information on regarding that.  


Bitmax:  


The only other exchange I’ve used is BITMAX, I’ve only used it on my laptop &amp; it was mainly to assist with selling moons.. I didn’t find it particularly easy to navigate or use but it also wasn’t horrendous. Unsure of its staking capabilities etc.   


Unused Exchange - Kraken:  


On here I’ve seen many people state how good kraken is &amp; that they love it. So although I can’t provide much opinion on it, I have heard good things   


Couple of additional notes:  


\- Binance is cheapest for fee’s (Unless using coinbase Pro)  
\- Coinbase easiest interface (for me)  
\- Binance best for Alt Coins   
\- Coinbase Earn is amazing   
\- LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR STAKING. Outside of the main apps, Moonlet for Ziliqa as an example.  


Any questions on this please let me know, if you think I’ve missed things also let me know, I’m here to learn as well.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Extra mortgage payment into inveatment account???,"I've been trying to find a calculator for what I'm trying to figure out, but I'm not sure what it would be called. Essentially, since interest rates are so low on mortgages I know it doesn't make since to pay it off early. Anyhow, what I'm hoping to find out is how long I would need to save money say an extra $2000/month into an investment account then at some point be able to stop paying the regular mortgage and use the money from the inveatment account to solely pay the mortgage. At that point in time i would also stop putting $2000/month into the investment account. 

Im assuming the following

Current mortgage $480,000
Term: 30 years
Interest rate: 2.25%
Current payment with taxes and homeowners insurance is $2500. 

Rate of return 6% and then another calculation at 8%
Extra payment $2000/month
Tax rate 15%

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts about DEFI,"Hey all,

TLDR: some thoughts and open discussion regarding Cefi, Defi, and the road to mass adoption. I think this is a very important discussion for the crypto community.

So recently, I am a little bit pessimistic about Defi. These countless shitcoins, hacks and scams. I truly want to believe that Defi is the future, including atomic swaps, Dexs, etc.
I have a fundamental issue with the model, and for us to discuss that I want to bring up assumptions on both Cefi and Defi.

Cefi:
I have someone to look out for me. Even a trade in the grocery store is a Cefi trade in my view – the credit card companies and banks process the transactions. I have customer support, and I have someone I can sue. I can and complain to big companies for help.
I also have law enforcement (let's put aside corruption, and look at it from a theoretic perspective). I can file a report to the police, sue the other party, and the state may help me in this battle.
Also, most of the time I know who I am doing business with. So if anyone tries to scam me, I can take action against them.

Although far from perfect, the general public are able to play by those rules in most democratic countries. The rules are understood by everyone, and there are good excuses for large players for breaking them (Fed printing money, big corporations doing whatever they want). People may want to rebel (Bitcoin, as example) but as long as they are okay most of the time, they are not as likely to cause serious damage to the system, and it can move forward. 

Defi 
I need to trust in code, not in people. Let's take the user experience out of the equation. I need to make sure that the protocol that I deposit my money into, will do what it promises. I have no one to talk to in case that something goes wrong.
Therefore, I have several methods to be able to feel secure with Defi:
1.	I can be a very technological person. Read the code, understand the protocol completely, and verify that neither hackers or the creators of the protocol can manipulate it and steal funds from it.
2.	A 3rd party company (which is centralized, and I can reach them directly) audited the protocol and made sure that it is safe. Also insurance
3.	I can get social validation from people I trust – friends, family, and random ""influencers"" on the internet.

As you can see, aside from social validation, the other methods are complexed, often require a lot of time or money, and are definitely not made for the general public.
Meaning the other tool Defi have to bring people to its domain, is human GREED. That seems to work, but than we have an Iron Finance scandal, and people lose faith all over again.

What are your thoughts on this? How can we help the general public move to Defi?

 When thinking about it, if someone trusts the authorities (to some degree) they would rather use Cefi and not Defi. I personally use cefi to hold and earn more than I use defi. (for the record, I think that as a community we have to fiercely fight hackers and scammers. This is one possible step to this problem)

(Reposting, deleted previously because of Karma bug)

Edit: of course, defi is a new and in its infancy. The question is how can we increase adoption, what solutions are on the line. How can we as a community and contributers help defi spread? (Without resulting to cefi solutions)",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,An overview of consensus protocols,"What's up everyone. Now before the next bull run really gets going, I thought I'd slap together a post about the different consensus protocols that exists within the crypto space. You know, before everyone stops giving a shit about tech anymore. I don't know about you but when I research a coin, one of the first things I check is how the blockchain network secures itself and how it achieves global consensus. I'll first introduce some basic concepts that constitute the blockchain, followed by the most well-known consensus protocols, namely Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Then we'll take a look at some more exotic examples and their (dis)advantages. The last part will be about Byzantine fault tolerance which is a bit more technical and not that essential to properly understand consensus protocols.

Security and consensus are inherently difficult subjects, so I purposefully leave out a lot of details for simplicity and to avoid talking about things I don't fully understand myself. Please note that I'm no expert on blockchain technology or consensus protocols. I taught myself most of these things by scrolling reddit and reading whitepapers and some articles. If you notice anything that doesn't seem right, please correct me and I'll edit the post. Also, if you know about some good links on specific subjects, feel free to leave it in a comment and if necessary I'll add it to the post as well.

So, let's get into this.

# Blocks

Cryptocurrencies live on a distributed ledger in the form of a blockchain (or not, if you like IOTA). This is effectively a chain of ordered blocks, with each block containing a set of transactions or any events relevant to the network. So a block is basically nothing else than a collection of data (transaction amount, timestamp, wallet addresses, etc.) describing what happened since the last time a block was made. A very well-explained and broader introduction to blockchains can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o9fjzx/how_does_the_blockchain_work_blockchain/).

# Nodes

A node is basically one participant of the network that helps building the blockchain. Each node can put together its own block with transactions but only one of them can add it to the chain. In a centralized system, it doesn't really matter which node gets to add its block to the chain since all of them correspond to the same controlling entity anyway. In a decentralized system however, the other nodes will have to check if the proposed block is valid. In essence, they have to make sure the proposed block does not contain fraudulent or malicious transactions. For example, a node can have a transaction in its proposed block that reverses a transaction in a previous block, which could be a case of [double-spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp). Or the block could contain transactions that contradict each other chronologically. So the job of the validating nodes is to find out if the proposed block doesn't contradict any statements made by previous blocks. (This is very much simplified, since there exist different types of nodes like full nodes, archival nodes, validator nodes, lightweight nodes,...)

If some group wanted to hijack the network, all they would have to do is create a lot of nodes such that they have a high chance of being chosen to add the next block to the chain. To counteract this, each node has to provide some sort of unfalsifiable resource to run. It is the nature of this resource that defines how the network is secured and what is the consensus mechanism.

# Proof of Work (PoW)

PoW was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto to secure the first ever cryptocurrency blockchain: Bitcoin. But it was first described way back in [1993](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-48071-4_10) as a method to combat junk mail and was properly formalized a bit later in [1999](https://www.arijuels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PoW.pdf). The required resource to run a node comes in the form of computing power. A node that wants to add its block to the chain has to prove it has this computing power by solving a set of equations (called hash functions) by trial and error. The first node that finds a solution is then verified by the other nodes, which check if the proposed solution actually solves the problem. Once verified, the block gets added and the node that found the solution gets a reward in the form of the native currency. Nodes that try to add their blocks this way are called ""miners"" since they are basically mining new coins (usually they get paid with transaction fees as well as newly produced coins). Obviously, the more work memory you have at your disposal, the more likely it is that you find a solution before anyone else. So the more computing power you have, the more likely it is your block gets added to the chain and the more control you have over the network.

Some PoW coins are: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum \^(but not for long)(ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC)

# Proof of Stake (PoS)

PoS was first introduced by the team behind Peercoin in 2012 (which was actually a PoW/PoS hybrid). In this framework, the resource provided by the nodes is the native currency of the blockchain itself.  Nodes have to ""stake"" some of their tokens in order to be eligible for adding the next block, meaning that they provide tokens to the network in order to help securing it. The term ""stake"" comes from the fact that a node loses a portion or all of its staked tokens if it has been found to have malicious intents against the network. Nodes are effectively putting their tokens at stake in order to receive a reward. Again, the more coins are staked by a node, the more chance it has to be picked for adding the next block and farming the rewards. Most PoS protocols also introduce coin age as a contributing factor. A node that has been holding its coins for a longer time has more chance to add its block.

* The pros for PoS are that it consumes much less energy compared to PoW and that regulating the network requires an on-chain resource. If an entity wants control over the blockchain, it has to buy in large amounts of the currency. Not only do you risk losing all of your staked coins if you try to attack the network, you also risk devaluating the currency you are holding yourself. A currency that suffered a successful attack typically drops in value and people will not be likely to accept it as a form of payment.
* A downside of PoS is that it can encourage hoarding. People with lots of money can stake more and collect more rewards. Meanwhile, people that spend more and drive the economy are not getting any rewards for doing so -&gt; the rich get richer.

Some PoS coins are: Ethereum 2.0 (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM), Tezos (XTZ)

Some variants:

* Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): With DPoS, stakeholders don't directly verify the block transactions. Instead, they vote for a node that represents them, called a delegate. The delegates then carry out the block proposition and verification as usual. DPoS introduces some elements of centralization, but in a dynamic and democratic manner. Used by EOS, BitShares (BTS) and Steem (STEEM).
* Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS): This protocol was proposed by Algorand (ALGO) to solve the blockchain trilemma between security, scalability and decentralization. Every token that is held in a wallet is automatically up for stake. Each round, a number of randomly chosen tokens are selected to validate the block and get a reward.
* Proof of Activity: This is a hybrid mechanism that combines PoW with PoS. First a block is mined with PoW. The mined block only contains the miner address and a random seed. This seed is used to select a group of stakeholders that sign the block with the actual transactions in a PoS manner. Used by Decred (DCR) .
* Proof of Stake Velocity (PoSV): This mechanism was introduced by Reddcoin (RDD) to somewhat counteract the hoarding problem that affects normal PoS. Instead of the stake weight increasing linearly with coin age, the weight increases logarithmically with time. So newly staked coins gain weights quickly and the weights of older coins gradually reach a maximum. This should encourage people to more actively spend their crypto. PoSV is actually part of a larger category of consensus mechanisms that reward their validators based on how actively they use the network, called Proof of Importance (PoI). A prime example of this is NEM (XEM).

# Proof of Authority (PoA)

With PoA, the resource in question is the reputation of the node, linked to an identity. The better the reputation of a node, the higher the level of authority it has within the network. Nodes have an incentive to act truthfully since they can lose their reputation, which can take a long time and a lot of secondary resources to obtain, if they are caught manipulating the network. And most importantly, the bad reputation will be linked to the identity of the person or organization behind the node. A good PoA chain should have a universal set of rules for how to obtain the right to secure the network.

The main application of PoA is traditionally for private networks, like [some applications on Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/ethereum-proof-of-authority-on-azure/). Examples of public cryptocurrency blockchains are POA Network (POA) and VeChain (VET) (and these are the only ones for as far as I know).

* Pros: Very fast, low-cost and economical. It is a very simple mechanism since it typically runs on a limited number of nodes with only reputation as a relevant parameter. At the same time, this also leads to the most apparent downsides of PoA.
* Cons: It more or less defeats the purpose of decentralization. All nodes receive their authoritarian status from the foundation that built the chain. Besides this, history learns us that people are often more than happy to trade in their reputation for profit.

# Proof of Space (PoS*)

PoS\* is similar to PoW, but instead of work memory it uses storage memory. Harddrives can be read very fast, they are relatively cheap and are broadly available, which is why it is proposed as a better alternative to PoW. A node in the network can add its block by proving that it has sufficient storage available to verify transactions. The specifics of how this happens can vary a lot so I'll list a few variants below.

* Proof of Storage/retrievability: A verifier sends a file to a prover, who then stores the file. To add the next block, the prover has to prove to the verifier that he really stored the file. Used by Permacoin, although with some alterations (Maybe it has been renamed by now or it just died somewhere in 2014).
* Proof of Capacity: This is a clever adaptation of PoW. First, nodes pre-calculate solutions to a cryptographic puzzle, which are then stored. Later on, nodes can ""mine"" new blocks by reading through their stored solutions and check if they solve the puzzle for the current block. The advantage is that you have to do the computation only once and the actual mining is done on the hard drive. Used by Burstcoin (BURST).
* Proof of space-time: Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Einsteins theory of general relativity. In addition to proving that a node has a certain amount of storage available, it also has to prove that the space has remained unchanged for a certain amount of time. Used by Filecoin (FIL) and Chia (XCH).
* Proof of Acces: With this protocol, nodes have to prove that they stored a randomly selecetd block of the blockchain history on their hard drives. Then, all nodes that have the block in question on their hard drive will compete against each other with the usual PoW algorithm. This allows a very dynamic blockchain structure since each new block is linked to the previous block as well as this randomly selected ""history"" block, effectively creating a graph structure sometimes referred to as a ""blockweave"". Used by Arweave (AR).
* and many more...

Note: It seems that the terminology within this subject isn't exactly standardized so the names Proof of Space/Storage/Capacity are often used interchangeably.

* Pros: No need for power-intensive hardware like PoW has. PoS\* also sets a lower entry barrier than PoS since this kind of hardware is relatively cheap as well.
* Cons: More accessible hardware also makes it easier to control 51% of the total network.

# Proof of Proof (PoP)

I wanted to include this one just to illustrate how creative one can get with security protocols. With PoP, any blockchain that has insufficient active nodes to properly secure itself could inherit security from another blockchain instead.  Instead of carrying out PoW or PoS themselves, miners can publish reference data from a PoP chain onto any other chain that is considered to be ""more safe"". In the case of an attack on the PoP chain, miners can compare the information on both chains and notice that there are inconsistencies. VeriBlock (VBK), the pioneer of PoP, has proposed to [help securing Bitcoin SV (BSV)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veriblock-foundation-funds-initiative-to-secure-bitcoin-sv-to-bitcoin-with-innovative-proof-of-proof-protocol-301340309.html) and [Ethereum Classic (ETC)](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1094.md) this way, since these chains regularly suffer from 51% attacks.

* Pros: PoP could help blockchains with lacking security infrastrucure by recycling the resources from bigger, more secure chains like Bitcoin.
* Cons: The problem is basically transferred to the miners that do the PoP verification. You would have to trust them to publish legitimate data on the bigger chain.

A variant of PoW, called Delayed Proof of Work (DPoW), is quite similar to this: A PoW blockchain profits from the additional security of a secondary chain within the same network. In order to take over the primary blockchain, both chains would have to be compromised. But unlike PoP, DPoW doesn't require a ""third-party"" chain to operate. Used by Komodo (KMD).

# Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA)

Byzantine failure is a key concept for any consensus protocol and is often explained with an allegory (a word that I just learned myself, basically an analogy) about generals of the Byzantine empire. The generals, who are physically separated, have two options: attack or retreat. Each of them has to cast a vote and have it sent to the other generals by a messenger. The generals are then expected to act based on which option has received the most votes. The process is complicated however, by one or more generals who are traitors to the empire and seek to disrupt the operation. As an example they can vote to attack but instead retreat, leaving the attackers at a disadvantage. Or they can send a vote to attack to some generals and a vote to retreat to the others. Another complication is that the messengers could fail to deliver the votes or even falsify them. All of these are examples of Byzantine faults: An incident where the overall state of the system does not appear to be the same for all participants. Byzantine failure occurs when the system is unable to function properly because of too much faults.

In this analogy, the generals represent the nodes in our network who also have to options: To add the proposed block to the chain or not. As you may have noticed it can be difficult to determine what is the truth in a trustless, decentralized system. Yet a proper blockchain should be resistent to Byzantine failures up to a certain level.

An FBA protocol introduces a specific set of rules that each node/general has to follow in order to mitigate the impact that a bad subset of nodes can have on the system. This can be done by having multiple voting rounds where nodes have to convince other nodes to vote for a proposed block. To come to an agreement, each node has its own quorum slice, which is basically the subset of nodes needed to convince this one particular node of a statement. With the quorum slices of different nodes overlapping, this allows for a very dynamic structure that hopefully converges to one single statement being correct. However, the increased complexity can also lead to some nodes being ""stuck"" without coming to a final conclusion. Even then, the system still utilizes subprotocols to guarantee it can operate despite a number of malicious, failed or stuck nodes. FBA mechanisms are typically characterized by a high level of mathematical rigor.

Within the cryptocurrency space, the FBA protocol was pioneered by Ripple (XRP) and later on adaptations were made by Stellar (XLM). The main difference between the two is that XRP uses pre-selected nodes as validators while with XLM anyone can become a validator and choose which other nodes they trust. If you are looking for a detailed explanation of FBA protocols, the [Stellar whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/5deac75ecad2173c2ccccbc7/5df2560fba2fb0526f0ed55f_stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf) definitely has that. (I actually read through the entire 30-page thing and I must say its a good read if you're familiar with university-level mathematics and/or set theory. Otherwise I'd recommend skipping chapters 3 to 6 because it's damn heavy literature, and that's probably an understatement). Furthermore, NEO uses a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism, which adds the previously mentioned concept of delegates.

* Pros: Very fast, cheap and doesn't require a lot of power usage.
* Cons: Lack of an unfalsifiable resource. You can theoretically make as many nodes as you like, which forces validators to reintroduce the concept of trust and consequentially, also some level of centralization.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Is The Ethical Choice,"Below is a snippet from Hülsmann Jörg Guido's conclusion in his 2008 book, *The Ethics of Money Production* (pages 239-255). I felt it wonderfully emphasized the need to examine morality in money production. In the realm of ethics, it is indeed interesting we hold engineers and businesses to a moral standard punishable by loss of professional license, but not our politicians and monetary-policy decision makers whose impact can sometimes be more severe than a poorly built bridge or business deal.

**TL;DR:** Controlling and gaming the production of money is only permissible in a broken, unsound monetary system like fiat. There are ethical implications involving how money's production is dictated and decided. We need a sound money and anything less would be immoral.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Ethics of Money Production*** (pages 239-255)

We have argued that these monetary institutions have not come into existence out of any economic necessity. They have been created because they allow an alliance of politicians and bankers to enrich themselves at the expense of all other strata of society. This alliance emerged rather spontaneously in the seventeenth century; it developed in multifarious ways up to the present day, and in the course of its development it created the current monetary institutions.

Let us emphasize that this alliance is, and has always been, an ad hoc alliance. We do not claim that our monetary institutions have resulted from a three-hundred-year-old conspiracy between bankers and politicians. It is certainly naïve to assume that no such conspiracy has ever been concocted, or is not presently concocted. But, as our analysis has shown, the conspiracy question is only of secondary importance. The driving force that propelled the development of central banks and paper money was the reckless determination of governments, both aristocratic and democratic, to increase their revenue, if necessary in violation of good faith and of all established rules of commerce.^(1) On this point we find, again, fundamental agreement between our economic analysis and the ethical concerns of the Church:

&gt;This concentration of power and might, the characteristic mark, as it were, of contemporary economic life, is the fruit that the unlimited freedom of struggle among competitors has of its own nature produced, and which lets only the strongest survive; and this is often the same as saying, those who fight the most violently, those who give least heed to their conscience.^(2)

Notice again that our present study does not purport to provide a full discussion of all considerations that have been brought up on the subject. We have presented a broad picture and dealt with details only where appropriate. The point was to show that the evidence for our case is sufficiently clear and sufficiently important to warrant closer examination. The serious student must still acquaint himself with the discussions that can be found in other works on our subject.

MONETARY REFORM

The monetary institutions of our time are in dire need of reform for many reasons. Present-day discussion of monetary reform, insofar as it takes place at all, however, suffers from an amazing intellectual narrowness. It is of course impossible to provide the antidote in a short study, but our exposition might nevertheless be useful in pointing out the directions where alternatives might be found. One such alternative is the natural production of money, even though it presently plays no practical role.^(3) It is a significant fact that one cannot get around the natural order even in theory, because it alone provides a solid starting point for any serious analysis of monetary institutions. And in monetary policy too, as we have argued, it is something like the optimum optimorum.

Notice that we do not recommend simply turning back the clock. A natural monetary order in our day is certainly not identical with what a natural monetary order would have looked like in the sixteenth century. We do not advocate abolishing credit cards, checking deposits, and whatever other viable financial institutions might originate on the market. **The point is to return to a universal respect for property rights**. We need not change instruments such as banknotes, paper money, and the organization of central banks; but the legal rules under which central banks operate and under which paper money is produced. We need to abolish the legal privileges of central banks and monetary authorities. There is no tenable rationale for preventing the citizens from using the best monies and money substitutes. Quite to the contrary, a reform in this direction is necessary for many reasons. Immediate and vigorous action is called for.

Many will object that it is impossible to bring about such a return, now that we have progressed so far on the way toward a global paper money. This is a thoroughly defeatist point of view because it takes the coming disaster (hyperinflation or global tyranny) for granted. Most importantly, however, it is morally wrong. As we have argued, we face a problem of the human will; but this is after all only a problem of the will. In 1258, King Louis IX of France began a monetary reform that would eventually restore the currency of his realm on natural metallic bases. He seems to have been the last ruler so far of his country who fulfilled God’s promise:

&gt;In place of bronze I will bring gold, instead of iron, silver; In place of wood, bronze, instead of stones, iron; I will appoint peace your governor, and justice your ruler. (Isaiah 60:17) 

 It might be argued that Saint Louis had a comparatively easy job. After all, he just needed to clean up the mess in what was still basically a metallic monetary system. By contrast, fractional-reserve banking and paper money have been with us for quite a while, and they have changed habits and even our mentality. Yet consider that China ran through various experiments with fractional-reserve banking and paper money for five hundred years (from about 960 to about 1455 of our time) and in this epoch repeatedly suffered from hyperinflations and other problems that we have analyzed in this volume. Then the country returned to monetary sanity when the political leadership no longer suppressed the circulation of silver and copper coins. And consider that the makers of the American Revolution, the Founding Fathers of the U.S. Constitution gloriously cut the legal ground from under the century-long tradition of colonial paper money. Consider that President Andrew Jackson, against the frantic resistance of vested interests in banking and financial circles, withdrew the legal privileges from all fractional-reserve banks and cut back the public debt to an amount that could have been paid by any individual wealthy citizen. There is no reason why today we should be unable to accomplish such things, or something even better.

retirement,Retirement activities,"Well it's here. I'm riding PTO until the end of the month and then it's official. I've lived under the haze of a calendar my last 35 years and now, nothing. So I'm curious what you do in retirement. And please be specific. 

Today I woke up, fed and walked the dogs. Got home, made breakfast and watched some TV. Personal grooming. I worked a little in my flower beds and trimmed some trees. More TV. I'm about to fire up the grill. More dog walking this evening weather permitting. 

I hope to add some educational components eventually. I need to get back to playing my guitar. I'd like to learn some new cooking techniques. Eventually, I'd like to learn Spanish. Also, I feel one volunteer activity a week would be nice. I know a food panty for homeless and abused nearby. Eventually, we want a 16' to 20' travel trailer to explore the country.

So I ask, what are your activities? As I said, I've been a slave to a schedule for so long, it's probably not possible to just lounge around all day. I'd like to accomplish one small thing each day.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"The US Dollar is not backed by anything, It’s status as global currency rests solely on the perception of US military invincibility. As the US Government begs Taliban to allow a peaceful exit from Kabul, that perception lies in tatters. Is it time for decentralised digital currencies?","The US Dollars status as a global reserve currency is backed by the might of the US Military and the perception of invincibility. 

Today, this perception has taken a massive hammering as Taliban lays siege to the Kabul Airport and the US Embassy has requested its citizens to take shelter and hopes for a peaceful evacuation and airlift of all personnel from Kabul. 

This comes hardly 2 months after the US President announced that there is no chance the Taliban would be able to takeover the country. Yet today, the Taliban have taken over the entire country and have even entered the capital Kabul, and as per some reports the Afghan president has fled. This shows how quickly geopolitical events can unfold. 

This may severely damage the reputation of the US dollar. Geopolitics can change overnight and there are already reports that China recognizes the Taliban government and would trade with them, buy cheap oil without using any USD. The Taliban leadership have been spotted on a visit to China. The geopolitical implications of this cannot be understated or immediately understood by many. 

People believe it is impossible that the USD could fall, but history is proof for far more impossible events becoming reality. Global Reserve Currencies in general seem to have a lifetime of about a century or so. Before the US, gold, British Sterling, French Livre, Dutch Guilder were the reserve currencies. In 1600, the Spanish Real was actually the local currency in most parts of the North American economy. 

What ever happens to the USD, we now live in an incredible period in history where there are viable alternative digital currencies like Bitcoin that are not controlled by governments or by shadow private entities like the Fed, but existing as decentralised networks and can be easily traded among fiat currencies. 

It is an interesting phenomenon, maybe the calling for Bitcoin is finally here. As the Bitcoin network continues to mine and validate block after block, unbothered by the fiat government establishment of the day, it will only attract new participants to the network and its censorship resistant nature will continue to provide a transactional currency for everyone, without any restriction.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,I personally do all I can to protect doge out of principle specifically because it's the anti btc. Palmer knows why and everyone should understand why BTC needs to go the way of AOL.,"The info on how to battle the whales is spreading and so long its been going as expected and working as a dithering / stabilizing force which is the hope. The goal is to at the very least make it much harder for whales to execute coordinated pump and dumps and ideally counter balance and neutralize manipulation to the point where true value and price reach alignment much faster.

Look at the timing of my posts today. From the release onward. You can see that the meme stocks immediately jumped into pump and pull literally in sync.

http://imgur.com/a/5bJYCnK

Here's the time stamped post announcing the release. 

http://imgur.com/a/mH6qAqw

You can probably guess when it was on the btc graph.

Upon release of btc the bots react immediately then the x factor is media which is typically just botted news especially when ""something"" happened that completely contradicted their original headline. The next headline will spin it and the way it spins it can have a big impact or none at all which would result in a typical recovery with the bots beating humans at snatching up the discounts which they're sophisticated enough at they can sustain a discount while buying and then drive the price up as humans begin to buy.

The vulnerability to the market whether crypto or otherwise is in the very nature of the ask and bid system.

Collusion has always been an issue and the presumption has always been that self interest would cancel out the efficacy of any coordinated effort since people are thought to more likely betray one another but we all know this isn't true... The mechanism of collusion and even the simulation of a bidding war is commonly seen from shopping for airline tickets where one site will leave a cookie to snitch to other sites letting them know the price it had offered you so that the next site would base its pricing on what price you had already been offered. It would then add a count down timer incrementally rising as if the very act of you looking up tix at the exact time you did set up some butterfly effect where apparently others are after the same exact seats at the same exact time so the price rises according to the added ""demand"" that apparently was triggered by ""coincidence"".

I think most of us know of this by now and know to clear our cookies or even modify them so you appear to be from a different location thus resetting the price or even giving you a discount.

The airline ticket hack is so familiar I suspect people don't even think of it anymore than a nuisance to casually override but how quickly we just accepted this form of collusion and just found a way around it. Others who explored it further found ways to hack it to score cheaper tickets which then exposes a conundrum that I call the secret gold mine not because I want to but because I don't know of an idiom that'd fit. If you do please let me in on your secret gold mine of idioms. I suspect this is why others aren't going public about this.

It also makes me wonder why people even still do pump and pulls (pump and dump is an outdated term. The dump part doesn't even need to happen anymore.) I suspect it's chart manipulation so people can go further by scaling the x y and z axes plus the sample rate to set up false expectations or to create hype. Maybe some dumps naturally pull the value down but you just as commonly see the prices deliberetely being driven down by trickling sales with one hand and buying them back up in bulk with the other.

A real sell off would be not deliberately sell for less than the highest bid consistently with inhuman precision all the way down. Anyone who'd want to sell would try to sell off the most at the highest point.

https://i.imgur.com/taJi9I4.gifv

The issue with speaking publicly is that you know you're speaking publicly so can only choose the audience in terms of relevance but you can't filter out those with opposing interests. /r/dogecoin is as far as I can see the largest public forum for people interested in a mix of economics, crypto, of course doge, and by extension technology, futurism. As a bonus I like(d) the positivity which I know is still here, but unfortunately since June my account has been hacked and I can only interact / post if I vpn hop otherwise I can log in but anything I do just errors out making it effectively a read only account. I don't really mind and kind of expected it but it was pretty fun when we'd talk as a team tracking the bots openly and discuss ways to address their manipulation. It also deleted my first post which was deliberately a tall claim I. E. ""There was gonna be a big discount dip that's 15 to 20 percent more than you expect, so wait for it and I mean REALLY wait."" I'm sure plenty who see this remember but I'm sure of you respond it'll be shadow banned. I expected everyone to dismiss it but used it as an opportunity to prove how easy it is to manipulate the market these days even for just one person during still waters. 

I can do it again but I don't think you'd want me to right now. But important points was not just how it was possible but how to recognize it when it was about to happen and as it was happening I. E. Bot thrashing 

If anyone subscribes to a pump and dump can you dm me. I want to know why they are doing it that way when a discount dip would be helpful for everyone and the worse that would happen when you time it during a stable period is that some people would time it better and get a deeper discount... No one would actually lose. So I've got questions for old fashion pump and dump scammers. 

One of our first attempts to liberate doge was to try to get people to stop falling for the pump and dumps and instead have them back fire by getting everyone keen on how to recognize when not to buy and when to buy kind of like with the meme stocks where you'd be set up to notice the rise too late and it'd play on your greed and fomo to get you to buy high expecting it to rocket further when without the urgency you'd clearly see that you're being lured into over paying then drive the price back down strategically until you end up losing robbed at least on the short term.

I guess actively tracking the bots and openly discussing it was too much for ""some"". 

Ever since this post where I managed to respond to one comment before the rest vanished. My account got restricted to read only somehow and reddit has no idea why.

http://imgur.com/a/p4xpz8E

This only delays me and it killed the discussion. A bunch of others were similarly locked out. I vpn hop so can get through the cluster ban but it keeps me from issuing timely warnings and such sometimes. 

Shadow banning is meant to be effective by confusing you into believing no one is paying attention since you think your comment is posted but it's only visible to you. It's the most effective type of censorship if you aren't familiar to the technique since you're more likely to think people truly for some reason suddenly just don't care and everyone else suddenly I guess evaporated into a cloud of apathy. I'm familiar with this tactic, it's typical Russian censorship where if suppression of positive attention while amplification and artificial insertion of troll comments isn't enough they'll go as far as to plant drugs on you or even 51 50 you just so you have the record and they can just use group think to get people who clearly see what you're showing them but will remain silent. There's a Russian term for it but I got to the word helicopter and I can order drinks before I realized Ruski is really really hard. You see the same thing more and more here like somehow the term ""woke"" as if red pilled in the way it was intended, a word that even as far back as in Zen Buddhism is the goal. The diametric opposite to all the hysterias so much work is spent to get us to see through FUD. Even when facing a tiger encounter or any emergency FUD would only get in your way. By stander syndrome comes from FUD. Doing what you know in your heart is what's right often means annihilation of FUD. To be perfectly honest I'm not an idiot and this stuff does scare me. But I don't seem to see anyone else covering it so I feel like I have no choice but to do what I feel is the right thing and hope anyone I'm threatening can sympathize that I'm doing what I feel is best for everyone. If I'm wrong and there's something I'm missing you're free to DM me. Maybe I'm an idiot and there's some higher plan. I'm familiar with the concept of noble lies from Plato. Sometimes a lie ends up more true because the truth simply can't be said. Before literacy we used myth and magic to help people with noble lies. That's fine with me too if it's the way it has to be for now.

Dms are still fun but not the same but regardless the suppression is meant to suppress in the same way that reddit's vote system is designed so that you can have a thousand up votes and all that would need to happen is for it to be botted down to 8 or so which is another technique to make it so that nothing truly important can get broad attention. Only things that run with the grain of media bias could ever get up voted to the point where it gains more views. So Logan Paul is a hero. Ted Cruz, Gavin McGinnis etc Canadians are suddenly teaching us American patriotism... Sorry but people who won't u turn unless there's a sign that says to. No... You don't get freedom, 10 seconds no cars I run the red light. Truck too near, I'm cramped and feel unsafe, I will speed and break the law because even with lege nulla poena sine mens rea. No action in itself makes you guilty of a crime. And even if you get a ticket a simple letter to a judge and he has to dismiss it, not because he's a nice guy but because that's the foundation of our legal system. It's why we have jury nullification if the judge for some reason screws up. Knowledge really is power. And disinfo can literally strip you of freedom just like Snowden scaring everyone into believing were all being spied on 24 7 which would be the stupidest thing anyone could ever do. Just stick three phones near eachother and play a pure sine wave.

A post I made on cyber security rocketed to top of all time due to mcaffee endorsement and I wrote the piece because no one else had. The internet used to be very broad as a platform for free expression where even YouTube used to have a most popular section until of course Google ate it and pood out what it became, eliminated video responses, segregated audiences and replaced most popular with trending which is a fake self fulfilling prophecy that'd allow them to control what would become popular. By eliminating video responses and segregating the audience targeted media turned YouTube from a vibrant community of free expression and debate to a series of queue's setting up to divide everyone into rabbit holes with the most radical queue's becoming ever more radical and self reinforcing, from an echo chamber to a fun house mirror maze to a straight up Lazer blast that can take a person from Joe Rogan through a set pathway that'd unite him with a crowd where the radical had become so apparently normal it seemed like a good idea to kidnap Gov Whitmer. 

Google search is effectively one page of ""trending"" results and everyone is expected to click on page 1. Recently so much has been deleted from the internet that I've gotten literally 3 pages looking up keywords that used to leave me with dozens of pages and in that case I couldn't even find any reference to what I was looking for any more at all. 

So Google and YouTube have a monopoly over what we read and watch and segregate us so that everyone has a uniquely taylored false perception of what's normal and even what's happening. People literally believed the city I live in was constantly on fire when literally the opposite was happening I. E. No blm were not ""looting"" antifa were not constantly blowing things up, in fact the exact opposite happened and we stopped some Boogaloos attempt to assassinate a few old guard panthers, and instead they cowardly shot randomly onto the crowd killing a guard who happened to be black. 3 of our synogogues were looted and vandalized, Asians including elderly were beaten up so badly they were hospitalized and it was declared ""crimes of opportunity"" like the bad day the shooter had who murder the women targeting the salons that was presumed to be run by Asians (after driving past several strip clubs). 

Botting. Suppression of information I e real censorship vs guys who auto played randomly on YouTube claiming they're censored so you better pay them because their censorship is proof that what they're saying should have money thrown at it as if that would somehow help. 

From airline ticket price collusion to the bot net splicing itself to fill strategically manipulate the price signals to actual censorship like when you are banned to the lost of faith in journalism due to low quality botted articles triggered by any event to aggregate anything that seems to correlate even if it has to go back in time to do a chop job, change the date to today and reassign the author to ""editor of the wsj"" to give it credibility all to get first click advantage at the cost of causing time soup. I'm sure many of you have observed even before covid that time seems weird, did you know the matrix came out 20 years ago?

Yet we're in the age of automation, with self driving cars yet botting, how much bots impact our lives is barely discussed and one seen people surprised that AI would be used to run action bots when we've had AI at least since video games and adapting poker AI to auction bots isn't hard nor should it be surprising that its happened and why would it be one anymore than why would only the airline ticket industry collude to shake you down by playing with your sense of fomo and simulating phantom competition. 

Auction bots have been around forever first just simulating the appearance of human demand. This happened when pizza.com and business.com made the news for selling for millions, suddenly auction bots had purchased the stupidest domain names and were making it appear as if ""mydoctorsadentist.com"" sold for $15,000, prompting people to believe in the hype and domain registrars made a ton of money but also most importantly LEARNED the best domain names based on the volume of people trying to register the domain name thus we taught those bots how valuable each domain name was. Recently NFT pay for play auction scam sites have cropped up running the same scam which only takes a few newsbots to be complicit or a single unscrupulous journalist who ""tried"" to sell an NFT of a news paper and lo and behold headline news, it sold for a few grand. Not a bribe at all... True value. 

If you try going to these pay for play scam auctions you'll notice some distinct qualities that set it apart from eBay. eBay offers free listings and makes money on commission so its incenrivised to also offer you ways to maximize the interest in the listing with multiple high res photos, descriptions, ratings etc etc and though it runs contrary to its interest will ban you for up bidding your own item with another account. For some reason the NFT auction sites don't follow the most successful auction site of all time and charge you to post knowing if you're in for a penny you're in for a pound and so of course there will be enough people bidding up their own item to fill a single page of ""past sales"".

When crypto was new there were only a few auction sites which I'd rather not name but you may remember being mesmerized by the screen as ""people"" seemed to be bidding these things up like crazy. Certain ones would even have a live chat but would only allow those who had more than 30 grand in to partake in the supposed conversation so you too could say the same pointless ""rocket"" banter /r/dogecoin is flooded with for no apparent reason other than to make sure no post has any meaningful amount of exposure. 

And it'd only take a few adbots and a few unscrupulous journalists who clearly profited to put out an article declaring that some kid says he's now a millionaire because he got BTC, see the 16 year old wearing a suit 2 sizes too large thus proving his immense success, and for all the btc millionaires, what do you suppose is going on with who started the operation and premined all but the tip of the ice berg.

You may also remember all the reports of supposed btc millionaires who lost it, lost the password. Or remember when the sites suddenly went dark with the BTC millionaires checking in on the site to see when it'll come back online.

All the while the rest of the news on BTC isn't nearly as pretty, silk road being 4chan to the dark web that BTC actually is. 

Here's a post by the CO founder of doge, Palmer upon having had more research on what BTC had always really been all about:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1415353986392072196

I'm aware of the dangers of ""BTC dominance"" which relies on it being so over priced to the point where we've simply stopped questioning whether prices have to make any relative sense at all especially regarding something that literally followed the playbook of debeers and opec, has to be large enough to work as leverage that's contaminated all markets with its bots and is a large enough value where a single token is something you'd imagine in a book would be the currency used in an underground market that sells people and tasks that shouldn't be done. 

BTC is 80+ percent monopolized by only 0.5% of wallets which are known to be used by bots, it's design where the decimal moves the other way makes more sense to bots than to humans who think in whole numbers and even with change a dollar breaking into just 100 pieces is already so much no one would bother to pick up 1000 pennies unless it was already bagged at least. 

The projection that BTC will go to 100,000 would be a repeat of what happened in the 20s when the federal reserve act replaced treasury notes with federal reserve debt notes (national debt notes) and expanded the credit leading to the roaring 20s then collapsed the credit so rapidly it created the first billionaires on the 1920s when a burger was a nickel and Rockefeller has to buy 7000 Jackson Pollacks just to store his wealth. Warren Buffets father was one of the first billionaires. 

There is no non double plus bad reason why BTC, a cartelised ""currency"" should be anywhere near the amount its worth now nevermind 3 times that. Why would we want that? For the 8 or so remaining percent left to the rest of us to split into endless fractions hyping up the value for the 80+ percent that's already being leveraged against us?

How about we see it behave first and stop stealing value from other things before we let the cancer grow and see what happens then? 

This is a war of attrition. All the cryptos mutually competitive, doge isn't the penny to BTCs dollar, it's the Nintendo to BTCs Collecovision. I think I made that word up trying to think of the first video gaming console but it's so old and irrelevant I don't really care to look it up and I definitely wouldn't expect it to be 100 times the value of a Nintendo just because it's really old slow and dusty.

As usual I'd rather we were allowed to have conversations on the topic, it's such an obvious question. Why is BTC valued at what it is and why should it actively hold all other cryptos hostage under it? LTC is literally a cut a paste job with all the flaws including dust trails that destroy its anonymity unless jrs only used to transfer gigantic amounts of money at once. 

Doge is inherently dust free, by design 1 doge is its floor value. The remaining dust from transaction fees accumulate in your wallet. 

The second mouse gets the cheese. There is so much we can learn to not let doge become and do it right this time. And doge has all it needs to really be adopted at least as a concurrent parallel currency that works more like a token of gratitude that can be spent than legal tender to settle debt with debt.

It's 5 doge rolls right off the tongue. Doge friendly, or we like doge, or we accept doge all look and work great especially with the equivalent to mankind's starter Pokémon as it's symbol, and payment already meant to be a transfer of gratitude by a token of appreciation that we all want to appreciate over time against the dollar which is presumed to always lose value. 

At its max cap which no currency has any reason to have. The story of tulip mania is misunderstood just like the boiling frog experiment doesn't actually work. Tulips were initially exotic and so it was rare. It wasn't artificially scarce. Local farmers began to grow them. They were no longer exotic and rare and suddenly everyone got to have a full tulip. I can have a while bouquet but you know what's weird? Despite how people can grow them, I can even grow them, I still have to buy a bouquet of tulips. They aren't worthless because I don't suddenly go dmt head and see that we are all but a grain of sand floating in an infinite universe that is worthless because it is infinite. When I leave my house and see the boundless space around me I don't recoil at the worthlessness of too much space. And I would not want someone to force space to be artificially scarce upon any of us. We literaly use that as a form of punishment.

Even if we were to hit the reset switch and btc reached its max cap, if it were divided evenly to every man woman and child everyone would have 300. If we were to do the same to the dollar everyone would have 200. So how much is btc really worth? 

It will take 300 years before there are as many doge as there are dollars: the global reserve currency. 

Which is really worth more? 

As usual you can try posting and I'll try to catch them before they disappear while the troll comments for some reason remain. But there's a bit of food for thought and an explanation for why we insist the value of btc fall as doge rises and btc dominance should be seen as the threat it clearly is and even sounds like when said out loud.

The term implies much more. People have died and have put out hit jobs to threaten people against upgraded it's base layer for reasons that are as thoroughly sketchy as BTC has always been and is now becoming more and more public.

At this point we're still suppressing btc but only by tipping the scales with a feather. I've been calling this maintenance when I do it manually which implies consolidation. The war of attrition is for btc to became so dusty it loses all its glimmer to reveal the pile of ash it's always been.

Ideally the attacks on btc will keep it suppressed and its effect on others will become even less and less until its leverage yields no significant impact anymore.

My prior post about the attack on btc through Bch went exactly as planned. All this seems hopeful. And I suspect our friends along every axis of means who's interest align with ours but can't outright admit it so we are willing to do the work if they maintain the tacit relationship that has been mutually beneficial thus far. 

This has all gone so well that we honestly don't know what to do going forward and are just supervising with the exception of ""maintenance"" like publicized with my prior post.

BTC continues to lose its luster in a war of attrition while all else rises and price signals and value approach sanity.

Ideally periods of ""maintainance"" will no longer be needed and then no manipulation would even be necessary anymore.

But until then we're going to maintain downward pressure on btc while careful to continuing to reduce the effect of a btc drop would have on any thing else.

**1. Retirement and Income Supplement**

* **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)**

 Everyone 18 or older can create this account. Every year we get an amount we can contribute to it (usually between $5,000-$6,000). From this account we can invest in stocks/etfs/funds/crypto/etc and everything made from this account isn't counted as taxable income. Any withdrawals from this account are re-added as contribution room the following year.

* **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)**

 Similar to the TFSA as it has a certain amount of contribution. This account is used to defer taxes. So you can use this to lower your current tax bracket and push it down the road to your retirement years, keeping you in a lower bracket.

* **CPP (Canadian Pension Plan)**

 Working Canadians have a % of their income taken out every pay and put towards the CPP. This is a massive pension plan that benefits all working Canadians in their retirement. We can start withdrawing from this at age 60, but if you start these payments before age 65 there is a penalty and you get less. Max monthly amount for 2021: $1,203.75

* **OAS (Old Age Security)**

 Another monthly payment for everyone 65 or older. Max monthly amount: $626.49. This payment is reduced if you make 79k or more as income (TFSA/RRSP comes in handy here)

* **GIS (Guaranteed Income Supplement)**

 Designed to help low-income retirees. Basically everyone who relies solely on CPP/OAS in retirement. A single person can receive as much as $916.38 per month. A couple can receive as much as $551.63 per person.

* **GST/HST Credit**

 For low and middle-income Canadians. It's a payment to help offset the General Goods/Sales Taxes. Scaled based on income. Max benefit of $456/year, paid quarterly. 


**2. Education &amp; Kids**

* **RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)**

 A plan for savings for your kids' education. You can contribute up to a max of $50k per child. The account can be used similar to a TFSA for investing, and isn't taxed if used for education. The federal government will match contributions up to 20% per year up to $500 annually. Certain provincial governments also match contributions. For example Quebec matches an additional 10% up to a maximum of $250 annually. The feds also give a one-time grant of $500 upon making your first deposit into the account

* **Child Care Benefit**

 Monthly payment for every child you have until they reach the age of 18 that is based on income. $6765/yr for kids under 6, $5708/yr for kids 6-17. Provinces can also have their own additional benefit. Anywhere from 1000-3000/yr based on province/age/income/etc

* **EI/Parental Leave**

 Employment Insurance, the system that pays Canadians in case of job loss, also covers parental leave. The leave can be up to 18 months and gives you a percentage of your income. Can also be shared between parents. The amount is 33%-70% of your regular earnings, depending on duration of leave, type of leave, province, etc. Quebec gives additional leave for fathers (5 weeks).

There's more programs for housing, healthcare, etc but I mainly wanted to compare retirement/income/kids/education.

CryptoCurrency,I’m done with my savings account.,I’ve received a letter from my bank letting me know that my savings account is no longer offering me the amazing 1% interest rate per annum ... but that they have now reduced it to •5%. So it would take me 10 years for my savings account to return what I made on my portfolio in the past 24 hours.

People that use the 4% rule typically have 40% bonds because that was what worked best for capital preservation in all cases in tested scenarios. How though, can we determine the optimal percentage bonds should make of our portfolio when we dont follow the 4% rule, because we have a higher return on investment or less volatility achieving the same interest rate that a mostly-stock portfolio would yield over time?",finance
personalfinance,Would it be dumb to take a federal student loan even though my first year is already paid off?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Mortgage/Debt ReFi Question,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I'm hoping you and your sage wisdom can serve as a gut check for me. First, a few bits of background


* My wife and I were married last year, and refinanced her student loans this year. I co-signed on these. This transaction reduced her interest rate by 1.15% and consolidated five loans into one. The repayment term reduced significantly. She had some 10 year, some 15 year, and some that were longer than that. We consolidated to a 7 year schedule.

* Also earlier this year we refinanced our mortgage. This shaved 62.5 bps off the rate. Our current LTV is approx 50%.

* My income is approximately 70% of our total.

* She's pregnant! While on leave, she'll be getting ~60% of her income. After her leave, we're unsure how much she'll be working, so, that 40% loss in her income may be permanent (or it could be more).

With that background, we're considering another mortgage refi. My ""guy"" has offered two options


* Cash Out Refi - which would consolidate the loans and the mortgage into a single loan at a 12.5 bps decrease to our current mortgage rate (and a 1.2% decrease to her student loans), and, our mortgage interest would be deductible, while her student loan interest is currently not.


* Straight Refi - we maintain the student loans as is, and our mortgage loan rate by 62.5 bps.

All else being equal, keeping the student loans as is and doing the straight re-fi is the clear answer. Our Weight Avg. Interest Rate in that scenario is a half point lower than our current Weighted Avg. Interest Rate, and in a little less than 7 years, we have meaningful cash to start dumping into our mortgage (or a college savings account...). The cash-out refi option also keeps the yoke of these student loans around for 30 years, rather than 7. 

So the question I come to you with - is the ~1k of payment difference between straight refi + student loan vs. cash-out refi worth it? By that I mean the flexibility if her income decreases meaningfully for a long time - this is almost $11k in annual debt service that, at least in the first few years would be material.

In hindsight, the 7 year term was aggressive, I probably should have done 10, but, I didn't think we'd have a little one en route so soon. 

I'm sure I missed some pertinent information or explained something poorly, so, please let me know what other info you need and what other considerations I should be thinking about. Appreciate the help all.",finance

Bitcoin,"Paid a Visit to The Graves of my Grandparents and Uncles/Aunts for the 50th ""Anniversary"" of Nixon's ""Temporary"" Gold Standard ""Fix""; Philosophical and Spiritual Insights Ahead!","I literally went to the cemetery for said date yesterday, and stood at the grave of my grandparents and aunts/uncles whom lived through ALL of that, and have since passed.

They were all born 1921-1934, and lived through a lot. The perspective is fucking insane. They lived through that and the decline of the dollar, all the wars, etc. My oldest uncle was literally the oldest; born 1921 and he checked out early 2019 just before shit started really hitting the fan. He was 98. Can you imagine seeing almost 100 years of monetary policy shifts - let alone cultural ones?!

I was born in 1988. The 90's were amazing and then obviously 9/11 was a huge blow. Now that I'm almost 34 I can see that this shit has always, ALWAYS been going down; all that has changed is the technology. I remember my parents losing their first home to foreclosure early 90's, and renting for 10 years before having enough to purchase a small home in like, 2002.

I have more money saved than they ever have, and I can't even afford a down payment on anything. I took out a 5 year loan for a car, and paid it off in 3. I have no credit card debt. I stack BTC and collect gold and silver as a hedge. They did NONE of that shit and had two cars, and even after being foreclosed, could still afford a place to rent after the fact. 

I feel like that's not an option in 2021.

My point is not envy or jealousy; it's proof of the erosion of purchasing power in the last 30 years, which requires experience of being 30+ to now see plain as day. My parents were my age back then (1991). That'll rock your shit; it did mine all day.

Bitcoin (and to a degree, gold and silver) is literally THE fucking ticket up and out of whatever class you're stuck in income wise.

They had the market and retirement and higher purchasing power back then, but now we have a huge opportunity to do the same with BTC to a moderate degree.

I trust the power and wisdom of the elders to fuel my spirit going forward. Weak minds will never last. Stack, hodl, love unconditionally.

If this resonates with anyone for any stupid reason, PM me. We need more like minds at this time!",cryptocurrency

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

22. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

37. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

38. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

39. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

40. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML.

41. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano.

42. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that!

43. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

48. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

54. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

56. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

78. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
79. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

81. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

85. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

91. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

CryptoCurrency,The Financial Crisis Shaped Crypto. It Also Shaped Crypto’s Regulators.,"Good morning one and all, here is a part of an interesting article I was reading in the economics section of the Indian Times over breakfast this morning. I leave it here for your perusal, and I wish you a pleasant day.

For all the gauzy stories of what crypto could become, there’s the simple reality of what it mostly is right now: A financial market in which highly volatile assets are traded, where scams and hacks and broken promises abound, and with DeFi, where complex derivatives and financial instruments are being invented and swapped. One worry many in the government have is that these markets are thriving through the avoidance of taxes and regulations.

This is a story we’ve seen before: Amazon got an early advantage by dodging sales taxes for years, and Uber and Lyft evaded transportation and labor regulations until they got powerful enough to essentially rewrite those rules themselves. But there are particular dangers to financial instruments designed to skirt oversight. Anyone who lived through the 2008 financial crisis knows the threat of shadow banking sectors.

“It is untenable to allow an unregulated, unlicensed derivatives market to compete, side-by-side, with a fully regulated and licensed derivatives market,” Dan Berkovitz, the commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in a June speech. “In addition to the absence of market safeguards and customer protections in the unregulated market, it is unfair to impose the obligations, restrictions, and costs of regulation upon some market participants while permitting their unregulated  competitors to operate wholly free of such obligations, restrictions and costs.”

Still, when I talked to staff members at the Treasury Department, they seemed a bit shellshocked by the past week. To them, the mobilization against Portman’s language was a bizarre overreaction to a modest provision that would be followed by a multiyear rule-making process, where the crypto industry would have plenty of say. The language of the bill was expansive not because the Treasury Department wants to force everyone who touches a blockchain to produce a 1099, but because it doesn't want to prejudge how the crypto networks were structured. Crypto advocates keep saying that they shouldn’t be regulated until they’re better understood, but that’s precisely, from the Treasury Department’s point of view, why Congress shouldn’t tie its hands before it can go through a full regulatory process.

Of course, the crypto world saw the effort differently.

“The language was overbroad, and it still is,” Katie Haun, a co-chair of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund, told me. “It could be read to encompass software developers and miners. A possible reading — and where there’s a possible reading, it chills activity — is whether, on every transaction, you’d have to make a filing. Treasury says that’s not what they were intending to capture, but that left uncertainty , and uncertainty chills innovation and moves it offshore.”

The oddity of reporting this story is that all sides swear they want the same things. All the people I spoke to in the crypto universe agreed that there needed to be tax compliance; they just didn’t want to see software developers or blockchain miners caught up in an IRS dragnet. All the people I spoke to on the government side said that they were just trying to get the information necessary for tax compliance, and that they had no intention of bothering software developers and blockchain miners who weren’t actually brokering transactions.

I am, of course, being a bit purposefully naive here. The truth is that there’s some mixture of misunderstanding, mistrust and regulatory jockeying on all sides. The crypto industry wants to be lightly regulated and undertaxed, just as every industry does, and many of its key players are deeply hostile to the government — the genesis of the technology, after all, is an effort to wrest the control of currencies away from governments, even if the money flooding into the sector has ensured that crypto will be intimately entwined with governments.

The federal government, for its part, wants broad authority, in part because it believes that carve-outs will be used for tax and regulatory avoidance. It fears a future in which crypto is big enough to pose risks to the financial system, and it doesn’t have the tools or reporting to see and manage those risks, just as was true in the derivatives markets in 2007.

There is an irony in this. The cryptocurrency boom was partly a reaction to the collapse in trust toward governments that followed the financial crisis. But that same sector is now going to be scrutinized by governments that, after the financial crisis, have become much more skeptical of young whiz kids who are making wild profits from new, highly complex and volatile assets and financial instruments.

“You have to ask yourself: Do you think, in general, finance is an area that’s over or underregulated?” Furman told me. “Are you more concerned all sorts of cool products don’t exist because of regulation or are you worried people are being ripped off and taken advantage of? I know which side of that I’m on.”

The bill ultimately passed the Senate with the crypto language unchanged. There was a compromise proposal that both sides supported, but for procedural reasons too inane to go into here, it needed unanimous consent, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., blocked it in order to try to get $50 billion in unrelated military spending added to the bill. Shelby failed, but he took the crypto compromise down with him. As I’ve said before: The Senate is a ridiculous institution, run by ridiculous rules. But this is the beginning of what will be, for better and worse, a long relationship between the government and the crypto community. After all, this was just about tax compliance. How to track and minimize financial risk in the crypto markets is going to be much harder, but that fight is still to come.

“What I like about the infrastructure bill is this showed a recognition on the part of the 67 senators who voted for the bill that crypto is here to stay,” Haun told me. “This is an industry that’s maturing. It’s not in the shadows.”",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Popular Stable coins are moving away from dollar peg claims. Lets take a look at some facts behind major stable coins.,"There has been a lot of speculation and FUD about pretty much all stable coins. So let's take a look at some details of stable coin with market cap&gt; 1 Billion USD.

1. TUSD: I started with this one since it's the easiest to explain. Pros- TUSD or true USD is indeed backed by USD cash kept in escrow accounts. However, this 100% cash also limits it's market cap to only 1.3 Billion USD. Low liquidity and low adoption are it's cons.


2. UST: This is a pure algorithm based stable coin on the terra-luna system. Pros - High and easy scalability since it doesn't need physical funds makes it good for defi projects. Cons- low market cap and adoption. Current market cap is 2.1 Billion USD. Also, it doesn't have any physical assets to back it up.


2. DAI: DAI is a decentralized form of Stable coin that works on smart contracts - primarily Ethereum. One deposit eth for DAI tokens. Based on algorithms and amount of eth in the system, DAI token are created or destroyed and this maintains the dollar peg.  Current market cap is 3.6 Billion USD. Hence, it has a low liquidity and exchange adoption.


3. BUSD: This is a binance USD stable coin, issued in conjunction with Paxos, which is a US regulated entity. It's reserves, as declared recently by Paxos are 96% cash, held in insured accounts and remaining 4% are US Treasury bills. However, this is what Paxos has declared, I am not sure if this has indeed been audited. Pros - decent market cap of 5 Billion USD, decent liquidity. Cons- It is still Binance issued which raises uncertainty related to China and makes it's stability tied to Binance's future success.


4. USDC: One of the most popular and transparent USD stable coin founded by circle and backed by Coinbase. Recent they removed the ""USD backing"" statement. They have regular accounting audits which show backing with 60% cash reserves and the rest in the form of commercial papers and low risk assets. With a current market cap of 27 billion USD, It has good liquidity and adoption. However, still not as widespread as USDT. Also it is only issued as ERC20 token, making it prone to high gas fees issues. 


5. USDT: Tether issued stable coins which is by far the most popular with a market cap of 64 Billion USD. It has the maximum liquidity and adoption. Pretty much every exchange in the world uses it and almost every crypto pair is available. Also, it is available on ERC, TRC, MATIC network giving several transfer options without high gas or exchange fees. Cons - the biggest issue with tether is TRUST! Tether has been known to do some shady things in the past. They were fined by New York AG and banned from doing business in New York. Also their last accounting report shows low cash and mostly commercial paper backing. They have never performed an audit of their reserves to satisfy and quell the FUD. But they are still the most popular stable coin.


Now coming to the future of stable coins. In the present day and age of very low interest rates and rising inflation, I doubt anyone would issue a stable coin with 100% cash backing. It's like having billions sitting on your account without yielding any returns. Therefore, the future is either algorithmic stable coins or dollar asset backed stable coins.

CryptoCurrency,Here is my take on the most Undervalued coins at the moment on the TOP 100 Marketcap list.,"We are approaching the next Bull market, and there are some projects and coins that seem to be undervalued at the moment, here is my take for each one of them: 

# THETA

**Current Marketcap:** $8,182,853,902

**Current Price:** $8.18 

**ATH:** $15.90

**What make them unique?** 

Theta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.

The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.

Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.

Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.

The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.

In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.

# AAVE 

**Current Marketcap:** $5,780,342,916

**Current Price:** $446.24

**ATH:** $666.86

**What make them unique?** 

Aave has several unique selling points when compared with competitors in an increasingly crowded market. During the DeFi craze in the summer of 2020, it was one of the biggest projects in terms of the total value of crypto locked in its protocol.

The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave’s flagship products are “flash loans,” which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There’s a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction.

Another big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.

# Monero

**Current Marketcap:** $5,093,822,858

**Current Price:** $283.39

**ATH:** $542.33

**What make them unique?** 

There are several things that make Monero unique. One of the project’s biggest aims is achieving the greatest level of decentralization possible, meaning that a user doesn’t need to trust anyone else on the network.

Privacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured — and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are “selectively transparent.”

Obfuscation is achieved through the use of ring signatures. Here, past transaction outputs are picked from the blockchain and act as decoys, meaning that outside observers can’t tell who signed it. If Ian was sending 200 XMR to Susan, this amount could also be split into random chunks to add a further level of difficulty.

To ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.

All of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin — especially on darknet markets. Governments around the world, especially the U.S., have also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who can crack Monero’s code.

# Cosmos

**Current Marketcap:** $3,558,119,368

**Current Price:** $16.19

**ATH:** $31.70

**What make them unique?** 

A major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible.

Cosmos is described as “Blockchain 3.0” — and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it’s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result.

Scalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they’ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites — or be even better.

# Tezos

**Current Marketcap:** $3,306,878,856

**Current Price:** $3.86

**ATH:** $8.40

**What make them unique?** 

Although staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.

Bakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain’s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority.

Tezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency.

Big cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that’s seen too widely across digital assets.

# Algorand

**Current Marketcap:** $3,292,114,706

**Current Price:** $1.01

**ATH:** $3.28

**What make them unique?** 

Algorand was invented to speed up transactions and improve efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of Bitcoin and other blockchains. Algorand is designed so that there are very lower transaction fees, as well as no mining (like Bitcoin's energy-intensive process), as it is based on a permissionless pure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol.

# Dash

**Current Marketcap:** $2,177,030,212

**Current Price:** $211.71

**ATH:** $1,493.59

**What make them unique?** 

According to its website, the goal of Dash is ""to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency in the world."" To accomplish this, the project relies on a network of masternodes, which are servers backed by collateral held in Dash that are designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dash's proposal system. In exchange for part of the block rewards, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend and ChainLocks.

Dash is marketed to both individual users and institutions, including merchants, financial services, traders and those who need to send international remittances. In October 2020, Dash Core Group reported that its strategic objectives moving forward include building its ecosystem and brand, ensuring that users are satisfied and further advancing the technology behind the network.

Dash's governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for the development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group. In addition, the Dash Foundation, which advocates for the adoption of the cryptocurrency, receives donations and offers paid individual and institutional memberships.

# Enjin Coin

**Current Marketcap:** $1,451,651,311

**Current Price:** $1.74

**ATH:** $3.94

**What make them unique?** 

According to co-founder Radomski, Enjin Coin is unique in that every token minted with Enjin Platform, the company's blockchain asset development platform that launched in February 2020, is directly backed by ENJ, giving in-game items real-world liquidity. Similarly, Blagov has stated that the company is focused on adoption, saying he imagines a future in which millions of gamers use digital items backed by Enjin Coin without even knowing it exists.

Enjin Coin uses a series of smart contracts to which game developers send ENJ to mint new, unique fungible or nonfungible ERC-1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, which launched in September 2019, or exchanged for their backing ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, thus making it scarcer.

According to its whitepaper, Enjin Coin uses a series of both on-chain and off-chain processes. When a transaction is completed within the Enjin ecosystem, a Trusted Platform contacts the users' smart wallets, and the website or game is updated immediately with a placeholder or nontradable version of the digital item until the transaction has been validated by the Ethereum blockchain.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Fed Printing Bad, But Tether Printing Good?","Let's talk about double standards.

Stablecoin Tether (USDT) is the third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. It's also the biggest stablecoin on the market. But its popularity doesn't necessarily make it a safe investment. Some of us are very well aware of that. However - the trading volume on Tether indicates that most either don't know, don't understand, or simply don't give a f\*ck.

I'll break it down assuming you don't know what is going on:

The problem with Tether is they are printing unbacked U.S Dollars, sending them to shady unregulated crypto exchanges, then injecting it into many crypto assets, most notably Bitcoin.

They LIED to our face, in 2019 their official website stated: *""Everything Tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency saved on our reserves, so 1 USDT will always be equivalent to 1 USD"".* This statement was changed this year, Tether is essentially backed by 2.9% cash, which is much different from the 100% cash backing they previously claimed. **Unfortunately, the majority of crypto traders are too focused on their desire for the market to go up**, **than to admit the uncomforting truth**, that Tether doesn’t have sufficient reserves and is propping up the entire crypto market with fake money (Sounds familiar? Printer goes brrrrrrrr).

Have I mentioned that Tether at one point only had **13 employees**? That's right. I guess it's easier control them and keep the whistleblowers on check. 

USDT volume often ranges from **50% to 80%**, which is higher than any other crypto on the market. Exchange data clearly shows USDT is mainly fuelling Bitcoin’s price valuation, which is deeply concerning.

Tether printing is the backbone of market growth. In court documents, we saw leaked conversations from top Bitfinex executives which included the admission that *“Bitcoin could tank below $1K if we don’t act quickly”.*

Immediately after NYAG announced its settlement with Tether, Bitcoin lost 25% of its market value in only a few days. When Tether released their questionable pie chart showing the breakdown of their fake reserves, Bitcoin dropped by another 53% and lost over $520 billion in market cap.

**Final thoughts:**

Yes, the market has been looking great these past days, but be advised that ""*Bitcoin's ecosystem does have its ticking time bomb demons*."" ^(Vitalik Buterin on Tether on an interview this year on the Tim Ferriss Show.)

TL;DR If you criticised the Fed for printing money but you keep trading Tether, which has essentially been doing the same, you're a top tier hypocrite.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Fed Officials Weigh Ending Asset Purchases by Mid-2022,"Federal Reserve officials are nearing agreement to begin scaling back their easy money policies in about three months if the economic recovery continues, with some pushing to end their asset-purchase program by the middle of next year.

In recent interviews and public statements, several have advocated for this timetable, which would enable them to raise interest rates sooner than currently anticipated if the economy makes rapid progress toward their goals.

The central bank last December said it would continue the current pace of bond purchases until officials concluded they had achieved “substantial further progress” toward their goals of 2% average inflation and robust employment. Officials at their July 27-28 meeting deliberated on two important questions: when to start paring their monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities, and how quickly to reduce, or taper, them. The Fed is set to release on Wednesday minutes of the meeting that could provide further clues about those discussions.

The answers are important to financial markets because Fed officials have said they would prefer to conclude the bond-buying program before considering when to raise interest rates from near-zero. At their June 15-16 policy meeting, 13 of 18 Fed officials projected they would raise rates by the end of 2023; seven expected to do so by the end of 2022. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a July 28 news conference that the Fed was still “a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It’s not something that is on our radar screen right now.” A recent run of strong hiring reports have strengthened the case for the Fed to announce at its next meeting, Sept. 21-22, its intentions to start tapering, potentially as soon as its following meeting in November.

CryptoCurrency,"We need to have a talk about centralization, what it is and why it's bad.","I read someone a day or two ago saying ""if everyone only uses one crypto, that's the epitome of centralization.""

This is very wrong, and it indicates that some people don't really have any idea about what decentralization even is and why it's a good thing.

Centralization IS NOT a lot of people choosing to do something. Centralization is when ONE person or group can choose what OTHER people do. The greater the ratio of people subjected to the decisions is to decision-makers, the greater the amount of centralization. Decentralization is when every person decides for themselves what to do.

The military is centralized. There's a Commander-in-Chief who ultimately, in that system, can force other people to go fight and kill others even if those other people don't want to.

The US dollar is centralized. There's one group, the Federal Reserve, who can destroy it completely at any time, by printing it into nothing, whether you like it or not. They also can take as much of the value out of your dollar as they want, by printing their own.

The Hollywood studio system is centralized. If you want to make a movie, you have to appeal to a gatekeeper, who, if they approve, then appeals to someone above them, who ultimately appeals to a studio head who say yes or no.

Centralization is inefficient. It allows the ignorance, biases, insanity or other vices of one person to effect or ruin the lives of countless other people.

Centralization is anti-intellectual. It negates the value of education, talent or hard work, in favor of helping those who appeal to the selfish interest or whims of the decision-makers, through politics, nepotism, secret deals, emotional appeals and other nonsense.

Centralization is unethical. It allows the initiation of force on a mass scale, which is a widely-accepted definition of evil.

Centralization is illogical. The justice system falls apart when it accepts centralized systems, because it is unable to assign responsibility for wrongdoing. This was most obvious in the Nuremberg Trials, where German officers and soldiers argued that they shouldn't be punished because they were following the orders of others, or because they only gave orders and didn't perform the act. The court system ended up hanging all of them, which didn't make sense either because soldiers in centralized militaries are threatened with death or criminal charges if they disobey orders, and the courts then tried to argue that soldiers have to ignore unlawful orders, which of course also doesn't work because soldiers can't keep legal handbooks on them in the battlefield. The fundamental error is that the court accepted that that totally centralized system was just in the first place.

Centralization is also unnatural. In the system that evolution created, no one talks, so no one orders anyone around. People observe each other and choose people to partner with or follow as leaders or role models, and they only do what the other person does if it seems to work. Otherwise they leave or do something else. 

By contrast, DECENTRALIZATION allows meritocracy, efficient use of information, and proper responsibility, both in oneself and in judging the actions of others.

A free market is decentralized. It doesn't matter how much money Bill Gates has, he can't take my popsicle from me. He can only offer me things in return, which I may or may not accept.

The internet is decentralized. Open access to audiences and information, in a few decades, have totally outpaced the traditional, centralized studio and media and found thousands of times more talent and content.

Bitcoin and good cryptocurrencies are decentralized. No matter how much Bitcoin someone has, he or she can't PRINT Bitcoin or force other people to do things with it. He or she can only exchange his Bitcoin with others who choose to trade.

If at some point someone could in fact control the verification of transactions, then it would become centralized and fall apart, as long as that can't happen, it is decentralized and decentralization is very, very good.

So let's be clear on this in the future. It's important to what we're all doing.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Buy Manufactured/Modular Home vs. House &amp; Invest Monthly Savings?,"Hello all my Smart Money friends!

My financially disciplined Significant Other &amp; I (good credit) are ready to buy a place of our own! My Main question, is it worth it in the long run to buy a modular home, and place the savings of what we would be paying with a traditional home in an Index Fund instead? There's a lot of factors at play here. 

Please don't respond with the traditional ""House = Appreciating &amp; Manufactured = Depreciating, so buying a House is automatically the best call for your money"" answer. I'm open to all answers so long as I can see the reasoning behind it via the numbers. I'm not opposed against either options at the moment.

**I completely understand that a manufactured home is a depreciating asset that likely would come with lot/land rental fees (unless finding land to purchase on) and a traditional home will appreciate over time.** 

**Scenario:** Roughly 40K Cash available to purchase a Modular Home in Full w/ $400 in monthly lot rent (say this lot rent increases 3% every year), or to take a 20% downpayment + closing cost on a traditional House around 185K on a 30 year Loan at roughly a 3% rate. 

**Factors:**

* GF and I are very money conscious to the point of excel sheeting every purchase no matter how small. Savings vs cost of house *would* be put into an Index Fund - Likely VOOG. 
* Planning to live there the next 10 years.
* Like a car, the highest rate of depreciation on a manufactured home is in their first few years. We would likely purchase a used home built in the early to mid 2000's to limit total depreciation. I've looked all over the internet and can't get a solid % depreciation rate. A few places say 3% but who truly knows. Perhaps I could sell in in 10 years for half at what I bought it?? Having tough time with this.
* Using [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/), for a 30 year mortgage with a 3% Interest Rate, I would pay the $185K principle + 76.6K in total Interest over 30 years with an estimated monthly payment of $907. The first 41K of Interest would come in the first 10 years alone. That's money I won't see back.
* Manufactured Home Utilities cost less due to much more efficient and smaller homes, and water+Sewer+trash is usually covered in lot rent. Home Insurance and Taxes cost less for modular homes as well.

&amp;#x200B;

After 10 years, what's the best money play here? The Savings invested every month, or the better resale value of the actual home?

personalfinance,Wait to refinance or get a heloc?,"I recently quit my job (Jan) and have gone self employed full time. I make more now than I ever did while employed for someone else. I have a company bank account and transfer what I need as needed to myself and maintain a high balance in my company checking account that keeps growing. Recently, I decided to refinance. My current interest rate is 3.75% I can get to 2.75% with enough in lender credits to have no cost for closing. Great deal, but sadly the banks wont give me the time of day even with over 800 credit score and no late payments or any bad marks on my credit. I found a good deal, had my credit pulled and the underwriters declined because I dont have at least 2 years of self employment income. My home is worth $460k, I owe $240k. I want to take out 30k for remodeling. 

I am now realizing that if I didnt claim I was self employed and instead said I work for CloudBear9 LLC I would probably be approved but I am hesitant to continue applying because maybe the brokers I go through would use the same banks/underwriters and they would see that I already applied with different info and am not disclosing that CloudBear9 LLC is my company. Or, my tax returns would show CloudBear9 LLC which I used in the past to lower my taxable burden from my W2 employment by claiming it as a loss. 

Should I instead take out a HELOC to do remodeling or do I end up paying more for that in the long run?  Should I wait a few months and reapply after I have myself on my own payroll a few months? Should I instead start a new company and pay myself from that company which I would set up as an S-Corp and have separate tax returns for compared to my own? Is it stupid to invest so much time in doing that to get 1% interest rate lower and a cash out to do the remodels?",finance

CryptoCurrency,The Bangladesh Bank heist and why your money is not any safer in a bank.,"The Bangladesh Bank robbery, also known colloquially as the Bangladesh Bank cyber heist, was a theft that took place in February 2016. Thirty-five fraudulent instructions were issued by security hackers via the SWIFT network to illegally transfer close to US$1 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York account belonging to Bangladesh Bank. 

The Reserve Bank of New York blocked 30 transactions, yet the rest slipped by. Why? The hackers misspelled foundation as ""fandation"". This is the only reason most of the money was recovered. Yet millions still remain in the hands of hackers. 

The media will scream about how a hacker managed to steal $600 million worth of crypto, yet they will never tell you about the $1 billion they managed to steal from Bangladesh Bank.

Despite insane regulations, bureaucracy and records, banks still are way more unsafe than Crypto. A robber can't steal your money from Crypto. They can from a bank.

personalfinance,Investing for retirement outside 401k and IRA - What are my options?,"Hello everyone! Getting right to it, I'm a 25 year old man attending college on my VA Benefits. Right now I make about $3000 a month through the VA, about half or so gets spent on insurance, rent, bills, etc. My health care is also entirely covered by the VA. I am also unemployed, so I have no option to contribute to a 401k.

When I was in the military I managed invest about $7500 into the Thrift Savings Plan. All of which is in a lifecycle fund for 2045. Lifecycle funds and such appeal to me as they require little maintenance, I'm not particularly dying to become a day trader of stocks or crypto. Honestly I wish I had knew more about finances before I got out, as I would've contributed much more.

In any case, I have about another $40k in a money market savings account, with an APY of 0.45%. This alone is *more* than enough to cover 6 months of expenses. I have an additional $10k in my checking account.

The past two years I have maxed out my roth IRA ($14,600 now) and have plans to continue to do so until I gain a 401k/TSP through an employer. I plan to be employed in two years from now, likely with the federal government.

As for long-term goals, I'd like to buy a house with my wife within a decade or so. Seeing as though I am a veteran, I am eligible for no downpayment. This is further down the line of course, but I'd imagine we'd be looking at houses \~$450k and will perhaps put down a downpayment of some sort. If this is the case, the downpayment would be split evenly between me and my wife.

*I have no outstanding loans or debts.* I've followed the [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) from the FAQ, but I get sort of stumped once I get to the last decision. I'd love to retire early, but am unable to contribute to a 401k or backdoor IRA due to my unemployed.

To my question... Where else should I be allocating my money? The $40k in my MMSA seems excessive and I'd imagine greater returns elsewhere. Would starting a brokerage account be my best option or should I look elsewhere? Any recommendations you guys can make would be greatly appreciated!

If I miss anything in my write up please let me know and I'll be sure to update!

After the lawsuit agains XRP is over (and to be honest, yes i'm a bit biased about XRP), my guess is that they will have settled. So the SEC doesn't lose face, and XRP can continue it's business as usual.
When this happens XRP will be the only token with real clarity about it's legal status and be deemed safe to invest in.
What will come next is the attack on DeFi, and to be clear this is just my hunch (tho, my hunches were spot on for the last 2 years, for real. It's getting scary) and nothing more then a hunch.

But DeFi is the single biggest treath too the status quo. It has the potential to completely disrupt the world as we know it. And especially for this reason the whole ecosystem of DeFi will be slaughtered.

Not to be a dick, or hate on ETH for example. But they aren't in the clear, nothing is. And ETH is going to be the first target. No more small players, just setting precedents for the rest by targeting the friendly giants of the cryptospace.

CryptoCurrency,Anyone Else Worried That The U.S. Fed Reserve’s Coming QE Tapering Plan Is Going To Cause A Crypto Dump?,"My worries are due to the fact that the crypto market is still heavily tied to the stock market. 

Crypto has proven time and time again to be down when the stock market is down and further reinforce this because most price movement upward seems to happen after the stock market closes.

Crypto has also yet to prove itself as a true inflation hedge as its price movement has looked more like a tech growth stock which would then in theory drop in price when interest rates inevitably rise.

We’re in a precarious point of the market right now. We need to break ATHs to prove that the bull market is still alive. If we see a sizable drop in BTC prior to breaking ATHs, traders are more likely to interpret the price action as a macro lower top, leading to a drop below our most recent lows into the $20k range or lower. Which is similar to how the last bull market ended.

CryptoCurrency,How to Scale a Proof of Work Blockchain,"Let’s start with the classic Computer Science parallelization and work from there.

If one Bitcoin blockchain can do 5 transactions per second (using round number approximations for simplicity), two Bitcoin blockchains can do 10 transactions per second, ten blockchains can do 50 tps, etc. But this approach has two major problems:

1. Each of these completely standalone blockchains has a completely different currency. Ten separate currencies…not so great.
2. A 51% attack becomes a 5.1% attack…not good.

Kadena’s Chainweb protocol solves both of these problems by braiding the chains together. For 2 chains, in addition to making each block include the hash of the previous block on the same chain, **you also have it include the hash of the previous block on the other chain**. This means each Chainweb block in a 2-chain network contains one additional hash — i.e. 256 additional bits of information…not bad! But what benefits do we get in exchange?

Well, if you wait one block after your transaction, it will require the full hash power of both chains to do a 51% attack on that block. And the hash braiding gives us the Merkle Tree structure needed to do cross-chain SPV proofs, yielding a single currency across both chains. So now we’ve solved the two major problems, and the cost is only 256 bits (32 bytes) of additional storage per block. But if we scale this up to, say 10 chains, that starts to add up.

If each block in a 10-chain web contains the hashes of the previous block on all other 9 chains, that’s an additional 288 bytes of overhead per block or 2880 bytes per block height — it gets out of hand fast. But there’s hope! It turns out there’s a brilliant result from an obscure branch of math that can save us and solve the Proof of Work scalability problem! Back in Undergraduate Computer Science, we learned a little bit of this arcane branch of math called graph theory. If you didn’t think it was all that interesting, you’re in good company. I didn’t either. But as it turns out it’s just the thing we need to scale blockchains

# Enter Graph Theory

Earlier I mentioned that with two chains, where each chain has the hash of the other chain, we solve both the multiple currency problem and the 5.1% attack problem. If we visualize the way these two chains are connected, it looks like this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/edlg99y0mrh71.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f61d9d9564228d3a64834430ce3af41f166769

We need to scale this up to hundreds or potentially thousands of chains. But first we need to figure out a strategy for how the chains should be connected together. Let’s start with 10 chains and explore a few different strategies. The naïve approach would be to have every chain be connected to every other chain. That would look like the image below.

[Assume a line means that there’s an arrow in each direction.](https://preview.redd.it/e9wqx72ghrh71.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29f0e9e459dc6ea88a94cd37325de0d87932f32f)

As we calculated before, this would use way too much space because we have to store an extra 32 bytes for every line attached to a node. It might be doable with 10 chains, but it definitely would be too much with more chains. We need to reduce the number of edges each node has. We could drop down to just two edges for each node. This reduces our storage requirements, but it has a different problem. It takes 5 hops to get from any chain to the chain that is the farthest away. If we scale this up to 100 chains, that would be **50 hops**.

https://preview.redd.it/10wj5n2hhrh71.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046944d430fb301d125027b834d67bd75a694252

This means that with 100 chains, you would have to wait 50 blocks before it would require 51% of the whole network hash power to attack that block. Even in blockchains like Ethereum with a relatively fast block time, that’s still a long time to wait. That’s also how long it would take to transfer coins from one chain to the farthest chain. So we have a dilemma. We want to minimize **1)** the number of hops it takes to get to the farthest chain, and **2)** the number of chains each chain is connected to.

Here’s where graph theory saves the day. The number of hops is called the **diameter** of the graph. And the number of edges each node has is called the **degree** (assuming they all have the same number, which is fine in this case). This is a well-known problem in graph theory called the **degree diameter problem**! That is the brilliant result that Kadena uses to scale proof of work in what we call the Chainweb protocol.

# How Chainweb Works

Graph theory researchers have been studying the degree diameter problem for a long time. Optimal solutions are very difficult to find for large graphs. But it turns out that we know how to construct solutions that are quite good. Here’s the 10-chain graph that Kadena used at launch. If you examine it closely, you’ll see that every node has three edges (in graph theory parlance, it’s degree 3) and you can get from any node to any other node in at most two hops (diameter 2).

[Kadena’s 10-chain graph configuration   ](https://preview.redd.it/jhauwlaihrh71.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ad42465ce10f4cf9596653184a359ff299fcfce)

This means that we only have to store 3 additional hashes per block and after two blocks you can transfer coins from any chain to any other chain, and you have to have 51% of the entire network hash power to attack any single chain!

On August 20, 2020, the Kadena network forked from 10 chains to 20 chains. The first 10 chains kept all the same coins and smart contracts that they had before, and 10 new chains came into existence. The graph had a new structure, though. Here’s the 20 chain graph. (layer-1 scaling in prod...)

https://preview.redd.it/27r1163tvrh71.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f2a666719e5f773b209c00e188af4217831690

The 20-chain Chainweb graph still has degree three, but it now has diameter 3, so we have to wait 3 blocks after a transaction before the whole network’s hash power is protecting it. The most amazing thing is how much growth potential the degree diameter problem research gives us as we expand beyond 20 chains. Here’s a table that shows the largest known graph size for graphs of **degree d** and **diameter k**.

https://preview.redd.it/hxovul5khrh71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be80bd22b65521251cddfded2e3f4fb5850d5b8b

The above table means that using a chain graph with a degree and diameter of 7, Kadena’s blockchain can scale to more than 50,000 chains! And if we increase the degree and diameter one more to 8, we can get well into the **hundreds of thousands**!

Conclusion.

**Kadena’s Chainweb protocol leverages graph theory research into the degree diameter problem to scale a tried and true proof of work blockchain easily into the realm that we need for the scale of the global financial system**. As Vitalik Buterin has pointed out in the past, “the only solution to high tx fees is scaling”.  As we have learned above, Kadena has solved the scaling problem.

# TLDR:

If one blockchain can do 50 transactions per second, two blockchains can do 100 transactions per second, one hundred blockchains can do 5000 tps, etc. But this approach has two major problems

* 51% attack becomes a 5.1% attack.
* each of these completely standalone blockchains has a completely different currency.

To solve the first problem, you need to braid the chains together. For 2 chains, in addition to making each block include the hash of the previous block on the same chain, you also have it include the hash of the previous block on the other chain.Now this is good and all for small networks, but it can get out of hand pretty fast when you increase the amount of shards/chains, Here’s where graph theory saves the day. The number of hops is called the diameter of the graph. And the number of edges each node has is called the degree. This is a well-known problem in graph theory called the degree diameter problem, That you can connect all chains together via the shortest path. That is what Kadena uses to scale proof of work

To solve the second problem, the hash braiding gives us the Merkle Tree structure needed to do cross-chain SPV proofs, yielding a single currency across both chains. The coin (or any coin for that matter) is also just a smart contract, this means you can use the same method to do 100% safe cross chain operations.

# What benefits does this give us?

**Scalability**

Literally unlimited TPS, not just 10k or 100k or 1M

**Security**

Now since every chain is braided together you have absolutely unparalleled security, doing a 51% attack requires reproducing history up to the common confirmation depth. For Kadena, doing an attack at the very moderate depth of 4 (on average 2 minutes), already requires overcoming all honest hash power on all chains.

**Speed**

Each chain/shard has a 30s blocktime, but there are 20 chains \[currently\] running in parallel, so the network blocktime is 1.5sec (if your dapp is scaled across all chains). Once scaled to, say, 50 chains, the blocktime will drop to sub-second blocktime and a 1000 network would have a blocktime crossnetwork of 0.03 sec

\---

# Personal Opinion

Your first thought should be \*""wait this is working right now? why is no one talking about this?""\*It's because there's 5+ years of nonsense to deprogram, specifically *""POS is the only future""* and we're up against a lot of influencers and ""thought leaders"" that have large vested interests in POS being the only future (despite KDA being evidence to the contrary). So it's gonna take time, because most of the biggest names have a lot to lose by even crediting KDA with shipping sharding.

Crypto should reconsider the *narrative* that they've been fed for the last 5 years. Specifically, that POW is outdated and POS is the only future. KDA is POW and yet it alone has actually shipped a real sharded protocol. Once people get with the idea that *POW works, and KDA fixes its limitations* then we'll see rapid uptake. Until then, I expect a lot of ETH2.0 is the future and Vitalik (who always fails to ship) is the prophet nonsense

Industrial-strength scalability can't be faked. Only Kadena can scale to any load, any sharded PoS system will grind to a halt with enough shards and experience massive security breaches.

Layer-1 scaling is a monumental advancement in crypto that will dramatically increase the capacity for the sector to grow... but it may be that crypto is basically full of crap and doesn't actually need scaling because it'll always be *just hype*. I don't believe it's just hype, I believe crypto is the start of something truly massive and global in scope... but I could be wrong.",cryptocurrency

* 51% attack becomes a 5.1% attack.
* each of these completely standalone blockchains has a completely different currency.

To solve the first problem, you need to braid the chains together. For 2 chains, in addition to making each block include the hash of the previous block on the same chain, you also have it include the hash of the previous block on the other chain.Now this is good and all for small networks, but it can get out of hand pretty fast when you increase the amount of shards/chains, Here’s where graph theory saves the day. The number of hops is called the diameter of the graph. And the number of edges each node has is called the degree. This is a well-known problem in graph theory called the degree diameter problem, That you can connect all chains together via the shortest path. That is what Kadena uses to scale proof of work

To solve the second problem, the hash braiding gives us the Merkle Tree structure needed to do cross-chain SPV proofs, yielding a single currency across both chains. The coin (or any coin for that matter) is also just a smart contract, this means you can use the same method to do 100% safe cross chain operations.

# What benefits does this give us?

**Scalability**

Literally unlimited TPS, not just 10k or 100k or 1M

**Security**

Now since every chain is braided together you have absolutely unparalleled security, doing a 51% attack requires reproducing history up to the common confirmation depth. For Kadena, doing an attack at the very moderate depth of 4 (on average 2 minutes), already requires overcoming all honest hash power on all chains.

**Speed**

Each chain/shard has a 30s blocktime, but there are 20 chains \[currently\] running in parallel, so the network blocktime is 1.5sec (if your dapp is scaled across all chains). Once scaled to, say, 50 chains, the blocktime will drop to sub-second blocktime and a 1000 network would have a blocktime crossnetwork of 0.03 sec

# Personal Opinion

Your first thought should be ""wait this is working right now? why is no one talking about this?"" It's because there's 5+ years of nonsense to deprogram, specifically *""POS is the only future""* and we're up against a lot of influencers and ""thought leaders"" that have large vested interests in POS being the only future (despite KDA being evidence to the contrary). So it's gonna take time, because most of the biggest names have a lot to lose by even crediting KDA with shipping sharding.

Crypto should reconsider the *narrative* that they've been fed for the last 5 years. Specifically, that POW is outdated and POS is the only future. KDA is POW and yet it alone has actually shipped a real sharded protocol. Once people get with the idea that *POW works, and KDA fixes its limitations* then we'll see rapid uptake. Until then, I expect a lot of ETH2.0 is the future and Vitalik (who always fails to ship) is the prophet nonsense

Industrial-strength scalability can't be faked. Only Kadena can scale to any load, any sharded PoS system will grind to a halt with enough shards and experience massive security breaches.

Layer-1 scaling is a monumental advancement in crypto that will dramatically increase the capacity for the sector to grow... but it may be that crypto is basically full of crap and doesn't actually need scaling because it'll always be *just hype*. I don't believe it's just hype, I believe crypto is the start of something truly massive and global in scope... but I could be wrong.",cryptocurrency

I do have a couple kids (16 and 14) that will be starting college in a few years, but I also have some money put away from them as well.

Is it worth trying to invest some of the money or is the margin between whatever interest I get on a loan vs expected return too minimal to be worth the effort/risk?

personalfinance,Saving Account vs. Index Funds,"Hey guys, I'm very green to the stock market and am learning every day but I had a question about Savings accounts vs investing in index funds.

Please explain to me why I should keep some money in a savings account if savings account interest rates aren't enough to keep up with inflation. Yet if I keep money I'd normally keep in a savings account, in a couple of index funds that return higher than inflation and are safe bets for the most part, I'd cover myself for inflation and then just a little bit more.

I know the conventional wisdom is to keep money in savings which is FDIC insured and backed by the treasury but it does seem like I'd be losing money every year if inflation rises.

personalfinance,I'm so tired of having CC debt- but is it a smart move to pay off my credit cards?,"Hi all,

I'm 21 and have about 4 years of credit history, and I was looking to purchase a home soon as homes in my area are in the low 100s and I generally meet the guidelines to take a loan out. However, I was waiting until I get my credit score into a prime spot so I could get the lowest interest rates possible, my credit has recently been hovering in the mid 600s the last year or so. This month my score plummeted very quickly due to very high utilization as I didn't pay off my spending before my statement and now for the first time ever, one of my bureaus have reported an under 600 score (595) which really shook me as that's a huge decline from about 720 from 2 years ago!

I'm really frustrated because this is going to delay my goals for a while, and honestly I'm just considering paying off a large portion of the balance and I'm wondering if anyone has good feedback for me. I've been carrying balances for a long time on CCs and paying a lot in interest but since my money situation has fluctuated a lot in 2020/2021 I preferred to keep my cash instead of draining my accounts to pay off CC.

Here's where I'm at today:

Credit Card 1: $2970 balance, 22.99% APR  
Credit Card 2: $1888 balance, 25.49% APR  
Credit Card 3: $251 balance, 23.99% APR  
Credit Card 4: $2030 balance, 19.99% APR  
Credit Card 5: $10 balance, 22.90% APR  
Credit Card 6: $980 balance, 0% APR

Total Balances: $8,129 out of a $10,600 credit limit. \~81% util

Assets

Bank Accounts: $2880

Securities: $4000

Cash: $795

Total Assets: $7675

I only have minimal savings so not included. I'm low income, just under $1000 monthly. No significant expenses at this time, just existing. So to make a significant dent in my debt, I'd have to drain most of my accounts, I could theoretically live with just my income but I'm not the biggest fan of that idea. However, my utilization is super high and so are my interest rates.

Aside from get utilization down, I'm not sure what the best way is to go about this considering my goals. If anyone can share their perspective I would deeply appreciate it! Thank you!",finance

Finally feel I'm at a place where a house might be attainable for me, but anxious as to whether my financials make sense with this big decision. Been lurking here awhile and reading everything I can. I have a realtor lined up - no knock on him, but was hoping to have an unbiased 'third party' that isn't looking for a nice commission to gut check me.

Market: Dallas/Ft Worth

Income: single person w Gross 84k/yr, up to low 90s if including variable compensation. Solid job, feel like I am pretty settled in DFW and dont plan on moving anymore

Savings: Emergency fund of \~30k and have a house fund currently at 40k. Contributing to the company 401k to get the match as well as an outside ROTH IRA too. I have a 'play account' of individual stocks currently valued at 10k that i could tap into if needed.

Debt: Auto is paid off, no school loans, credit cards are paid on time with a great credit score. Currently renting an apartment for \~900/mo

Ive been hoping to hit that magical 20% down payment, originally a 250k ish house is what I was shooting for but the housing market as we have seen with the housing supply and prices -not as buyer friendly as they once were. I am starting to eye some options up in the 270s and 280s however that means I am falling into the PMI zone and I am not sure how I should feel about that? Then there's all the closing costs and extra stuff too which I try to pretend aren't there but I know they exist and should keep that in mind lol.

I guess my main questions 1) Am I shooting too high in the 280s? 2) Is PMI really the devil some family members have told me? 3) Overall does a house even make sense, as I would like to take advantage of the low interest rates

I appreciate your time - thanks!",finance

I'm also a first-time car-buyer who financed a 2019 Cherokee for an 84-month loan (I know now this was a questionable choice). I have 57 months left on the loan and am looking to refinance. I've been approved, but it's looking to be a tradeoff of priorities, and I wanted advice from ~~the void~~ other people not connected to my life. I have two choices which are less than ideal, but which do offer positives:

A) Stick with my current loan, with an 8.6% interest rate for 57 more months, paying $450 each month. 

B) Refinance at a 4.19% interest rate for 66 months (NINE months longer), paying $384 each month on a higher principle (nearly $2K)--freeing up more money each month for the student loans I have to start paying imminently.

Option A offers the status quo, but with a shorter payoff time. Option B offers more leeway in my monthly budget in case anything happens, or just for me to do more with my money. I also plan to use part of my tax refund (about $500) to pay down the principle on both the student loans and the car loan, alongside savings and investments.

I can afford to pay off my car longer, and feel like refinancing could be good, but I don't know if the tradeoff of having to pay a higher principle for a longer period of time, even with half the interest rate, is the right decision.",finance

personalfinance,Starting my first real job after college,"Hi all,

I graduated college this year and accepted a job offer last week. I had applied for roughly 30 jobs, had 2 phone interviews, and only one moved to have me come in for in-person interviews and ultimately extended a job offer. I grew up in a poor family with a single mom who did not graduate college and start a profession until I was in high school, so I don't have a lot of people in my life to learn these sorts of lessons from. 

The job pays $57k per year. Benefits include medical, vision, and dental insurance, 401k matching up to 5% annually, and ""gain sharing"" of excess budget. 

Student loan debt is my main concern. I have $55k of student loan debt ($15k federal, $40k private). I do not need to start paying off these loans until January 2024 for the federal loans and May 2022 for the private loans, per the loan servicer websites. These dates seem much further than what I've been told they would be, but that's what the servicers are telling me. Obviously, I plan to start paying well before then in order to minimize interest accumulation. My federal loans are about half the interest rate of my private loans. Am I right to think that I should be putting all of my loan payments towards the higher interest private loans until the time comes that I am required to pay on my federal loans?

My next concern is insurance. I am under 26 so I am still covered under my mom's health insurance. However, the insurance company offered by her work is owned by her employer and only operates regionally, and my new home is 1,000 miles away with no in-network providers local to me. I can get comparable coverage through my employer for ~200/month. Is it wise to take this coverage, or would I be better offer paying out-of-network costs through my current insurance? I have no known chronic health issues, although I do wear glasses and am overdue for a new exam. 

My last concern is with the 401k. I want to start saving for my retirement ASAP and take the 5% ""free money"" from the matching, but I do also want to make headway into my loan debt. Should I immediately start contributing 5% to get the matching, or put more towards loans?

Thanks in advance. I'm excited for the opportunity and want to ensure I make the most financially sound moves for myself.",finance

Long time lurker, first time poster. I started looking to purchase a home in April and was pre-approved by two lenders.

I connected with a lender he recommended and I hated the guy -- he talked at me for 40 minutes, tried to push me to seek pre-approval for $100K higher than the budget I gave him and explained things after I interjected to explain I understood them (I get how points/ rebates work).

business,Why starting a business during a pandemic could be a good idea?,"Times we're going through now certainly bring doubts about whether it's worth starting a business now or waiting for better times.

The worldwide pandemic that started in 2019 is now established in the current world and has its influence over every aspect of human life. The fact that entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity to start a business during the covid-19 pandemic, shows that individuals can capitalize on every situation.

We'll share with you the advantages and opportunities that Covid-19 brought to the entrepreneurship sector. In so doing, we didn't mean to deny the damage the virus has caused.

# What are the benefits?

For sure, not every business can succeed during the recession - quite contrary. Our intention isn't to romanticize the recession but to expose reasons why it could be beneficial to initiate a business right now.

The main idea - a business should be relevant to have a promising start. Under the relevance of start-up implies being up to the current challenges and offering a solution to make life easier.

**Necessity brings invention**  
Innovation is the key to the solution people need during the downturn.

The pandemic illustrates how creative humans are. Such adaptability fascinates and encourages more and more people to start businesses. Even though the idea you want to follow exists already, you can be innovative while delivering and developing your business.

**Less competition**  
It's kind of taking advantage out of disadvantage, but it's a fact that due to the sad story ends of many businesses, there's less competition on the market. Whether you decide to make a good start for your idea or thinking of re-entering the market - it's the time.

**Funding opportunities**  
During the recession, funding becomes more accessible as interest rates become lower. It may sound illogical, but it's an excellent time to look for funding.

Also considering the current business environment, negotiating for lower cost and better conditions is more appropriate than ever.

# What are promising industries?

**Tech**  
Tech or contactless tech is the primary field for investing at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. The virus affected human's perception of communication and interaction. As many shops and catering places went trading online, more and more potential opportunities appear.

**Crypto**  
It's unfair to say that Covid-19 facilitated the rise of cryptocurrency businesses. Better to say, so far, the pandemic didn't affect the crypto industry. The flow of time and tech progress strengthens cryptocurrency's position by natural causes.

Being 100% online-based industry, cryptocurrency is promising more than ever now. However, if you decide to build a crypto business, it's crucial to evaluate the risks and consult professionals.

**Going online**  
IT businesses are still as relevant as they were during the past decades. Furthermore, Coronavirus compelled even no fans of technologies to use online services, thereby creating an absolute online necessity.

When everything moves online, it's more than enterprising to invest in the 'online industry'. More likely, when the pandemic is over, the usage of machines continues to increase rather than decrease as humanity strives for comfort.",finance

15. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

16. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

22. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

37. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
38. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

39. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
40. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
41. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
42. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

43. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

48. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

54. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

56. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

75. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC.

78. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
79. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

80. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

81. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

CryptoCurrency,Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi,"DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.**Lending and Borrowing**Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.**Interest Rates**One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:(1) Zero-coupon bond.(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.**TLDR:**

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Auto pre-approval question,"Long story short, I am buying a new car, and I need to know when my CU will ask for POI, if at all.
 
About me: Young, never purchased my own car, 725 FICO credit score, only trying to finance 12k of a 26k new car. Rest will be down-payment. Make roughly 4000 a month, but only started this recently. Am self-employed (gig-economy, not going to be using new car for work). 
 
I was recently pre-approved with Navy Federal for a $12,000 auto loan, 2.69% APR for 60 months. Sounds fair enough to me. However, they never asked for POI during this process, and sent me a pre-approval ""draft""/check that I just fill in with the dealer, and then they call NFCU to get a pin to process the check. They keep telling me the only reason the check would be denied is if the car doesn't fit the terms (it does), but others are telling me the check will never be approved since I'm self-employed and work in the gig economy...
 
A lot of people are telling me that once the dealer tries to cash the check, that is when NFCU will actually start reviewing my financials and ask for POI, etc. I do make $4000 a month, but I was unemployed for 2-3 months before this.. so I'm hoping NFCU won't ask for POI.
 
Does anyone have any insight -- do credit unions need POI when you try to use your pre-approval at the dealership? Is it common for credit unions to deny a pre-approval check?
 
TLDR People are trying to tell me that my pre-approval check will be denied or my credit unionwill only start reviewing my loan application once I try to use the check.
 
I feel like that is incorrect and they already reviewed my finances.. wouldn't they have already asked for POI if they needed it?",finance
personalfinance,2nd House Mortgage/Investment,"Background information: I live in Australia and have a mortgage on my house. Looking for my 2nd house to live in. Current house will be the investment house where I'll eventually rent it out. I am current paying principle and interest on my mortgage. Monthly repayment on this mortgage is $1400

My house estimated value is $540k and current loan remaining is $330k. Here are some maths which I believe I calculated correctly. 

- 80%LVR of $540k = $432k
- $432k - $330k = $102k

I currently have $102k equity available

Now for my 2nd property, I wish to buy a property of value around $650k. To achieve 20% deposit, I will need $130k. Assuming I have that amount and working off an interest rate of 2.34% for a 30 year term, doing principle and interest, I would need a 520k loan amount. That would result in me having to do weekly repayments of $464 ($2012 monthly) 

Meaning my current property which I already have a mortgage, I will need to have a tenant who pays a minimum of $464 or more to positive gear. 

Questions:
1. First, are my calculations correct? 

2. I would be paying 2 principle and interests mortgages. Should the one I'm living in right now be changed so that I only pay interest as that would be the investment property? 

3. Obviously the more equity I have, the less repayment I would be required to pay. What equity should I be working towards to be considered 'safe'? 

4. Is there any other information I should be aware of or something which I missed?

CryptoCurrency,HODL or miss out,"I've been investing in Crypto since 2015. Been through ups and downs and have missed-out on a lot of gains in the process. What I've learned is the following.

&amp;nbsp;

**Crypto is very resilient**

No matter how many hacks, government regulators, shills, etc... it keeps coming back. Why? The technology makes sense. It may not make sense as a form of payment in the near-term, but it's only a matter of time before a breakthrough makes it legitimate competition to credit card companies.

&amp;nbsp;

**People hate ""the man""**

People don't trust the government, or how they're managing the money supply. They would rather people control it, and allow market economics to maintain equilibrium. No increasing the deficit by printing more money to pay back loans, no increasing or decreasing interest rates to slow or speed-up the economy. We all want to control our own destinies.

&amp;nbsp;

**FOMO**

Everyone wants to get rich quick, and there's stories every day about shitcoins making people millions. With governments, banks, and tech companies jumping on-board the crypto train, the fomo is starting to build legitimacy for crypto as a store of value, source of record, or meme monetization.

&amp;nbsp;

The use-cases are there, the tech just needs to catch-up to support it. It's currently a technology in search of a problem to solve. Once it solves a real problem at scale the skies the limit.

So HODL or miss out, and kick yourself 10 years from now for the Lambo hovercar you paper handed out of today.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Not a fan of Dogecoin, BUT: Mass adoption would be the ultimate fuck you to Banks and FIAT","No, I don’t own any Dogecoin, so I’m not shilling this coin obviously. However I’ve been thinking a lot about why it’s so popular, and with the Cuban and Musk comments it made me think even more about this:

Here are most of us hoping for FIAT and/or the current banking/financial system etc. to be replaced by projects with great utility that could revolutionize the entire global financial market, constantly improving technology etc., because we think it’s going to take a giant to stand up to the financial elites in this world.

Chainlink,What exactly is the role of Oracles like Chainlink in decentralized insurance?,"I am from the insurance industry, and I'm trying to understand if there's any value that blockchains and smart contracts can provide in this domain. I'm trying to understand things at the conceptual level, purely from an eagle's eye point of view, at the moment.

Let's take a simple example of automating life insurance **underwriting** and **claims**.

* For underwriting, I can collect data from the person about their health ***if*** they agree to wear some kind of sensors, like a smartwatch for example, that can provide the insurer with the insuree's data, based on which they can calculate how much premium should this person pay.
* For claims, I guess somebody would need to make a public database where the insuree would need to register and, again, agree to wear a smartwatch that can monitor if the person is dead or alive. And hopefully, the database is updated real-time, or at least every few hours, so that the smart contract is triggered if the person dies and their insurance claim is disbursed to the nominee.

***Where do Oracle networks come into this?*** I ask this because I've been doing some reading, and Chainlink always comes up in the articles as a way to do this. However, as I've described above, from my vantage point it seems like you only need a smart device and a database (that can be accessed in the form of an API or a website), from which the data can be fed to the smart contract. Or, is it that there's no simple way to feed this data into the smart contract, and that's what Oracles do? In other words, are Oracles simply an adapter for feeding real-world data into a blockchain? If so, then what are the advantages of using smart contracts to do this, as opposed to a ""normal"" system where the data from the smartwatch and the database are fed directly to a regular old if-else script written in Python, C, etc?

Also, if I understand correctly, the whole point of oracles is that there should be multiple data sources and they should be decentralized, right? The correct data is then taken from some kind of consensus mechanism (like, majority vote, as the simplest example). So, in the above use case, ***how can there be multiple data sources, for both underwriting and claims, and how can these be decentralized?*** Because the way I see it, there is only one data source - the smartwatch for underwriting, and the public death-records database for the claims.

Not to mention the elephant in the room, that is if a person does not agree to wear a smartwatch, then what ***can*** be a reliable data source by which the person can be underwritten?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,What is your most controversial opinion about crypto that others are likley to disagree with?,"Mine is that, there is nothing wrong with taking out a personal loan to invest in crypto, especially with interest rates the way they are at the moment.

CryptoCurrency,Don’t keep your emergency savings in stablecoins,"Your emergency fund is that money you set aside for unexpected expenses or a loss of a job. Especially if you are living near paycheck to paycheck, it is important to have a bit of a safety net lined up.

Bank interest rates are ridiculously low. It is crazy that a bank offers near 0% and in the crypto world you can easily get 10-12% returns. The big difference is that banks give you FDIC insurance. That money is going to be safe. 

Stablecoins have risk. They could fall off peg and collapse. There could be a hack and you lose it all. The largest stablecoin, Tether, disclosed that its holdings “include loans to unaffiliated entities (12.55%).” With a true emergency fund it’s important to avoid risk. 

If your savings is a pool of cash that you just build up for fun stuff. Then sure. Take advantage of the crypto space. Screw those banks and their garbage interest rates. Just don’t risk your emergency fund if it is money that you truly might need.",cryptocurrency

Anyways looking to reduce our monthly expenses a bit and decided refinancing would be a good idea. To get our DTI down to 40% the bank wants us to pay off about 50k in debt (4.5% auto loan and 5.9% RV loan plus 2 smaller private student loans), then wrap two higher interest rate private student loans $28k total into our new mortgage. Overall this reduces our net financial burden by $1500ish a month. We have about $105k in the bank currently, but it is our first time ever above 100k so really struggling with the idea of taking 50k out and cutting our savings in half.

I think I need a bit of a reality check because I keep telling myself this is a good decision overall, I also feel a bit paralyzed by making such a big move. I am so super afraid of what this will do to my credit to have 3 major accounts and my current mortgage wiped clean. My current score is an 815 and I'm guessing it will drop a ton if I do this?

2. Cash-Out Refinance Primary -  I can refinance my primary residence.  I'm at 2.8%.  The refinance would put me around 2.9%, but I'd have to pay around $3,000 in fees.  I just refinanced to 2.8% last year, so I hate to do it again.  Also, the fees are too much for this to make sense.
3. Cash-Out Brokerage.  I have $50K in cash, so would only need to cash out about $30K to cover the mortgage and have a few grand left over for emergency fund.  I'm looking at $1500 in LT Cap gains if I go this route.
4. HELOC on Primary.  I just started looking at this option.  I believe I can get 3.25% variable APR that is fixed for 5 years.  It appears there aren't many fees either.  If I pay it off over 5 years, I'm looking at $1,320/mo.  The house rents at $1,200/mo currently.
5. Just continue to pay down the loan aggressively.  I'm looking at payoff within a few years.

economy,Media a Silent Cog in the Deep State’s Military Wheel,"# Media a Silent Cog in the Deep State’s Military Wheel

Google, Twitter, Facebook, et al. raced ahead with innovations that brought them millions of customers. They provided the equivalent of an “open mic,” where anyone could sing any tune he wanted. Then, they sold the info to advertisers, who used it to find customers of their own.

But then, the tech companies decided to impose their own musical tastes. If they think you’re off-key, you’ll be [canceled](https://click.exct.bonnerandpartners.com/?qs=835c9d56f07a37b3c6893e3bec73d43d34f9b3d18dabc9454816bb2380eead6e2f55992b9e8229146dc3e665629d04cc8beff906c9542944), deplatformed, and disappeared.

It happened, famously, to [Donald Trump](https://click.exct.bonnerandpartners.com/?qs=835c9d56f07a37b37f039d868ba3593e7b349ab3574cc3da4f6a9979cecdd36672edd3970fba98b9273a9f5a897e477f352b65e4ee7e55d1). The ex-president is, of course, a moron. And private companies can cut him off if they want.

But if Twitter took down the accounts of every moron who can’t carry a tune, it would be out of business.

Instead, the social media companies just cut off some morons… not all of them. And therein hangs a tale…

# Political Business

As politics become more important, private companies become more political. That is, when a country’s elite goes mad, its private sector goes mad, too.

Just try opening a bank account.

First, there are fewer local or regional banks; the smaller ones have been less and less able to survive in the world of complex federal control.

Second, the big banks that are left act more like chartered, federal monopolies. They don’t give you a toaster anymore. They give you a grilling…

Who are you? Can you prove where you live? Where did your money come from?

And then, thanks to the Federal Reserve, you put money on deposit and the banks don’t pay you any interest.

ValuePenguin, whatever that is, tells us that the average rate of interest on savings accounts is 0.06%. At [today’s inflation rate](https://click.exct.bonnerandpartners.com/?qs=835c9d56f07a37b32899a2e653635aae11a5ced12b2323b53e20f3a05727233dcc03712caf45213388827eb9f165bd05cb12eeb7053ac423), a saver loses over 5% per year.

The big banks get their money from the Fed. They are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Naturally, they lick the hand of their masters whenever it is offered.

# Dutiful Media

Is it any different for the media?

You may expect the banks, heavy industry, military suppliers, and Wall Street to collaborate with their biggest customer. Always and everywhere, capitalists do what they have to do. They adapt to whatever politics they confront. 

In Hitler’s Germany, for example, IG Farben, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Kodak – all were eager suppliers to the Nazi regime. Hugo Boss even made its uniforms.

Even in the stalags of the Third Reich and the gulags of the Soviet Union, capitalists did the best they could with what they had to work with.

What is surprising is how eagerly the press wags its tail.

After our disgraceful defeat in Afghanistan, for example, you’d think the American press would be blasting the knuckleheads who got us into it – the generals… the think-tank war boosters… the private sector profiteers, who made billions from aiding and abetting the military’s boondoggle.

You’d think the media would be howling for the heads of them all… including retired General David Petraeus (who led U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and subsequently headed up the CIA) and G. W. Bush himself.

They lied. They blundered. They wasted trillions of dollars and have the blood of thousands of people on their hands.

But if you want to understand what happened – beyond the usual “mistakes were made” excuses – don’t expect to find it in the major U.S. media.

# Celebrated, not Canceled

Here’s Sri Lankan “social theorist,” Indi Samarajiva:

&gt;The American war on Afghanistan was a $2.26 trillion scam. Somebody pocketed all that money, and it certainly wasn’t the people of Afghanistan. That amount is *115 years* of Afghan GDP, and it mostly went to arms dealers, the corrupt US military, and corrupt US politicians. Meanwhile the Taliban gets to keep the weapons. This wasn’t just a waste, it was a gigantic *fraud*.

Shouldn’t the people responsible for this scam at least be put in prison? Better yet, shouldn’t a gallows be set up on the Capitol mall… and Petraeus and Bush hung… to serve as a proper warning to the next group of warmongers?

Instead, the people responsible for the war now sit on the boards of Raytheon and Boeing. They advise the nation on “defense” issues and live in their mansions in Northern Virginia… as if they have nothing to be ashamed of.

# Media Silence

A cop killed George Floyd, and the media went bananas.

In Afghanistan, U.S. soldiers killed thousands. Where is the press? Where are the demands for justice? Where are the investigations – what did they know? When did they know it? And how much money did they make on the affairs? 

Silence.

How come? Because the media were in on the game from the beginning.

Dan Cohen, in *Behind the Headlines*:

&gt;Imagine a country where there’s no separation between the government, the military, and the media. A lot of Americans would think of China, Russia or North Korea, but it’s a perfect description of the United States today.

When you read the news, you may think you’re getting the lowdown from an unbiased source. Often, what you are really getting is a press release from the U.S. government filtered through a toady “reporter.”

# Special Access

**Here’s how it works…**

A “Think Tank” is created, such as the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). It takes in millions of dollars from the defense industry, oil companies, big banks, and foreign governments.

Then, it gives “residencies” to reporters, from *The Washington Post*, for example, who follow defense issues and are granted special “access” to the Pentagon.

Naturally, the reporters are very sympathetic to the defense industry… and to the government and all its works.

They are not objective observers of the Deep State’s military wing; they are part of it.

And Facebook, Twitter, and Google? What role do they play?

CryptoCurrency,"Brent Donnelly, ""gold is underperforming because Bitcoin is becoming a competitor to gold."" Sees Bitcoin as the new gold for traders: Gold has $7.5T Market Cap","Author and professional trader Brent Donnelly was on the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast last week. He is not a crypto person or crytpo trader but is very well known and respected in the trading world. He was asked about Bitcoin and stated around the 37:30 mark that ""Bitcoin is slowly becoming a pretty good proxy for the whole dollar debasement and fed liquidity trade. ... It does look to me like there is a pretty clear substitution effect between gold and Bitcoin where gold is underperforming because Bitcoin is becoming a competitor to gold. ... Some people might believe that and some might not, but it doesn't really matter if you don't believe that as 38% of people do and buy Bitcoin instead of gold to hedge.""

The reason why this is huge is that gold is about a $7.5 trillion market. If BTC were to become gold that would put it at around the $500k value range. It's unlikely BTC fully replaces gold, but this just shows how much more room there is to grow in the crypto space. I think that as all cryptos begin to replace and be viewed as sound growign technology, traditional investment holdings, risk management techniques, investment growth opportunities, etc. in the eyes of traditional professional traders and investors like Mr. Donnelly this will create huge growth in the crypto space.

Edit: some are saying gold market cap may be more like $10T or more. I think it depends on whether you include just all refined physical gold or gold plus gold related ETFs plus unmined or something. I'm not a gold expert. If it's $10T+ that's even better news for Bitcoin and crypto. Main point is Crypto is still small relative to other asset classes that it will slowly replace.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 17, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**

Stocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. 

Shares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. 

According to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. 

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. 

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.

CryptoCurrency,Story Time: When I got admitted to the psych ward 🧠,"So the other day I wanted to try to sell some of my m00ns. Paper handed bitch, I know… Within a matter of 5 minutes I had received Stellar Lumens on my Binance account and changed them into ADA. Amazing.

Nonetheless, I wanted to share this experience with my GF.

The first thing I did was to tell her about this cryptocurrency names Moons. They are rewards for contributing (a.k.a. shitposting) to a subreddit. 

- She looked at me like I was from another planet.

I moved on an told her about my Stellar Lumen (XML) address and memo on an exchange called Binance. 

- Now her weird look had changed into pure confusion. Moons and Stellar Lumens?!

So. I was on a roll. I told her how I had easily converted the XMLs into another project I believe in, Cardono, or ADA, to keep it in the cryptocurrency slang.

- Now she stood there with her phone out ready to call for backup, because I was obviously going insane. 

I went on to tell her, that it wasn’t over yet. Because on Binance, I afterwards went ahead and stacked my newly received ADA next to my current bag of VET. This would leave me with great interest rates. 

- This is when she admitted me to the psych ward. When she admitted me, I remember her saying to the doctor receiving me: “Doctor, you got to do something. Fast.

In a nutshell they are going to give me a dataset tomorrow that I have to go through and prepare a presentation on by next. Once I get the dataset I have 24 hours to analyze it and pick it apart. Now I have monitored live networks before as well as sniffed packets and the like but, I have no idea what will be in this dataset and I am unsure which tools to brush up on? The bulk of my hands on experience is with FTK and Kali Linux. 

What type of presentation are they going to want? Do the want a cheesy PowerPoint or a legit looking document along the lines of a cyber forensic report?

What specifics are they looking for?

Are there any resources with similar datasets to the one I might receive that I could practice on?

This opportunity came through a recruiter and his knowledge about the details were limited. I don't know if this type of interview process is normal. I am not sure if I'm overthinking this but I just don't want to mess it up. Any help or advice would be very appreciated.",technology
personalfinance,Pay for car in full or get a loan?,"I am looking at getting a newer car in the future, one with much better gas mileage for my new job which is further away. I have diligently saved for many years and can pay in full for the price range I am looking at. I am wondering if it is better to walk into a dealership being able to pay in full, or do a loan? I am prior military, so will be able to use USAA or Navy Fed, and interest rates are low now. 

I am mainly wondering if I will be able to better negotiate the price if I tell them if I can pay in full, but also wondering if that means I would lose any bargaining power in the future with maintenance issues/warranty. 

My biggest issue with cars is reliability....I prefer ones that aren't fancy, but are just solid and dependable, that will last me many years without needing much maintenance/upkeep. I prefer not to deal with dealerships more than I have to, have not had great experiences and don't want to get screwed over if they know I can pay in full. I don't mind doing a loan, because I know I can pay it off, if that is the better option.

Any advice welcomed, thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"Wife's student loans went to collections, and I can't find a personal loan to pay it","Hi everyone.  

So it's a very long story, but my wife has about $88k in private student loan debt (not including federal).  About 7 years ago she tried to consolidate, and the lawyer screwed her over royally and it ended up in default (4 loans total). 

7 years later, she only has 2 loans left with a balance of $88k.  She's been making payments monthly for 7 years at a fixed rate based on her income.  She's had the loans for practically 15 years.  In fact she owes almost double today what the loans were actually for due to interest.. (around $45k).  Well yesterday we get a call that the loans are now in collections and they're willing to settle if we come up with $53k essentially today.  We called the lawyers involved and the loans were indeed sent to collections.  We had no clue why, but apparently the settled amount she has been paying is no longer good enough, and instead of telling us, it's in collections and we have to pay fully now.  They said with how little she was paying that the loan was never going to be paid off... We managed to talk them down to $47K if I can get the money this week.

Her credit is garbage, that's what happens when you have 4 student loans defaulted.  we thought we were in the clear with this but they told us it just went back into default....so we worked for 7 years to fix her credit, and just when it was all about to go away they hit us with this....

My credit is good however and I have a decent enough job that I can afford to take out a personal loan and have her pay me back.  Her job barely pays her minimum wage so the loan is fully relying on me.

Here's the kicker.  I've tried to apply to about 10 places, and NO ONE will give me a personal loan for this.... I explained that I am gifting her the money to pay collections for the loan debt.  But everyone claims that because they were AT ONE POINT, student loans, that I cannot take out a personal loan for this reason...

I have tried Lightstream (my best hope and best rates), Wells Fargo, SoFi, Upgrade, Best Egg, Capital One, Chase, Education Loan Finance, etc, anywhere I could think of.  But it's the same story everywhere.  OH SURE WE'LL GIVE YOU A LOAN, OH WAIT IS IT TO PAY OFF A STUDENT LOAN? NOPE.  

The only places I had a little success is Yrefy and Best Egg.  Yrefy however says they do not accept the payout offer of 47K, and will have to refinance the loan at the full $88k for 10 years.  This is about $920 a month....ridiculous.  Best egg said they could do it and they didn't care it was student loans, but they only do 5 year repayment and they were charging us $2500 for the loan, so it would be $1000 a month for 5 years... We can't afford this.  We were hoping for around the $700 range, which Lightstream was offering for 7 years...but they denied my loan because they considered it for student loans even though I explained we're paying off a debt collector.

We also tried to apply for a student loan refinance loan...but they wouldn't let me take it out in my name because I'm not on the student loans.  So they're like she has to apply.  Well her credit is crap, she can't get a loan, shocker...

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, I turn to you, because I am out of options.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know of any place else I can check to get a personal loan quick??  I need to essentially come up with $47k by the end of the week....I never thought it would be this hard to just open up a personal loan, get cash, and pay it back monthly.  This has been absolutely ridiculous....

&amp;#x200B;

.....also our pet died today...yeah that's how my day is going.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Save and pay for (new) used car outright or pay down mortgage?,"So my wife and I are both financially responsible and are planning on upsizing the older of our two Corollas to match our new family growth, and I'm thinking about the best way to do so.

In between the two of us, we make around 100k/yr, and have about that amount remaining on our mortgage @ 3.75%. (We looked at refinancing, but with a plan to move in 1-3 years, the savings weren't really worth the closing costs.) We have more than enough cash to purchase a car (estimated 15k) outright, but are planning on saving 1.25k/month (via envelope method) to be ready to purchase it in about a year. Alternatively, my wife is confident we could finance it for less that 3.5%.

My thought is why accumulate 15k over the next year to avoid financing a purchase that we could potentially get for a lower rate than a larger debt, and we would be better off paying that 1.25k/month into our mortgage (which is our highest interest debt). Sure, we would add that amount of debt in a year, but at a lower interest rate and the extra principle we pay off our mortgage will continue to pay dividends until we move without any extra costs. 

Am I missing anything major? I get this motion hinges on us being able to get a car loan at around the same or lower than 3.75%, which is not a guarantee nor is there any guarantee of a change in our financial situation, but it seems like a good idea to me.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Russian Power Provider to Debut Blockchain-powered Sales Platform in 2022,"A largely state-run Russian energy firm is set to launch an energy buying platform that makes use of blockchain technology – but is seeking help from the private sector to carry out its plans.

Per Cnet, the project is the brainchild of the largest energy sales provider in Kaliningrad and the surrounding region. The company is named Yantarenergosbyt, and is a subsidiary of the energy giant Rosseti – a firm that is 88% owned by the government’s Federal Agency for State Property Management (a division of the Ministry of Economic Development).

Yantarenergosbyt is seeking a private contractor to help it build the platform, which will automatically register new customers to a new retail electricity market, create smart contract-powered energy supply contracts and relay information to energy industry supervisory authorities.

CryptoCurrency,How would Paying Loans in Crypto Work?,"I had a bit of a question. I've been seeing a lot of news about places allowing Mortgages to be paid with crypto. One question I had is how they measure your payment. The cost of crypto fluctuates, but the amount you owe generally increases with the interest rate. So if you were to pay 10$ of crypto towards your loan, and the price of that crypto were to double to $20, would you now owe 10$ less than what you did before? Or would the loaner charge based on a set initial amount. For example if your loan cost 100 coins of x crypto at the beginning, than you would owe 100 coins no matter the price (which seems a lot less likely). Would appreciate any insight fellow Reddiots c;",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I'm moving from New York to Florida tomorrow. Would I still pay income tax on capital gains I realize between tomorrow and December 31st?,"\*\*I'm referring to New York State income tax. I know I'll still owe federal taxes!

I'm sitting on a substantial amount of unrealized gains (i.e. I have not sold them yet). I'm intending to move to Florida very soon where there is no income tax. Just wanted to know if I'd get screwed over taxwise if I happened to sell them before January 1st 2022.

Since it's already August and I've lived in New York the whole time so far this year (more than 183 day), does that mean all income I incur in 2021 (even after I leave New York for good) is still taxable in New York?

Or would the 183 day rule only apply starting when I declare myself a Florida resident?",finance

Intro to Personal Finance

-	Be Goal orientated
-	Have short/intermediate/long term goals and how you are going to accomplish them
-	Short term = 1-3 years. Intermediate 3-7 years. Long 7-10+ years.
-	Most Americans live beyond their means. Don&amp;#39;t be like this.
-	Spend less than you earn. Live beneath your means. Pay yourself first.
-	Pay yourself first – easy to do because it is automatic and works like a pay raise but in reverse and you get adjusted to the lower amount. 10% is a reasonable goal.
-	The most important financial decision you will make. Who you marry……
-	Saving is easier than budgeting. Budgeting tends to fail likes diets.
-	Less than 1% chance you get audited. And most audits are for math errors.
-	If you claim large or unusual deductions, you are more likely to be audited
-	Home mortgage interest doesn&amp;#39;t help much with lower income brackets. Once your income reaches middle to upper middle incomes, then a home is a much better tax break. Should you buy a home?? Yes. Should you buy a home for the tax break…. Not really.
-	Don&amp;#39;t keep a balance on the CC.
-	Home/Higher Education are good debts.
-	75% of Co-Signers end up paying the loan. Do NOT Co-Sign loans.
-	For every $2 spent, you must earn $3 or $4 depending on your tax bracket. A dollar saved is 2 dollars earned
-	Median age of Millionaires is 57 years old
  - Most are married and NOT divorced
  - 80% are 1st generation
  - Most invest at least 15% of their income
  - Having a high income is not a pre-request for being a millionaire. You must be frugal and invest wisely.
  - If you never learn to be happy with what you have, you will never be happy. Your wants will always outweigh what you have. And if you do become a millionaire, you will still have the same problem.
-	Shopping can be an addiction
-	You are NOT what you drive
-	You are more likely to spend more over the long-term leasing rather than buying
-	Most cars lose 65% of their value in 5 years.
-	Buy a reliable new or used car and run it into the ground. This allows you to invest the difference.
-	A house is a home first and an investment 2nd.
-	Insurance – A necessary evil
  - Protection against possible loss
  - Ask yourself, how much could I lose? If the answer is &amp;quot;plenty&amp;quot; then you need insurance
  - Buy term insurance and invest the rest. Don&amp;#39;t buy whole life insurance
  - Insurance is insurance and investments are investments. Don&amp;#39;t mix those
  - If people depend on your income, then you need life insurance. If they don&amp;#39;t, you don&amp;#39;t need it
  - Do not buy life insurance for a child
  - Young married couples or single parents with children almost always need life insurance
  - Buy life insurance at 10x your income. Example – 50K income needs 500k term life
  - Don&amp;#39;t need credit life insurance or accidental death. Very expensive
-	Stocks – great long-term investment. You are a part owner in a business. Have averaged 8-10%. Stock are volatile and do go up and down. Be prudent and patient.
-	Bonds – good intermediate/long term investment. You are a lender to corporation/government. Have averaged 4-8%. Less volatile than stocks but have lower average return.
-	Cash/Savings Accounts – good for the short term. Safety of principal. Have averaged 2-4%. Inflation can eat away your returns
-	Annuities – bad investment. Average 2-6% and have VERY HIGH commissions. Don&amp;#39;t invest in these.
-	Real Estate – difficult to deal with home maintenance, renters, etc. Low liquidity. But has a return. Most people only have their home as a real estate investment. This isn&amp;#39;t for everyone. Has historically returned less than stocks. 6-8% return
-	If you have a long-term horizon – buy high quality stocks. Intermediate term horizon – bonds and REITS are good choices. If you have a short-term horizon – then cash equivalents are your only choice or very short-term bonds.
-	Individual bonds are usually traded in 10k increments. Very hard for individual investors to buy bonds. Unless you are buying them directly from the US Treasury.
-	How to pick a Mutual Fund
  - Invest in high quality stocks or bonds
  - Well diversified across many classes of investments and countries. Diversification is good.
  - Long term horizon and don&amp;#39;t shuffle its advisers every few years
-	After you have a solid foundation. You can get a &amp;quot;Vegas Fund&amp;quot; started. No more than 5-10% of your portfolio should be in this.
-	Major types of Stock Mutual Fund classifications – most risky to least risky
  - Aggressive growth – very risky and volatile
  - Growth Funds – invest in growth companies. Companies growing their earnings.
  - Capital Appreciation – they can invest in growth companies AND things like turnarounds if they think they can make money. They are like growth companies but they have more flexibility in what they can invest in.
  - Growth and Income – blend of growth and dividend companies. AKA - Value or Blend funds. Growth does good in bull markets and you have downside protection from the dividend companies during a bear market.
  - Equity – prioritize dividend paying companies
  - Regional – only invest in a specific area. IE – Latin America, Japan, etc.
  - Sector – only invest in a specific sector. IE – Oil, technology, etc.

    - Within these funds they have different capitalization and domesticity – least to most risky
      - Large - 10+ Billion
      - Mid – 2-10 Billion
      - Small – 500 Million to 2 Billion

      - Domestic – only invest in US
      - Global – invest everywhere
      - International – invest only outside the US
-	Bond Funds – most to least risky
  - Junk – AKA high yield bond funds
  - Corporate
  - Municipal – tax exempt. Good for investors in a high tax bracket
  - US backed bonds – IE - Fannie Mae
  - US treasuries
    - Duration – longer duration is risker than shorter duration. Interest rate risk
      - Long
      - Intermediate
      - Short
    - Area – same as stocks
      - Domestic
      - Global
      - International
-	Balanced Funds
  - Invest in both stocks and bonds. 50/50
-	Asset Allocation Funds
  - Invest in stocks and bonds. But they have different percent for each. Might be 60/40 or 25/75, etc.
-	Money Market Mutual Funds
  - Kind of like a checking account
-	Life Cycle Funds – AKA - target date funds. Fund of Funds
  - Select a retirement date and the fund allocates for you. One stop shop
-	REIT fund
  - Invest in real estate like office building, homes, etc.
-	Index funds
  - Passive management
  - Track an index – IE - S&amp;amp;P 500
  - Usually have lower expenses. Many active mutual funds don&amp;#39;t beat the index.

They have a built-in problem. They are forced to buy high if a stock is going up to keep the index correct. The same thing on the way down. They are forced to sell a company.",finance
personalfinance,Intro into Investments by Professor Frank Paiano,"Intro into Investments by Professor Frank Paiano

- Must know your time horizon for investments
  - Short Term Investments – 1 year or less
  - Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years
  - Long Term Investments – 5 plus years
- Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?
- Don&amp;#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&amp;#39;t get
- Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)
- Stocks – you are the owner
- Bonds – you are the bank
- Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.
- Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf
- Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)
  - Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next
  - Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &amp;quot;bell curve&amp;quot;
  - The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return
- Don&amp;#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose
- Don&amp;#39;t speculate
- Do NOT invest in an annuity
- Short Term Investments - Cash
  - 1 year or less
  - Usually Guaranteed
  - Very liquid
  - Low Risk-Low Return
  - Good place for emergency fund
  - Can lose purchasing power if they don&amp;#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&amp;#39;t
    - Common types
  - Savings accounts – stated rate of interest
  - Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.
  - Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation
  - Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity
  - Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&amp;#39;t stop them
  - Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem
- Mutual Funds
  - Choose a family, not a fund
  - Professional money management and diversification
  - DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&amp;#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.
  - Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!
  - Keep a long-term horizon and DCA
  - Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&amp;#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.
  - Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.
  - PITA (Pain in the A\*\*) factor is low
  - Fees
    - Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value
    - 12b-1 – &amp;quot;Advertisement fee&amp;quot; usually under 1%
    - Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs
    - Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%
      - A – front end load – paid upfront
      - B – back end load – paid when shares are sold
      - Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1
    - No Load – no commission when the fund is bought
      - No sales representative
      - 12b-1 Fee can&amp;#39;t be over 0.25%
      - I, F = don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; but charge a &amp;quot;management fee&amp;quot; of usually 1-2%
      - Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&amp;#39;s have index funds with very high fee

- REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust
  - Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders
  - Own various forms of real estate
  - Good long-term investment
  - No PITA factor unlike being a landlord
  - Very liquid
  - They are a hedge against inflation
  - No management concerns
  - Offer diversification
- Stocks
  - Allow general public ownership in a business
  - Historically the best return is in stocks
  - Very liquid
  - Primary Market – IPO&amp;#39;s – don&amp;#39;t get involved in this
  - Secondary Market – where most investors trade
  - Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets
  - Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market
  - Don&amp;#39;t buy on margin
  - Don&amp;#39;t sell short
  - Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies
  - S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies
  - MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies
  - Stock spin off – conversion of a company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company
  - Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5
  - Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares
  - Stocks can have different classes.
    - A – original shares
    - B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying
  - You want cash dividends, not stock dividends

Valuation techniques

- Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
- The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)
- The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel
- There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company
- P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E
- Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times
- Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify
- Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy
- The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years
- Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&amp;#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&amp;#39;s by using a P/S ratio
- Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.
- Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =
  - 5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)
  - The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
  - Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce
  - This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn
  - Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments
  - Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date
  - Different types of DDM
    - Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks
      - Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)
      - IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value
      - Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield
      - IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return
      - Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return
      - You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%
    - Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth
      - Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.
      - (10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105
      - 3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%
      - (5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return
    - The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula
    - You can&amp;#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&amp;#39;t paying dividends
    - Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible
    - DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
    - This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors
- The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&amp;#39;s.
- Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.
- There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock
- Balance Sheet
  - Financial summary of firm&amp;#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&amp;#39; equity
  - Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity
  - Current – Less than 1 year
  - Long Term – More than 1 year
- Income Statement
  - Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period
  - Revenue – expenses = income
- Cash Flow Statement
  - Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events
- Reports
  - 10K – annual
  - 10Q – quarterly
- Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider
  - P/E – Price/Earnings
    - Most popular stock market ratio
    - Price/EPS
    - Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment
    - Look at competitor&amp;#39;s P/E ratio. Don&amp;#39;t just look at one number
    - The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.
  - Dividend per share
    - Dividend/Number of shares outstanding
  - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend per share/market price
  - Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends
    - Dividend per share/EPS
  - Book Value
    - Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding
    - It tells you the &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up
  - Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value
    - market price/book value
    - 3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20
    - Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets
  - Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&amp;#39;t use these
    - A way to &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s
- Profitability ratio
  - Net Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.
    - Varies based on industry
    - Net Income/Total Revenue
  - Gross Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned from gross profit
    - Gross Profit/Total Revenue
  - Operating Margin
    - Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items
    - Operating Income/Total Revenue
    - The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry
  - Return on assets (ROA)
    - Measures profitability relative to its total assets
    - Net Income/Total Assets
  - Return on equity (ROE)
    - Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity
    - Net Income/Total Stockholder equity
    - Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.
    - ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt
- Liquidly Ratios
  - Current Ratio
    - Current Assets/Current Liabilities
    - Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better
- Leverage Ratios
  - Debt to equity ratio
    - Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity
    - A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better
- Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men
- Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
- From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years
- Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.
- If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!
  - It&amp;#39;s a new era
  - It&amp;#39;s different this time
  - The old ways of valuing stocks are gone
- Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.
- Mania&amp;#39;s will end with a crash every time.
- Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy
- John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.
- Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk
- Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio
- Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking to refinance horrible auto loan, DCU questions!","Hey everyone, I’m looking into refinancing my current auto loan asap. I financed a car in college out of need with zero credit to my name and no one to co-sign with me, so I got a 20k~ loan at 18.5% 
I’ve since graduated college and gotten a stable full-time job, and I’ve gotten my credit up to a 730 since, and I’m now looking to refinance to rid myself of that crazy interest rate. Many Redditors have recommended DCU so I’m looking into them and a few questions have risen. Hoping to connect with anyone who’s gone through the process to lend me their experience!
Firstly I’m worried about the two hard pulls that I’ve see online, one for the membership and one for the loan, will the first membership credit check affect my credit so that the loan credit check will come from the lower score, or will it be at the same time? Hopefully that makes sense! 

Thank you in advance!",finance
CryptoCurrency,How do DEFI platforms generate the huge stablecoin returns?,"I've seen many people on this sub recommend various DEFI platforms which offer huge (relatively speaking) returns on stable coins such as USDC and USDT. I've seen numbers such as 7, 10, and even 12%+ bandied about. How do these platforms generate those returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a reasonable understanding of traditional finance, and the interest earned in your savings account is as a result the difference between the FED/central bank interest rate and the loan interest rate. (i.e. the bank will borrow from the FED at x% and lend it out at y%, making y-x% profit - if interest rates are high, they will borrow from clients instead at z% which is lower than y% and make the difference in profit. You will earn z%. Now with interest rates being at record lows, there's very little incentive for the bank to borrow from you, hence the sub 1% returns in your savings account). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after that short simple and generalized explanation, how are DEFI platforms generating these returns? Who are they lending your stable coins to that they can offer you such a high return? How is this safe? Wouldn't anyone borrowing USDT/USDC at an interest rate in excess of 10% be able to fund that borrowing at a far cheaper rate? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your explanations.",cryptocurrency

In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awaited paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

20. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!!

21. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
23. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML.

24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
25. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that!

26. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

27. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future.

31. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

37. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

39. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

personalfinance,Take a Higher interest Personal Loan to consolidate/invest,"Ok so first off i know that it is ""sometimes"" a ""bad"" idea to use a loan to invest, but hear me out.

No other debt beside our mortgage, EF is $30K=3 month cash/3 month in 6-9month CD ladder

Here is what i owe so far:

|7/19 -60 month Car ; $24.5K|$10K|0.9%|$417 ( pay $100/week)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|9/18 -48 month PL ; $15K|$7.9K|4.99%|$346|

So based on my numbers i owe about $17.9K with an  original blended interest rate of 2.45% paying about $750 a month. both loans are set to be paid off in about 24 months. plan was to put the 750 into maxing my wifes IRA and bulking up our house maint. fund and kids school fund

I just got an offer for a low rate with longer term.  72 month  @ 3% ( 2.75 w/ an account but lets just use 3 for now)

 My plan was to pay off the personal loan but the minimum loan amount is $10K so i came up with 2 options ( or 4 if you get technical with the option)

* get the 10K, pay off the 7.9K and ""return"" the extra ( min payment about $152)
* same as above, but keep the extra and invest it
   * plan was to top up my wifes IRA( we dont usually max it out)
* pay off the car and loan only ( min payment about $275 but would plan on paying $450 a month, investing/saving the $300)
* get 20K, and do the IRA thing ( min payment about $305)

for most of the options we plan to pay more than the minimum since its not hurting our budget. but i wanted to get more opinions. I love running numbers but i fear i am not taking something into account and my plan has a big flaw im not seeing. i feel money in  investments today is worth more than the same amount put in periodically and am ok with paying the interest over the life since  i would assume even a ""bad return"" would net us like 1-3% (5% ROI minus the 3% cost)

Edit: wanted to add a note, the primary reason for the loan was to see if I should pay off some or *all* the current debt, the secondary reason was to see if I should get extra and invest it",finance
devops,Federated prometheus and integration of kube-state-metrics,"I have a number of k8s clusters which have installed a prometheus instance(using prom operator). I have a central separate prometheus which collects all metrics(cadvisor, kubelet) from all the k8s clusters using the /federated endpoint(using a load balancer service). I have recently installed  kube-state-metrics on some of the clusters and i was able to expose those metrics using a separate LB service.   


My end goal is to be able to have only one LB service exposed from each cluster and expose all metrics from that endpoint.   


What i want is to be able to merge all metrics (cadvisor, kubelet, kube-state-metrics) into the local prometheus and expose all metrics externally using the federated endpoint of the local prometheus.   


I was unable to find something similar online but i am sure other people have had experience on how to do this.",technology

personalfinance,"How to think about ""years till breakeven"" on mortgage fees on refinance.","So a mortgage amortization schedule has substantially higher interest vs principal in early years. Therefore my instinct to just mutliply the 1% lower rate I'm being offered on refi, by 1/2 my principal (since over 30 years till full payoff the avg outstanding principal is 1/2 the loan) is perhaps not correct, since more interest in early years. 


I know there is a fancy way to do this with present value of interest payments, but tricky since every future payment is slightly different x 360 months, and college was too long ago.  

So instead of a 5 ""years till make sense"" timeframe on a 200,000 refi mortgage with 1% lower mortage rate than old mortgage (roughly calculated at 200,000 refi means 100,000 average at any given time is outstanding so 1% x 100,000 is $1,000 annual savings, so 5 years to cover $5000 fees) it may be around 2.5 years, since it's really almost the full 200,000 x 1% savings in early years for $5000 savings?

Or no?

Not referring above to points to lower interest, although the theory is the same I assume? Also total payment is not an issue...I am more concerned with lowering interest rate.



EDIT Regarding points to lower interest rate, (not what I am asking about above but same principal) I found this on Rocketmortgage site, and it seems completely wrong to me in that they don't consider the larger upfront years interest, but rather just use overall loan x interest saved as monthly savings. In reality the interest portion is dropping monthly, so they are using principal paydown to make it ""neat"" so each month same :



*How do you calculate that breakeven point? Let’s run through a quick example using the numbers referenced earlier.*

*If you have a $200,000 loan amount, going from a 4.125% interest rate to a 3.75% interest rate saves you $43.07 per month. As mentioned earlier, the cost of 1.75 points on a $200,000 loan amount is $3,500.  If you divide the upfront cost of the points by your monthly savings, you’ll find that your breakeven point is 81.3 months. $3,500 / $43.07 = 81.3*

*If you plan to stay in your house for longer than 6 years and 10 months and pay off your loan according to the original schedule, it makes sense to buy the points because you’ll save money in the long run.*",finance
CryptoCurrency,Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari on Crypto Market: ‘Thousands of Garbage Coins’,"“There is no  barrier to you creating your own bitcoin, or me creating my own … I’ll  call it Neelcoin,” he said. Pointing to his on-stage interlocutor, Larry  Simkins, CEO of conglomerate The Washington Companies, Kashkari added,  “and then Larry can create Larrycoin.”

Other  Fed officials have expressed more nuanced and favorable assessments of  digital assets. Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, for example, said [in June](https://www.coindesk.com/fed-vice-chair-we-should-be-saying-yes-to-stablecoins) the U.S. should find ways to “say yes” to stablecoins.

While  it is true that anyone can spin up a digital asset easily, Kashkari did  not mention the power of network effects, which make bitcoin more  secure and valuable in the market’s eyes than its many competitors.

personalfinance,General Purpose TSP loan?,"Hello everyone! 

I’m currently exploring options on repaying credit card debt that I currently have against me.

stocks,U.S. Stock Futures Slip Ahead of Fed Minutes,"U.S. stock futures were choppy Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting. Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.2%, indicating that broader market may post a muted decline at the opening bell. The index fell 0.7% on Tuesday in its biggest drop in nearly a month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.3%, and contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 slid 0.1%. 

The notes from the Fed meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, will offer more indications of when the central bank may begin scaling back easy-money policies that were adopted at the start of the pandemic. Fed officials are nearing consensus on beginning to taper bond purchases in about three months, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The Fed’s bond-buying program and lower interest rates have helped the stock market power higher, with major indexes notching records earlier this week.

“As long as policy remains reasonably supportive, growth continues and we keep increasing our vaccination, it is a strange environment where conditions are good for equities,” said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. “There is genuine economic strength.” Investors also don’t have many alternatives to putting money into stocks, according to Mr. Kamal. Markets aren’t sure what direction to go in, and the Fed minutes will offer some crucial insights into policy makers’ futures steps, he said. “The Fed has shown they are really scared of upsetting the market,” Mr. Kamal added.

defi,Fiat onramp &gt; Stablecoin loan &gt; Fiat offramp,"Hi folks

I need to make a significant purchase in USD in real life (travels + flight tickets + move apartment). I could all pay it off with my savings but instead would like to pay if off in - lets say - 3 months. Looking for ideas to take a real life loan against my savings.

Has anyone taken a stablecoin loan in Aave and converted the loan to fiat? And pay the loan back?

What I was thinking:

1. buy a bunch of GUSD via Gemini (with my USD savings)
2. transfer the GUSD to Aave for collateral
3. take a GUSD loan
4. transfer the GUSD back to Gemini, convert to fiat, ACH to my bank account

Any risk?

CryptoCurrency,7 Things I've learned so far on Crypto.,"I've been around for some time, and I've learned some things that *might* be really usefull to new crypto investors and maybe old ones too.

1.- Crypto is a limited asset. 

As a limited asset, you will have only so much from it, and as more and more people are demanding it, the price will go up 'cause that's how offer-demand works, but around the world, we almost have *""unlimited""* quantities of something, and there are just a little amounts of stuff that are limited, and almost every single one, tend to go up in time, like Gold, some type of Cars, some type of watches, Art, Pokemon cards, etc. So, crypto in time, will only go up in price, 'cause it's a limited non diying resource.

2.- Deflation.

We're so used to inflation, with FIAT, and even Deflation with Fiat can be a Scam, you just need to control the circulation of money (contraction), and credit on the economy. That's only controlled by Governmets, and Central Banks. Deflation could be also be influenced by productivity and technological improvements, and a lot of projects are working on improvements on their technology.

*""Milton Friedman argued that under optimal policy, in which the central bank seeks a rate of deflation equal to the* *r**eal interest rate* *on government bonds, the nominal rate should be zero, and the price level should fall steadily at the real rate of interest""*

On Crypto deflation it's a natural thing, as you have a limited ammount of coins (almost every project), the individual value of every coin will go up, so your purchasing power, will go up aswell, that's the reason why so many people came into crypto when Covid started and Governments went nuts with the **magic printer**, Crypto it's a good place to fight **inflation.**

3.- If you bought already, **DON'T TRADE.**

Please don't make the mistake that maybe a lot of us have made, just Hold your precious Coin, if it is a *good project* you'll be better off holding, and as explained on the past 2 points, the value will go down in time. Yes you can get lucky, and get some good trades, but you can get rekt so easy on the market, specialy on such a volatile environment. Please, don't try to time the market, market almost always will time you, and you'll be a sad trader **losing money for being greedy.** Just hold your position, and you'll be green sooner than later.

4.- Don't stare at the charts for **too long**, or **too often**.

This is the most volatile asset on the history of finance, and you can get really frustrated on the blink of an eye, and you can get happy on just 2 minutes with a really green dildo on your screen. My advice on this it's coming from the other 3 points, time it's on your side, fundamentals are on your side, technology it's on your side, **adoption it's coming**, and if on any case, you're feeling scared, please just *ZOOM OUT.* Take a look at the bigger picture and you'll know for sure, that you're safe.

5.- Do your **own motherf\*cking research**.

Don't take any advice as an absolute truth, not even from this post, I'm just a 27 year old guy from somewhere around the globe with ambitions on crypto, and my opinion might be bias on some way.

Take your time and study, make some research on every project that you might be interested, take a look at the **OWNERS** of the project, their cv's might tell you something about the future of the project sometimes. Take a look at the fundamentals, how many coins the owners own, how many coins will ever exist, that would give you a **Marketcap** (Coins circulating x Price), and a potential price on the future, so you won't be that guy saying *ADA it's going to be 10,000 usd by the end of 2021*. Internet it's a great tool, and you can learn a lot. Just be careful, there are some really good sources of information, and there are also a lot of scammers that want to make money fast, giving false information, and selling a shitty coin.

6.- DCA all the way.

*Dollar Cost Average*, it's the best way to take some of the stress out of the buying process and entry levels. You might want to time the market and get the lowest of lowest candels to buy, and the greenest of greenest Dildos to sell. Truth be told, no one can do this, not even the most gifted traders on the market. You might get it right once, but not twice. So you're better off just making a schedule, and buying on a regular basis, you'll get an average of price, and it's the better proven way to buy at least on this market.

7.- You don't need that iPhone.

Some weeks ago, I saw a post from an user that wanted to buy an iPhone 12 last year, and he did not do that. Instead he bought a 100usd cellphone and put the rest of the money on crypto. Months later he had enough money to buy 3 iphones 12, and even more money to go out and party. This is just a personal view on Fiat, and I believe it will pay off on the long run, I'm not buying anymore stuff that I don't really need anymore, specialy stuff to impress others, I just DCA that money, and I know for sure that on the future, it will be the best decision that I've ever made.

Anyways, this is just advice from a noob, I've made many mistakes, and I've learned a lot, hopefully your portfolio is green, and hopefully you can fulfill your dreams.

Simple. Outside investors. 
People holding steem, and theta simple just bought off an exchange.   That's why it's so beefed up.    There is no other reason for that high of an Mcap on theta.   Just people FOMO'n in pumping up Theta hoping for it to Explode in User base.

CryptoCurrency,"Cardano teams up with Ergo blockchain, which uses UTXO-based accounting like Cardano&amp;Bitcoin, to work on a stablecoin contract called Djed which is the first formally verified crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank","Cryptocurrency volatility is one of the obstacles to its wider  adoption. Blockchain technologies provide benefits such as transparency,  data immutability, and proven security of financial operations. Yet, it  is harder than fiat currencies to predict how the market will behave,  or forecast the value of a digital currency. This hinders using  cryptocurrencies as accounting and exchange units in daily operations.

A  stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a basket of fiat currencies or  a single currency (eg, USD or EUR); commodities like gold or silver;  stocks; or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that  maintain a low price deviation from their target price and so are useful  to store or exchange value, as their built-in mechanisms remove the  volatility. 

Some stablecoins lack transparency and liquidity of  their reserves, which compromises their price stability. To address  these challenges, IOG has teamed up with Emurgo, another of the three  founding partners of Cardano, and the Ergo blockchain, which uses  UTXO-based accounting like Cardano,  to work on a stablecoin contract  called Djed. Djed is based on algorithmic design. This means it uses  smart contracts to ensure price stabilization, and that the coin will be  useful for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. 

## How stablecoins work

Different  mechanisms contribute to the stability of the coin’s value and help  eliminate price variations. These mechanisms are underpinned by the  economic principles of supply and demand. 

A common mechanism is  backing the stablecoin by a reserve of the currency used as the peg. If  demand is higher than the supply of sell or buy orders, this supply  should be increased to avoid fluctuations in the price. Typically,  stablecoin reserves are not stored in cash. Instead, they are kept in  interest-bearing financial instruments such as bonds. The returns on  these provide revenue for the operator. 

As long as the stablecoin  is fully backed by reserves in the currency to which it is pegged – and  the operator can react quickly to variations in demand – price  stability is maintained. 

## Common risks

Stablecoin reserves  are commonly associated with investments. The lack of liquidity of  these investments may prevent the operator from reacting quickly to  demand. This compromises stability in the short term.

A drawback  of fiat-backed stablecoins is that they require trust in the entities  keeping the reserves. Lack of the reserves’ transparency or of the  ‘full-backing’ claim, combined with inefficient stabilization measures,  have already caused Tether stablecoin (USDT) to fall below $0.96, as  shown in [Figure 1.](https://ucarecdn.com/20fef54f-2d33-4c16-9a74-3a74f4cb0420/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/)

 Issues of transparency do not arise when the backing asset is a  cryptocurrency on a public blockchain. Furthermore, the use of smart  contracts ensures efficient and reliable execution of stabilization  measures due to its automated and secure mechanisms.

## Enhanced stabilization mechanisms of Djed algorithmic stablecoin

Djed is a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank. It operates by keeping a reserve of *base coins*, and minting and burning *stablecoins* and *reserve coins*.  The contract maintains the peg of stablecoins to a target price by  buying and selling stablecoins, using the reserve, and charging fees,  which accumulate in the reserve, as shown in [Figure 2](https://ucarecdn.com/8fac023c-68b9-4fbc-9ad3-9c8d2005c544/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/). The ultimate  beneficiaries of this revenue stream are holders of reserve coins, who  boost the reserve with funds while assuming the risk of price  fluctuation.

 The Djed stablecoin is designed as an asset pegged to a fiat  currency (USD), along with a governing algorithm. This approach provides  a stable means of exchange. But Djed is not limited to being pegged to  the dollar. It can work with other currencies, as long as there are  oracles providing the contract with the corresponding pricing index.

## The first formally verified stablecoin protocol

Djed is the first *formally verified*  stablecoin protocol. The use of formal methods in the programming  process has greatly contributed to the design and stability properties  of Djed. Using formal techniques, the properties are proven by  mathematical theorems:

* **Peg upper and lower bound maintenance**:  the price will not go above or beyond the set price. In the normal  reserve ratio range, purchases and sales are not restricted, and users  have no incentive to trade stablecoins outside the peg range in a  secondary market.
* **Peg robustness during market crashes**: up to a set limit that depends on the reserve ratio, the peg is maintained even when the price of the base coin falls sharply.
* **No insolvency**: no bank is involved, so there is no bank contract to go bankrupt.
* **No bank runs**:  all users are treated fairly and paid accordingly, so there is provably  no incentive for users to race to redeem their stablecoins.
* **Monotonically increasing equity per reserve coin**:  under some conditions, the reserve surplus per reserve coin is  guaranteed to increase as users interact with the contract. Under these  conditions, reserve coin holders are guaranteed to profit. 
* **No reserve draining**:  under some conditions, it is impossible for a malicious user to execute  a sequence of actions that would steal reserves from the bank.
* **Bounded dilution**: there is a limit to how many reserve coin holders and their profit can be diluted due to the issuance of more reserve coins.

## Djed versions

There are two versions of Djed:

* **Minimal Djed**: this version is designed to be as simple, intuitive, and straightforward as possible, without compromising stability. 
* **Extended Djed**:  this more complex version provides some additional stability benefits.  The main differences are the use of a continuous pricing model and  dynamic fees to further incentivize the maintenance of the reserve ratio  at an optimal level.

## Implementations

IOG, Ergo, and  Emurgo teams have been working on the implementation of the Djed  algorithmic stablecoin contract earlier in 2021 to test different  models. 

The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/)  on Ergo. This was the first algorithmic stablecoin deployed on a  UTXO-based ledger in Q1 2021. It had a fee of 1% for buying or selling  operations, and an oracle that updated the exchange rate every hour.  This initial version was subject to a reserve draining attack by an  anonymous user who owned a large number of ERGs (Ergo’s native coin).  The attack was ultimately unsuccessful, and it is estimated that the  attacker lost $100,000. 

To further discourage such attacks, this  initial deployment of Minimal Djed was replaced by a version where the  fee was set to 2%, the oracle updated every 12 minutes, and every oracle  update was allowed to change the price by at most 0.49%, unless the  price difference was greater than 50%. This provided stronger resilience  against reserve draining attacks.  

Djed has also been  implemented by the IOG team in Solidity. One version uses the native  currency of the Ethereum blockchain as a base coin, and another uses any  ERC20-compliant token as a base coin. So far, these implementations  have been deployed to testnets for Binance Smart Chain’s testnet,  Avalanche’s Fuji, Polygon’s Mumbai, Ethereum’s Kovan, Ethereum’s  Rinkeby, and RSK’s testnet.

## Djed: Cardano implementation

The  Alonzo update to Cardano will enable smart contracts using Plutus.  Plutus is powered by Haskell, which guarantees a safe, full-stack  programming environment.

Draft implementation of an earlier version of Minimal Djed is [available in the Plutus language](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-use-cases/src/Plutus/Contracts/Stablecoin.hs).  In this implementation, stablecoins and reserve coins are native assets  uniquely identified by the hash of the monetary policy that controls  their minting and burning according to the Djed protocol. This  implementation also assumes that oracle data such as the exchange rate  is provided as signed data directly to the transactions, instead of  being posted on-chain.

There is also an ongoing OpenStar  implementation. OpenStar is a framework for private permissioned  blockchains developed in Scala. The implementation of Djed using  OpenStar follows the idea of off-chain smart contract execution to have a  stablecoin on Cardano that does not depend on smart contracts executed  on-chain.

solar,So how bad is leasing?,"So I’m looking to add solar to my house, and the installer recommended going with a lease instead, but everywhere I read says that buying is the way to go. 

The initial quote came back with over 110 panels for a 37kw system. We’ve had some unusual power usage this year so my gut feeling is that’s a bit high.  Regardless, the solar company comes in at .10 a kWh, while my electric company is charging .165 or with delivery/supply charges. 

The monthly payment is the same for the length of the lease, and they have a production guarantee.  25 year warranty on everything. 

So it seems like a decent deal to me, basically saving 40% this year, and then saving even more if the power company increases their rates over the coming years. 

The difference between the purchase price and the lease is about 20%, which just about covers the federal incentive that I wouldn’t be able to maximize anyway since I don’t pay more than 26k in federal taxes.  

So is there a case for leasing?  Or should I hold and reevaluate at a later time?",energy

personalfinance,What else could we be doing with our money?,"Hi everyone - my husband and I have both gotten new jobs this year that pay more than what we used to earn, and are settled into our first house...we are now wondering if there's anything else we can do to better manage our assets / investments.

Background: We are 30, making a combined $280k pre-tax (not including stock options). We always pay our credit cards in full, and after recently paying off our car, carry no debt besides our mortgage.

* House: We owe \~$300k on our mortgage ($1,750/month at a 2.5% interest rate with 20% down when it bought it 2 years ago)
* Annual 401k contributions are now maxed out (this wasn't always the case when we were starting out in our careers) - We now have roughly $220k in combined retirement, with a relatively even split between traditional and Roth
* HSA contributions are now maxed out - $20k in health savings
* HYSA: $26k emergency fund that we don't typically add to or take out from
* Cash savings: $20k, which pays for my husband's part-time grad school classes, and we're also saving towards a new car
* Checking: We always maintain \~$10k in checking for operational expenses, credit card payments, etc.
* Vanguard Brokerage: $27k invested in a number of ETFs -- once we purchase our new car, we would like to funnel future cash surplus into the brokerage

My question is: what else we can do to optimize our finances?

* For instance, we are relatively new to using the Vanguard brokerage -- what are considered good expense ratios for ETFs?
* I also have 401ks from former employers (using Vanguard and Fidelity), and my new platform is Lincoln Financial -- would it be better to consolidate everything?
* Should we make additional mortgage payments rather than invest excess cash? Do we have too much liquid cash?
* Would it be worth considering getting into crypto or other forms of investing?
* Anything else to recommend that we're not already doing?",finance

""For anyone that doesn't understand;

Banks and institutions have big wads of $$$

Banks decide to put big wads of $$$ with the Feds for %0.05 ANNUAL INTEREST.

So this begs the question;

If stock market is booming and inflation is going to slow down according to Government, why not put their assets elsewhere instead of the Feds for such a measly interest rate?

Unless... Everything that the media tells you is bullshit, the stock market is in the biggest bubble in history, and they don't want their money anywhere because they know shit is about to implode and they'll lose that money due to a... i dunno, impending crash?

I contacted the agency my 401K is currently with and they said they don't do spousal IRAs. So does anyone have recommendations for places to open one?

As for the second part: we've gotten a lot of adverts telling us about various online savings accounts that give you a decent cash bonus (something like $500) if you transfer a certain amount (usually in the $50K range) to them in a new account and keep it there for a certain amount of time.

stocks,"$CLNE, I like the stock.","4th day in a row when sales out number buys by at least 4-3! And she held the critical support above $6.85! Even after the SPY and DOW dumped because pansy traders are scared of the fed minutes, she held! This girl right here is at a YTD low! And a possible double bottom from last week’s low! Volume is low allowing shorts to manipulate price and have a greater affect! But that doesn’t matter, because support held through dump after dump after dump! Sure it didn’t take off today, but we know that any volume sky rockets this thing! 

Analysts maintained the outperform, but lowered the PT to $16... wait... $16?!?! That’s 2.5x the damn price!!! Who cares if the fed tapers?! This is a damn value company that’s about to get fueled by a $3.5T infrastructure bill that allocated $30B into its EMERGING market! That’s right! This is a pioneer in its space and will likely get awarded most of it! Not to mention the released signed deals that came out of the news yesterday! 

So we have higher revenue, more growth, more earnings, more contracts, an infrastructure bill, and climate reports literally begging to find alternative fuels? And it’s down 12% for 2021?  

Simple institutional investors want lower prices to keep finding ways to get higher returns. So they short and they wait. But right now shorts have 3 days to cover, and she’s oversold 4 sessions in a row, why more selling? Because if she doesn’t break below $6.82 then this will be a double bottom and she will rise to cut above the moving averages which are consolidated and the short term MA will cross as well triggering a huge pump because algos are built by developers not traders. So a golden cross off a double bottom is extremely likely. So MMs and institutions that are short need this to stay down long enough for Friday and their options need to expire OOTM. 

You might say, “well isnt institutional investment up on this?”. Yeah on 16Aug there was an incredible amount of 13Fs filed but those were shares bought mostly. And many of them also bought puts to cover risk going down. So now we are 2 days from options expiring with an incredible amount of shorts, short calls, and OI on calls below $9. 

Once the options expire MMs and institutional investors will let this baby run free because fed minutes and taper talk is incredible bullshit to give a reason why there needs to be a sell off. Because selling in order to manipulate the price to have your sold options expire OOTM sounds unethical? 

Long story short. This is about to pop, she just needs volume. Retail can’t do it alone, that’s why the shorts have to cover and options need to expire. Then watch this thing become a gem of a stock analyst will rave about in the emerging clean energy sector and it’s extremely undervalued.... after they’ve been manipulating it to get their friends a better entry.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 18, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 18, 2021**

*Sorry no highlights, took longer to write this edition of the recap.*

Stocks largely traded sideways before plunging in the last two hours of the market following the release of the Federal Reserve’s July Meeting Minutes, after the Fed revealed it may begin to taper the pace of their monthly bond purchases likely before the end of the year. This is not at all surprising, there was always an expectation and I have been warning for months that quantitative easing would likely taper towards the end of the year but as usual the market loves to overreact. It just shows that economic recovery is progressing nicely and the market is starting to be able to stand on its own legs. It is important to note that no consensus has emerged between participants regarding the taper timeline, as will be discussed below.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. 

First off, before the recap begins, I encourage everyone to read about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, in which the market freaked out after the Fed began tapering asset purchasing programs passed during the height of the 2008 crisis. I think something similar may be happening here. With how far the economy has come in terms of corporate earnings, improving labor market conditions, and an increasingly vaccinated population, the fundamentals for the economy are improving, so it is not surprising that pandemic-era support measures will begin slowing down. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)

The timing and potential scope of a potential taper timeline has been a key question in the minds of market participants moving forward. In the latest meeting minutes, the Fed revealed that “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”

On inflation, the minutes said “With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory” and “Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.” However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.

In short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, “A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.”

I recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

stocks,Whats your view about the fed minutes that came out today?,"Right after the fed minutes came out there was an initial rise followed by a drop for the rest of the day. My question is whats your view about the news ?

Mine is simple, this is great news that a taper is planning on happening this year . This will cause inflation fears to drop great as the fed will slow down the amount of money that gets pumped into the economy . 

Heres an analogy that the fed described with starting a taper this year-"" it as if letting go of the gas pedal on a car""

Essentially , the fed pumping money to keep the economy going is the same as pressing down on the gas pedal , letting go of the gas pedal(tapering) will cause the car(economy) to slow down without needing to press the brake(increase rates). Basically by tapering soon, they can delay increasing rates until the end of next year and also cause rates to not jump as  much either. 

Thats my view , how about yalls?",finance

personalfinance,"Feeling defeated with my debt load, I know what I have to do, but it will make me very unhappy for the next 5 years. Asking for advice if I’m about to do this right.","So… through a series of unfortunate events, I managed to rack up $13,905 of debt. They are distributed in the following way. 

Chase 1 - $2,300, minimum payment $79 interest rate 23.74% 

LOC - $8,000, minimum payment $160 interest rate 11.4% 

Citi - $2,100, minimum payment $55, interest rate 19.99%

Cap one - $1,100, minimum payment $40, interest rate 22.3%

Chase 2 - $1505, minimum payment $39, interest rate 21.99% 


I thought of using my line of credit knowing that paying $300 would cause $220 towards the principle. But instead of paying the LOC down use the $220 and apply $220 plus $79 to make it $299 towards chase 1. Since that is the highest interest till it drops to $900, since continuing to make the minimum payment towards the LOC would leave $100 towards chase 1 this would happen in March 2022. 


Then use the 140 plus the $55 towards cap one to make $195 till cap one is paid off (Octoberish 2022). Then pay the final 190ish towards chase 1 in November 2023.


Now cap one and chase 1 is paid off. During this time roughly $1000 would be available in credit on the LOC. So use that, add the paid off cards minimum payments which would be roughly $1300 toward Citi. 


Using the LOC minimum payment and the available principle again  Citi would be paid off by Jan 2023. Continue making the minimum payments on the LOC. And put the $284 (extra $140, previous paid off cards minimum payments) towards chase 2. Which would be paid off by June 2023.

Then focus on maintaining a $400 payment towards the LOC which would be paid off in 2025.


I have a few worries about this. Namely I don’t have an emergency fund, and I can’t get a second job since my therapist highly advised against it owing to my depression that says and I quote “has not devolved into suicidal depression through will alone, because the medication hasn’t and never worked”

Am I thinking about this plan right? I still plan to put aside $50 ever month by the hook or crook into an emergency fund and hope not to resort to using it before it reaches $1000 (using betterment investment account to save)",finance

I work two jobs, one full-time (the new one, which is my primary job) and one part-time.

Here's my question for the tax gurus among us - if I'm understanding the instructions correctly, the amount I put in Step 4c on the W-4, ""Extra Withholding,"" should be the total amount my employer deducts for federal taxes from each check.  Do I have that right?  

This is a very different process than the last time I did a W-4 and I want to make sure they aren't going to withhold whatever the standard withholding amount is for my annual salary PLUS the amount I put on the Extra Withholding line.  If I remember correctly, on the old W-4, you could take a certain number of exemptions which would determine your withholding amount, and then also indicate if you wanted extra tax to be withheld.  The new W-4 doesn't work that way and I don't want to lose half my paycheck to federal tax withholding!  Thanks for any guidance you can offer!",finance

* Tax is only applicable to interest earned and not on principal amount (total deposited amount in savings account)

Assumptions:

* 401K contribution limit remains at $19,500 for 2022 and 2023
* 401K early withdrawal penalty fee: 10%
* Federal income tax rate: 22%
* State income tax rate: 5%
* If I max out my 401K contribution + employer match, I will hypothetically have: Employee contribution (19,500 x 2) + Employer contribution (16,000) = $55,000
* Withdrawing 401K will leave me with: $55,000 \* 0.9 \* 0.78 \* 0.95 = $36,679.5

Is my calculations right?

CryptoCurrency,A Simple Example Tutorial of How to Get Started with DeFi,"For those who already play around with DeFi, you're going to react to my example below as overly simple and yes, you can get much higher yield with alternative approaches, but I want a nice clean example for people to get started.  Hope this is helpful:

Say you've got $1000 worth of Dai (a stable coin) sitting in a private wallet.¹  It's just sitting there not doing anything for you.  We want to play on the polygon network (matic) for this example, and if it's just sitting in your wallet, it's probably on the Ethereum blockchain, so first you'll need to bridge it over to the polygon network using the [polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge).  Okay, now you have a little less than $1000, because you paid an Ethereum transaction fee, but you're on polygon so your fees from here out will be fractions of a penny.

You head over to [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com/) and deposit the $1000 worth of Dai.  Now you're getting 4.31% interest.²  Much better!  And better yet, this is still self-custodied.  It's deposited with AAVE, but you still control the keys.

But we're not done.  In addition to the 4.31% on your Dai, you're also getting an additional 1.73% interest in Matic tokens.  So your effective interest rate is 6%.  Awesome!  But we're still not done.  Because this is deposited in AAVE, it can be used as collateral for a loan.  So now you take out a loan of, say, $500.  A few clicks and you'll have a $500 loan.

At this point you may be wondering if that's safe and why you would want to take the loan.  We'll come to that, but first, as to safety:  you've got a very safe and healthy loan-to-value ratio.  $500 borrowed on $1000 collateral.  Also, we're using a stablecoin as our collateral, so the odds are the value of the collateral isn't going to change.  (You could easily be using wrapped bitcoin, or Ether, or a host of other crypto.)

But why take the loan?  Aren't we losing money now that we have to pay interest on the loan?  Yes, but stay with me.  Your debt on the $500 is going to grow at 5.92%, but polygon gives you another 3.22% in matic tokens *back* on the borrowed money.  (Yes, they're paying you to borrow.)  So you have an effective interest rate on the debt of 2.7%.  You also have the $500.

What do you do with the $500?  Well, let's say you deposit it right back with AAVE, so you can take advantage of that 6% we talked about earlier, but now on the $500 in addition to the $1000.  This means we're getting 6% interest on money that we borrowed at 2.7%, for an effective rate of 3.3% interest on the $500.  By redepositing the $500, you've also upped the amount of collateral so you have an even healthier loan-to-value ratio.  (And yes, you can borrow more now.)

Congratulations, you're playing with DeFi!

Incidentally, I'm using AAVE as my example, but there are tons of other services you can play around with to do this.  Don't want to keep the rewards tokens as Matic?  Convert them at will (for fractions of pennies on the transaction).  Or maybe use the matic to play around with other DeFi projects without risking your collateral, which is sitting safely and gaining interest.

You may be thinking that it can't possibly be true that you could make money by borrowing from a service and lending the money right back to them, but the reason it works is because polygon gives tokens as an incentive to participate.  If you did this on AAVE on the Ethereum network instead of polygon, they'd be giving you additional rewards tokens in AAVE instead of Matic.  And there are lots of other competing services.  You don't just have to play with stablecoin, and you don't just have to play with borrowing/lending, you can dip your toes into providing liquidity to pools and taking a cut of the transaction fees yourself.

In a few weeks we'll have Arbitrum launching (an ETH layer 2 with super low transaction fees) and all the major DeFi projects are going to be dumping their tokens on customers to try to attract a new wave of retail to DeFi.  If you haven't played with DeFi before, it's a great time to learn.  If all this makes you nervous, try playing around with a small amount first and get comfortable.

Hope this was helpful to someone out there!

¹ It doesn't have to be Dai, incidentally, I'm just using it as an example.  And it doesn't have to be $1000, again just picking a round number as an example.

CryptoCurrency,DeFi Explained: LP-Tokens,"At central exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, investors trade their fiat money in exchange for crypto, or they trade between different crypto trading pairs. However, these trades are only possible because there is sufficient liquidity on such exchanges. In decentralized finance (DeFi), there are no central exchanges and all trading is done through decentralized exchanges, better known as DEXs. These DEXs need liquidity before you use them to trade tokens. Once you provide liquidity to a specific liquidity pool (trading pair), you will receive LP tokens in return. But what are LP tokens and how do they work? Let's find out in this post!

# Decentralized exchanges

Before we delve deeper into LP tokens, it is important to know the distinction between a central and a decentralized exchange. As the word implies, central exchanges are centrally controlled and usually also have sufficient volume and liquidity to enable trades on their platform. Note that you will always trade one digital asset for another. For example, you can buy Bitcoin (BTC) with fiat money, but you can also buy Bitcoin with Ethereum (ETH). This is all possible because there is sufficient volume on the central exchange.

In DeFi, things work differently. Traders depend on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which in turn depend on investors. That's right, they depend on the liquidity that investors lock in the protocol. To enable traders to swap tokens and to keep token pairs in balance (for example, a 50:50 ratio), decentralized exchanges use automated market makers (AMMs).

# Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An order book is used on central exchanges. You can place limit orders so that you can buy or sell assets at a certain fixed price. This price is determined by the buying or selling volume, also known as supply and demand. An AMM is, among other things, highly dependent on the liquidity of the protocol.

An AMM works in the same way as an order book in that there are trading pairs, the only difference being that you don't need a counterparty to execute the trade. Suppose you are willing to buy Bitcoin at a price of $35,000. This transaction can only be executed when someone is willing to sell Bitcoin at this price. Instead, an AMM works with smart contracts that enable all these transactions. We no longer speak of peer-to-peer transactions (P2P), but of peer-to-contract (P2C) transactions.

# Liquidity

Each decentralized exchange is in turn dependent on the liquidity on the platform. The more liquidity and trading pairs available, the more attractive it is for an investor to complete his or her trade in this protocol. Liquidity is also a factor that is built up over the years. This is accompanied by possibilities and trust, among other things. Let's take a look at the liquidity of the most famous DEXs:

# UniSwap

UniSwap was the first AMM and version V1 was launched in November 2018. If we consult the statistics at the top of the menu, we see that there is a total volume of more than 2 billion dollars.

# PancakeSwap

PancakeSwap is the decentralized exchange built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). At the time of writing, PancakeSwap has total liquidity of no less than $4.69 billion. But not every DEX has that much liquidity. According to CoinMarketCap, there are now 70 decentralized exchanges and new ones are added regularly. And how does a DEX try to be successful? By guaranteeing sufficient liquidity.

# Providing liquidity

A decentralized exchange is therefore dependent on liquidity. And this comes from investors because they in turn are going to provide their liquidity. The protocol promises very attractive interest rates for liquidity providers when they offer their digital tokens in the protocol. This makes it easier for others to trade and, in addition to this attractive interest, the liquidity providers usually also receive part of the transaction costs that are made on the platform.

Adding liquidity to a protocol is always based on a trading pair with a ratio of 50:50 in value. Suppose you want to add 0.5 ETH to a pool, with the stablecoin DAI as another asset. Suppose the price of Ethereum is currently at $2500, so 0.5 ETH is equivalent to $1250. This means that you still have to add $1250 to DAI. But how does the protocol know who added what? This contribution is paid out by means of LP tokens.

With the new update of UniSwap V3, it is no longer necessary for this split to be 50-50. It is possible to set a range to deviate from this ratio. With UniSwap V2, this ratio still applies.

# What are LP Tokens

LP tokens or liquidity provider tokens are tokens that are issued to liquidity providers, who make their digital assets available to the AMM protocol on a decentralized exchange (DEX). By using smart contracts, you will receive these LP tokens in your wallet immediately after the transaction. These serve as a kind of proof of ownership that you have contributed to add liquidity.

As soon as you add liquidity to a pool, you get LP tokens in return. For example, if your stake is 1% of the entire pool, you will receive 1 LP token, if there are 100 LP tokens in total. Your investment is translated into a percentage of liquidity in the pool. Keep in mind that you can always lose money and your investment is not necessarily stored in the LP tokens. Your percentage of liquidity of the pool is stored in the tokens.

Example: You decide to add liquidity on PancakeSwap and you do this by depositing CAKE and BNB into a liquidity pool. For this you will receive CAKE-BNB LP tokens. Thus, the number of LP tokens you receive for this represents your share of liquidity pool of the trading pair CAKE-BNB. Then when someone trades on PancakeSwap, he or she pays a percentage fee for this trade. Part of this is added as liquidity, and you receive the remaining share as a reward.

These LP tokens represent your share of the pool. You can not trade with these LP tokens. The value of LP tokens is also less relevant. After all, you always exchange it for your underlying liquidity. However, what is possible is to use these LP tokens to achieve even more returns by depositing them in a vaults or farm. 

# The value of LP tokens

Although the value of your LP token is less interesting, it is useful to know how to determine this value. You can do this via various online tools, but it can also be done via manual calculation. To determine the value of your LP token, take the total value of pool and divide it by the number of LP tokens in circulation. You can check also this via EtherScan if you're providing liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain. If they take place on the Binance Smart Chain, you can visit [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/).

# Sell ​​LP Tokens

Selling your LP tokens is done in the same way as buying them. After participating in a liquidity pool, you have received these LP tokens and are stored in your MetaMask or TrustWallet. You can sell them at any time. Go to the decentralized exchange where you provided liquidity and go to the relevant pool.

When you've added liquidity, the pools you've contributed to will automatically load. Here you can choose to sell your LP tokens again. When you do this, you sell your position in the liquidity pool and receive your tokens.

You can sell your LP tokens by re-entering the platform and into liquidity. The pools you participate in automatically load here. In the example of BNB-CAKE, you can immediately recover the liquidity. Confirm that you want to withdraw 100% of your liquidity from this pool and your request will be sent. Within minutes you will receive proof that you are officially no longer a liquidity provider. From now on you will no longer have LP tokens, but separate BNB tokens and CAKE tokens.

# Yield Farming

Yield Farming is a very attractive reason for many to make the switch to decentralized finance. Beyond the decentralization aspect, we cannot deny that astronomical interest rates affect us. On the contrary. After adding liquidity, we received these LP tokens, and we can sometimes use them to get extra returns. Characteristic of DeFi is the use of APY, which stands for Annual Percentage Yield, whereby compound interest is used. In contrast to the traditional interest rate, this is very attractive and is often used in combination with liquidity providing. In the protocol you can often stake these LP tokens to get extra rewards. 

# Risks

Adding liquidity is not entirely without risks. Of course, the risks with stablecoins are much less than with other digital assets. The greater the risk, the greater the interest. Despite the less attractive percentages, adding liquidity based on two stablecoins can be a good investment, provided you are currently not getting returns on your currency anywhere else.

# Impermanent losses

The biggest risk with DeFi is the chance of an impermanent loss. This is a term that you have most likely already come across and that everyone is warning you about. Impermanent loss refers to the chance of a temporary drop in the value of your currency due to the volatility in a trading pair. You should never underestimate the volatility of crypto.

# Conclusion

LP tokens play an important role in DeFi. They act as a proof of ownership for liquidity providers who have deposited their tokens in to a liquidity pool. If it wasn't for these liquidity providers, DEXs wouldn't be able to function and investors were only able to trade their crypto on regular centralized exchanges.",cryptocurrency

The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event.

37. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

68. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

74. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

CryptoCurrency,When The Price Drops: The Psychological Effects,"This post focuses on the psychological effects of a price drop. Specifically, the reinforcing roles of social media (looking at you Reddit) and news are highlighted. When you know what a price drop does to the human psyche, you might be able take advantage of this.

There are various methods to estimate whether the price of Bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto will rise or fall. For example, you can perform technical or fundamental analyzes on your cryptocurrency to determine the expected price. In addition to these two more well-known forms of analysis, there is also a slightly less well-known alternative: sentiment analysis.

The investor's feeling is central here. This feeling is partly determined by the share price, but is also fed by external factors such as the news and opinions of others. We'll discuss the sentiment analysis in this post, with a central focus on the psychological effect of a price decline.

# The current market sentiment

# Q1-Q3 2021

​​​​​​​​​This year has been a great time for the crypto world. Making a loss seemed impossible and returns of hundreds of percent seemed up for grabs. Investor sentiment peaked and euphoria set in.

Crypto investors sprang up like mushrooms. How different this is past the month of May. The events of 2017 seem to be repeating themselves. But what consequences does this have for the price of the various cryptocurrencies? And what is the consequence for the sentiment on the stock market?

The cryptomarket has been taken some serious blows and the burning question is, do we stay in the corner where the final blows falls? Or will the cryptomarket recover and flip the price back up like a bull?

At the time of writing, BTC is trying to breach through the 48K resistance-level. This means that we are in what seems like a recovery phase, something we saw in the bullrun of 2013 as well.

In itself there is nothing strange about a number of strong corrections of as much as 20 to 30% during a strong bull market. As mentioned before, this also happened during the bull run in 2017 and in 2013. If it's your first time as a crypto investor, such a ride down seems pretty scary. It is difficult to determine whether these price drops are just corrections or a crash.

# What is the current market sentiment?

At the time of writing, there is a positve sentiment in the crypto market, as you can see in the image below. The image shows the Fear &amp; Greed Index. The general market segment is measured via various variables. Examples of these variables are social media, research and market volume.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m8mwnu6fx9i71.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a3b39553ec1440824c9dd8b477b55c1995b56d1

The positive sentiment results in a bullish mentality among investors, due to the price of BTC (and other coins) going up strong. We're currently sitting at a greed index of 70, which is caused by the current resistance level at 48K.

What matters now is whether the positive sentiment continues. Nowadays you even discuss crypto with the local baker or that annoying drunk uncle at birthday parties. Even Paris Hilton gave advice on crypto. If everyone in your area has an opinion about crypto and says that you achieve brilliant returns without any effort, this can be a signal that a hype is coming to an end. Of course, this does not mean that the bull run is over.

# The causes of the sharp price declines this year

1. Bad news (FUD).
2. The role of social media.

# Bad news

In May 2021, the Chinese State Council released a summary of the Chinese government's plans for mining and trading Bitcoin. It stated that the Chinese government wants to stop mining and trading in Bitcoin.

Half a day later, this news item led to a fall in the Bitcoin price of more than 10%. But not only Bitcoin had to suffer, the altcoins also experienced a drop in price. This isn't the first time China has released a similar news story.

In addition to the bad news from China, there have been more examples of negative news lately. A similar message came a month earlier from Turkey where the Turkish Central Bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. The rationale for the ban is the risks associated with the transactions and protecting the national lira.

The latest news came from the US, where the Senate approved the infrastructure bill, which contains stricter tax-reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers.

# Social media

Elon Musk pushed the price of Bitcoin up in February 2021 by reporting that Tesla had purchased 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin and that it is possible for customers to pay with Bitcoin. Then the opposite happens. In the tweet, the 'Dogefather' said that Tesla no longer accepts Bitcoin as a means of payment. The reason for this is that mining Bitcoin is too polluting for the environment, according to Musk. This resulted in a price drop of Bitcoin.

# The psychological consequences for investors after a price drop

Why is the crypto market reacting so strongly to these news reports and social media content? Let's first distinguish different types of investors within the crypto world. To date, there is a relatively small diversity of investors within the crypto world compared to traditional investors.

The different types of investors explained are the early adopters, institutional investors and the lazy investors. The market cycle is then discussed and finally, the psychological consequences of a price drop are explained.

# Types of investors

You have the early adopters, these investors got in early and know the ropes. The large price fluctuations are nothing new and the early adopters are not impressed. These investors are usually steadfast with a strong belief in the product, after all they were one of the first to get in for a reason.

In recent years there has been an influx of institutional money. This means that investment funds, investment companies and banks are entering the market, as well as leading companies such as PayPal and Google.

This is a change from the bull run in 2017 where the increase was mainly driven by retail investors. These new entrants have a strong capital which drives the price of cryptocurrency further up.

Finally, there are lazy investors. These are investors who want to quickly profit from the success of the rising cryptocurrency. They step in on the advice of someone from their social circle in an upward trend. This is called the FOMO phenomenon.

The fear of missing out takes over from rational thinking and people step in blind. These investors have done little to no analysis and are in it for the money, limiting their crypto knowledge: There is too little knowledge about technological developments, BTC price history and an investment strategy is unknown to them

# Little diversity

A consequence of this small diversity of investors is that the chance that they use the same investment strategy increases. The investors in the crypto market tend to follow a large group (r/CryptoCurrency) and therefore also use the same decision strategy. This increases the volatility within the crypto market. When fear reigns, the investment strategy is forgotten. Potential gains evaporate and losses are taken (buy high, sell low).

# The market cycle

A market cycle is the movement within the market with psychological causes. The different motivations within the cycle can be seen in the following figure. The upward movement is mainly driven by enthusiasm, FOMO and following other investors.

Greed and faith play an important role in this. Rational thinking turns into irrational thinking. An overconfidence bias arises, which means that you have too much faith in the choices you have made. Risks are lost sight of and making a loss seems impossible at this stage.

Then, when prices start to fall, greed gives way to fear, denial and panic. Moreover, the ego gets a bang because the big drop shows that your judgment was not as good as you thought.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4saxsfwyu9i71.jpg?width=816&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2299b78eb6eb69210ddf8eec045f9b692c1e973

# The psychological effects of a price drop

The crypto world lacks objective information and this results in uncertainty. There are no annual reports available as is the case on the stock exchange. In the crypto world, the value is determined by supply and demand, potential, the development team, speculations, social media and news reports.

Moreover, many projects are still in the start-up phase where ideas are fully developed. Bad or good news can therefore do a lot to the value of a price, let alone the opinion of a very influential person involved in a tweet (Elon Musk).

This can make the price rise tens of percent but just as easily as dropping like a brick. Early adopters are less impressed by this. But the unwitting investor develops fear which can result in a wave of sell orders. This is where the wheat is separated from the chaff. Another example is the Chinese news item mentioned earlier in this article, a similar message also came out in 2017 and 2013.

# Cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is an unpleasant feeling that arises when making choices. Nobody likes to make the wrong choice. And certainly not when money is at stake. For example, when you purchase a cryptocurrency, you will convince yourself that this is the right choice. After all, you want to keep the good feeling and not regret your purchase. You adjust your attitude, behavior or your thoughts to avoid the bad feeling.

You look for messages and sounds to confirm the good feeling. To avoid the bad feeling after a purchase, investors tend to herd and look for confirmation. Because if everyone else does it, then it must be good right?

If we look at the negative tweet from Elon Musk, we see this happening. One negative tweet from a person highly regarded in the investment world resulting in a whole bunch of people wanting to sell their crypto.

It seems that all these investors have blind faith in Musk and are willing to sell their crypto without a long reflection. This is due to the previously mentioned lack of knowledge and experience of investors.

# The influence of social media on the course

Herd behavior is a fertile ground for the emergence of hypes. The crypto world is an example of this, but also think of the internet bubble or the housing market bubble. The internet and social media amplify herd behavior through the enormous reach, especially of influential people with millions of followers.

A tweet with a maximum of 280 words can shake the entire crypto world to its foundations. For example, Mr. Musk has influenced the market several times in both a positive and negative sense. The question that arises from this is why would he do this?

The reason he is trying to push the price up seems simple, more profit for Elon. But why would Musk want his investments to be worth less? And then buy cheaper again? Elon Musk knows the market like no other, he knows when he expresses himself negatively that a large herd follows his 'advice', causing the price to fall.

When investors panic, it ignites other investors and investor behavior becomes predictable. This is precisely where opportunities lie for investors who keep their cool and do the opposite of the herd.

Invest when no one dares. Don't be fooled by whales. But remember if you buy then someone else sells but for what reason? Enough profit? No more confidence? Behind the purchase and sale of this transaction is a motivation, a train of thought.

# We are looking for confirmation

Social media is also a place where investors look for confirmation (social proof), especially with existing algorithms on social media, you will be linked to like-minded people. A danger of this is that tunnel vision arises because you are only looking for confirmation.

The positives stand out but the negatives of the investment are ignored. The right and above all diverse sources of information help to prevent tunnel vision. This phenomenon is called confirmation bias.

Another danger of social media is repetitive and simple information, which sticks in your memory better than complicated white papers. In addition, the search for confirmation is reinforced on certain forums, communities and Facebook groups.

# Conclusion

Social media and news channels amplify fear and uncertainty among investors, especially inexperienced and ignorant investors. This group is more sensitive to reports than other investors such as the early adopters. Media platform forums increase the herd behavior and irrational thinking of investors during a price drop. A number of psychological consequences follow from this:

* Tunnel vision
* Herd Behavior
* Social proof
* The same decision moments
* Panic Selling &amp; Growing Uncertainty
* Confirmation bias
* Anchoring heuristic

A cocktail of these consequences results in high volatility within the crypto market. If negative sentiment takes over, the price could decline and could end in a bear market. It is striking that after such big correction as the we saw this year, large numbers of crypto are often purchased by the so-called whales, early adopters and other parties, which gives the price a small boost. It may go against your logic to invest in a downtrend. But making money succeeds where others panic. If the majority of people sell, then there are opportunities there for the calm investor.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Tapering announcement overreaction as possibility to cut losses?,"For some time I'm grappling with an idea of cutting losses on some of my subpar financial decisions. From time perspective I see how irrational those decisions have been and how today with more informed mindset I wouldn't buy them, rushed decisions have been made and while the company itself does not look totally hopeless I'm considering whether I wouldn't recover from the loss faster simply by relocating same cash to VOO or blue chip stock. Those bags are not particularly heavy, but I'm -30% on it and I'm mostly holding it now to sell at loss at some point anyway to cover for my gain tax on other holdings.    


Seems like market found yet another thing to overreact on with announcement we all saw coming in a while: Fed's laying out their approach to tapering the QE, maybe even still in 2021. As I am writing this, futures on SPX have sinked to 4350, around 100 points below ATH, with probably still some room to go down, but I don't expect anything in the shape of true correction.

  
The way I see it is an overreaction to the catalyst we all knew was coming and should be at least partially priced in for some time and I'm expecting S&amp;P to go back to pushing new heights within a month. At the same time I feel like irrationality will be more impactful on more risky stocks of developing companies, depending on credit lines to remain open for cheap funding. So selling them now would probably limit my losses, and allow me to at least partially recover on my blue chip/VOO that I expect to be up and humming in no time.

This is probably quite amateur approach, but do you think there is a merit behind it?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Decentralized Stablecoins / Maker MKR &amp; Terra LUNA,"With Tether being very untransparent and regulators taking action against centralized stablecoins it is important to look take a look at decentralized alternatives. After all, what’s the point of using DeFi if the stablecoin you are using is centralized?

[I wrote a post about Maker and Terra on publish0x if you are interested](https://www.publish0x.com/2sats/the-importance-of-decentralized-stablecoins-the-maker-protoc-xdgdqze?a=openrBoPe7)

Here is a summary

**Maker** issues the USD stablecoin DAI on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of holding fiat, Maker holds cryptocurrencies as collateral and has various precautions in case the value of the collateral drops, like automated selling and a treasury. The value of DAI is kept close to the dollar by a control in supply and demand. if needed the protocol makes the fees higher to discourage people from minting new DAI or increasing a possible interest rate you could earn with DAI to encourage people to make more DAI.

**Terra** is a proof of stake blockchain that uses Cosmos tech to bridge to various other blockchains. it can send its stablecoins to Ethereum and theoretically every proof of stake chain. You can create stabelcoins of many different fiat currencies on Terra. The unique thing is that their stablecoins are not collateralized but kept stable with an algorithm. To create a stablecoin you need to burn the equivalent dollar value of LUNA, and you can burn the stablecoins to get the equivalent dollar value of LUNA back. If LUNA has a value of $1 then you need to burn 10 LUNA to get 10 UST. If the value of LUNA is $0.50 and you burn 10 UST then you get 20 LUNA.

This creates an incentive to regulate the supply and the value because should the value of UST somehow drop to $0.50 you could get an instant 100% return by buying UST and burning it for LUNA, this would lower the supply and increase the value. Should the value get higher than $1 then you could get an instant profit by buying LUNA and burning it for UST which would increase its supply and lower the value. like with all stablecoins there are always little price fluctuations, but traders can make profits by stabilizing the value again.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is there a calculator and/or easy way out there to see how much a few extra payments will help towards a loan?,"Picking up a Tesla next week. I'm borrowing $50k @ 1.99 for 72 months.

Currently owe ~ 66k in student loans. I make 95k before bonus. Got this new job while payments were @ $0 (previously with the state on the pslf track), so never have had to make a payment due to the pause on federal loans. Since about February, I've been putting $1000/mo. At my student loans, and the plan was to continue to do so until they resumed at the end of next month. Basically wiped out all the interest that hadn't capitalized and paid it down a few several thousand! 

Now that they are pushed even further to January, I'm thinking maybe it's more prudent to put some extra month towards the car loan in order to lower my monthly and chip away at the total interest I'll accrue and pay over the next 6 years.

TL;DR: all the repayment calculators I see online assume you'll be putting extra $$ each and every month for the life of the loan. Is there an easy way to see interest savings/what my monthly would approx. be if I say, put $500/mo. extra for the next 4 months? 

I tried to subtract my payment + $500 from the loan balance four times, adding 1/12 of the annual interest @ 1.99. is that napkin math correct?

EDIT: I neglected to mention my motivation to do so comes from the fact I'll be refinancing once I actually need to start repaying my student loans again. Last I checked, my rates were in the 2% range... So the extra wrinkle is whether it's worth to pay down a smaller loan that's accruing interest now vs. a larger loan that's on pause?",finance

I keep thinking eventually the maintenance costs will get less and less once I get all the big stuff out of the way, but I'm starting to realize this just might be a normal thing as a landlord and maybe I should just get out of the situation and sell the house. The other issue though is that I don't know what I'm going to do with the $200,000 once I sell, and in 6 years when it's paid off that extra money from rent will help with future maintenance costs, but is it all worth it in the end to keep it as a rental? Sorry for the long post, I'm just hoping someone here with renting experience can help me out with my decision. Thanks in advance!",finance

defi,BridgeMutual,"Thoughts on this?  They pretty much just launched the app. They also got audited by Kozoyo, they audited a handful of project but nothing huge yet.  Bridge Mutual is an insurance dapp.  So like Nexus Mutual but there are some key differences. They are working on making Bridge Mutual a DAO, and anyone can add pools kinda like Uniswap.

I want to know what your guys thoughts on this. The interest rates are nuts, I think its because there is not a whole lot into it yet.  But at the same time it is very very risky, kinda.  So basically from what I understand, if you put 100k into insuring Anchor Protocol, if it gets hacked you will lose some or all of the money you were backing. Until then (hopefuly it never gets hacked) you earn interest with BMI tokens. I think Nexus Mutual is similar but Bridge Mutual is doing 100+% for insuring some of these projects.  I'm it'll go down as more people will get into it, that's how it works I guess.

personalfinance,Dentist overcharged by $700 and the anesthesiologist's assistant is giving me the run around for reimbursement claim form information.,"So this comes in 2 parts. 2 months ago I had my wisdom teeth and another tooth extracted. The oral surgeon was concerned about my sleep apnea and brought in an anesthesiologist to handle that part of the operation. 

The anesthesiologist's assistants told me that they don't bill to insurance and that I would need to file a claim for reimbursement and charged me $750 5 minutes before I went under. 

The dentist's assistants told me that the insurance didn't cover part of the procedure for the front tooth extraction, bone graft, and membrane, and that I have to pay $1071.80. Again, right before I went under. (Turns out, the insurance did cover the entire procedure and paid for that part).

That's $1821.80 I have to pay day of procedure. 

So I'm trying to fill out the claim form but there's a section that says it needs to be filled out by the dentist/doctor. I've been trying to contact the anesthesiologist's office and no one would answer phones or emails (3 different phone numbers, 2 emails). I finally called the dentist office and told them to get the anesthesiologist office to contact me. Finally, I get a call from someone from the anesthesiologist's office and she gives me an email to send the claim form for her to fill out. The next day she texts me and tells me that she can't edit the PDF on her computer. She just gives me minimal information (doctor name, license number, nothing else) and tells me fee amount, dental codes, tax number, contact information is on the receipt. I have the receipt on hand but I found that incredibly unprofessional to say ""Here's a pic of minimal information, the rest is up to you"".

So I fill out the claim form as much as I can, but I still need a signature from the doctor himself. She tells me that she doesn't see him directly and that she just handles the business side. At this point, I'm fed up with this unhelpful person and I say, ""Who can I send the claim form to get a signature?"" She gives me an email and says, ""Here's his assistant. She'll print it out and have him sign it tomorrow"". So I send the email to the assistant. That was 3 days ago and I've heard nothing. 

While on my hunt to get this claim form filled out, I get an email on the explanation of benefits. Here's the differences from the EOB vs the receipt the dentist gave me.

&amp;#x200B;

||EOB|Dental Receipt|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dentist Submitted|$4943.00|$4923.00|
|Adjustment|($3277.00)|($2408.00)|

|Courtesy on membrane (receipt only)||($256.00)|
|Owed by patient|$333.00|$1071.80|

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I'm quite frustrated with everyone involved (except insurance, ironically, because they covered something I was told they wouldn't cover). So, what do I do? I called the dentist office about this and they said that their billing was handled by a separate office and that they would have someone from the separate office call me back but I have little faith in that happening.",finance

I haven't filed for S or C corp designation, just going with disregarded/pass through tax treatment right now because my side hustle income is so negligible. I'm in California.

I've been reading a lot about the 15.3% self-employment taxes and how they need to be paid quarterly in most situations. However, I believe I can file a new W-4 with my 9 to 5 employer to withhold extra income. I've read that increasing my withholding with my W-2 employer will negate the need to file quarterly estimated self-employment tax payments. I'd much rather do that instead of having to make quarterly estimated payments when my side hustle income is so variable right now.

Am I right to think I can just file a new W-4 with my 9 to 5 employer and then be done with it? How much should I increase on my W-4 while my side hustle income is so new and variable? Is there still a need to file any extra/quarterly tax payments with the feds/state?",finance

The only stable companies are the likes of $FB $GOOG $MSFT etc. Small and mid-caps are being stomped.

personalfinance,"Does this ""Should I buy points"" mortgage calculator get it wrong, or perhaps have two results?","It simply takes the cost of the points and divides the monthly savings on total payment into it, resulting in ""months to pay off."" 

But if you look at the monthly amortization schedule on any mortage calculator, the monthly interest portion goes down way more than the total payment goes down when you input a lower interest rate. And principal payment goes up substantially.  

So the amount of time to break even on buying points seems to me to be much shorter than this calculator says, since if you perhaps sell the house in 10 years, you will have paid off way more principal on house with the lower rate (and higher principal payment monthly), but this calculator does not consider that at all.  They also don't mention it in their discussion at bottom.

My back of napkin calculation says it is almost doubling the period till break even. Or am I not thinking about it correctly?

https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/should-i-buy-points-mortgage-calculator

EDIT

200,000 mortgage at 3% for 30 years first month payment is 500 interest plus 343 prin=843


200,000 mortgage at 4% for 30 years first month payment is 666 interest  plus 288 prin =954

So if you only consider interest savings thanks to points buydown of 666-500=166 but lets change that to $130 since interest drops to around 600  over 5 years, so $130 is rough average for monthly savings in early years.  So say 4000 in buy down points will pay off in 31 months. That calculator says approx double that.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, August 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 19, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterday’s session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserve’s July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. 

Yesterday’s meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

Today, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Fed’s assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”

On inflation, the minutes said “With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory” and “Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.” However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.

In short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, “A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.”

I recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans ASAP or should I invest?,"I have over $200k in federal student loans. The interest rate ranges from 4.3-7.6% but interest is frozen through February I believe.

I'm about to start my new job making $200k a year. This is a pretty high stress job and most people burn out after a few years. Most likely, I'll only stay 2 or 3 years before moving on to something lower paying.

CryptoCurrency,The most optimal way to store your seedphrase,"So I’ve been thinking about what the most secure way would be to store your seed phrase. Proofed from break-ins, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, hacking and genital mutilation. So here’s my foolproof solution: 

Buy a Nintendo DS and a copy of Pokemon Diamond. Never connect that shit with whatever, though it’s not like you can since nintendo blocked up wifi services. Fly to the fucking sahara and dig 30m deep if you have to. Since seeds are made up by 2048 different words times 12 or 24 you’re gonna go ahead and catch Pokemon and level them up to the value of the last two digits, and give them a hold item to hold while making sure you got the amount of the last two digits of it in your bag. So a level 41 Slowbro holding a rare candy while you hold 3 in your bag translates to value 0341, which translates to clever, see what I did there? Except now you’re gonna offset every value by 2. You claim the original seed the Pokemon give you and plant a small treasure in it of 1 ether, if people ever find out they’re gonna wonder why you went to such lengths to hide your seed phrase this well to begin with, but by that time Eth hit 100k. To order your words, just place them randomly in your box between junk Pokemon. How are you gonna recognize your seed phrase pokemon? Simple: you give them a tm exclusive move for that pokemon as marking. Then when you find your 12 or 24 pokemon. Go to pokedex and order by size small to big. And voila, your decoded seed phrase you can put your 69 million safemoon in. 

Next make a plastic vacuum seal around the cartridge. MAKE SURE YOU SAVED THE GAME AND THAT ITS BRAND NEW. Make a small incision under your armpit and place it in. Sew that cut up and start growing armpit hair to cover up the scar.

You’re gonna be hodling for life😎",cryptocurrency

retirement,I think we are both going to punch out - from $130K gross to $80K - it's about the kids,"I can retire from federal gig in 18 mos.   with about $42K in SOCSEC and pension.  
Wife is  51. She can retire from teaching gig with $36K in a plan that ""levels to social security"" meaning, her pension will be cut when she starts drawing  SOCSEC   
So that  leaves us about $80K total   


We will also have $300,000 in 401K and ZERO debt other than the house. ($1000/mo) and about $800 for health insurance. (both currently healthy)   


Our current net is $52,000  as we load retirement account.  We live in low cost area and cook better than most restaurants in 100 mile radius.   


It's scary taking a $50,000 hit on gross but it really seems doable.  


Also,the boys will be 12&amp; 14 when we punch out.   This allows us to focus on them as they leave the nest.   As older parents we know We may not be around when they are adults. we need to pour in as much as we can while we can.  


There will also be another $12-20K in Social security for the boys which i think, if invested will cover them for college. (in-state)

personalfinance,Student Loan and 529 Plan - Is this a sane strategy?,"Let's say I have $50k owed on a consolidated federal student loan at 6%. I have cash and liquid investments to pay off in full. A change to the Section 529 plan in December 2019 includes student loan payments as an approved education expense at a maximum of $10k annually.

Assuming a very simple and speculative 8% average return, could it be worthwhile to open a 529 account, fund it at the balance minus expected gains and pay down the student loan over 5 years at $10k a year plus interest? The strategy is capturing the spread between student loan interest and tax-free investment gains, and either making the last loan payments for each year out of investment gains or accumulating them all to the fifth year and running down the account then.

As for the risks, investment gains could be lower than the interest rate or, even worse, there could be losses. Even in the best case, I don't know how to factor in the tax advantage from investment gains that make this strategy worthwhile versus simply paying the loan out of brokerage withdrawals. I think there's additional risk (and reward) in accumulating gains over the life of the strategy, as one year's gains could be wiped out by next year's losses (or next year could benefit from not touching last year's gains).

On the margins, paying off the loan now means that monthly student loan expense doesn't impact applying for a large loan like a mortgage in the intervening period; I already purchased a home and have a mortgage but could see moving in the next 5 years. It's also kind of a guaranteed return in that I won't be paying the 6% interest through the life of the loan.

CryptoCurrency,"This is Hal Finney's last post to bitcointalk.org. For those who don't know, Hal was the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction, directly from Satoshi himself","I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. I’m still coming to up speed on that one. Same with ETH 2.0 “validators.”

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code for free.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,791,118 BTC out there at a cost of 46,900.79.

That means, the market cap is 46,900.79 x 18,791,118 = 881,318,279,183.22 (881B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 32,127,627,594. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more.DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 2.44 that means the market cap for Cardano is2.44 X 31,948,309,441 = 78,391,411,329.36 (78B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

130,926,176,669  + ((10,000\*60\*24\*365) = 136,182,176,669 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)136,182,176,669 \* 1 = 136,182,176,669

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594  \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.02 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence.  They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are the first versions of Smart contracts. They are essentially images that are written to the block as a token, that can then be stored in a digital wallet with a certain policy retention.

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

personalfinance,How can “we” see the general day to day trend of mortgage interest rates?,"We are doing our first home loan since being back from overseas for an extended period.  We hunted and found a company we are happy with.  We were quoted 2.875% with no points with good closing costs.  But, while waiting for some things it bumped to 2.99%.  We needed to start the process, but our guy told us we can “float the rate” once before final closing.  He said he doesn’t make any commission on rates, but I’m skeptical of everyone :). I’m going to text him to check on rates daily, but didn’t know if there was SOMETHING I could keep an eye on that might indicate the rates went back down a bit?",finance

personalfinance,Questions about refinancing private student loans,"Hi guys, I just graduated college this month and started a new job, and am in the process of refinancing my student loans.

A little background: I have roughly 70k in private loans (Citizens bank) all ranging from 6.88-8.74% interest, and have been working a job for 2 weeks (75k salary). I have another 22k in federal loans that I'm leaning towards not refinancing (if anybody here can convince me though I'm open to it).

I had a couple questions about the process that I wanted to get some input on:

1. When checking rates/applying should I be using the principal loan balance, or should I include the accrued interest as well? I'm not quite sure how it all works.
2. Will my short employment time harm my rates at all? I just began my grace period so if it makes sense to wait longer I can do that.
3. Are there any resources besides NerdWallet I should know about for the best rates?

Thanks for the time and the advice!!",finance

defi,Can you win from Impermanent loss?,"I've got a question/ Strategy for you guys.

In a bear market and only in a BEAR MARKET...

If I was to yield farm eth/usdt. As the price of Eth falls my allocation in the pool would be rebalanced, leading to an increase in the number of Eth I own and a decrease in USDT. Is that correct?

If I aimed to exit the pool at the lows. I would have increased my Eth allocation. Setting me up for the next bull run.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I am asking are:  
\- I do not wish to sell my Eth.  
\- Yield farming rewards are greater than blockfi by a lot  
\- so why not take advantage of a high interest rate and increase my eth allocation at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I do not wish to sell my ETH is because of tax. If I sell at where I believe the top is, the market would need to fall more than my tax rate, in percentage terms, before I bought back in. Otherwise I make a loss. So I would have to buy back in after a 25% drop minimum. And I am not to keen on trying to time that.",cryptocurrency

Newly covered today: 

1. Various rankings websites are called out for what seems to be an unbelievable number of errors that imply an anti-Cardano bias.  [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1428312666569904129](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1428312666569904129)
2. Coinbase is going to invest $500M into crypto and 10% of all profit going forward (probably increasing with time) according to Brian Armstrong. Since Cardano is listed on Coinbase and it’s a good guess they will invest in the coins they list, this is probably very relevant for Cardano.

22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano.

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

Without giving away too much personal info, I've always owed money every time tac time comes around and just accepted it. But lately I've been trying to pay more attention to stuff, I've gotten in a fairly good financial state over the past couple years and it's always bugged me that everyone I know/work next to making the same as me always get money back and I have to pay. I get every situation is different and it's probably something to do with homeownership,having kids, and/or being married. But I was recently talking with my coworker/friend about how I don't see the benefit of a lot of overtime on my checks and we were comparing and I have about twice as much taken out of my checks every week for my federal withholdings. We make the exact same amount (minus him working more ot because it benefits him) And I understand the situations are probably different as far as dependents and stuff but I don't understand how I am paying in so much and then still don't get anything back. Over the years I have gotten married and bought a house and still had to pay at tax time. The only thing that made a difference is when I had a kid, then I got some money back but it was still only a fraction of what I hear my friends and coworkers talking about. I'm just wondering if it's something I'm doing wrong or who I even go about contacting to try and see if something is actually wrong or if it just, 'is what it is'.",finance

defi,5 Upcoming DeFi Projects in 2021: A Review,"In the early days of crypto assets, there were only a few ways to make gains. One way was trading. The other way was to simply hold onto the assets, in the hope their price would rise to an unexpectedly high rate. 

Later, some forms of storing up crypto assets for interest gains appeared. Some of those projects turned out to be scams. Most notoriously, Bitfinex relied on a constant inflow of new funds, as well as Bitcoin appreciation, to be able to support its Ponzi scheme. 

The crypto market, however, did not stand to see digital coins and tokens sitting idle and waiting for a pump. In the summer of 2020, a form of decentralized finance appeared which promised to create more predictable, constant money flows based on trading and lending algorithms. Thus, owners of whale-sized wallets could see some of their assets make gains, while others could take out loans for trading positions. 

One of the key elements of this decentralized finance ecosystem is yield farming. Most generally, it means the locking up of digital coins or tokens in dedicated smart contracts. Those smart contracts can then generate liquidity for multiple other projects, including lending contracts, decentralized exchanges, or the creation of dollar-pegged coins and tokens

 

**1.SyncBond**

 SyncBond is a project taking in crypto funds and issuing crypto-based bonds. The SYNC token, which is being currently released in a year-long process, will be one of the main tools to generate passive income. Unlike usual yield farming projects, the SYNC token will not be locked directly within liquidity provider pools. Instead, SyncBond has chosen to create a crypto bond. 

This is a separate, fully crypto-based financial instrument, which at the time of issuance combines equal dollar values of SYNC tokens and UniSwap liquidity tokens. The bond exists on the Ethereum blockchain as a non-fungible token (NFT) and can be traded on the secondary market. 

The advantage of a bond is that it holds both sides of a liquidity pair. This ensures that SYNC will always be paired with some amount of UniSwap liquidity tokens and that the pair will not see its liquidity dry out. The crypto bond has the advantage of holding both assets, as a potential longer-term buy and hold strategy.

Impermanent loss is still possible with crypto bonds, though SyncBond attempts to mitigate that by ensuring stable liquidity.

**2. UniFarmer**

 UniFarmer is another one of the up-and-coming yield farming projects. It is still in the token sale stage, arriving months after some of the hottest yield farming projects of 2020. 

UniFarmer is the answer to a dilemma for small-scale investors. Choosing a liquidity pool and moving assets on one’s own can be difficult or prohibitively expensive, due to high Ethereum gas fees. UniFarmer chooses a model of pooled, automatic yield farming that optimizes yield for most users. 

The UNIF token, with a total supply of 150,000, will aim for a small-scale liquidity pool initially, of just around 80 ETH. Buying UNIF at 500 tokens per 1 ETH is similar to an ICO, except the asset will be immediately liquid through a decentralized yield farming smart contract. UniFarmer is a smaller project compared to some of the leading DeFi startups. However, even small projects can achieve significant returns from yield farming. 

**3. JuiceSwap**

JuiceSwap is an already fully functioning project complete with staking, yield farming, a non-fungible token market and a decentralized exchange. Launched in January 2021, JuiceSwap uses the principle of automatic market makers or algorithmic trading. 

JuiceSwap is one example that in the world of DeFi, there is still place for new platforms. The basics of JuiceSwap trading use the already well-known formula of UniSwap for automatic market-making. The formula, X\*Y=K, where K is constant, is used to establish a ratio between a pair of crypto assets. 

JuiceSwap uses the usual path of unlocking MetaMask or WalletConnect to access the yield farming features.

**4. Pledge Finance**

Pledge Protocol (“Pledge”) is an algorithm-driven lending platform on the Binance Smart Chain 1 . Pledge is a decentralized protocol 2 which establishes money markets with algorithmically fixed interest rates and provides its own token in an exchange called tokens based on supply and demand of certain cryptocurrencies. This allows users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of money derived from collateralized digital assets and stable coins 4 . When a user holds tokens they receive a fixed interest rate called annual percentage yield (APY 5 ) with earnings accumulated per block, while borrowers pay fixed and predictable interest. Pledge unlike other Defi 6 lending protocols can create various liquidity pools 7 with different maturities for a given crypto asset featuring fixed lending terms for each loan 

**5. Venus Protocol**

 Venus Protocol is another relatively new decentralized finance project. Its distinguishing feature is that it is based on Binance Chain, avoiding the congestion and fees of the Ethereum network. 

Venus Protocol moves away from direct yield farming but serves as one of the underlying sources of funds, which can then move into yield farming. The protocol relies mostly on dollar-pegged stable coins, where arbitrage rarely leads to big price swings and big potential losses or liquidations. 

Venus Protocol relies on a double token scheme. One of the tokens, VTU, is a dollar-pegged stablecoin. The other, VToken, is used as collateral to mint VTU or to borrow other funds. Dollar-pegged tokens allow for safer arbitrage and more predictable yields in some farming protocols. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Yield farming remains relatively complex. Choosing the right project means being aware of the high-level market risk still inherent to crypto assets. Yield farming has gone through spectacular booms and busts.

Some of the projects manage to recover, but the losses have been absorbed by the less fortunate traders or farmers. 

The appearance of new projects aims to mitigate some of the riskiest sides of yield farming. As funds locked in various liquidity vaults grows, sometimes doubling within the course of a few weeks, decentralized finance is already showing signs of being here to stay.

The trend for growth in funds locked also signs to promising times for yield farming.

While the initial hype has worn off, and there were some stark warnings and losses in the sector, new projects keep discovering better mechanisms to extract value from fast algorithmic trading, thus opening constant opportunities for yield farmers.",cryptocurrency

- Bitcoin has never to date raised anywhere near enough in fees to be secure without issuance. [It’s not even raising $1m a day in fees](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_total_transaction_fees_per_day). How is that ever going to pay enough miners to secure the network?

oil,Oil Prices Sink to 3-Month Low,"The price of oil dropped to its lowest level yesterday since May, with investors scrambling for ways to figure out the market's next move.

Data: West Texas Intermediate crude oil, a major benchmark of oil, reached $64 a barrel. In the past month, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XON) is down 5.77%, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is down 3.73%, and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) is down 12.93%.

Breaking it down: Rising Covid-19 cases is hammering oil demand. Pressure from the Fed and the price of the U.S. dollar are also factors.

Why it Matters: In addition to the investment side, the price of oil is often tied to inflation and other economic conditions. Lower prices are good for oil buyers and bad for sellers.

Final Thoughts: Oil stocks may not look pretty, but many of them do have strong dividends.

I’m Janani Ramachandran and I’m running for California State Assembly in an August 31st special election. I am a social justice lawyer, activist, and artist who has devoted my life to empowering communities who have been failed by our existing systems. I am running for State Assembly in District 18 because of the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19, and worsening income inequality, environmental catastrophes, and racial injustices. These problems demand a fresh perspective from a leader who has been working directly with her communities for years. California doesn’t need just another Democrat in Sacramento – we need a bold advocate who isn’t bought by corporate interest groups and who will deliver real progressive change for Californians. 

I’m running for State Assembly because California needs bold solutions now, starting with stronger statewide tenant protections, a $22/hour living wage and support for small businesses, ending qualified immunity for police who cause harm, investment into community alternative justice programs, a Green New Deal with a racial equity lens, and universal healthcare. I am also passionate about ensuring that we have a transparent and accountable government. 

The establishment knows my election would be a huge threat to “business as usual” politics, where the rich get richer and working-class Californians suffer, which is why corporations have poured nearly $2 million into my opponent’s campaign. I’m not taking a cent of corporate money, so the only way we can reach every voter and win this seat for the people of California’s 18th Assembly District is with an army of passionate volunteers and supporters who are fed up with the status quo.

You can join our fight for justice by donating, volunteering, either virtually or at an in-person event, following me on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and talking about our campaign with anyone who you know who could help us win this race and bring about real, progressive change for the people of California.

personalfinance,Am I in the right position to look into buying a house with my gf?,"I know the market is whack right now but I hate throwing a month of rent at something that isn’t building any value when I could be using it to pay off a mortgage. I known people are going to ask if it’s a good decision to buy a house with my gf if she’s only that. We’ve been together 3.5 years and loving together for about 1 so we’re secure there and we are on the same page. 

[I have a pretty good budget breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/euBYadF.jpg) I tried to do the [same for my gf](https://i.imgur.com/I0TnSyB.jpg) but she doesn’t keep up with it as much as I do. I overestimate costs and underestimate earnings so I should have more than it shows there but it’s pretty accurate to about what I can do per month. My gf has more expenses than listed but it’s a good baseline for us. 

I’ve got $3K I owe on my car(make double payments paid off in ~10 months) and $5K in federal student loans. My gf has about $15K in student loans and about $20K on a car. Other than that we both have about $6k in savings which isn’t ideal but we max out Roth IRA and 401k as well as living comfortably and enjoying life. I also dumped my saving to pay off a private student loan recently. 

I’m going to start with I just started to entertain buying a house so my knowledge on house buying process in minimal and I know it’s a terrible time to buy right now. I have contracting experience and plenty of free time working remotely right now so I’ve debated buying a fixer upper for cheap and fixing it until it’s move in ready. My biggest want is a garage and some land to play with also so I have some privacy. We live in central ny so it’s not too hard to do and I’ve looked into buying land and building a garage with a guest suite to live in until a house can be built. 

Is it a terrible idea to go for a fixer upper that is about $40k with about 2 acres right now? Is it better to wait out the housing cost inflation? Would it be better to buy a house that’s done now and eat the inflated cost instead of paying more expensive rent? What about buying blank land and building? Are we even in a good position to consider this?

I’m not entirely sure if this is the right place to ask this, but figured I’d give it a shot.

Currently, here is my financial break-down:

The federal loan grace period ends in March.

personalfinance,Plan for aggressive student loan repayment?,"Background: 20M, College Student, just switched majors, 3 more years left. Tuition: ~$8k/year after scholarships. I have about 12k in fed debt with a 4% interest rate, deferred. Not too worried about that one. College Avenue Student Loans: $33.9k outstanding at an average APR of 12.8% deferred. My parents have bad credit and income and I didn't have an income my first two years of college (was a nursing student so was full time student mode, now I'm a finance major and cruising on 12-13 credits/semester to be able to work full-time and still be full-time student). In a month I'll be making $15/hr after my 90 day raise, working 40-44hrs per week currently (2nd shift working and classes earlier in day, so I have time to do school by day and work by night). Take-home is over $2000 per month, but using $2000 as a base expected. Expenses are about $1250/month, next year I'll be farther off-campus and moving in w/ gf so expenses should go down ~$300/mo for the places we've looked into. I would like to be able to save and invest at least some of my money to make up for my federal loan interest, but those private student loans are eating me alive.

My car is going out on me and I was looking for a newer car. I can obviously afford a bit of a nicer car if I financed, even for 60 months or less. Credit is ~674 but just paid off my maxed out cc and won't be doing that again, so should go up and up, especially if I'm making SL payments. Tried to apply for a loan as I found the perfect car to last me thru college, and got denied an account of short credit history and too high of debt to income ratio with too little payment history. Really didn't wanna buy another shitty $3k beater but looks like I really don't have any other choices. Guess that's my cue to start paying back my student loans, too. 

After fed. loans, Spring semester should cost ~$700, so I'll be saving up to afford that myself. I had originally planned to loan $6k/semester private to help with bills as I originally planned to work PT, but now I'm thinking I should cancel my Spring disbursement and raw dog this ish, keeping interest to as low as I can manage. 

At this point, I might as well look into refinancing ASAP into a lower APR as I will no longer be in deferment, but with the hard pull and lack of payment history anyways, I think I should wait 6 months or so. Looks like my current monthly interest incurring is about $360/month now. Based on my budget, what's my best course of action?

TL;DR 3 more years of school, $33.9k private debt at $360/month interest incurring on top of ~$12k fed loans at 4% and will continue to loan fed ~$5k/year. I take home $2000+/mo and expenses are $1250/mo not accounting for entertainment. I'm thinking $450/200/100+* split for private SL/investing/savings, respectively. I do make more than $2000/mo with some overtime so would be more than $100/mo saved. Additionally, next year my expenses go down $300/mo. Really beyond what I should start doing right now I have no clue what to do over the next few years regarding my debt. I'm hoping to intern in the summers and whenever I can and hopefully get a CFP apprenticeship whenever possible, as to maintain a full-time income from here on out.",finance
personalfinance,Escrow or not? New construction query,"Hello Folks,

We are in the process of purchasing a new build, and wanted to get some input from you on escrow.

The way our lender explained it to us, escrow will contain property taxes + HOA fees. We need to pay into an escrow because we do not have a 20% down payment. It also involves paying PMI.

We have the amount saved(invested), but did not pay due to the low interest rate we got.

My question is as follows:

Does it make sense to pay the 20%, to remove the $70 per month PMI and not have to use an escrow for the property taxes? The HOA is $400 every 6 months, and I would prefer to pay the property taxes via credit cards to get sign up bonuses.

Any pros or cons to this approach? Do people do this in general? Any comments or opinions would be helpful.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm 28, running out of money, and completely unable to make decisions. Where do I begin?","Hey r/personalfinance, first-time posting. This might get long because of the context. 

10 years ago my mom passed away unexpectedly. She was not a high-income earner and did not come from generational wealth. However, she did have a will and a life insurance plan to which I was the beneficiary. The will stipulated that in the event that she pass before I turn 30, that the money of the life insurance be held in trust until I reach 30 years of age. Because I was 18 when she passed, the control of that money has been held in my mom's family -- by relatives I trust but who are also working-class and have no ready knowledge about financial planning.

My 20s have been stressful, marred by mental health issues and periods of unemployment and underemployment. I would not describe myself as living particularly beyond my means, but my recurring expenses are rent for my room, my phone bill, some very small subscriptions and such. I have about $10K in federal student loans that are in forbearance due to COVID. I don't have any large money drains such as drugs, gambling, a needy relative. (I'm single with no kids.)

Throughout my 20s I have still managed to blow through money when my periods of mental dysfunction have prevented me from gainful and regular employment. I have even received windfalls in the form of: my mother's savings account, 1 or 2 of my mother's retirement accounts, and the proceeds of the sale of my grandmother's house after her death (1/4 of the value as my mother was one of 4). That money is gone from unremarkable recurring expenses.

I have also withdrawn from the value of my mother's life insurance policy. The original value was $250K. I haven't kept records, but I would estimate that I have withdrawn $75K over the years, leaving $175K in the trust. (My cousin keeps the records and has never withheld money from me, we just don't talk much.)

Within two years I will have to liquidate the trust or face penalties. However, my ability to earn a stable income has been perpetually nonexistent. Despite having a college degree, I have worked at best in entry-level white collar healthcare work and at more often in food/bar service, physical labor, menial gigs. I have a strong work ethic, but I have never succeeded in holding down any kind of full-time white collar job due to intense and disruptive anxiety. My last job was working as a barback in my city's tourist district. I liked the job a lot and made decent money but the work environment was unprofessional and unbearable. With my city re-entering into a COVID lockdown, I asked my cousin for a disbursement and am planning to live off that through the end of the year while I am incentivized to stay home.

This brings me a lot of shame for my inability to keep up with adult life expectations and to not be able to support myself. Most of my social circle doesn't know my situation because it's so bizarre and out of the ordinary that I don't know how or what to tell them. I don't want to be associated with ""mailbox money"" trust fund kinds of young adults who come from money because that was honestly never my situation -- at the time of my mom's passing she made probably $50K/year and was supporting me and my grandmother. 

Making any sort of monetary decision brings me intense anxiety, looking at bank statements even more so. The cousin who administers the money has no ill will towards me, but we're not close and I don't know what use it would be to tell him how vulnerable and confused I feel about this predicament. It also feels disrespectful because his mom died within the past 10 years and was flat broke with no life insurance policy, etc.

Because my biggest expenditure has always been rent, I would of course love to own my own property. $175K is enough where I live now to buy a single-unit property or a condo, or even a vacant plot of land that I could build on if I really was enterprising. But my anxiety manifests in the fear that I will do so and then fall behind on taxes/insurance/repairs, and then lose my home. Even in living, as I have, with shitty roommates in dilapidated buildings, I have an intense fear of becoming homeless because that would truly be the end of it for me.

I have had contact with one or two financial planners over the years and have never committed to an action plan. It's obviously completely possible for me to invest my nest egg in a variety of things. To be honest, though, I completely revile capitalism and do not want to put my money even into an ""ethical"" mutual fund where I would hold shares in Apple, Amazon, etc. I also have no kind of savvy to invest in anything by myself. I have no interest in crypto at this time.

But as the time of my trust dispersal approaches, I know I need to firm up a solid plan so that I don't make a dumb spur of the moment decision two years from now.

Where do I even start, Reddit? Obviously I need to better manage my anxiety and I'm taking steps towards that. But I also don't even know what options I have in preserving the funds I have, let alone putting them to work to grow.

I am open to any feedback or suggestions and am happy to answer questions in comments or DMs. 

Thanks :')

stocks,"The valuation of the S&amp;P 500 is based on rapid projected earnings growth, and not necessarily overvalued as many assume.","I see a lot of posts these days proposing a relatively simple analysis: the stock market’s P/E is historically very high so it must be overvalued, and the only reason it has stayed high is because the FED is being extremely dovish, which it will be forced to stop soon as inflation heats up, thus leading to a bubble pop in the stock market. I am leaving aside my feelings about the inflation bit of this argument (I disagree that inflation will continue to run hot and that the FED will be forced to be more hawkish). Instead, I want to focus on proposing an entirely different and more justifiable reason why P/Es are so high and why the market is likely not overvalued.

The reason for the high valuations in the market is simple: growth. If the companies in the market are expected to grow faster than they have in the past, then they should be valued higher. This is in fact the case, as the current expected long run (5 years) earnings growth rate of the S&amp;P 500 is 21.8% compared to the historical average expectation of ~12%. So how do we adjust valuations for growth? Enter a ratio that is not considered often enough, the price to earnings growth ratio (PEG): simply divide the forward P/E of the market by the long run earnings growth rate. The current forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is 21.1, implying a PEG ratio of 0.97. The only times the S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio has been lower in the past 27 years (as far back as the data goes for me) is late 2008, mid 2011, the last day of 2018, and in March 2020. Each of these times was followed by a historic period of outperformance. The median value of the S&amp;P 500 PEG over the last 27 years is 1.25. 

So by PEG standards, the stock market is actually undervalued quite a bit! Now naturally, the next question should be whether the long run earnings growth analyst consensus estimates are realistic. This is debatable and a discussion worth having, and I would hope that the bears don’t simply hand wave earnings estimates away and say they’re way too high. Even if we discount their estimates significantly, the S&amp;P 500 has quite a bit of room to run through the end of 2022:

Let’s consider long run earnings growth estimates are too high, perhaps by a very significant 20%, and by the end of 2022, the PEG reverts back to its long run mean of around 1.25. Therefore, the actual long term earnings growth rate would be 17.44%, and the forward P/E at the end of 2022 should be 21.8. Current analyst estimates for S&amp;P earnings in 2023 are $236/share, so the implied S&amp;P price by end of 2022 is $5,145, 16% higher than it is today, even if long term earnings growth is overly optimistic by 20%!

I welcome your critiques and encourage avoiding hand waving or overly simple analysis without nuance.",finance

BACKGROUND 

Lending and borrowing is a critical part to any growing economy by stimulating the economy. We know this from as low down as borrowing some money off a relative or friend, to borrowing money from a bank to pay for a car. 

The premise of lending and borrowing is that the borrower is willing to pay additional interest to the lender to have access to more capital immediately. However, how is this applied to the crypto space? 

DEFI AND CEFI 

Effectively the lending and borrowing access within the crypto space is through either decentralised protocols: AAVE which is a blue chip example or it’s accessed through centralised finance such as: BlockFi another blue chip example. 

CEFI businesses work a lot like the traditional financial banks by taking custody of deposits and lending them out to willing borrowers such as institutional or regular retail investors. The issue surrounding CEFI lending and borrowing is the exact same security risk as CEXs (centralised exchanges) which is losing founds through malicious hacks, or being locked out of accounts. 

This is where DEFI tends to flourish for those who do not want to participate with the CEFI risks as it allows you to maintain custody of your assets. DEFI lending is unique because it’s of course decentralised but also is conducted in a permissionless way. This means you are able to access these services without the need for KYC (know your customer) due to the fact these are operated on smart contracts. 

HOW DOES IT WORK

Individuals who are willing to become lenders provide their tokens and coins to a money market. Money market meaning a section of the financial market where financial instruments with high liquidity and dealing with debt are done. The lender in return receives interest based upon the APY (annual percentage yield), the lent assets are placed within a smart contract and are available for others to borrow. 

For supplying tokens, the lender will receive tokens that represent the supplied tokens plus interest. These tokens can be called various names depending on the protocol but for an example as I previously mentioned AAVE, the lender will receive Atokens which can be redeemed for the underlying token or coin. 

For the borrowers for most protocols, the loans themselves are over collateralised meaning the borrower must supply tokens or coins which act as collateral that is worth more than the actual loan. Many traders will utilise this to increase their leveraged positions with borrowed capital. 

How much can I borrow? Well the amount that can be borrowed depends on the liquidity in that particular market and the collateral factor for the supplied tokens. The amount you can borrow takes into consideration the amount and type of token that will be put up as collateral. 

How does collateral work? Well the length of time for borrowed funds can theoretically be unlimited if the follow condition is met: 

The value of the loan &lt; the value of the collateral x the collateral factor. 

&lt; meaning less than. 

If the collateral falls below the value of the loan then the collateral will be exhausted and liquidated. 

HOW DOES THE INTEREST WORK 

Essentially the interest is determined by the ratio between the supplied and borrowed tokens or coins within that market. The borrowing APY will be higher than the supply APY as the interest paid by the borrower is earned by the lender. The interest rates for some protocols are variable interest rates which means they’re not fixed and will fluctuate depending on the supply and demand, whereas other protocols may use stable APY which are fixed for a period of time but will change over time. 

FLASH LOANS

You may have heard this terminology from time to time but essentially a flash loan means a borrower can instantly borrow a large amount of capital without collateral for a short period of time based on an atomic smart contract pool and is completed within the same blockchain transaction. Typically flash loans are used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.

solar,Some quotes in Los Angeles - any thoughts?,"All prices are *pre-incentive*, I *think* Energysage quotes are preincentive. 

I got told previously that folks were seeing $2.50-$2.75 for decent gear out in the marketplace, but I'm really wondering about equipment and install quality. I'm also wondering if that estimate is pre or post federal tax credit... 

Southern California, Los Angeles, big house but with weird roofing; so I'm also using my detached garage. I've wasted 9 months with Tesla Solar roof; and they're now doing their third complexity reprice.

1. Semper Solaris.

Basic cost (less $2750 for circuit relocation and new board, less $1000 trenching) : $64k; pre tax credit. $3.7/watt
Enhanced Limited Warranty where Solaria also pays any S&amp;H for panel replacement below the rated output for the system.
What do you think?

2. Sunpower by Green Convergence

16.9kW, claiming 24kWH generation at $2.55/watt - $43,146 [With a battery!]

Any thoughts?

Also, any thoughts on using the solar installer to do roofing rather than finding a roofer? 

As much as going with a highly reputable installer and using Sunpower goes; I can't tell if I'm just paying a huge premium on equipment, paying a huge premium for better installers, or just getting bilked on quotes 1 and 2.

CryptoCurrency,"Blockchain use-cases, more then currency!","We hear people say that crypto is the future, everyone is so bullish on their projects cough cough ‘Algo’.. ohh excuse me.
But I can bet that most of us have never interacted with a blockchain before, and probably trading coins on platforms like binance/Coinbase, so, why is blockchain the future? in this post I’ll try to explain 2 optional use cases for blockchain:

-cryptocurrency: 
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend (BTC, Ltc, Doge). 
Our financial system today is ruled by central banks, those control our funds, monitor every financial movement we do and shift global economics by raising or lowering interest rates. 

If you add to this the fact that our financial system is old and inefficient, transferring money over seas can be crucially long and hefty in fees, our fiat loses value consistently and the banks gives you close to zero interest on your funds, it’s only natural to look for other solutions, hence, cryptocurrency!

- decentralized, not control by central banks.

- anonymous.

- fast and international, using the right crypto currency can let you send funds in a matter of seconds.

- Cheap, some cryptos out there are dirt cheap to send.

- Secure, once you owe a crypto, it’s yours, and the whole blockchain can validate it.


Blockchain to serve for voting!

The blockchain technology draws its power from the peers—or nodes—on its network to verify, process, and record all transactions across the system. The data exists on the “chain” supported by millions of nodes simultaneously. 

Thanks to encryption and decentralization, blockchain’s database of transactions is incorruptible, and each record is easily verifiable. The network cannot be taken down or influenced by a single party because it doesn’t exist in one place

any type of data transmission is possible via a blockchain. This kind of system infrastructure is extremely useful for voting because a vote is a small piece of high-value data. 

Out of necessity, modern voting systems are largely stuck in the last century, and those that want to vote must leave their homes and submit paper ballots to a local authority. 

Why not bring this process online?
So far some have tried but mostly
for security issues the process have been denied.

Blockchain can solve the many problems discovered in these early attempts at online voting. A blockchain-based voting application does not concern itself with the security of its Internet connection, because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to affect other nodes. 

Voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible. 

If you reached all the way down, I’m honored, and hopefully gave some perspective. If I’ll see that people are liking this content I’ll make a follow post with more usecases such as supply chain, voting, NFT’s and more!",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The New Nightmare of Central Bank Digital Currencies,"A Twisted Tale
Imagine one day you walk into a local grocer, grab a few items from the shelves, then head over to the checkout. The cashier scans your items like normal, and you pull out your card to pay. But as you tap your card, a message flashes up onto the cashier's screen.

""I'm sorry sir, I'm afraid I can't let you purchase any garlic bread this week, that would take you over the amount of calories recommended by the Ministry of Health. New rules this week"".  ""Oh"", you respond with a half-smile, ""that's ok I guess, don't worry about it"".  The cashier looks back at you awkwardly and you know there's more.  ""Umm, there's also the salmon, it says you purchased salmon last week. I'm afraid you can only buy salmon every second week sir, the Ministry for Environmental Protection says it is essential to protect the oceans"".  You stare blankly as the cashier takes the garlic bread and the salmon out of your bag, then leave with your other items.

On the way home, you stop at a petrol station to fill up your car. As you scan your card, a message pops up on the bowser screen: 'You have 25 litres of fuel allowance remaining for this month. Thank you for helping save the environment'. Only 25 litres left. Looks like you won't be able to take your kids to visit their grandparents this month, you need that fuel to get to work. You head into the petrol station, grab a drink and head up to the counter. As you scan your card, another damn message pops up on the screen in front of the attendant.  ""I'm sorry sir,"" says the attendant, ""it says you've exceeded the limit on purchases of sugary items for the week. The President says we have to take the War on Obesity seriously"".

No garlic bread. No salmon. No visiting family. No drink.

Why are you not allowed to spend your own money?
Money is a pretty great thing, a medium of exchange that allows people to freely and readily exchange goods and services for what they really want. On the other hand, Central Bank Digital Currencies present a nightmare for freedom. Governments have always had an interest in controlling their citizens and shaping what they can and cannot do. Of course, there's plenty of laws governments would love to dump on their citizenry, but these laws would be too difficult to enforce. There's only so many police a country can afford, and those police are typically occupied with more serious matters. But what if governments had a simple, cheap way to enforce whatever policy they wanted? Something that could be used to control and punish offending citizens at the flick of switch? Central Bank Digital Currencies are that enforcement method.

CBDCs are different to currency as we know it today; the biggest difference lies is fungibility. What fungibility means is the ability to interchange items of the same kind, where each item is essentially indistinguishable from the other. For example, an ounce of gold is fungible, because you can exchange or substitute it with any other ounce of gold and it remains identical in value and function. Cash is largely fungible too. Even money in bank accounts is largely fungible because this 'money' is essentially stored as simple data entries. If I withdraw $100 in my bank account, the bank can give me any $100 note; they don't have to specifically give me the $100 note I originally deposited with them.

Cryptocurrencies are not like today's national currencies, in that most of them are not fungible. Each coin of a cryptocurrency has a unique identifier, stored on a blockchain database that validates it as a legitimate coin. One of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology is that it makes auditing easy; every transaction of every coin is stored and distributed across a decentralised network of computers. Attempts to manipulate data by changing, adding or removing info from the blockchain is extremely difficult since all copies of the blockchain are constantly verified against each other. Some chains do this in different ways to others, but the general outcome is the same. The disadvantage of this lack of fungibility however, is that transactions and coins are readily traceable between wallets. This may not seem like a big deal for most cryptocurrencies, given that wallets don't necessarily contain identifying information, but it really is. Remember not long ago when exchanges were flagging and discussing restrictions on 'dirty' or 'tainted' BTC that had been coin-joined? Or when the 'representative group' of shills and spruikers known as the 'Bitcoin Mining Council' were pushing the idea of 'clean, environmentally-friendly mined' BTC? What about when the Colonial Pipeline hackers got paid in BTC and the Feds traced and seized it back? Like it or not, every coin on the blockchain has a permanent, traceable history.

Why does this matter?
Because CBDCs will be non-fungible. They will have a history. They will be explicitly linked to you, and every transaction you make with a CBDC will be recorded by the government. This is an insane level of constant reporting of every aspect of your life to the authorities, who Edward Snowden unequivocally confirmed have no qualms keeping as a permanent record.

Unlike most cryptocurrencies of today, CBDCs will not be decentralised but centrally controlled. Do you trust your government not to change, add or remove your balance, especially if you are a minority or a political activist? Or to give a more pointed example, if you believe systemic racism is an ongoing problem in the USA, then you must believe that a CBDC system can and will be used to target racial and religious minorities. Worse still, governments will CBDCs to control your behaviour and spending (I say will because this is already happening in China). ""Obesity Crisis""? Forcibly limit the amount of fatty food someone can buy, no police necessary. ""Global Warming""? Forcibly limit how much petrol someone can purchase. ""Vaccine-hesitancy""? Link vaccination status to your CBDC balance and prohibit you from buying or entering whatever place the government decides. Businesses won't even have a choice to serve you or not, your money simply won't be accepted.

The more you think the worse it gets. ""Economic problems""? Implement negative interest rates or expiry dates onto CBDC balances to force people to spend their money and 'stimulate the economy'. All those Keynesian, statist economists who view saving as 'hoarding' and 'selfish' are going to enjoy forcing you to be completely reliant on the government (saving is actually fantastic for the economy, see this article for a rebuttal). What about ""Mass Shooting and Gun Violence problems""? Easy, just restrict people from buying ammunition. Again, there's no threats of police enforcement, violence or imprisonment necessary. You want to opt out of the corrupt system by buying gold, silver or alternative cryptocurrencies? Sorry, you're not allowed to purchase those items with your CBDC balance. 

Surely you're exaggerating!
Governments have wanted to do nearly all of these things before, it has just been too costly or difficult to enforce.  Think about the UK government introducing sugar taxes to 'tackle childhood obesity', or the Canadian deputy Prime Minister having the arrogance to blatantly refer to the savings of citizens as 'pre-loaded stimulus' to be 'unlocked'.  The Australian government attempted to ban cash for large transactions, while New York state has introduced vaccine passports to restrict entry to venues.  Imagine how much easier it would be for governments to control you by force if they had direct control over what you could do with your money (if you could even call it yours).

The centralised control of money has always been a disaster for society. A brief look at the history of central banking demonstrates a history of manipulation, inflation, theft, lies, propaganda, cronyism and destruction. CBDCs are just the next step in this long dark march.

What is the solution?
Oppose cash bans at all costs. Opt into alternative, hard assets now while you can. Learn about privacy coins like Monero. Take every opportunity to educate others about the dangers of CBDCs, and don't be tempted to accept CBDCs just because they come with 'free' Universal Basic Income (which I believe will be the Trojan horse for CBDCs).  Even the smallest amount of education and preparation will help.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, August 20, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 20, 2021**

Stocks rose today, recovering some of the losses from earlier this week as market participants shake off some taper concerns. Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.

On Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”

Read the full meeting minutes here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

As of yesterday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”

The U.S. now has an average of 143,827 new COVID-19 cases per day as of yesterday, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 911 people are dying each day, triple the death rate seen in late July. For context, the US was averaging roughly 20,000 new cases per day on July 1.

However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost ⅓ of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida. 

According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

**Highlights**

* The price of digital currencies surged after Coinbase (COIN) announced it was investing $500 million and would allocate 10% of quarterly profits into a digital currency portfolio. 
* Yesterday was Tesla AI Day, in which the company unveiled new technologies and ideas the company is working on. Among the most interesting was a humanoid robot that will be operated using Tesla’s full-self driving technology (FSD). The robot is designed to do “dangerous, repetitive, boring tasks” according to Elon Musk. Interesting to say the least.
* Microsoft (MSFT) boosted the price of Office 365 for the first time since the service was launched a decade ago. This caused the surge to spike to a new all-time high. The company said collaboration tools now used by more than 250 million monthly active users
* After 70 years, the MLB dropped Topps as the creator of the iconic baseball cards. As a result, Topps merger into the market was terminated a day before shareholders were set to vote.
* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued beasting after smashing earnings and raising guidance moving forward. I love this stock so much
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) continue to bleed among the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party. The stock is now way below even March 2020 level and is trading at the lowest level since June 2019.
* Facebook (FB) unveiled a new product called “Horizon Workrooms”, which is a VR powered, remote work app that uses the company Oculus Rift headset. Zuckerberg called it the first step in building a “metaverse”, which is a collectively-shared virtual space where people are able to interact using avatars. This seems like the next big trend among giant internet companies.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

personalfinance,Should I use federal student loans to pay off my credit card and medical debt?,"My fafsa covers all of my tuition.

personalfinance,Changed jobs - filled out new W4 - new employer only withheld $10 in Federal tax from first paycheck,"So I switched jobs a few weeks ago to a new position with a substantial pay raise.  As part of the process I filled out a new w4 (first one since they changed the form for 2020) and to say that I'm a bit confused is an understatement.  

I used the withholding calculator on the IRS site, and plugged in all my numbers from the previous job, as well as my wife's earnings, and how much tax has been withheld so far.  I also included our two kids, so there is a $4000 credit on the new w4 that I filled out.  

Here's what's weird - old job was taking out around $160 in federal taxes per paycheck.  The new withholding calculator, when I tried adjusting the ""refund"" slider stated that “based on filing status and income my standard withholding should be $471 a paycheck"".  

My first paycheck was for a single week instead of 2, and the federal tax withheld  was $10.05, which seems quite wrong.    I contacted Payroll and the showed me what they have entered for my w4 in the new system:

Filing Status - Married filing jointly

Multiple jobs/spouse works checked

Federal tax block : blank

SS/Med Tax block: blank

Additional withholdings: $0

Dependents total $4000

Other income: $0

Deductions: $0

personalfinance,Auto Loan: 1.79%/3-yr vs. 1.99%/5-yr,"I am planning to apply for a ~$25k car loan (through PenFed), and the applicable rates are as follows:

1. 1.79% APR for a 3-year loan
2. 1.99% APR for a 4-year loan
3. 1.99% APR for a 5-year loan

And then there are a few other longer-term loans that I have no interest in.

I can pay off the $25k loan in savings now and be just fine, but given the interest rates, I figure it's better to finance and just keep the funds in the market. Accordingly, I'm thinking it makes sense to go for the 1.99%/5-year loan given these options.

Does that seem sensible? The 0.2% higher APR is worth it to extend out the loan? Or is it better just to go for the 1.79%/3-year? I've heard of the 20-4-10 rule, but I don't quite see why four years should be the max when rates are so low and it's the same rate at five years; seems it's just between the 3-year and 5-year option.

Your loan amount is below the new conforming loan limit of $548,250.  That fact along with home appreciation and interest rate improvement is providing an opportunity for you to improve your 3.375% interest rate over .625 % with no cost.  The fact that you can refinance your loan at 2.75% right now and get a lender credit of $3348, means that your closing costs would be covered by the lender credit.

solar,"Considering Solar, weighing my options","Hey folks, I’m considering getting a solar system to both save some money and reduce my carbon footprint. Had a consultation with an installer today and was left a bit disappointed, but wanted to get others opinions on which route I should go.  I am going to get quotes from a few other installers, but this is what what the first guy proposed.

Option 1: 16 panels on the back of my roof. It faces nearly due east but slightly south, no shade at all. The other side of the roof facing west, and the roof over the garage aren’t nearly as suitable, so putting panels on the spots that would really work well would supply about half of my electricity needs. That was kind of disappointing to hear because I was hoping to offset nearly my entire bill.  Max achieved AC power for that system is 5kw and would cost about 13.2k after the federal tax credit.  Payback period is estimated to be 13.5 years.

Option 2: Ground mount system. I don’t have the detailed report on this yet, but it costs more than twice as much (28k-29k or so after tax break) but would supply enough power for basically my entire electric bill.  Payback period was about 2 years longer than the rooftop according to their model.

Curious to hear the thoughts on these two options? The thing that concerns me about putting the panels on my roof is, I will most likely need a new roof at some point before the system dies (roof is only 7-8 years old but already is a bit beaten up). That would mean the extra expense of having to take off the panels and have them reinstalled. That was not taken into account with the modeling. I also live in a very snowy climate (Vermont), so I like the idea of being easily able to clean off the snow with the ground mount. Still, what the calculations were showing is the rooftop system paid off more in the end and was less expensive up front, and it wouldn’t take up any yard space so that would definitely have its advantages.

A third option I had thought about is building a pole barn with a roof facing due south with enough space for about 24 panels. That would be enough to negate my electricity bill, and we could certainly utilize the extra storage space. The cost of the solar system would be right about in the middle of the ground mount and rooftop system would cost, but we would get much more use out of the barn rather than the ground mount obviously. Anyway, would be curious if others had weighed similar options in the past, or if anyone has any advice in general? And one more thing I was curios about, when people reference $ per watt of a system, is that commonly referring to the price before or after the tax credit? Alright thats all I got. Looking forward to reading any responses. Thanks!",energy
solana,LunaYield Rug Pull,"I haven't seen too much discussion of the LunaYield Solana rug pull (August 19th, 2021) on this thread. I was impacted significantly by the rug pull and wonder what, if anything, might be tried to track down the perpetrator and recover the funds. 

I was planning to report the incident to Federal authorities. Additionally, are there entities invested enough in the solana ecosystem that might help to recover or potentially refund some of the lost funds? I don't think this is a good look for Solana because the LunaYield project was featured on their main webpage prior to the rug pull ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210814120046/https://solana.com/ecosystem/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814120046/https://solana.com/ecosystem/)). At the very least they should provide a front-and-center disclaimer on the Solana Ecosystem page stating that the information presented is provided by the project and is not vetted in any way by the Solana Foundation. 

The project lied about their code audit status (along with basically everything else - as you would expect for a rug pull). If we as a community don't want the wild west, there needs to be a vetting process for new projects and some level of accountability. Otherwise, this will happen again and again.

CryptoCurrency,SEC Chief Says Most DeFi Project Aren’t Decentralized..,"TLDR:-**Securities and Exchange Commission Chief Gary Gensler said many so-called decentralized crypto projects must be regulated**.

**Securities and Exchange Commissioner Chairman Gary Gensler has put the decentralized finance community on notice that most projects must register with his agency**.




Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Aug. 19, Gensler said DeFi “**projects that reward participants with valuable digital tokens or similar incentives could cross a line into activity that should be regulated, no matter how ‘decentralized’ they say they are**.”

Gensler was tapped for the SEC chairmanship this year after a run as a cryptocurrency and blockchain professor at MIT, so he is intimately familiar with the industry.

In the Journal interview, Gensler took issue with the claim by many DeFi developers that because they handed project control over to a decentralized autonomous organization — or DAO — no SEC oversight is required. 

“**There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees**,” Mr. Gensler told the Journal. “*There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of this*.”

Calling the term DeFi “a bit of a misnomer,” Gensler added that most projects “**facilitate something that might be decentralized in some aspects but highly centralized in other aspects**,”

**All Cryptos Securities?**

Gensler has also taken issue with the broader cryptocurrency industry’s argument that many digital assets’ initial coin offerings —or ICOs — should not be seen as securities that the agency regulates.

On August 3, Gensler told attendees at a securities industry event, “**I believe every ICO I have seen is a security — we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply**.”

The reason, he said, is simple: “Generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits.”

He has promised strong regulation of the industry, arguing that at present that lack of disclosure or effective regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency market leaves prices open to manipulation and investors vulnerable.

CryptoCurrency,A Bitcoin ETF is Coming,"Last month (July) the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund launched. It is the first U.S. mutual fund tracking Bitcoin prices (it has a minimum investment threshold of $1,000). And while the fund doesn’t hold physical BTC or invest directly in BTC, it does trade in futures contracts based in BTC. Likewise, this month (August) Cboe Vest launched its own mutual fund: Cbor Bitcoin Strategy Managed Volatility Fund (BTCVX). Both track BTC futures. 

Side note: if you’re curious about what a mutual fund is in the US, it’s a pool of money collected from many investors (retail of institutional) to invest in any security: stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets like cryptos.

So why does this matter for a BTC ETF? Currently there are over 15 different Bitcoin ETFs waiting on approval or denial or currently delayed. They are all being put in limbo besucase regulators are worried about protecting investors from the volatility of a fund or funds holding BTC directly. 

Gary Gensler, (the Securities and Exchange Commission Chief of the US) recently suggested that he would rather consider Bitcoin Futures-based ETFs under stringent guidelines. To quote him, “I look forward to the staff’s review of [BTC ETF filings], particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.” Which is to say, his position would prefer allowing for a Bitcoin futures ETF before a pure BTC holdings ETF is launched because there is more regulation in US futures markets. And federal regulators are worried about unregulated markets. 

Is that ideal? Not exactly, no. It’s not the same as an ETF or mutual fund that allows many investors to directly participate in the holding and exchange of actual BTC. But it is forward progress, and it’s certainly worth being more bullish than bearish about, in my view. Patience is obviously necessary. Maybe it won’t be 2021 before we see *any* kind of BTC ETF, but I would be surprised if we *didn’t see* any kind of Bitcoin ETF in the next couple of years. 

TL;DR: it has never been about if. It’s a question of when. And when is getting a hell of a lot closer.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Crypto and Germany ... A perfect match ?,"You may have realized that Germany recently made it among the [top 10 crypto mining countries](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/) in the world.

This is something which I would not have expected because the German energy prices are among the highest in the whole western world. But Germany also has a very high percentage of renewable energy sources. It seems to prove that those renewable energy sources and mining operations actually go hand in hand. The possibility to use the excess power of these renewables to generate crypto instead of wasting it, seems to be real driver for both, renewable energy sources and mining.

Besides that Germany is a very crypto friendly environment in general. It is more than just a coincident that germane already attracted a lot of crypto companies to take office there (e.g. The Ethereum foundation, The IOTA foundation just to name a few).

One big point is probably the geographic vicinity to eastern Europe (one of the highest adoption rates for crypto in the world) but still having the comfort of a fully developed western world country. But this case can also be made for other central and northern European countries. In my opinion it is also owed to the prevailing mentality of the Germans, which is very favorable for crypto:

In difference to more authorial and/or imperialistic regimes, the German government dont seem to feel very threatened by crypto and is not trying to forbid/restrict it. Some politicians (on both sides of the spectrum) even consider it a opportunity to have more (as they call it) ""Internet companies"" in Germany. "" Would be nice to own a piece of that future internet thing hhhh"". In a such highly industrialized environment as Germany a lot of politicians are generally like: ""Its always good to have MORE companies"". Therefore crypto companies are very welcome in Germany and have a high level of law security compared to other countries.

In matter of taxes, crypto is treated as an asset class comparable to art. Which means if you are a collector and not a trader its tax free. Currently you only need to hodl more than 12 month to be considered a collector. But this ""tax haven"" state will probably change in the future. Politicians [recently started talking](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.btc-echo.de%2Fnews%2Fbmf-zeigt-sich-beim-krypto-steuerentwurf-uneinsichtig-124415%2F) about more effective taxation of crypto. (Thanks to u/AXTurbo for this source)

The next thing which makes a very big difference is that a lot of Germans actually care about the security of their data. Privacy and security of personal data is a very big topic in Germany and widely adopted among politics and mainstream media. Germans dont like to talk about their wealth. Personal fiances are usually kept private. This works in general favor of crypto but of course especially for private currencies like Monero.

Also Germans already experienced switches of currency. Not even that long ago:

Reichsmark to Deutsche Mark and Eastmark 1948

Eastmark to Deutsche Mark 1990

Deutsche Mark -&gt; EUR 2002

Because of that the people are not that tied to their currency and dont see it as a unreplaceable historic necessity like the USD.

Germans dont trust much into banks. This is probably because a lot of the older generations experienced  expropriation before, while and also after the second world war. The ""not your keys not your ..."" mentality is very common. Therefore Germany has one of the highest usages of cash among the western world. A lot of Germans would probably rather switch from cash to crypto than from cash to bank wire services.

Last but not least Germans are considered to like savings. The percentage of money that goes to savings is very high compared to other western countries. This is why Germans are deeply p\*ssed by the zero to negative interest rates in fiat money and looking for alternatives.

**TL;DR**: Germany is a very friendly and favorable environment for crypto. In this post I try to explain why and give some insight to the crypto friendly aspects of the prevailing mentality among the German society.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Was reading about ""Dow Theory"" this morning for investing strategy, and came across this part:","***#3 The stock market discounts all news***

*The stock market incorporates new information as soon as it becomes available. Once this news is released, the price of the asset changes to reflect this new information. The price reflects the sum of all the hopes, fears, and expectations of all the market participants. Factors such as interest rate movements, earning expectations, revenue projections, major elections, product initiatives, etc. are all integrated into the market price.*

**What this means to me?**

**Buy the rumor, sell the news.**  I've known this part of the strategy for a long time, but never really as part of an overall learning.  For me, this is why I believe we miss out on some gains as retail investors.  Institutions don't run on emotion or the thoughts of living in a tropical paradise.  They run on goals and returns for groups of investors.  This applies to stocks more than crypto in a lot of senses, but I believe crypto is heading this way as more institutions get involved.

If you've ever invested in a coin based on an upcoming project coming to completion, a fork with a series of patches, etc. and then missed on the peak of the surge - this is why.  Everyone is buying *because this change is coming*.  It's considered 'priced in' at this point.  Once the news drops, project completes, etc. then people (whether whales or institutions) start to take their 25% (arbitrary number for the sake of crypto as this would be lower in the world of stocks) and retail investors are holding in hopes of 100% gains.

**Summary**

Buy the rumor, sell the news.  Set a reasonable goal and stick with it.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
&gt; “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
&gt; “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
&gt; As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
&gt; “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
&gt; “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**

&gt; In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out

&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**

&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**

&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**

&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto firms are rushing to hire former regulators as federal agencies look to tame the 'Wild West' industry,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,What would be a form of legislation that would completely wipe out the crypto market?,"Centralization and “transparency” seems to be front of mind for congress (who honestly has much bigger fish to fry). I just don’t understand how crypto can be the focus right now. 

The equity markets have exploded thanks to a fed that will backstop anything.  We as an economy aren’t organically growing contrary to what your Schwab account says: share buybacks, acquisitions funded through zirp, and the knowledge that government feeds corporations before people is what is driving those values. 

I’m going to say something controversial here but I think one of the biggest catalysts to the way the fed acts now is when Obama bailed out GM. This set a precedent that we can’t let corporations fail even if they have mismanaged their operations.  And now that fcking clown Tillman Fertitta thinks he needs a bailout. 


Anyways, back to the original question: our extremely inept (/corrupt) government seem intent on getting in the way (or more accurately getting a cut): Can someone provide what an example of legislation that would significantly hamper progress?",cryptocurrency

His job was our main provider; with mine just being extra cushion to put back. We have about 3000 in our savings. In his 401k he has almost 3000, but pulling it out means he loses $900 to federal taxes and his previous employer took 2,000 they put into it away. What do we do? Should we pull it out?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why Is the Fed so Scared of Stablecoins?,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Trading bots time downturns to page-view metadata on exchanges to take profits and make day traders bag holders. (Theory),"You all know about the common story or experienced it yourself, You buy a coin and maybe hold it for months or weeks and you finally get tired of slow decline or trading sideways until finally you sell. Almost magically either the instant you sell or a day later the coin suddenly skyrockets. leaving you behind having broken even at best. Or maybe it seems like whenever you stare at the chart it only ever seems to dump. Perhaps you are not imagining it. 

It started as a thought experiment based on based on my observations and the common story. So I decided to test it for myself knowing that with a sample size of one I could not really prove anything. I had two exchanges (FTX and Binance) and the coinmarketcap page for a coin open. When not looking at a coin either control site would be on the home page. When looking at the coinmarketcap page I tend to see nothing but green with some red mixed in. But when I opened the page in my signed in account on FTX or Binance the green showing on the page would either start shrinking or turn red. The high frequency trading also gets more intense in a logged in account by my observation. If you leave the page and go back to market cap it usually though not always back to green. Whereas if you leave the page open for more than an hour the behavior seems to normalize. After thinking about why this was and how they would do it I had a thought. 

A family friend had invited me to a financial seminar since he saw I was interested and did not know it was for crypto, this was one of those invite only things with no phones allowed so I jumped thinking I would get some contacts. Paint was more interesting to watch dry but I saw and learned some f#$%ed up stuff like the constant shorting of Cancer companies and the profitability of subsequent acquisitions. But the thing that stuck out to me the most was a briefing on algorithmic trading. Market Makers, hedgefunds, rich individuals and wealth management firms (""Smart Money"") all trade using batches of one hundred shares. ""Dumb money"" (typically retail) almost always trade in odd or even numbers well below a hundred shares. Market Makers the middlemen who ensure trades go through and can literally print shares from nothing, use this system to completely eliminate retail trades from price discovery. While this is not possible with crypto it is what was shown next that inspired this post. **A tool assisted trading strategy based on brokerage metadata that operated on page views.** 

When multiple users are all on a stocks page on the brokerage their aggregate number increases, as it increases it assumes retail interest and buying pressure will enter and as buy order come in will begin a sell-off with retail traders as bag holders. (Brokers report this data directly to anyone who pays for it but I have heard in some sites its available in the page metadata.) Keeping the price stagnant or dropping the price. Many traders if they bought will instantly sell if the price goes down. Conversely the algorithm will place buy orders lower on the chart at a designated amount creating a buy wall. The algorithm will place small trades just below the bottom of the sell spread by a fraction of the penny and not allow retail trades to go through easily causing chain reactions that force the price lower and lower until the buy wall is met. Then the price is allowed to increase slightly, encouraging more buying as the process repeats until interest goes down and the page view and trades goes below a set threshhold then the stock is pumped by back and forth buying and the process repeats again until retail loses interest and the stock is dumped. This strategy specifically targets day-traders but holders are also effected when the stock is dumped. 

There are circumstances present in finance that simply are not in crypto that allow this and only allow large players to do it. But I see no reason it would not be possible if not easy to implement this strategy in crypto, if you are a whale with the funds . I think it might already be implemented.

I don\`t know if that data is available to the average person, but you could configure trade bots to do the same thing on crypto platforms infact while the interfaces are vastly different the buy sell spreads I see are eerily similar to the power point presentation I attended at the conference. What do you think? Do you believe this might be why people get screwed? Buy high sell low. 

TL;DR Buy and hold if you believe in the project **don\`t trade** the algorithm is designed to screw you.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"How To Amend Federal Taxes for ""dependent claim"" issue","Our 22yo daughter checked the box ""can be claimed as a dependent by someone else"" in both 2019 and 2020. We were not actually able to claim her so this needs to be amended so she can potentially receive some of the stimulus money that went to people in 2020 and 2021.

I know she can file amended taxes for 2019 and 2020 but is there something else to do to alert the IRS she should actually receive the stimulus money. We did not receive any stimulus money for her in 2020 or 2021. 

What are the steps to getting this clarified with the IRS and hopefully getting her some of the stimulus money she was actually eligible for?",finance
personalfinance,Newly married - joint account questions for mortgage planning,"We are recently married and are wondering where to make our joint checking account. I use Schwab (checking and brokerage) and am very happy with them; my wife uses Chase and BOA and is fine with them. We are looking to purchase a home in the next couple of years and are wondering how important the customer discounts end up being for mortgages.

Is it better to just pick the bank you like working with, and then have flexibility in shopping around for mortgage rates, or do the bank-customer interest rate discounts end up being significant? Schwab doesn't do its own home loans and instead goes through Rocket/Quicken. They do offer an interest deduction for account value, but my research on R/Q suggests their interest rates are not very competitive.",finance

personalfinance,Help us evaluate whether rooftop solar makes sense as an investment,"Hello Reddit, I'm gonna jump right into it.

My husband and I have been doing well with finances, so we have ended up with a surplus of money. Now for me, I have been absolutely itching to get rooftop solar, and I had some companies come out to give quotes so we had a ballpark.  But I guess we just aren't really sure if this makes sense from the lens of it being an investment. Would love some feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

* Monthly electric bill averaged out: $130 per month.

This includes it being extremely high in the summer, also we have an electric car. However we PLAN to have 2 electric cars in the future, but because we went full time WFH we have not been driving much and have put that plan off for a few years.

* Monthly Electric Bill with solar averaged out: 15$ per month.

In the solar market we are in they do the ""credit"" system so you build up account credits for the first couple months in the winter and then are left with just paying the flat rate amount to be connected to the grid.

* Warranty: the solar set up I am looking to get comes with a 25 year warranty and the warranty covers the solar cells maintaining 90% efficiency at year 25. I just throw that in because I know sometimes people like to pop up and say solar panels degrade.

**Solar costs:**

I got several quotes and I actually would like to go with one on the high side of the quotes I got. I know I could get a cheaper price, but I personally would like to go with this company because they have been in business for 20 years, they have their own installation staff(they don't subcontract out the work) and they preform any warranty work that is needed, including a 10 year workmanship warranty on roof leaks as a result of the panels.

* Full cash price: $26,000
* Federal tax rebate: 26% aka 6760
* Cash price minus rebate is $19,240

This purchase would SAVE us $115 per month, forever.

* $1380 savings per year
* $6900 savings in 5 years
* $13,800 savings in 10 years
* $20,700 savings in 15 years - At this point it has paid for itself. Still has 10 more years warranty life.
* $34,500 savings at 25 year - At this point the warranties expire, but the system keeps working and can continue to save us or the future home-owner money for MANY MORE YEARS.

In 25 years, assuming no inflation and the price of electricity doesn't go up, which is extremely unlikely but this is the least favorable way to calculate for solar, we would have paid:

* 39,000 in electric bills no solar (130/month)

OR

* 23,740 - with solar (4500 in electric bills with solar + 19,240 in the cost of the system.)

All of this assumes the cost of electricity stays the same, if it goes up(as it has historically for the last 30 years) the calculations work in my favor even faster.

* 15 grand 25 year savings by installing solar.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess the think we struggle with is like, what other options are there for a large surplus of funds like this?

* 26k is enough to put a down payment on a house and husband has been into the idea of having a rental property. - But that seems to be adding a mortgage forever, instead of eliminating a bill forever, and is increasing our monthly need to keep ourselves afloat. 
* We can just invest 26k - But how do you just ""invest"" a large amount like that? I already max an IRA every year and husband has a 401k with an employer match. It doesn't really seem like there is a vehicle to just place a large sum of money into like that. 
* He wants a pool, which can give us joy in exchange for our money, instead of solar which wont add anything to our lives, the lights will still work the same. - This seems like another lifestyle creep thing where we are just adding a bill we have to take care of forever, instead of eliminating a bill.
* What if there is another thing we should be doing that we haven't even thought of???

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion there is only one thing that is kind of a wrinkle and that is that I am currently looking to change jobs, but I am not open to relocation so we wouldn't be moving as a result of that, and also we do have an emergency fund and a second income other than my own. So to some extent I kinda feel like this is one of those things where the situation will never be perfect, and you just gotta keep living life.

&amp;#x200B;

So there ya go reddit, my husband recommended making a post here so please weigh in! For the sake of argument if I have 26k in cash just sitting around in savings accounts right now, and this is my idea of what to do with it, do you think I should do something else with it? Do you think my idea is just bad?",finance

He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awaited paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

20. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!!

21. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano.

22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
23. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
25. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that!

26. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

27. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future.

31. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

37. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

39. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

58. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects.

60. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry!

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
ethereum,Blockchain legos,"**The era of the monolithic blockchain is ending. The era of blockchain legos is dawning.**

Broadly speaking, blockchains have three functions:

1. **Execution**: Collecting transactions from users, and executing them as efficiently as possible.
2. **Consensus**: Provide security and safety - eliminate double spends, reorgs or other fraud.
3. **Data availability**: Store transaction data and ensure it's always available.

For the last 12 years, blockchains have had to do all of this all by themselves. This has lead to significant inefficiencies and bottlenecks, leading to the blockchain trilemma. To have a highly decentralized and secure blockchain, the execution side is always underutilized. Ethereum is an example of this, of course. On the other hand, you can let the execution side off the leash, but you do this at the cost of an insecure consensus, and the rampant data availability required to keep execution fed makes these networks very centralized over time due to state bloat - Polygon PoS and Binance Smart Chain being examples of this trade-off.

But what if we could separate out these three functions, so three different protocols that are focused on one of these can do what they do best? Enter blockchain legos. This is why rollups are so special. They can focus exclusively on fast and cheap execution, while letting another chain do the hard work of security and most of data availability. But, it doesn't just stop at rollups! Here are some of my thought experiments on how this can proliferate. This is just a fun experiment, don't take these nomenclatures too seriously!

|Type|Execution|Security|DA|Nomenclature|Example|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Monolithic|1|1|1|L111 or L1|Ethereum, Polygon PoS|
|Rollups|2|1|1|L211 or L2|Arbitrum, dYdX|
|Validium|2|1|2|L212|DeversiFi, Sorare|
|Volition|2|1|1/2|L211/2|zkSync 2.0, Immutable X|
|Multi-volition|2|1|N|L21N|None yet|
|Validium (external DA)|2|1|3|L213|None yet, but I bet we see Hermez + Avail|
|Data availability|0|0 (1?)|1|L001 (L011?)|Avail, Celestia, Ethereum data shards|
|L1 with external DA|1|1|3|L113|None yet, but I bet Polygon PoS + Avail|
|Security chain|0|1|0|L010|Polkadot relay chain, Ethereum beacon chain (pre-shards)|

You can take this further... the sky's the limit as zk proofs mature. Some other ideas: adding the type of proof used. E.g. L2V would be zkR, L2F would be OR. Or even, L2P would be Aztec or zkSync as they use PLONKs, while L2T would be StarkNet. Similarly, L212V would be validium, L212F would be Plasma. And before anyone asks, sidechains are just L1. Or, one could argue L222, but that's once again, just L1.

So how does this impact users? It's simple - over the next couple of years, most users will find themselves on execution-exclusive chains like rollups, volitions and validiums, instead of L1s. These will offer lower fees, higher security, and higher decentralization than any L1 ever could. Today's L1s will either need to become a rollup, volition or validium, or become a security and/or data availability chain. The latter is precisely Ethereum's pivot. Yes, there'll still be an execution layer, but it'll mostly be used to settle rollup transactions and larger financial institutions, governments, whales etc. Ethereum's greatest strength will be industry leading security and decentralization, and massive data availability with data sharding - making it the perfect home for rollups. Going forward, most users will use rollups, and rollups will then settle on Ethereum. Of course, there'll be other data availability only or security + data availability solutions emerging, starting with Celestia and Polygon Avail. Architecturally, these are actually the only competition for Ethereum going forward, till other L1s start making their pivots to the new era of blockchain legos.

I believe 90+% of all transactions in the blockchain industry will happen on rollups or other execution-exclusive chains. This is a paradigm shift in how blockchains function, and with Arbitrum One's launch imminent, this would be a great time to reorient your perspective from being L1-centric to being rollup-centric!

personalfinance,Car Refinance Increase Principal?,"Are they trying to swindle me or is this normal?

I am trying to refinance my car, my current remaining principal on my current loan is $12,416. In my refinance quote, my new principal is $14,749. That is adding $2,300 into my principal. My interest rate is going from 7.65% to 3.00%, but it seems to me the difference I would even save from switching is offset by a $2,300 increase into my principal balance. Is this normal? If so, the whole refinance business seems like a sly bunch of swindlers.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Nexo.io Opinions,"Hey guys,

I researched [nexo.io](https://nexo.io) but still somewhat skeptical. Long long long ago as a young naive dumbf\*\*k I got burned by ponzi schemes so it still rings my rugpull bells. Need this sub's opinions on:

1. How is nexo's crypto interest rates so high? I may be too used to regular bank's piss poor fixed term rates of like 0.xx% so I'm kinda skeptical on how it can consistently accrue daily interest.
2. They have some sort of insurance policy. But from what I understood, there is no legal protection. If Nexo gets hacked or have a sudden mass withdrawal, I'm worried my funds will be inaccessible or gone forever.
3. I've seen mixed reviews about Nexo. Half says its good, the other half have complaints of bad support, missing interests, etc.
4. I couldn't find their office address nor telephone number. This is shady.

Thanks in advance for your input!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,After forbearance loan modification or loan deferral ? Which would you do and why ? Any impact to credit ???,"Hi

I've been on forbearance for a little over a year.  My loan processor Loancare offered to either do loan deferral or loan modification.  

They said that neither will affect my credit.  Loan deferral they will do a small 2nd on side to be paid off after the 1st is.  They said I auto qualify for this. 

The second option is loan modification where they may lower interest rate, extend term to 40 years, etc. And approx 58k will be added to my loan balance of 460k.  Underwriters will look at how to reduce the monthly payment.  And they would send new paperwork and I would need to get notarized.  

I'd like to do one of the plans and then potentially refinance as soon as able to take advantage of low rates.

I was reassured my credit would not be impacted be either of these options.

Did you all experience the same ?  No impact to credit ?  Why wouldn't I take the 2nd option?  I probably won't be keeping my home for 30 or even 40 years.  Most likely between 5 to 10 years before my wife and I move on.

Appreciate your input and any help and feedback.

personalfinance,Do I have any chance asking for a raise working in city government?,"Sorry for all the background info but its necessary for context. So I'm a 911 dispatcher and have been with my agency since January 2020. When I was hired the training salary was $34,500 and went up to $35,500 when we finished training. Since then I've gotten a 2% cost of living raise from the city, and 5% when I was promoted which puts me at $38,300 now.

This is a chronically understaffed industry so they are literally always hiring, and in order to get people to apply they raised the recruitment salary to $37,000, which turns into $38,300 when they finish training. So despite the fact that I'll have almost 2 years more experience, new employees a step below me will be making the same as me  and then more when they get promoted and get the 5% increase (the ""promotion"" is an optional training so that you can dispatch fire and ems. You have to be approved by your supervisor but they're hurting so badly for people all you really need to do is apply).

This is an increase of about 8% since i was hired and of course they don't adjust standing employees salaries along with the starting pay. Cost of living in the area I'm in is skyrocketing and 8% would make a pretty good difference in my financial security. I know the government rarely operates around what's fair but I think asking for the same adjustment is reasonable and there are a few factors that I think lean in my favor.

I'd have to go to the director about this, and I know he has the ability to give raises because I know of at least one employee who received one. She put in her 2 weeks notice and on her last day he called her into his office and asked what he could do to get her to stay and she said a raise and she got it. Said employee has only been there about 6 months longer than me and is a very ""minimum effort required"" kind of employee. I'm the opposite and I think my track record shows that. Now I'm not willing to play chicken with my job and for the possibility of a raise and I don't really wanna leave my agency, but every surrounding agency has a higher starting pay (highest I believe is about $44,000). That plus the fact that we're understaffed and he's desperate to keep people on I was hoping could work in my favor, but honestly I'm not sure. 

There isn't really any upwards movement apart from becoming a trainer then supervisor but I'm a year away from even being eligible to become a trainer (and honestly I don't think I want that kind of responsibility), so the only raises I'll get from here on out are cost of living from the city but those really can't be counted on. Has anyone ever successfully negotiated a raise with the city or government? Is it worth it to try or would I just sour my relationship with him?",finance
personalfinance,"Medical student, looking to apply for a credit card","I am currently a medical student in the US. All of my money right now comes from federal loans, which cover both my tuition and cost of living (housing, food, etc). I also have a scholarship, but to my knowledge that was applied to tuition first. My credit score is ~780. No prior cards, other than a few gas station cards that I've had for several years. No debt from undergrad.

I want to apply for a credit card, but I'm not sure if I can list my loans as income or not. I've heard conflicting things on this, with most users here saying not to. Medical students in other communities say it's allowed, and I've seen at least one who claim they've talked with representatives from Chase saying it's OK. Many say that they've been able to get cards like the Sapphire Preferred/Reserve, which they use to get rewards during residency applications and interview travels. 

So, can I list my loans as income on a credit card application or not? If I can't, would I even be eligible for any?",finance

personalfinance,What should I do to save money?,"\*My account name says throwaway, but it's actually an account I use lol.

I started a new job at a dealership getting paid 13/hr. However, my hours are very low because I am more of a back-up employee than an actual part-time one (even though I am still part-time). My guaranteed amount of hours is 12/week and I will be working on Saturdays occasionally. This means I am not making a lot of money.

I am a college student and I have way too many classes to keep working long hours (I worked while in school before and it made me exhausted mentally and physically). I have only two expenses, monthly insurance which is $87 and my gas (I haven't started commuting to school yet, so my gas spending might go up) which is about $30-35 to fill my tank every two weeks.

What can I do to start saving money while not making a lot? I only plan on working at this job temporarily because I want to intern for a federal job sophomore year.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How do Defi platforms generate the huge stable coin returns?,"I've seen many people on this sub recommend various DEFI platforms which offer huge (relatively speaking) returns on stable coins such as USDC and USDT. I've seen numbers such as 7, 10, and even 12%+ bandied about. How do these platforms generate those returns.

I have a reasonable understanding of traditional finance, and the interest earned in your savings account is as a result the difference between the FED/central bank interest rate and the loan interest rate. (i.e. the bank will borrow from the FED at x% and lend it out at y%, making y-x% profit - if interest rates are high, they will borrow from clients instead at z% which is lower than y% and make the difference in profit. You will earn z%. Now with interest rates being at record lows, there's very little incentive for the bank to borrow from you, hence the sub 1% returns in your savings account).

So, after that short simple and generalized explanation, how are DEFI platforms generating these returns? Who are they lending your stable coins to that they can offer you such a high return? How is this safe? Wouldn't anyone borrowing USDT/USDC at an interest rate in excess of 10% be able to fund that borrowing at a far cheaper rate?

Thank you in advance for your explanations.

personalfinance,"Must buy a car, sudden brainstorm about old 401K, now freaking out about amount IN the 401K","TL;DR: should I cash out an old 401K to pay off student loan / buy a car, or roll over?

Basic info: Southeast USA, $41K annual income, $47K debt (all fed student loan, so currently on 'pause' for COVID), age 44, no credit cards, hardly anything on my credit report. My credit scores (whether you want to consider it ""real"" or ""fake"") are 681 (Experian FICO-8), 710 (TransUnion Vantage 3.0), 696 (Equifax Vantage 3.0). I had credit cards in the past, they got out of hand, so once I was able to get rid of them all, I stayed away. But having zero credit usage isn't doing me any good now. Nobody ever said ""hey, cellovator, if you don't have SOME kind of active credit usage, you're never gonna qualify for any kind of loan at a decent rate!"" My mom has no financial knowledge, so there was none to pass on to me. ((I'm not blaming anyone for my lack of knowledge, it's just a fact.))

A couple of weeks ago I was in a car accident (other driver's fault) and my car has been totaled by the other insurance company. Luckily, no injury, even luckier, I owned it outright. I'd already been saving to get a new car (pref. new, but at most 5 years old), so I already have $5k saved for a down payment. I won't go into describing the car market, we all know. So I've been totally stressed out about how I'm going to pay for a car, especially when student loan payments kick back in. Car shopping should be fun, right? NOT SO. I've thought about just going and pulling out the $5k from the bank and buying a beater from craigslist. But I really want something that will last a long time. The answer to that is something newer, which means finance. But with my credit profile...ugh.

About an hour ago I remembered that I have TWO different 401K plans that I have yet to roll over to my new job (started almost 2 years ago...I'm lazy). One plan I was only in the job for a little over a year, so that plan has been active for 3 years now. I can't even find the login information at the moment. But the other plan...I was at that job for almost 15 years. And I just remembered that it was just sitting there, waiting for me to roll it over, or take a payout, because if I'm no longer employed there, I can just cash it out, right? So I log in to look at the balance, which I haven't done in a REALLY long time. It's over $58k.

Now what??? If I take the payout, (from what I understand) I immediately lose 20% to the IRS, and then another 10% because it's an early withdrawal (not yet 59 1/2 age). My state doesn't have income tax. So that $58k shrinks to between $40,800-42,000, depending upon how the 10% is calculated. But that's $40k that I could potentially have.

Other factors: **1**. I don't expect to ever retire. I don't expect that my health will hold out that long, so sometimes I wonder why I even have a 401K. I do, however, always withhold the max for my HSA, which has always turned out to be a good decision. That's a long story, but I have zero medical debt, and it really could be so much worse. **2.** I would love to get out from under the student loan, because my payments haven't even been covering the interest (I'm on income-based repayment), so my balance each month (before COVID) was creeping slowly UP instead of down. And when that 25-year mark hits, I'll be liable for taxes on the amount that gets forgiven. **3.** I'm so tired of being stressed about this. I'm starting to see this as an easy way to get $40k.

Is this the stupidest thing you've ever heard of? Is it genius? Is it only slightly moronic?

Please, someone with more financial sense than me, tell me what you think.

EDIT: Ok, so you guys obviously are telling me ""don't touch your retirement!"". I genuinely was asking for reasons WHY, other than ""you'll need it later"", but whatever. Thanks anyway.

2nd EDIT: Thanks for the advice, folks, I’m going to leave the $58k intact and roll it on over. Other than that, I’m still at a loss for what to do.

3rd edit: This is what I come from: I just called my mom to tell her I was not cashing out, and her response was “why not?” Like I said, no financial knowledge.

Final edit: Found out today (8/23) that insurance payout is waaaaay more than I expected, so the 401(k) is definitely safe, guys! Put away the pitchforks LOL! And thank you for all the advice.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"I love crypto, but because of the scams and greed I fear a “poker black friday” event","What was this black friday?
On thursday night, you had some fun on Poker Stars, then close your computer and  go to sleep.

The next morning, you opened your computer and saw that shit:

“Black Friday, or April 14, 2011, was the unexpected day of attack launched by the DOJ and FBI on poker sites operating in the US.

In one afternoon, indictments were opened against three of the biggest poker rooms in the world: PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute Poker/UB. On one fell swoop, thousands of poker players were taken offline and millions of dollars seized.”

And was the DOJ right… unfortunately yes. Full tilt, one of the biggest website defrauded its own players for a small amount of 450 millions USD. To this day, online poker is still illegal in almost the 50 states in the usa.

Why do I talk about this? It mostly came when I read an article about the binance us ceo resigning. There was keyword in the article that I read that made me say “Oh god  no”.

Then, the crypto market is now over 2 Trillion. The Federal Reserve knows about this and I don’t think they like it. This means that it’s  2 trillions that could have been invested in US dollars or the US stocks market.

Then again, the ducking NFT, that sucking crap. We all know it’s filled with money laundering.  I wouldnt be surprised if the DOJ use the NFT mess to hit:

CryptoCurrency,Why should I not hold all my crypto on Blockfi for the interest rewards,"Ok, so I have been procrastinating on my homework and I was checking all the markets and as I was doing so I noticed I had way more money in my bank account than I normally do. I'm safe to pretty much invest everything I earn at the moment, so keeping a proper savings account isn't as much a concern at the moment. Anyways, I noticed Blockfi offers interest rates for all the cryptos I am currently holding on Coinbase. Now my question is, why shouldn't I just move all my crypto to Blockfi to earn interest? Is the main risk that Blockfi gets hacked and I lose all my assets? But right now I feel like I have just lost quite a bit of free money by not holding on Blockfi and getting that free interest every month. Is there a reason not to move everything besides the, all eggs in one basket saying?

22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

37. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

39. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

68. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

74. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

CryptoCurrency,ADA and a Shrek gang: a tale of gains and an expression of appreciation,"About 7 years ago I started with crypto. Btc and tron was my jam for 100 euros at the time. Due to panic and fomo and shitty coins and poor research and overtrading i probably halved it, although I am still thinking I should go ahead and find that account soon.

Anyways, flash forward to ""now"", I got in crypto again a while back. More toughened up and less stupid, over the years. I still have a lot to learn, for example I bought while it was still crashing at around 48 and then some at 42. You can imagine I was a bit miffed when it crashed to 30k, but i trusted the stake-hodl for btc, ether, matic, and ADA. The last of which I bought at below 1, some qt 1 20 and some at 1.50. I will also be hodling, becauew lthough i had to cash some out at a loss, i then realised i have to keep some cash around for things. 

But GOD DAMN have i learned a lot. I was horribly shit with money, and I figured that even -50% would have me left with more money than just parking it in my holehanded bank account. Now I am actually considering if I need things, and thinking about parking for the future. That being said, now I am both educated a little (and still growing) and the gains are coming my way. Taking some profits slowly but I am definitely holding some bags for years down the line. 

This subreddit helped a lot and I appreciate the advice and in the darker times the memes and seasoned veterans here really help.

ethereum,The Ethereum FUDBuster - An Attempt 1,"Hey everyone, so I decided to take some time to address some of the common FUD that has been thrown into this subreddit with hopes it may help some newbies into ETH to at least understand the whole context to the FUD that is used usually by Bitcoin Maximalist.

I will definitely make mistakes, so I hope this can be something that everyone will critique so I can improve on it! So let's get on to it!

**ETH IS A PREMINED 'SHIT' COIN**

* Premine refers to the issuance that happened before mining, this in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, unless it is done in such a way that a very small group of people benefits and causes a great inequality.
* The Ethereum sale lasted for 42 days. [Link to the launch page of the sale](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/) for more information. The sale gave enough information and can be also arguably said to be more public and reached more people than when satoshi started mining bitcoin by posting it on the bitcointalk forum.
* [Link to the results of the sale](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/ether-sale-a-statistical-overview/) after 2 weeks. Interestingly, the result of the sale had a Gini coefficient that is lower than bitcoin's at the time, possibly indicating that initial ETH distribution is more equal than Bitcoin's distribution. This is of course assuming that every sale participant address is unique.
* Overall result is that 60 million of ETH is sold to the sale participants and 12 million is created for the Ethereum foundation to fund activities. (This is the premine). [Some good data here.](https://keepingstock.net/overview-ethereum-s-initial-public-sale-563c05e95501) This is the part where bitcoin maxis will usually say that vitalik and co will dump their ETH on us, assuming of course these 72 million in ETH has not been moved at all and everyone who bought in has diamondhanded until now (SPOILER: This is a stupid argument).
* The 72 million premine accounts for about 61% of current ETH total supply (117 million at the time of writing). Again with the fact that this happened 7 years ago, the distribution of ether from that time since now has of course diluted the holdings of the initial sale participant. Though I must confess I do not have the data on that. If anyone can share some, that would be awesome.

**ETH is a INFLATIONARY SHITCOIN with UNLIMITED SUPPLY**

* Inflation or deflation is a neutral term, it depends on the goals of the underlying asset to decide whether it is good or bad. It is correct that we have unlimited supply, but that does not mean there will be unlimited ETH in circulation. This is neither a good or a bad thing.
* Ethereum has had a few forks that adjusted the rate of inflation since the genesis block. Historical changes to the issuance can be found [here.](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/) The changes to issuance reflects ethereum's monetary policy of minimum necessary issuance.
* On contrast, it also does not mean that a limited supply is a good thing, for bitcoin for example, this raises concerns that when all 21 million of BTC is minted or when subsequent halvings have passed, there needs to be enough bitcoin transaction fees to incentivize miners to mine the chain and secure the network. Other coins like monero have tail issuance at the end of minting, that ensures miners are still compensated via a block reward component rather than just transaction fees. Only time will tell which is the best option.
* **EIP-1559 introduces the necessary deflationary pressure** to ETH, by burning ETH based on the demand on blockspace. **This does not in itself make ETH deflationary,** but it allows for the protocol to algorithmically adjust its own monetary policy by linking it to network usage. This eliminates the need for community consensus to be made to reduce issuance further up until the merge.
* The merge, whereby the consensus layer will be replaced by PoS will further reduce issuance, **causing ETH inflation to significantly decrease!** This is because it is less costly to run a PoS validator compared to a PoW miner, and hence we can reward them less to secure the network. I find [this page](https://www.attestant.io/posts/charting-ethereum-issuance/) does the issuance numbers some justice.

**PoS is shit and leads to centralization, enriching Vitalik and co who has a lot of stake in ethereum.** credit to /u/SwagtimusPrime

* Proof of stake in Ethereum is designed such that stakers need to align themselves to the interest of the network or else they risk to get slashed. Slashing would effectively cause one's staked ETH to be burned and he gets kicked out of the validator pool, reducing his stake and voting power in the system.
* For concerns regarding early adopters having more power in PoS, refer to arguments under premine. People had 7 years chance to get into ETH and get some voting power, the move to PoS has always been the goal of the ethereum ecosystem.
* It is correct to say that the more ethereum you have to stake, the more you will earn and eventually you can hold more. There are mechanisms in the PoS system that is designed to discourage pooling.
   * The hardware requirements to run PoS consensus node is very light, you can even run them on a raspberry pi
   * The 32 ETH requirement is the result of the above. Remember that this was made when ETH price was in the 3 digits, and hence was very accessible to a lot of people.
   * For people without 32ETH, the coredevs are looking into something called the [secret shared validators](https://medium.com/bloxstaking/secret-shared-validator-ssv-phase-1-testing-summary-5e3f5ab06083), which allows smaller trustless pools to be formed, unlike exchange pools where you deposit your eth and hope they behave. (Note, if they don't behave, they will lose your and their own ETH due to slashing, which they have to compensate one way or the other, making an attack very costly).
   * The execution clients high disk requirement due to state bloat is being solved slowly through [state expiry research](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). I am not sure if ReGenesis is also in the cards for this.
* Vitalik himself did a good write up on this in [this page](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html).
* Essentially with slashing mechanisms in place, it is much more costly to attack the PoS system compared to PoW as attackers would need to procure enough ETH to game the system, and is also willing to burn these ETH in case their attacks fail. In PoW, the ASICs or GPU can be continuously used to attack the chain over and over again. Take a look at Bitcoin SV for referrence.
* Some additional good points from /u/SwagtimusPrime [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p99i4q/the_ethereum_fudbuster_an_attempt_1/h9wwfqv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**Nobody knows how many ETH there is**

* This was actually a fairly recent FUD and is not true. In etherscan for example, you can look at the total number of ETH very [easily](https://etherscan.io/accounts). IIRC there were some differences found simply because the scripts made by different people did not account for some edge cases.

**Ethereum will never scale, too much bloat**

* Scaling is a hard process, the scalability trilemma (i.e. scalability(speed), security, and decentralization) is something that needs to be considered when trying to scale ethereum.
* A lot of work is being done for this and I will try to mention some of them here
   * State expiry - reduce state bloat and allow lower requirement to run execution clients
   * [Layer 2 ](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)centric roadmap - zk-rollups and optimistic rollups are solving scaling while maintaining low costs and is running now! They are still in beta however.
   * Data shards in consensus client can work together with rollups to allow for even more tps.
* Ethereum direction towards statelesness will also make this easier going forward. [u/Liberosist](https://www.reddit.com/user/Liberosist/) made a good writeup of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o1s8an/statelessness_state_expiry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

**Vitalik makes all decision in Ethereum Changes**

* If someone tells you this with a passion, I suggest you ignore them as they are not going to listen to any good arguments with that brain.
* In all seriousness, vitalik has taken the backseat in making a lot of the core devs decision lately. What he is focused on is to bring some research data and making roadmaps which can be heavily contested by others in the coredevs team.
* It is not like vitalik has a master key to ethereum to make it do what he wants, seriously. If anyone feels that what he suggests is shit, they will not implement it. He also has to go through the same EIP process as everyone when proposing an improvement.

**Gas Fees are too expensive, nobody will use ETH**

* Gas fees are expensive because everybody is fucking using the network. Goddamnit can you all stop minting shitty NFTs (not you Ethfinance, you ok.) with ridiculous prices.
* On a more serious note, yes this is bad, I don't like it, nobody likes it. It creates a significant barrier to entry for a lot of newcomers to the space.
* What is good though, is that we are aware of it, and are working towards resolving it.
* Increasing the block gas limit is not always the best solution as this worsens state bloat. If they have solutions to the state growth, we can consider to start increasing block limit.
* Layer 2 are relatively cheap to use, however, they still don't integrate very well with exchanges and many DApps (Soon is our best hope)
* Will people run to other chains due to this? Sure they might, but that does not necessarily mean the end of ETH. I have yet to see a chain that is as decentralized as ethereum, that can handle as many transactions with minimal cost.

OK I need a break, probably will add more when I feel like it. Other points to talk about if anyone wants to help

* Ethereum can reverse your transaction if coredevs feels like it (The DAO)
* No ethereum full node exists except archive node",cryptocurrency

I am in Australia. I earn very well but my ex wife left me with a crap ton of debt. Here is the scenario. I have 2 separate credit card debts - totaling $17000 in debt. Both super similar interest rates around 20%. I have diligently been putting thousands towards this debt every month. 

I have $15000 in value spread amongst multiple cryptocurrencies that I held since 2017.  I also have $15000 in savings (from some crypto sales etc). Already I hear you all screaming to just pay it off, and that is my question. Should I just sell some more crypto and pay them off with my cash, or is there a cleverer way to play this with defi? Eg. Taking a super low interest loan putting down some collateral? I don’t really want to sell my crypto though, as I have made many times over more interest on my crypto than the 20% I pay in interest. 

The reason I’ve not paid it off yet is because I was burnt bad during covid last year and without money and job, so not having a little safety net of savings freaks me out.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage Equity Conundrum,"Hi all, first time posting, hoping someone with more knowledge than myself can help.

So, I am currently in the process of purchasing a new home and we found out on Friday that the property we were buying had been ""downvalued"" by our lender. This had apparently been very common in the current UK market with one figure we found stating that 60 to 70% of homes are getting downvalued. 

The property was actually valued in April but we were only made aware if the situation on Friday. Now, I understand that the bank is of no obligation to inform us of what the valuation is unless it effects the terms of the contracts. That's the weird part. It hasn't. The terms of the mortgage contract have remained the same even though it was downvalued by £30000. The amount we're borrowing is still less than their valuation, but the loan to value ratio has changed entirely so the terms should surely have changed too, correct?

So, for example, if we had agreed a purchase price of £250000, we were putting down 15% that would be £37500, meaning we need to borrow £212500 at 2.5%. The bank values the property at £22000 and decides, ""Yeah, you can have the £212500 and all the terms stay the same"". 

For context the bank is Halifax so one of the major lenders in the UK. When I do an online calculator for Halifax, using the example numbers above, borrowing 212500 against 250000 Vs 220000 give us wildly different interest rates so I don't see why they would be the same in our situation. 

I guess the crux of the issue is, we don't want to start in negative equity, and when it comes time to remortgage we get terrible rates. Effectively giving the vendor team of thousands of pounds for nothing. We love the property and certainly want it but down want to make a terrible financial decision. 

Essentially, 
1. Does it seem off that the interest rates and repayments remain the same with a £30000 difference in the value of the property and 10% drop in the deposit.
2. Would Halifax still consider us to have 15% equity in the property, or are we now only going to have 5-6% and handing over £30000 to the vendor.
3. Would we likely to be subject to the same drop in value? 

Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why Borrowing Money to Buy Crypto Is a Really Bad Idea,"**Why you shouldn't borrow to buy crypto**

As a general rule, borrowing to buy most investments isn't advisable. 

* You'll be committing to paying interest on a debt, while the return on your investment is only speculative. You will have to make payments on your loan regardless of whether your investment performs poorly or makes you money.
* Borrowing to buy investments also means your investment would have to perform extremely well in order for you to make a profit. That's because you would need to first cover the interest costs of a loan with your investment returns in order to break even before you actually turn a profit.

 

While this is true with any type of borrowing to invest, the risks are only magnified when you are borrowing to **buy cryptocurrency**. That's because crypto investments can be much more dangerous than many other kinds of investments for a few key reasons:

* **The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile.** There are huge swings in digital currency prices from one day to the next. If you don't time your purchase and sales for exactly the right time -- which is really difficult to do -- you stand a very high risk of losing money. 
* **There's a lack of regulation in the crypto market.** The federal government is still trying to catch up and figure out how to effectively **regulate virtual currencies**. 
* **The cost of buying cryptocurrencies can sometimes become divorced from their underlying value.**  Often, cryptocurrencies see prices rise because of **celebrity tweets** or social media hype.

personalfinance,Contract job possibly moving into full time work,"So I started a contract job making decent money working in i.t. I do love the company I work for genuinely, it's great work, the people are good etc. The pay is ok not anything to write home about $20/hr, but it's a contract job. I am moving soon and the contract is slated to end the month after I move out. I just got a call from my old contracts project manager recommending me for a position at her company full time, possibly making more money, and without the fear of losing a job due to a contract ending. If I accept the job I would be leaving the contract early. My questions are this

1. Let's say I interview and get offered a job at B company, working full time. Is it appropriate to wait a couple days before accepting that offer? Can I use those days to approach my current employer and notify them, and ask if they would be willing to make a employment offer as well?

2. If I were to get the position at company B, looking on Glassdoor and similar spots the pay starts between $48k-75k per year. I am making currently making 20/hr 40hrs a week (roughly 38k a year). My previous job contracted through company B was making 43k a year. What's an appropriate expectation when asked what my minimum salary requirements are? Would 55k or 60k be scoffed at, and potentially disqualify me? I'd love to make extra money and don't want to leave anything on the table but don't want to blow my chances by putting my stake in the ground for what would seem a ludacris number to them.

Edit: I know it's currently all hypotheticals but with a move out date coming soon, and a potential interview soon. I just want to prepare as much as I can and this is a big step for me moving out of fast food, and odd jobs, the past 5 years into I.T and project management.",finance

WHAT IS YIELD FARMING 

Essentially yield farming is the process of trying to maximise the return of capital through leveraging various decentralised finance protocols. Individuals who partake in yield farming will attempt to seek out the highest yield (rates of return) rates which revolves around various protocol strategies by moving the funds around between these different protocols or swap tokens for higher generating yield. 

If we imagine a traditional bank offering minimal interest rates on savings account, you can see why individuals are incentivised to look for better returns when yield farming can generate into the hundreds and even thousands of percentage. So how it possible for these sometimes insane yield rates?  

HOW ARE HIGH YEILDS GENERATED

Essentially there are 3 main relatively strong factors that determine these yield rates. 

1. Liquidity mining: This is essentially the process of distributing liquidity tokens. In this case some protocols will offer higher rewards for using their protocols. This is covered in my liquidity pool [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oxxa90/liquidity_pools_explained/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post. 

2. Leverage: this is essentially the process of accessing higher capital with minimal capital, this is covered in my Longs vs Shorts, leverage, margin and liquidations explained for beginners: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3rx9w/longs_vs_shorts_leverage_margin_and_liquidations/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post. In the case of yield farming, individuals will deposit tokens as collateral and borrow other tokens or coins, these borrowed assets are then also collateralised to borrow more tokens and coins and this process is repeated to leverage their initial capital to generate more returns. 

3. Risk: The risk associated to the previous points is the risk of collateralised liquidations. Additional risks can be dangerous smart contract vulnerabilities and bugs, liquidity pool attacks such as drainage of liquidity, system risks (collapse of the entire system) and dramatic price fluctuations. 

HOW DOES YIELD FARMING WORK

Individuals will typically follow the following methods to yield farm: 

- lending and borrowing: as mentioned in the above section, individuals can supply supply tokens on a lending platform and use the method described in the previous section to generate higher rewards 

- Supplying liquidity: as described in my liquidity pool post, individuals can supply tokens into a liquidity pool and be rewarded from liquidity pool fees and can enhance returns through liquidity mining.  

- Staking liquidity pool tokens: again as described in the liquidity pool post, when individuals provide capital into a liquidity pool, they are given LP tokens, some protocols can give individuals further incentives by staking those LP tokens. 

Yield farmers can use a combination of these methods to create a lucrative stream of income but requires a highly monitored process by the individuals due to the associated risks involved. 

WHAT ARE THE RISKS 

As mentioned in the yield generation section, yield farming is a high risk and high reward strategy. Some of the risks involved include: 

- Collateral liquidation:  this will be discussed in more detail within my upcoming lending and borrowing educational post but essentially If the collateral falls below the value of the borrowed assets then the collateral will be liquidated 
- Smart contract vulnerabilities: as we have seen in recent weeks, source code bugs are a regular occurrence in any technology and can be taken advantaged of by malicious entities
- Systemic risks: DEFI is still a new and testing space, lucrative opportunities are available but the risk of a system collapsing is also ever present. 
- DEFI hacks: as discussed in my defi hacks [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ozct29/defi_hacks_and_exploits_explained/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post, a risk of a liquidity pool drainage otherwise known as a rug pull can also be an associated risk. 
- Dramatic price fluctuations: what once may be profitable one day can simply be unprofitable the next. Hence, the statement stating the requirement of continuous monitoring. 

I’ll be doing one more educational post about NFTs and then I’ll be taking a break on the educational topic covering for a bit and will be creating some educational quizzes to test knowledge of the content that’s already been covered. If this sounds like a fun idea for you all, just let me know :)",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Crypto Could be the Last Hope for Middle and Lower Class to Become Rich,"Every year the wealth gap between lower, middle, and upper classes keeps rising. 

Due to the tax law, and the increasing affordability of homes, it’s getting harder and harder for lower and middle class people to become rich. 

The Fed is printing money, thus devaluing the USD. This hurts the poor and middle class the most. 

But now we have crypto. Coins like Doge, ADA and others have all grown very fast in short periods of time. Potentially turning hundreds of dollars into millions of dollars. 

But how can crypto change this? Well first, **you will not get rich by day trading crypto.** Holding is the only way to become truly rich. Crypto gives us this chance. 

In less than a year, Doge went from $0.002808 to $0.70! If you had put $100 in doge that would have netted you $25k! 

ADA went as low as $0.08 this year. It’s now at $2.59! $100 in ADA would net you $3,250

We are still early in crypto, and therefore, there are still a lot of money to be made. Crypto can help redistribute wealth but you need to not play with the system. 

The best strategy is to DCA, buy when prices are low, and hold until the money will change your life. It’s a long term investment, so treat it that way. 

TLDR; you won’t become rich by day trading. Holding is the only real way to get life changing money from crypto.

EDIT: A market cap today of 1 trillion for an alt coin may sound crazy high. But in 5 years it could sound crazy low.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Where do you see cryptocurrency in 5 years according to you!,"Hey guys! On Friday I posted a simple question to many crypto subreddits ( r/ethereum, r/cardano, r/Polkadot, r/solana, r/Bitcoin, r/dogecoin etc.): Where do you see your coin in 5 years? I didn't want to direct the discussion in any way towards price, market cap, technology, adoption etc. I wanted the conversation to take its natural course and observe what the opinions of each community are. I saw optimism, some memes, a lot of rockets and moons, some hate, a bit of technology and a ton of price discussion. This surprised me enormously, since apparently most of the people are in for the gains. In the next paragraph, I would like to mention some ideas of each community and where their coin is directed. None of this is my personal opinion, it reflects what each community thinks about its coin.

1. **Bitcoin prediction**: in 5 years, bitcoin replaces gold as store of value and price of one bitcoin is between 500k and 1 million dollars. The current total value of all gold ever mined is 7.5 trillion dollars. Based on the current price of bitcoin, the market cap would have to at least 8x to exceed 7.5 trillion. For price of 1 bitcoin to reach 500k - 1 million, the market cap would have to 10 - 20x.

2. **Ethereum prediction**: from tech's perspective, I am copying a response by user u/frank__costello:  

In 5 years, I believe Ethereum mainnet will be the core settlement layer of the digital economy. Businesses, governments, digital organizations, they'll all use Ethereum for settling payments (just like Visa is doing today), issuing equities and other assets (just like the European Investment Bank is already doing), and virtual goods (just like Gamestop is doing today). No low-value transactions will take place on Ethereum mainnet, the high costs will make it only affordable for large players. However, there's rich ecosystem of rollups attached to Ethereum for users to use. Some rollups are super low-cost, and are used for payments, others are specialized for trading, others are great for NFTs and gaming. Thankfully, there's a great series of bridges, and most users never know which rollup their assets are actually on, since moving from one to another only takes less than a second and costs less than a cent.

Very optimistic, but a great vision nonetheless. Price wise, the general consensus is that ETH price will reach between 10 and 30k in 5 years. In this case, the market cap would jump to between 3x and 10x.

3. **Cardano prediction**: in short in Ethereum's current position from technology and price standpoint. The community would like Cardano to be adopted mainstream with focus on underdeveloped countries. As u/International-Trip42 puts it: a stablecoin used as a national currency, running on the Cardano blockchain with stablefees. To reach the current market cap of Ethereum, Cardano price would have to 4-5x to around 12 dollars. Some users were even mentioning 20 dollar price.

 4. **Solana prediction**: some interesting use cases were mentioned, such as trading, IoT, stable coins on Solana, but nothing concrete. As u/Kav3li mentions:  

I’m not sure but right now, today, I like Solana a lot. I get to do a lot things I can’t do with other block chains. It’s a great user experience. I don’t know if something newer or better will come out but right now Solana is great and what’s on the map looks awesome. Solana also is meeting deadlines unlike ADA and ETH that keep pushing them back. 

Price predictions were moving between 500 and 1000 dollars per coin. For this to happen, market cap would have to 6-12 x in 5 years.

5. **Dogecoin prediction**: almost every response was a meme. What did I expect, right? Price prediction was between 4-5 dollars, which would mean 13-16x in price. We'll see if the meme is strong enough.

6. **USDC prediction**:  as u/Fo-One-Deuce puts it: overtaking Tether for the #1 stablecoin by market cap. The stable coin saga will have to get sorted out at some point.

7. **Polkadot prediction**: very little price prediction, more discussion from the technological standpoint and calling it the next Ethereum. The general consensus in that there is a lot of potential, but the ultimate end goal is unknown.  u/KuDotBit predicts, that in 5 years: 

DOT has one of the most reliable layer 1’s built on it, around 100 parachains running on them and no rugs. Strong community and ecosystem, a true ETH rival. 

Price discussion was limited to top 5 by market cap. Based on an estimate, this would mean at least a 5x in value.

8. **Chainlink prediction**: my post was quickly removed by the mods, but u/slurpslurpityslurp describes it in the following words:

 From a technology perspective the hope is that LINK is THE standard when it comes to oracles for blockchains. I imagine a large part of blockchain based services integrating LINK, from legacy banking to insurance, LINK will be integrated at the base layer of whichever company/organization uses a blockchain as part of their business. 

9. **Vechain prediction**: hopefully having as many commercial partnerships as possible. Price prediction was discussed between 3-5 dollars, which would mean at least a 25x in value. Now this is bullish.

10. **Algorand prediction**: amazing vision for the project by this community. Price prediction was focused on a 10x increase in 5 years, I will share some opinions by several users:

u/EngineerSexy :  In 5 years I'm hoping to see normal merchants accepting algo in certain areas. I'm hoping to not need to go to foreign exchange as I can move digital CAD to whatever I want. I'm hoping my banking can be on algo and get direct deposits right into a CBDC of my choice. I'm hoping to not need to carry passports of vaccine info except for on the algo app (I think they're testing this in South America). And having an algo app overlay my phone for call/msg encryption and privacy would be amazing too. Also being tested. I do think it's going to be a legit wallet - with hundreds of use cases.

u/jvmjunior :  Lots of business and finance institutions building and running things on Algorand. Algorand went mainstream, and many vendors accept payment through the algorand official wallet by reading a qr code. But in most cases, the payment will be done with stable coins. Algorand is largely adopted worldwide, besides usdc, many countries currencies also have their official stable coin in Algorand. Apart from financial success, Algorand is also in evidence on the political aspect. The climate change has aggravated and tougher measures had to be taken against the cryptoworld. Algorand Foundation alongside MIT, among other universities,have played a key role to educate legislators regarding the crypto world how it could help tackle climate change. As one of the results, PoS is now standard among most of cryptos and PoW has been banned in several countries. What has set the crypto world in turmoil. Algorand is now Top5 in the Cryptomarketcap and Ethereum is leading the list. Algorand has been one of the chains that most interect with Ethereum, which is now also known as Smart Gold.

u/DoesntMatterBrian :  I expect the first defi apps to be polished and prosperous. I expect somewhere in the realm of 12 mid-sized to small countries to have begun the process of shifting their currency to an Algo-based CBDC. I expect the United States Federal Reserve to have used it for the testing of their own CDBC, although I doubt they will use anything other than their own creation for the final product. I also expect it will have caught up to Cardano by market cap.

11. **Polygon prediction**: Price prediction was focused on 3 dollars, so a 2-3 x in value. Tech wise, u/Grayson_Cheng commented:  

We need to make some killing Dapp, an iconic application that belongs to Polygon to do that before ETH sharding comes alive. BSC is great and will take more share as more prestigious/innovative Dapp becomes mature but it easily becomes a target for regulation so it might temporarily suffer from political turbulence. if that all happened, a 15% market share shouldn't be a problem. we will have to go through what BSC go through for sure, like the congestion and regulation and our advantage is that large ETH projects are already on board! 

12. **Helium**: the community is talking about partnering with cellular companies, leading 5G decentralized network, IoT network for smart sensors etc. So a lot of potential but nothing concrete. I will leave price prediction to u/JBW1993: 

 Market cap of top 3 telcos is $600b (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile). HNT is a global network. What happens if HNT ($2b current mkt cap) takes some of that market share?

In addition, my post was almost immediately deleted in r/Stellar, r/Monero, r/XRP, r/Ripple, r/litecoin, r/UniSwap and r/BNBTrader. I was looking forward to some info where Stellar and Ripple are going due to low costs and a massive amount of transactions occurring. I know I forgot to post into some amazing subreddits, but I think the majority of the crypto future is mentioned here. Let's see what will actually happen in 5 years, since it is known that we usually overpredict everything.

This was a lot of fun. You guys helped me understand in which direction each project is going and what price the community wants to achieve. In any case, it appears that in the next 5 years, the cryptocurrenty market is estimated to at least 5x according to you. And remember: in the end, we are all in this together, no matter which project wins. I hope this post will be helpful to other users as much as it was to me.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Reality Check: Paysafe (PSFE) beats on revenue, reaffirms guidance, acquires three companies and drops 20% to 3.85X P/S","Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.

Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.”

To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \~ $105 billion)

So why the miss?  Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.

The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.

Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion
* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA
* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million
* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.
* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)
* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)
* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)
* Revenue growth in all segments
* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)
* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY
* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)
* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance
* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs
* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.
* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce

&amp;#x200B;

Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.”  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)

With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.

Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.”

This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.

Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.”

These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

&amp;#x200B;

Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

Paysafe vs PayPal

Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine.""  The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.

In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe’s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:

1. PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.
2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.
3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.
4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).
5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%.
6. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60
7. Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40.
8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.

* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.
* Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%.

&amp;#x200B;

There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32.

&amp;#x200B;

# Some Background:

Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.

As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”

Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

&amp;#x200B;

MOAT:

Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.”

&amp;#x200B;

iGaming Expansion

Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.

Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.

As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,”

Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”:

* ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
* ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""
* “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""
* ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""
* ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

&amp;#x200B;

Consistent Value Creation:

Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).

The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Essentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:

Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

M&amp;A / inorganic growth:

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.”

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.”

&amp;#x200B;

Valuation Metrics:

Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.

\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&amp;#x200B;

More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not investment advice.  Just a collection of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

CryptoCurrency,What are your long-term goals?,"As a long-time member of this sub, suffice to say I’ve seen my fair share of discussions  on here. 

I’ve still yet to see any meaningful discussion of individual long-term goals. 

I vividly remember late 17, when it was hookers, coke and lambos. I also remember late 19’ when everyone were crying themselves to sleep, thinking about getting their losses back. 

Still, no actual goals. Is it in cash? Are you here for the long run? Do you have a dream car? Vacation? House? 

I’ll start it off: 

**5 years** 
- Debt free
- Still sitting on a decent portfolio
- Completely exited from traditional markets

**10 years**
- Apartment for each of our kids
- Extended family has been financed
- Active part of my blockchain project of choice (Vechain), actively working to improve quality of the products we use and consume
- Introducing blockchain voting to national leaders in some way. 
- Not be consumed by crypto to the point where it affects health, relationships etc. 

That last one is pretty important to me, cuz boy have I seen some horror stories on this sub. 

What’s important to you?

EDIT: **It's troublesome that almost our entire generation has such a burning wish to get out from under mortgage debt.

CryptoCurrency,"Exciting and terrifying’: Crypto just like nineties tech boom, says Seek co-founder","The co-founder of $10 billion-valued jobs website Seek says serious investors can no longer afford to ignore cryptocurrencies, likening the technology behind assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the development of the internet in the early nineties.

Matt Rockman, who started ASX-listed Seek alongside Paul and Andrew Bassat in 1998, told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald he has around 3 per cent of his investment portfolio in the volatile assets as a gold-like hedge against volatility in the broader market.

Seek co-founder Matt Rockman has said serious investors should take the time to learn about cryptocurrencies. 

“The prime pumping by central banks has a lot of money in the system and unrealistically low interest rates are causing market distortions. I think at some point, the cycle will turn,” he said.

“Crypto is one of the few hedges one can have in a portfolio, other than gold, to give you some downside protection in these crazy times.”

Mr Rockman is part of a growing cohort of sophisticated and institutional investors looking towards the cryptocurrency space as a solid investment opportunity and a breeding ground for innovation.

personalfinance,Cash-out refi. Help checking my Interest/principal math?,"I'm considering a cash-out refinance to put solar panels on my house, and I'd like to get a sanity check on how mortgage interest and excess principal payments work. I've been in the house about a year, and the value has spiked considerably. Let's ignore whether getting solar is smart or not, my question is: assuming I'm going to do it, what's the best way to pay for it?

Suppose I do a cash-out refi and take out $10,000, and my mortgage interest rate is 3%. I'm ignoring the remainder of the principal of the house (it exists either way), my question is just about the added portion of the loan due to the cash-out.

**Scenario 1:** I take the full 30 years to pay it back (making the minimum payments). I pay $10,000 x 1.03\^30 = **$24,272.62.** 

**Scenario 2:** I pay more towards the principal every month such that I contribute an extra $10k within 10 years. Is my total payment on the cash-out effectively $10,000 x 1.03\^10 = **$13,439.16**? 

**Scenario 3:** I take out a solar loan charging 5.7% interest over 10 years. My minimum payment is higher (which reduces my ability to adjust to unforeseen circumstances), and I pay $10,000 x 1.057\^10 = **$17,408.04**

Am I correctly accounting for the impact of excess principal payments?

personalfinance,What's the best funds to look into for a Taxable Brokerage Account and my situation?,"Hello! Seeking some thoughts around my current situation and what funds I should be looking into:

I met with a financial advisor from Edward Jones who provided me some guidance on which funds might make the most sense but I thought it’d be good to get other people’s thoughts and also might not be worth me getting an advisor at this current stage.

**My goal is to grow my money for some large purchases in the next 5+ years (e.g. purchase property).** 

I’m trying to figure out what the best funds I should be looking into that are not too risky and not too conservative (e.g. not too conservative like what the bank’s interest rate is of 0.50% and not too risky per guidance of the financial advisor). More info below.

* I’m in my late twenties and have a lump sum of money sitting in my savings account (outside of my 6 months emergency fund) that I want to move out of my savings account and into a Taxable Brokerage Account so that I avoid inflation taking over my purchasing power and just for it to grow with the market (flexible if the market also goes down since the goal isn't an exact date)
* I will keep my emergency fund in my savings account
* I’m already on track maximizing my 401k and retirement funds (e.g. HSA)

I really need some input around what’s the best way to set myself up for the lump sum with the goal I have in mind, questions below: 

**Questions:**

* Which Taxable Brokerage Account would be a good one? 
* Which funds should I look into and stay away from?
* What are the risks I should be thinking through and considering?
* What’s the best bond % to look at with this situation?

personalfinance,Pulling from a traditional stock account (brokerage?) to fund an ira,"First off, I apologize if I get any of the lingo wrong. Feel free to correct me on anything.

I have a brokerage account through TD with individual stocks worth around 9k. My wife has a brokerage account through EdwardJ with a mutual fund worth about 8k. These were both started by our families and grew overtime. We haven’t contributed anything to these in  few years.

I’m wondering if it would make sense to pull these funds to put into a retirement account where they might receive better tax breaks, or should I just leave them and let them continue to grow. I have the ability to max our Roth IRA this year without these funds, but we neither of us have a traditional ira.  My wife just graduated medical school, so we are in plenty of federal debt and just now have the means to voluntarily begin putting away money for retirement through our workplaces. We also have a son that we would like to start a 529 for soon.

I understand there are consequences to selling these accounts, but I’m wondering if it’s better to take the hit now or down the road. Or should I just forget about these accounts and reconsider in 10/20/30 years?",finance

Yeap. But don't worry because everybody is worried to crash the stock market right now.

Then companies will start to shutdown. Then the first wave of unemployment. 

Increased interest rates to pay for unemployment benefits. 

More companies shutdown. 

More unemployment. 

Bang. The savings. Hyperinflation. 

New government. 

Rations. 


And crypto? It will get hit. But it will cut the middle man and will get out of it stronger then ever.

CryptoCurrency,"US Congressman to Federal Reserve Bank President: Most Crime Is Conducted With Cash You Print, Not Crypto..","**TLDR:-** *Congressman Tom Emmer has responded to the comments by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis about bitcoin and crypto having no use case other than funding illicit activities. “Most crime is still conducted with the cash you print,” he said*.



**Rep. Emmer Pushes Back at Federal Reserve’s Kashkari Over Crypto’s Use in Crime**

On Thursday, Rep. Tom Emmer told Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, how he is wrong about crypto being used mostly for funding illicit activities.

Crypto-skeptic Kashkari said this week at the Pacific Northwest Economic Regional Annual Summit in Big Sky, Montana, that cryptocurrencies are “95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.” In addition, he said, “I’ve not seen any use case other than funding illicit activities like drugs and prostitution.”

**Responding to Kashkari’s comments, Emmer tweeted Thursday:**

**”Crypto-based crime represented only 0.34% of the entire transaction volume in 2020. Unfortunately, most crime is still conducted with the cash you print”**

Blockchain data platform Chainalysis published a report early this year showing that “*cryptocurrency-related crime fell significantly in 2020.*”

Specifically, the firm wrote, “*In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% or $10.0 billion in transaction volume.*”

Despite this finding, many top-ranking officials still claim that crypto is mostly used in illicit financing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this year that 

“**Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern**,” adding that “**many are used, at least in a transactions sense, mainly for illicit financing**.”

The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, similarly said that bitcoin “*has conducted some funny business” and some “totally reprehensible money laundering activity.*”

Besides Rep. Emmer, many people have tried to set the record straight that most crime is done in fiat currencies, not cryptocurrencies. Among them is well-known economist Daniel Lacalle, fund manager and chief economist at Tressis Gestion. Calling Lagarde’s statement “outrageous,” he emphasized, “we all know that the vast majority of money laundering globally is conducted in fiat currencies, particularly in U.S. dollars and euros.”

Earlier this month, Mohamed El-Erian, an adviser to Allianz and Gramercy Funds Management, urged governments to “*stop dismissing the crypto revolution as some mix of illicit payments schemes and reckless financial speculation.*”

**When do you think Kashkari will stop saying that crypto has no use case other than funding illicit activities? Let us know in the comments.**

personalfinance,Can grant money be taken back?,"So, I got grant money for this coming semester. When applying for the grant I was asked how much I wanted to be put into my bank account and how much I wanted to go towards my tuition. I applied for the maximum amount of the grant. Honestly, at the time I wasn’t even sure if my financial situation was bad enough where I would get the grant so, I guess I didn’t think my decisions through well enough and only had a portion go into my account while the rest would go towards my tuition/fees. I ended up being awarded the maximum amount for the grant. And turns out, with my federal loans and the grant I have excess aid.

When I looked on my financial aid account a few days ago the remaining money for the grant was listed. I figured the remaining money would just be disbursed to me at some point in the semester. However, I looked on my account today and the grant is no longer on my account/that remaining money and the grant itself has disappeared from my account. So, now I’m wondering if they took the remainder away since it became excess aid for me. Is that something that’s done with grant money? Anyways there’s definitely educational expenses that that leftover money would help cushion. I’m just wondering is it possible the remainder of my grant money was taken away? Can they do that?",finance
NFT,Would NFTs be useful to produce vaccine passports that can't be forged?,"Hi I'm from Australia and was reading an article in the news this morning about a software engineer who has discovered how easy it is to forge our Federal Government's vaccine passports. I admit to being pretty new to crypto but understand solidity and how smart contracts work. My question is on what people think about the use of NFT on either an existing blockchain, or one established for this purpose, to administer vaccine passports. It seems like the notion of an immutable ledger producing an item unique to each individual for ownership would be great. Interested to hear people thoughts.",cryptocurrency
vet,Why hasn’t my dog pooped?,"My dog was restless Thursday (8/19) morning and didn’t seem like she could get comfortable. I took her outside and she pooped twice that morning. She refused to eat and acted like she was in pain when I touched her stomach. I took her to the vet that morning and they said it was probably gastroenteritis since she has a history of it. They gave her two injections and some medicine to take home. I fed her a small dinner of chicken and rice that night around nine (she had not eaten since a treat at 8 pm the night before). She was really tired on Thursday and kind of out of it, but Friday she was back to her old self. I again gave her two small meals of chicken and rice. On Saturday when she still hadn’t pooped I called the vet, they told me that her colon had probably emptied and was refilling, hence why she hadn’t pooped. They told me to start feeding her regular sized meals and to take her in again on Monday if she still hadn’t made a bowel movement. It is Sunday night and she still hasn’t pooped. She is still eating, but her stomach is hard and bloated. She doesn’t seem to be in any pain when I touch her stomach. I am going to bring her in Monday regardless, but I need to know if this is a serious and possibly expensive health concern. I am really worried about her and I need to know if I should take her in tonight instead. I apologize for the long post.

UPDATE: She finally pooped but it was solid with some diarrhea at the end. Should I still take her to the vet?",cryptocurrency
stocks,Safe Haven by Mark Spitznagel Book Summary Part 1,"Mark Spitznagel Safe Haven

-	Safe Haven – An asset that provides safety from risk
  - Risk is exposure to bad contingencies. Most of these will never happen, but they can and they can appear in any number of forms
    - Investment risk is the potential for loss, and the scope of that loss
      - A Safe haven asset is an investment that mitigates that risk to preserve and protect your capital. They are shelters from financial storms
-	Safe haven investing is both a defensive measure to avert future loss and an offensive one to exploit future opportunities with &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot;.
-	A risk mitigation strategy must be cost effective. Anyone can develop a strategy that does well in a down market, but we must not have a cure that is worse than the disease
-	Benjamin Graham – &amp;quot;The essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns.&amp;quot;
-	Do not attempt what Spitznagel does as a retail investor or even professional.
-	Everett Klipp - &amp;quot;A small loss is a good loss.&amp;quot; Risk mitigation and survival are everything in investing. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict
-	Investing needn&amp;#39;t be about making grandiose forecasts. No one has a crystal ball
-	A cost-effective safe haven doesn&amp;#39;t just slash risk, it actually lets you take more risk in other parts of the portfolio
-	Aristotle pointed out that, while it is easy to make a couple lucky rolls of a die, with 10,000 repeated rolls, the &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; of the die evens out
-	When your sample size is small, and even worse, unique and unrepeatable, no matter your subjective probabilities, there is so much noise in sample you can hardly know anything. You are hoping for good luck. Your Number (N) is 1
-	But if your success or failure relying on many outcomes, over many rolls of the dice. Your Number (N) is large. You are acting as the &amp;quot;House&amp;quot; exploiting the house edge through repetition to quash randomness. The house doesn&amp;#39;t gamble. We are as Poker theorist David Sklansky said, &amp;quot;at war with luck.&amp;quot;
-	Cost-effective risk mitigation or raising our compound growth rates (CAGR) and thus wealth through lower risk is really our comprehensive goal as investors.
-	Golden Theorem – As you accumulate more and more data in a random sample, you should expect the sample&amp;#39;s average to converge to the true average.
  - The more you roll a fair 6-sided die, the more the percentage of all those rolls in which you see any particular number will converge toward 1/6 or 16.66%
-	It isn&amp;#39;t just the single wager that matters, it is the iterative, multiplicative impact of that result on the next wager, and on the next! A large loss disproportionately lowers our geometric average return, because it leaves us with a much lower stake, or capital base to reinvest and compound on the next wager.
-	We cannot only judge our decisions by their outcomes. As good decisions can have bad outcomes. But we only get 1 outcome.
-	We have just one life (N=1), but our fate is a range of outcomes.
-	The most intuitive way for us to think about the meaning of the expected geometric average return and, equivalently, the geometric average ending wealth outcome under multiplicative growth is simply as the expected median ending wealth outcome
-	The geometric average return, rather than the arithmetic average return is close to what you should expect from random samples from all possible ending outcomes
-	By giving all the weight to this path(N=1), we essentially need to have gotten pretty much every possible path right. We must be robust to the realized path or &amp;quot;covered all the bases.&amp;quot; We don&amp;#39;t know what &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; we are going to get
-	Not all losses and not all risks are created equal, so not all risk mitigation is created equal
-	We need a risk-mitigation strategy that makes our returns both more accurate and more precise to win the bloody &amp;quot;war with luck.&amp;quot; We want a tighter grouping of our expected return or a reduced variance.
-	You have 2 options for achieving this. The store of value method or the insurance method. These 2 strategies can be very different in their cost-effectiveness
-	What makes something a safe haven vs a non-safe haven?
  - How does it do during a Crash? +/-
  - How does it do during normal times? +/-
  - What is the expected payoff during a crash and how does it achieve it?
-	You have 3 different types of safe havens.
  - Store of Value – Fixed in time and space. Key is low to no correlation. It provides both a cushion and &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot; should a crash take place. It is basically a matter of diluting risk. Crash return is +/0, Non-Crash Return is +/-, and Payoff type is low correlation
  - Alpha – Is like store of value, but its correlation is now expected to be negative. That means during a crash, it is expected to generate a positive return. Think of the flight to quality we see during a crash. Crash return is +, non-Crash return is +/-, Payoff type is negative correlation
  - Insurance – What Mark Spitznagel does, don&amp;#39;t try. Extreme version of the Alpha payoff. Needs to make a very large profit during a crash, relative to its expected losses the rest of the time. Needs to be highly convex to crashes or have an explosive payoff to justify its costs. Crash return is ++++, non-Crash return is -, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Convexity&amp;quot;
-	Safe Havens can be exceedingly costly, so much so that, as a cure, they can be worse than the disease.
-	Some safe havens require a very large asset allocation within the portfolio. The problem is large AA comes at a very large cost (drag) when times are good (which is most of the time). Gold has this problem.
-	Strategic vs Tactical Safe Haven
  - Strategic – Mitigates systemic risks in a more fixed way and letting it play out
  - Tactical – Requires moving into and out of safe havens. This requires timing and short-term forecasting skill (which people don&amp;#39;t have)
-	The problem is no one possess a &amp;quot;crystal ball&amp;quot; to know when to do this.
  - If you risk-mitigation strategy requires a crystal ball to work, then you are doing it all wrong. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict the market. Cost effective safe haven investing needs to be agnostic investing
-	Cassandras typically and ironically lose more in their safety from looming crashes than those crashes would have even harmed them.
-	Markets scare us more than they harm us
-	Markets are very, very good at making us feel safe when we shouldn&amp;#39;t and scared when we needn&amp;#39;t
-	Risk mitigation therefore needs to be a sustained way of life or habit, not a transient one
-	Imposter Safe Havens
  - Hopeful
  - Unsafe
  - Diworsification (Diversification)
-	Hopeful – Payoff is very unreliable. Requires a lot of luck to pay off in a crash. Sometimes requires good timing. It is like jumping out of an airplane with a parachute that only sometimes deploys, you are better off not wearing one in the first place and making a more informed decision. Crash return is (don&amp;#39;t know??), non-Crash return is +/- and the Payoff type is &amp;quot;Fingers Crossed&amp;quot;
-	Unsafe – This asset or strategy has so far always gone up, so it likely has a good story for why that should always be the case. This logic is then extended to their performance in a crash. They are often vulnerable in a crash, perhaps they have even shown some evidence of that vulnerability, but this doesn&amp;#39;t change the optimism around their safe haven status. It is like jumping out of an airplane and thinking you can fly. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, and payoff type is &amp;quot;Always goes up so it must be safe&amp;quot;
-	Diworsifier – Most common form you see in modern finance. It is pervasive throughout almost all investment portfolios. Diversification is fundamentally a dilution of risk, not a solution to risk. It is about evading risk. Diversification never tends to be as great (lower correlations) as it appears. When the investing herd heads for the exits in a crisis, most strategies and assets tend to get swept away. Strategies that were once uncorrelated, stable and liquid become the opposite of all those things as investors are forced to sell what they are able to, all at the same time. Diversification is &amp;quot;NOT A FREE LUNCH&amp;quot; as mentioned in modern finance theory. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Loses less, so it is worth it&amp;quot;
-	Diversification lowers returns in the name of higher Sharpe ratios, some investors who use this strategy but aren&amp;#39;t content with the lower returns are then forced to apply leverage in hopes of raising them back up. True risk mitigation should not require financial engineering and leverage in order to both lower risk and raise CAGR. Doing so adds a different kind of risk by magnifying the portfolio&amp;#39;s sensitivity to errors in those correlation estimates.
-	Aristotle – &amp;quot;The whole is not the same as the sum of its parts.&amp;quot;
  - This is true in finance. You can move a portion of your portfolio to an asset with zero expected return and away from an asset with a high expected return and raise the whole of your wealth, even though it lowered your average. All of this is due to compounding. Key Point of Book!!!
-	The properties emerge from the interactions of those component assets as they are rebalanced and compounded. Safe Havens adding so much ending wealth to the portfolio (geometric return) is due to the iterative nature of the game. They provide capital for the next &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot; by resetting or rebalancing the size of the wager at the end of each &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot;. Safe havens can thus top up or feed the wagers in the main game (large part of portfolio), particularly if the previous roll resulted in a big loss, without costing the frequent positive wagers enough to matter. The assets now interact, rather than act independently. Thus, an entirely new whole is formed, one that is very different from the sum of its parts.
-	If we only look at the way that things happened and obsess over it as the only likely outcome, then we are engaged in naïve empiricism. IE - we over-extrapolate the past
-	To avoid that we need to look at the past in the context of the many other paths that COULD HAVE happened, but never did, as well as our sensitivities to those outcomes
-	Most investors add a risk-mitigation strategy for its effect, but don&amp;#39;t properly account for the cost paid to gain that effect and thus don&amp;#39;t account for the net portfolio effect
-	There is always this risk-mitigation tension or tradeoff between the two contrary forces of cost and effectiveness (IE – arithmetic costs and geometric return). That tradeoff is between lower arithmetic returns (costs) as payment for the geometric pickup (effect). There is NO FREE LUNCH!!! But if can tilt that tradeoff in your favor, with an effect that outpaces the costs resulting in a positive net portfolio effect, then risk mitigation on net raises compounding and consequently, wealth. This is cost effective risk mitigation.
-	Remember, anyone can develop an asset or strategy that does well in a crash, the trick though is to do it while also raising the median return. Most risk mitigation strategies fail this portion
-	We cannot judge the cost effectiveness of a given risk mitigation strategy on its own, in a vacuum, based solely on its attributes.
-	The bigger the crash bang for the buck, the less that is needed and the less its potential drag or cost when it isn&amp;#39;t needed.
-	Mechanical vs Statistical payoff
  - Mechanical – is one that happens as a direct, intrinsic consequence. IE – an option going into the money from out of the money. It must go up in value.
  - Statistical – is one that only tends to be so, based on observed history, but it needn&amp;#39;t be so. It is more extrinsic and thus noisier. This would be like a flight to quality or safety that we see during a crash
-	You also have other possibilities for payoff warping, like counterparty risk (or the risk of not getting paid). Gold bullion has no counter park risk.
-	The question to ask yourself is do you need a lot of things to go right for a safe-haven to be effective? Is their history a good guide to their future, or is everything always different?
-	An ideal safe-haven is more mechanical but real-world payoffs tend to be much less so. They tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum between mechanical and statical.
-	Not Safe Havens
  - VIX futures – Volatility index but they are always in contango which causes them to have a very steep &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; making them a really bad trade
  - High-Dividend Stocks
  - Hedge Funds
  - Fine Art
  - US Farmland
-	Only 2 safe havens are worthy of that name – Gold and Equity Tail Hedge
-	Store of Value
  - Cash (3-Month Treasury Bill) – Less interest rate risks than longer dated maturities. Not a safe haven
  - 10-20 Year Bonds (Typical of &amp;quot;Balanced&amp;quot; portfolio) – More interest rate risks vs shorter maturities (as of 2021 those rates are extremely low which hurts their current safe haven status), classic flight to safety asset when things turn bad for the stock market and the economy. They are a hopeful haven or a Diworsification
-	Alpha
  - CTA (Commodity Trading Advisors) – Active managed strategies (usually hedge funds) and trend following strategies. Attempt to capture Alpha by using momentum. Other derivatives-based strategies use similar strategies like long volatility and generic tail hedging. Not a safe haven
-	Insurance
  - Gold – Hedge against the banking system. No counter party risk. Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation. It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices). Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s. Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value. It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected. During the 1970&amp;#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective. Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven. This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective. The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.",finance
personalfinance,Realtor for Rent/Lease to Own?,"Hello, my SO and I are jumping into the market (St. Louis, MO area) for the first time. We're a young couple with fair credit but can't really make up a down payment for a house, and have been renting apartments for the last few years and can't stand it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been looking at the Rent/Lease to Own option because it seems like the best of both worlds. We don't have a large down payment up front, we have time to build credit and build savings for a down payment on a mortgage all while living in our home, not renting apartments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our issue is that all the Rent to Own websites are so trash. They are outdated. I've called several homeowners to discuss options and they've scoffed because their house was sold anywhere from 1-3 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth going through a realtor or agency? Will they even be able to find Rent to Own options? how much would they cost, since realtors normally get paid off of closing costs and we wouldn't have one since the first couple years would be rented.

CryptoCurrency,Why DeFi Is More Than A Ponzi Scam,"# General Conclusion

Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",cryptocurrency

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The year is 2121...,"I hear footsteps &amp; faint chatter coming to the chamber door. Keys are clashing together. The door opens. Light fills the room as the flies escape. Two shadowy ANSESAL agents walk in. They call me by a name I once knew. A name I haven't heard in 30 years. A name that belonged to a world I no longer know. A name that made me remember what once was. 

""Date la vuelta y pon tus manos detras de tu espalda!""

I turn around and put my hands behind my back. The clips of the cold stainless steel cuffs cut into my wrists as they clamp. They grab me by the shoulders. One grabs the link of the cuffs. They lead me into the hallway. We didn't take a right down stairs. We went straight. I remember this room. We get closer and closer to the oak painted door. They open it.

I'm greeted with a familiar face. President Satoshi Bukele Jr. ""Well hello"" he utters with a smirk. ""Good to see our guards are keeping you well fed"" I weight 90lbs and get one raman a week. Im lead by the chair and as I arch to sit, the agents forced me down by the shoulder, which wasn't necessary.  

""You know why I'm here. You know what I want, and this is your last opportunity to be a free man. Give me what I want.""

I looked him in the eye. ""If I wouldn't give it to you all those years ago, what makes you think I'll give it to you now? You're desperate. You have no leverage.""

His face went blood red as a vein bulged from the side of his temple to his forehead. ""Listen here you little fuck, I single handedly wiped out all the nations to get what I wanted. I had no hard feelings against them, and frankly, I don't fucking like you. If you thought your life's been hell, then think again, because if you refuse this final offer, that's when the real hell begins.""

The room got silent.

He follows up, ""So what's it going to be?"" 

I gave him my own smirk.

""I'm not fucking selling.""

He can't even look me in the eye. 

""Get him out of my sight!""

The guards drag me by the shoulder and cuffs into the hallway. One agent hold my arms behind my back while the other punches me in the stomach. I spit up blood. One of them sweeped my legs from underneath me and I go head first to the rock hard tile. They pulled my pants down and began to shove crayons up my butt before throwing me back into the dungeon that is now my home ""We'll be back tomorrow with colored pencils."" The door locks.

A few minutes past by. I know they're gone for now. I crawl to the corner and lift a broken tile and removed the phone I snuck in underneath it. I power it on and move closer to the corner with the unsecured employee wifi. Only 7% battery so time is of the essence. I log into my grandfather's Reddit account. u/MrPoopCum420. The sacred password that men have killed for was used on all his devices when I was a child. ""ElonBad69!"" In his vault rest the last full moon not owned by the El Salvador forces, but I didn't turn on the phone for that. I clicked on his profile, and I go to the daily on r/cc where he posted his last comment before the world collapsed. In verdana font, and 2 upvotes, read the word ""hodl.""",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Daily Tether (possible) Scam Awareness,"Tether Holdings Ltd, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), reported that its total market capitalization had crossed $64 billion for the first time in history. [tweet](https://twitter.com/Tether_to?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1427375297729531909%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-bulls-at-risk-tether-growth-rate-flatlines-despite-market-cap-crossing-64b)

 The U.S. Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve have expressed their concerns  about the potential of dollar-pegged digital assets to cause global  financial instability and obscure transactions associated with money  launderers and other online criminals. 

 On August 6, Tether made their reserves audit from June 30 [public](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf),  in which they broke down the asset allocation and the maturity of the  commercial paper held by the stablecoin issuer. This was a very notable  step taken by Tether to increase transparency on the largest stablecoin  in the crypto market. [audit](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgzMTk0MzYxMDYyNzYxODI0/pasted-image-0-1.png) \- [\#2](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgzMTk0MzY4ODQ3MzkwMTE1/pasted-image-0-2.png) \- ***PS: I lack the knowledge to know if this is a valid/satisfying answer to the scam allegations, so if anyone who knows more about this stuff please feel free to explain it further.***

 The total market cap of USDT was around $4 billion in March 2020 but rose to over $61 billion in May 2021. The same period witnessed Bitcoin rising from below $4,000 to almost $65,000. 

 In February, Tether also agreed to pay an $18.5 million fine to end a New York probe over allegations that the company moved hundreds of millions of dollars to cover up $850 million in losses. 

 In June, JPMorgan Chase analysts noted that Tether’s large commercial paper holdings show that banks are unwilling to take the company’s cash. That could be due to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s guideline that orders banks to work with only stablecoin issuers whose coins are 100% backed by reserves. The banking giant added that providing Tether banking services would “likely raise reputational risk concerns” for financial institutions. 

 Theres an investigation focused on activity from Tether’s early days, probing whether the company misled banks by hiding the fact that transactions were linked to cryptocurrency, citing three people with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential. Federal prosecutors have sent letters in recent months to individuals alerting them that they are targets of the investigation and that a decision on the probe could be made soon, according to the news agency.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Market Cap calculation difference between Stablecoin and Cryptocurrency. The Danger of Tether.,"Hey

I've been thinking about the difference of how a market cap is calculated between the two different kind of coins and how they could greatly affect each other. So first off a Stablecoin is quite simple as it is meant to be back 1:1 with the currency it represents. Market cap = coins issued. Where as a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is calculated by Market cap = average price per token over a trade volume * the total amount of coins mined. 

The issue is that when bitcoin is traded with a stablecoin/currency a small number of stablecoin/currency can greatly influence the market cap of bitcoin depending on the trading volume. For example it could take $10billion USDT to increase bitcoins market cap by $100 billion.

Tether (USDT) is the third largest crypto with a market cap of $64 billion, a currency backed 1:1 USD. There have been claims that this is false with no real transparency of its balance sheet and that most of it is fabricated out of thin air and that ~70% of all crypto transaction are completed through tether directly or indirectly (via another coin).

Like with all non-productive asset in a market crash the problem is liquidity. When the time comes when people decide to convert bitcoin back into a federal currency then exchanges and traders won't be able to honour it because there is no money. If bitcoin goes below that price point then the whole system will collapse, and assets they thought was worth x amount is now worthless.

Alternatively if no one sells then this gravy train will keep chugging along but for how long? who know?

Just a risk I hope you consider. Thanks",cryptocurrency
worldpolitics,Could Afghanistan be fine with the Taliban in charge?,"Originally this post was meant for another subreddit. This post is 100% serious. I don't know why I write out all these words. Maybe the whole post is stupid, but I hope that the words bite and I hope they have some meaning. If by the time you read the whole post you think there's anything worth reading here, I ask that you upvote this post.

I have no idea why I'm writing all this. I’m no expert on Islam or the Middle East, so don’t take me too seriously if I say stuff that doesn’t mesh well in context.

Is Islam a respectable religion?

Islam is one of the major religions of the world, the 2nd largest, with 25% of the world’s population as followers. As someone who is not very religious, I always thought of Islam the same way as I think of Christianity, a general well meaning guide on how to live life which while not perfect as it was founded long ago has an overall net benefit.

I don’t understand how women could be considered less than men, although there are notable differences between men and women which shouldn’t be ignored but often are thought of as minorly important in the west.

My first point, is isn't Islam supposed to be an overall righteous religion? Therefore if the Taliban behaves as a violent group while being devout followers of Islam, wouldn't they be universally laughed out of the Middle East for being sacrilegious heretics?

Is Islam so weak of a religion that followers don't know how to condemn violence? Is Islam so weak that followers of Islam don't know how to engage in dialogue before resorting to violence?

Of course, the people who follow Islam are very devout and any who are criminally inclined would resort to religious crime before other crime. How could Muslims allow their violent populations be representatives of their Religion? Do you not feel ashamed? How come we haven't heard more of a push from you against those representing Islam that use violence achieve their goals? Many don't hear much about Islam beyond the terrorism that is propagated by extremists. If Islam is a good religion, how could that be okay with its followers?

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the second point.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the Taliban are Pashtun and follow the Pashtunwali code.

**The three primary\[16\] principles:**

1. **Hospitality** (مېلمستيا‎, melmastyā́) – Showing hospitality and profound respect to all visitors, regardless of race, religion, national affiliation or economic status and doing so without any hope of remuneration or favour. Pashtuns will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.\[2\]\[17\]\[18\]
2. **Asylum** (ننواتې‎, nənawā́te) – Derived from the verb meaning to go in, this refers to the protection given to a person against his enemies. People are protected at all costs; even those running from the law must be given refuge until the situation can be clarified.\[2\] Nənawā́te can also be used when the vanquished party in a dispute is prepared to go into the house of the victors and ask for their forgiveness: this is a peculiar form of ""chivalrous"" surrender, in which an enemy seeks ""sanctuary"" at the house of their foe. A notable example is that of Navy Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of a US Navy SEAL team ambushed by Taliban fighters. Wounded, he evaded the enemy and was aided by members of the Sabray tribe who took him to their village. The tribal chief protected him, fending off attacking tribes until word was sent to nearby US forces.
3. **Justice and revenge** (نياو او بدل‎, nyāw aw badál) – To seek justice or take revenge against the wrongdoer. No time limit restricts the period in which revenge can be taken. Justice in Pashtun lore needs elaborating: even a mere taunt (پېغور‎, peghor) counts as an insult.\[2\] Monetary compensation can be an alternative to badal, for example in murder cases.

**The other main principles:**

1. **Bravery** (توره‎, túra). A Pashtun must defend his land, property, and family from incursions. Death can follow if anyone offends this principle.\[2\]
2. **Loyalty** (وفا‎, wapā́).\[19\] A Pashtun owes loyalty to family, friends and tribe members.\[citation needed\]
3. **Kindness** (ښېګړه‎, x̌egә́ṛa). Pashtuns should act in the welfare of others.\[19\]
4. **Arbitration** (جرګه‎, jergá). Disputes are resolved through the Jirga.\[19\]
5. **Faith** (ګروه‎, groh) contains a wider notion of trust or faith in Allah.\[2\] The notion of trusting in one Creator generally comports to Islamic monotheism or tawhid.
6. **Respect** (پت‎, pat) and pride (وياړ‎, wyāṛ). A Pashtun's pride, has great importance in society and must be preserved. Pashtuns must respect themselves and others in order to be able to do so, especially those they do not know. Respect begins at home, among family members and relatives. Someone who lacks these qualities is not considered worthy of being a Pashtun.\[2\] As per the poetry Khushal Khattak “The loss of life and wealth should not matter, what matters is pat.\[20\]
7. **Female honour** (ناموس‎, nāmús). A Pashtun must defend the honour of women at all costs and must protect them from vocal and physical harm.\[2\] The killing of women is forbidden in Pashtun culture.\[21\]
8. **Honour** (ننګ‎, nang). A Pashtun must defend the weak around him.\[22\]
9. **Courage, manhood, or chivalry** (مېړانه‎, meṛā́na)\[23\]. A Pashtun must demonstrate courage. A turban is considered a symbol of a Pashtun's chivalry.\[citation needed\]
10. **Country** (هېواد‎, hewā́d). A Pashtun is obliged to protect the land of the Pashtuns. Defense of the nation means the protection of Pashtun custom.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the past weeks, we have been hearing terrible horror stories of Taliban. Not all the Taliban are Pashtun, but everyone must have pride or honor in their own right. Many are afraid of what the Taliban will do when in power. Fingers chopped off, people burned to death, is that the honor of the Pashtun or of the devout students of knowledge? You make the weak cower in fear of brutality that no person, only a rabid dog would ever use? Does courage mean to abuse those who are already afraid of you? Is kindness meaning to make people fear you so you can rule with an iron fist? There seems no doubt there are monsters among the Taliban, dogs, will those with pride, honor, and bravery be able to beat them down and make possible life led with kindness.

They say Taliban means student or seeker, of knowledge. How will the Taliban govern Afghanistan?

There is news that women from 15 and up and younger are going to be made into slaves of the Taliban, without a choice in who they marry or who they give their bodies to. Is that how the rule of the Taliban is going to be? Did the Taliban liberate Afghanistan or brutally conquer it? Maybe the Taliban won with great risk and through force and feel like rewards for their efforts are needed, but what choice would the strong make?

How can you start a nation where women are forced into servitude of men they don't want to marry? Maybe this issue is just a culture gap, and the women are fine with the arrangement. No doubt, the duty of protecting the honor of women would not include preventing women from marrying men they do not wish to.

The international community is watching. Afghanistan is known for four things, terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition and corruption. The Taliban has shown some early humanitarian signs thus far and if they live up to their name, they could be accepted on the international stage.

So how will the Taliban govern Afghanistan? Will it be through fear and terror? Will the different tribes and diversity of Afghanistan be allowed to flourish? Perhaps there are previous models of governance that the tribes followed ages ago? Maybe a confederacy, a union of independent states would be considered. Perhaps there are better solutions than that. No doubt everyone would have different views and feelings. Maybe a constitution would be crafted? Is there any hope for a fair and good Afghanistan?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Most cryptos won’t survive the next 5 years - opinion,"Crypto projects have largely been in the realm of speculation in years previous. We are witnessing the transition from speculation to application. A lot of cryptos do a lot of things. Most of them overlap in their use cases, some do it better than others, some do more than others. Redundant projects will get knocked out in the coming years.

I remember reading something from the fed about cbdc and it talked about how cbdc will eliminate most cryptos. This doesn’t mean it will eliminate all of them. We know cbdc is on its way and it will of course take time. But when this happens, regulation and red tape are going to be assassinating a lot of projects. After that weaker projects will go. Then it’ll be a handful of powerful projects that still claim necessity even in the presence of cbdc. 

If I had to recommend a long term hold it’d be a project that dominates its use case/application, a project that has prepared very well for incoming regulations and/or a project that hits an application that won’t be touched much by cbdc or other big cryptos.

I don’t want to mention anything specifically because it instantly polarizes people. These are just my thoughts about what’s coming to crypto.

Also I think projects that have wallets and transactions as private information will be opened up or banned. Gov is obsessed with being able to control your finance if they want, then act like they know nothing at tax time, unless you make a mistake.",cryptocurrency

Any help to improve my understanding of the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Loan agent said the closing cost would be packaged into the loan itself, so effectively nothing other than the equity I had, so maybe about $5000-ish? I still have 28 years of payments on this if I stick with it.

CryptoCurrency,Best crypto interest rates 2021 - DeFi and CeFi,[removed],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,FED expected to tighten monetary policies towards the end of 2021 / beginning of 2022,"With the end of last week, the FED published its protocol from end of july’s open market conference in which a majority favoured a return towards monetary responsibility in order to control inflationary tendencies. What does that entail? Ultimately reducing / stopping buying US treasury bonds and raising interest rates. 

If the FED should move towards more fiscal responsibility again, many other central banks are expected to follow. While economic upswing could be robust enough to continue on its own, less market liquidity typically also means less economic growth. 

-&gt; this means that the FED no longer views 5% inflation as transitory and believes they need to act rather sooner than later (who would have thought)

-&gt; if you are looking to get cheap interest rates on loans, you probably want to move before that happens (if it really happens)

I paid off the mortgage on my home and have 100% equity.  The house is valued around 900k.  I have credit score above 800 and I have a steady income around 150k/year. 

My main goal is to take advantage of the low market interest rate and prepare funds for potential investment opportunity in the property market.   Nothing has been determined yet but I'm expecting to find an investment property within a year.  I'm considering to get the loan amount around 70%\~80% LTV.  

After looking at different loan options online, I initially thought about getting a HELOC because I can take the loan whenever I actually need or find the right investment opportunity and only pay the interest when I actually use it.  However, I changed my mind because of the variable rate.  Therefore, I'm debating between cash out refi and home equity loan to get a lump sum upfront and have a fixed rate. 

Between the cash out refi and home equity loan, which one would you recommend considering my situation?

CryptoCurrency,We are at tipping point NOW and the World economy is going to be disrupted drastically. $1000 trillion notional value MUST shift to blockchain.,"TLDR: Blockchain is to economics what calculators are to math.  You don't have to understand the inner workings of a calculator to benefit from using one.  Those who refuse to adopt new tech will be replaced by the ones who do.

Let's start with a definition:  **Technological revolution:  a period in which one or more technologies is replaced by another, novel technology in a short amount of time**.

Notice that last bit: ""...in a short amount of time"".  Blockchain use has been growing for the last decade and a half since Satoshi Nakamoto fired up the bitcoin blockchain.  But the most important part of this growth is that it has been **exponential**.  Exponential growth can be slow.  Growth can be fast without being exponential.  But when something starts growing both **fast and exponentially** things change QUICK!  Burning gunpowder is an example of a tiny spark of flame growing fast and exponentially.

Throughout history many different inventions have changed the way people do things.  Every time a new technology has been introduced it has given the user a competitive advantage over those who did not posses it.  It's not hard to imagine the benefits that the first adopters of the wheel, paper, telephone or internet had as we enjoy these benefits everyday.  Other technologies such as firearms had fast and dire consequences for those that passed up on the benefits of them.

All the worlds markets, including currency, debt, property, precious metals, stocks,  bonds, derivatives, central and federal banks, can all benefit their users by using blockchain.  All these markets combined are estimated between 400-1000 Trillion (yup, with a T).  Countries and corporations that adopt the use of open blockchains in their markets will allow the people using them enjoy the benefits of efficient, permissionless financial services, trading and contracts.  

Being the first implementation, blockchain based currency is leading the numbers in adoption and despite many efforts to ban it it is growing faster than ever.  China has banned crypto multiple times but is ironically the largest bitcoin miner.  

Now blockchain based smart contracts are starting to be used for anything and everything.  People are using decentralized exchanges for trading as there is no risk of funds being frozen or confiscated by the exchanges at a government or others request.  

Large corporates are starting to develop crypto payment processing systems and it is only a matter of time before they start paying crypto dividends.  There will be blockchain based decentralized stock exchanges and people will be able to invest in companies using cryptocurrency and receive tokenised stock certificates.  The 100% transparent operation of these exchanges would take the power away from market manipulators using illegal practices such as naked short selling or one sided trading halts.  Blockchain allows a truly open and free market.

As most cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design there is considerable benefit to holding them as a store of value.  As more people buy the limited amount of these their price will rise which is what we have been seeing over the last decade.  Once a cheap, fast day-to day transactional cryptocurrency enters mass adoption most people will no longer have a use for fiat.  These are already here but are just waiting for mass adoption.  This will further accelerate the change over to crypto from fiat.  

Everything is in place for the world economy to shift to a blockchain based system/s NOW.  The shift is happening and is only getting faster.   As with all exponential change it will happen faster than we think.  It is an ecosystem way to large for anyone to stop or change the direction of even if they wanted to so it is subject to free market principles - unregulated competition will maximize economic benefit for society by providing the most goods and services possible at the lowest cost. 

The first adopters will benefit the most.  There will be a period where fiat limps on but in order to support itself fiat must use inflation to pay for enforcement of its use, further crippling its value and forcing others out.  The last to transfer value to the blockchain will get significantly less crypto for their fiat but by definition the last will transfer value right before fiat collapses.  So the world markets either buy in to crypto or watch their fiat shrink to zero, which is why their value MUST shift to blockchain.

Yes this will be disruptive to say the least, with many power vacuums to be filled, and most likely multiple conflicts along the way.  But like all other technologies that have come before, it will confer greater benefits onto a greater number of people than before cryptographic peer to peer decentralized blockchain came about.",cryptocurrency

[https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
21. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
23. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
25. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that!

26. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream.

27. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs.

31. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)

37. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

39. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

63. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

68. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

74. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

CryptoCurrency,Where do you earn interest on your stablecoins?,"I have a large part of my savings in crypto. But, I'm not a total ape and do hold a lot of stablecoins. However, holding stablecoins in your wallet is a huge waste of capital because you can easily earn 5-40% interest on them. Where do you guys deposit your stablecoins, what yield are you getting, and what’s the reason for you using that platform over others?

On deciding where to deposit, I think most look for security. Reassuring places might be large CeDeFi entities like Celsius, BlockFi, or Coinbase, where you can earn 8.9%, 7.5%, and 4% interest, respectively. Next might be old-name DeFi platforms, like Aave (2%), Compound (4%), Yearn (8%), or Curve (8% in CRV rewards). But, Ethereum has high fees and Yearn has been exploited before.

Of all the protocols I’ve researched, I think Alpaca Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers really high yields (20-50%), while still being secure and trusted. Even though BSC has a bad rep, Alpaca Finance is different. They are a blue-chip protocol and leader in leveraged yield farming across all DeFi chains They have $1.6B in TVL, 11 audits on their smart contracts, and developed many of their own security measures, such as time-locked contracts and an Oracle Guard. If you visit their [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/), you can see the sheer amount of information and transparency they provide. It’s much more than other protocols. From their well-designed user interface and NFT campaigns, you can see how serious they are about their product.

How does Alpaca give you such high interest rates? Leveraged yield farming of stablecoins. For example, if you open a USDT-BUSD leveraged yield farm and deposit $10k USDT, you can borrow up to $50k BUSD (6x leverage) and farm the combined total of $60k. It’s a little bit like Aave, where users deposit stablecoins, borrow stablecoins, and repeat, so they are essentially leveraged up on stablecoins while capturing all that yield. But, the difference is Alpaca Finance 1) does this in one easy step for you and 2) routes your stablecoins to providing liquidity on AMMs, which is more profitable than borrowing/lending (Aave, Compound). Thus, you can get 20-50% yields (right now it’s at 40%).

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Feel free to ask me anything about leveraged farming or DeFi in general. I just want to spread the word that you can still profit by just holding stablecoins, no need to ape everything into crypto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,High Interest rates are killing me.,"So I was dumb when I was younger, thinking I knew how to build my credit and wouldn’t get overwhelmed. Well it turns out I was completely wrong and let my decisions get the better of me. 

I currently have a little over 12k in credit card debt across 3 cards. These are all basically the first forms of credit building I started. Meaning the interest rates are insane, 29.9 % being the highest, I’ve tried getting them lowered but it hasn’t worked. I’ve never missed a payment and I pay over the minimum as often as I can but with the rates so high it doesn’t feel like I’m getting anywhere. A $200 payment doesn’t get me far when I get charged $130 in interest every month.  My credit score is doing okay, around 680 currently.  

I’ve been looking into consolidation, I’ve had a few quotes for around 13k for a 3 or 4 year loan at 10%. I’ve heard loans to consolidate aren’t the greatest idea but I’m not getting far paying the cards down monthly. I’m not in dire need of money, I do okay but I rarely have much left after bills. I’d like to be able to get these down so I can put a little aside for emergencies.

My wife and I are debt free (except a low interest 15 year mortgage that has about 14 years left on it), have a 3-6 month emergency fund, have two kids College 529 plans and invest 15% of our gross income in retirement ($6000 per year per ROTH IRA and the rest in 401Ks). We just got raises and I'm wondering where to put the extra money now? We can't put anymore into an IRA, don't want to save anymore cash on hand and the college funds are pretty set. I also don't think paying off the mortgage earlier is the best use of extra funds considering how low the interest rate is (about 2.3%). 

Do we increase our 401Ks? Create a brokerage account and invest it outside of retirement funds? Something else?

CryptoCurrency,The Global economic Collapse; the hows and the why`s and what effect it may have on Crypto Part 1: Derivatives and Quantitative easing,"Foreword:

A market crash comparable in scope to the great depression is almost a certainty in the next few months due to decades of over-leveraging and irresponsible fiscal policy. Holders should begin moving their coins off of exchanges and into personal wallets immediately to prevent loss in case of exchange shutdown, outage, or ""outage"". Restrictions of Exchange and withdrawal are also a distinct possibility due to historical precedence.

**Tl;Dr Take possession of your coins you are not actively using to trade or use in DeFi to prevent losing access to them during market volatility and the possibility of exchanges preventing access, going insolvent, or pretending to be having technical difficulties to prevent liquidity drain. Global economy screwed. No one can guess the effect that a market   crash of the magnitude described here will have on the wider crypto-market. As the only widely spread store of value out of the direct control of a few entities and governments Crypto may paradoxically rise as the market falls as people Fomo into it to preserve capital. Or with the new inclusion of institutional investors with large holdings it may force the Market to dump as liquidators force sell institutional holdings at a loss to cover margin tanking the market (institutions have no choice in the matter). Worst case the US dollar will collapse making Crypto sympathetically worthless. Only you can decide what to do in the events soon to come and these posts are only about providing information so you can make informed decisions.**

Note:   None of this is speculation it is all based on existing facts, historical precedence, and other otherwise publicly unknown details. Sources will be cited at the beginning of each section. Some of this may be unintelligible due to terminology used. I will put long forms of Acronyms whenever possible but to explain every minute detail would detract from the message of the post. I speculate only on its effects on Crypto.

Quick Definition:

What is a derivative?

“A financial product derived from another financial product” (for example, a futures contract tied to a stock index) — in practice, the term applies to a whole world of financial products that are written on a one-off basis between two entities called “counterparties,” as opposed to products that are traded on a broad, well-regulated market.

Standard futures contracts are bought and sold on large exchanges, for example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). If I buy a futures contract — for example, I go long (contract or agree to *buy*   in  the future) a million bushels of wheat, or barrels of oil, in the expectation that the future price will rise within the time limit of the contract — there will be a counterparty on the short, or selling  side, in a well-regulated market, the  contracts are all standardized;  there are thousands of identical  contracts in pairs (one on the long or buy side, and one on the short or sell side); and as long as there are the same number of identical contracts on each side, it makes no difference  who’s on the other side of the contract. The exchange just matches up longs with shorts when they liquidate. Or at least that is how it is supposed to work. Read on to find out why it does not.

**Some of you have expressed disgust and fear about exchanges that allow up to 125x margin. Individuals financially ruined for life for the small chance of getting rich. Now imagine that but it is the entire financial system itself. But it is many, many times higher than 125x margin. That is the situation we face. This is not Capitalism it never was. Nothing is made. Nothing is exchanged. It is purely and simply theft. And it has gone on longer than any of us has been alive.**

Banks and Bankers have long been derided throughout history for good reason, Jesus himself if you are partial to the faith committed violence against them for defiling the temple. In 2008 they were the primary cause of the global financial crisis due to bad swaps and credit. In 2008 the stick that broke the camels back was bad credit MBS\`s  (Mortgage backed  securities). These loans and property acted as the collateral for these securities. What most of you are not aware of is just why this was so devastating beyond a few million people being foreclosed upon. And what does this picture above have to do with that? Everything. The reason 2008 was so devastating is that those MBS\`s acted as the collateral for the securities needed to hedge margin. Without them the derivatives which the banks and other financial  institutions had became unbacked which caused a scramble for securities and collateral. The $ amount of  derivatives and leverage outnumber the  amount of $ in existence, never mind in circulation.

For  reference  the total $ in circulation last check was approximately US  $37  trillion. In existence meaning everything held by every bank and  country  in the world due to the US reserve currency status is $93.86 trillion USD. Most of this will never see the light of day as they act  as simple  backing of currency. This caused a mad scramble to cover  debts and went  up the chain of responsibility through insurance policies. When an entity became insolvent the backing bank got  shouldered with the bill and themselves became insolvent. (They use  your money for this by the  way.) But that was unacceptable the world  economy would have been  destroyed. So what happened? Bailouts. A few individuals were designated to take the fall and the rest were bailed  out on the tax payer dime and were even richly rewarded with bonuses. This was done through a process called Quantitative Easing, (Permanent removal of Collateral in exchange for liquidity) so problem solved right?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxS8NhWA41Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxS8NhWA41Q)

Quantitative easing contrary to what Keynesian economics advocates (Modern Monetary Theory) believe is not the balm for the world economy. It just hid the economic crisis put it in stasis if you will and kept digging the hole deeper. It did not have to be this way, the banks and other  institutions that will be mentioned were essentially bought time to unwind their positions and unscrew the situation. Something sensible, reasonable even. Something really good for long term business health and profitability but terrible for the short term bottom line. Did they do this? No, they doubled, tripled, and quadrupled their bets and positions and they have done so for the past 10 years. Dodd Frank is not worth the paper its printed on because Gary Gensler (Then CFTC  chairman) whom was its champion at the time insisted that the loopholes being exploited be put in.

The total amount of derivatives reported by banks from the q1 occ report is $189 Trillion. For reference the Global GDP as reported by the IMF is about $141 Trillion. These are just the Big American banks in the financial sector. This is all backed by only $20.273 Trillion in assets between all banks listed. This is only a small fraction of the full derivatives market. The full scope of which I have only seen one reference too a number in a radio interview put forward by Paul Willmot. This interview was only a  few months immediately following the financial crisis. $1.2 Quadrillion. Yes Quadrillion. But we will get  to that later.

You might be asking, why this matters now? The economy is good right now right? Except its not.

You may have heard of the rising inflation right? On paper inflation has risen 5% for at least 3 months in a row now. (Last time that happened was 2008 and the great recession.) But what if I told you the real number was higher because the equation used to decide it has been changed multiple times to hide the real number. How is this happening? The talking heads on television would blame retail or ""normal people"" and stimulus, but that is not what happened. Almost all of the federal stimulus has been kept out of the hands of retail. Many programs were never even rolled out with the states simply keeping the money. Only a fraction of what was meant for rent relief has been spent. So that is not it. So why the high inflation? The margin debt has gotten too big is what happened but even that could be kicked down the road for a time. Unfortunately, the Fed has had to keep the money printer on non-stop to give the economy the appearance of functioning normally. This sucks the collateral out of the market at a breakneck pace and as that  collateral is permanently removed, the purchasing power of the currency falls.

The fed is not the only thing that needs those securities. Banks, hedgefunds, bonds, bullion banks they also need those securities. And there is a finite number of them. The government is also technically shut down right now. The debt ceiling has not been raised, meaning no more securities can be made. So what is in the market is what is available. And that will be the case  until the end of September at minimum as congress is on vacation. We do not have that long. Essentially the entire market is playing a game of musical chairs. And the instant one player, just one is unable to  secure the securities it needs margin will be called. The game will stop. There is not enough  money in the entire world to cover the margin that will come due. That will be a catastrophic event that cannot be stopped at this point you have very little time to be prepared. Its not doomsday but this will be at minimum a great depression 2.0.

1.2   Quadrilion? I can scarcely imagine the number. Even spread over every financial sector in the world bond market (Jane Street), Stock Market (Wall Street), Bullion (London, Comex, Misc.), Commodities, and Real Estate. It is still unfathomably high to put it into perspective a million dollars (bills) would stack to your height more or less. A billion would scale a building. A trillion a sky scraper. A quadrilion would scale all the way to space and be well on its way to the moon. That was in 2009, Margin has only increased since then at a breakneck pace as quantitative easing hid its effects. No official number exists but it has at least doubled since 2009.

Without touching on the other sectors margin of US banks being more than the entire World GDP would be dire enough so I will begin by briefing you on the biggest publicly accessible piece of evidence of whats happening.

The What? You are possibly asking, I won\`t lie I struggled to understand  it myself at first thinking it meant something else. Sparing you the history the Reverse Repo is a service provided by the Federal Reserve whereby it opens its treasury reserves  (T-Bills) to money market funds (MMF\`s) and now other financial institutions. This is to ensure those funds remain solvent in the case that sufficient treasuries are not located to fill collateral requirements. MMF\`s **need** treasuries. It is a non-negotiable requirement to keep the USD **solvent.** In the event they are not able to locate the required collateral even once the currency could collapse overnight. And as USD is the reserve   currency most other currencies would as well including I fear cryptocurrencies as it is still dependent on the dollar for liquidity. This is the **absolute worst case scenario** and also **the least likely** as the Fed would do literally anything to prevent that from happening. I will be grossly oversimplifying this concept due to the sheer complexity involved. If you wish to know the full nuances I have posted the title of a post on a sub that does not allow linking above.\*

The Reverse Repo works by the FED essentially loaning a portion of its own treasury supply (collateral) to the applying fund for a period of about 24 hours in exchange for US dollars (liquidity) before that treasury must be returned. However going by the musical chairs theme we seem to be seeing, that treasury is then immediately loaned back to the  borrowing institution until either the event that required the collateral has passed, indefinitely if the situation is stagnant, or until the FED can no longer supply sufficient treasuries. You can see in the image above that that at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic regardless of what you believe about its origins and the current social state of the country the Reverse Repo immediately shot up like a  Cannon. We will get into some of the reasons why as we go on. The total  amount of funds that are being parked at the FED overnight has just passed 1.1 Trillion $.  And it will continue going up for a number of  Reasons, but  primarily there are three really big ones and we are going parabolic as the Congressional Budget Office admits inflation and the  GDP will ""surpass its maximum sustainable level by the end of the  year"".  [https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57263](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57263)

Meaning the game of musical chairs will get turned to 11 until when the music stops there are no more chairs.

These reasons are as follows taken from the post referenced above.

&gt;Loss of Faith in Primary Dealers/Repo Counterparties- Bank Credit Contraction beginning. CDS Rising.Collateral Supply Shortage- Caused by the Treasury drawing down the TGA (Treasury  General Account) and hitting the Debt Ceiling (Treasury not issuing more bills/bonds). SLR exemption expired. Massive Treasury Demand- Spawned by “flight to quality” from FIs, Fed   continues to pump  $120B a month into the banking system. The Fed is EATING the Treasury  Market.

1. Banks   have stopped giving out new loans despite the FED printing money like crazy and giving it directly to the banks for nothing. ~~Wells Fargo has stopped personal lines of credit~~ (apparently the reinstated it~~)~~, JP Morgan chase is hoarding cash, and that ties directly back to the Covid-19 Stimulus. That money was meant to prop up the economy and help the average person weather this storm but none of it has been given out. Real inflation is closer to 12-14% and banks are directly hurt by inflation because it devalues loans. This is one of the arguments people use to say that inflation is good. Also credit contraction is a historical sign of an impending market crash. Banks credit risks are skyrocketing and practice something that is the center of almost all of the market corruption and ""growth"" you have seen is **rehypothecation** a similar process is known as fractional reserve banking. A process by   which a financial institution sells the same asset to X number of people. On paper each individual owns the same asset and they are the only owner. Imagine if you will a car salesman selling the same car to a hundred people and mandating that you cannot take possession of it and if you want to use it you have to give them notice to take it out for a   day. What happens when two people want the same day? The dealer cannot tell either driver that they cannot have the vehicle for the day. The same analogy applies to treasuries. Default happens when the paradox comes due for fruition. The MMF\`s cannot afford that. So they park their money at the FED for a flat rate of interest of 0.05% because Fed treasuries cannot be rehypothecated and the FED cannot default removing counterparty risk.
2. The Debt ceiling was not raised this past July. As the treasury is draining its general fund it only has enough to at most last 10 more days at  current average daily drain. (This is also a crash catalyst due to the precarious state of the market) And congress is on Vacation until mid  September. No more new treasuries can be made until it is or next years tax funding comes in. Which means whatever treasuries are in  the system  are whats available. And the FED is vacuuming all of them up for itself. Still pumping $120 Billion into the system monthly.

*""The* [*SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio)*](https://www.risk.net/definition/supplementary-leverage-ratio-slr) *is the U.S. version of BASEL-III capital adequacy norm and a Tier-1 leverage ratio; it varies from 3-5% common equity capital U.S. banks must maintain relative to their total leverage exposure. This is like a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements”*

3.   With the SLR exemption expiring in March of this year Banks are scrambling for collateral with the expiration of a Covid-19 collateral exemption normally to back their margin they must have at least 3 to 5 % of assets compared to liabilities. This means they could have a  balance sheet of 100% liabilities. Their Margin could be unlimited. While in practice it did not go to that extreme banks did take the opportunity to ratchet up their leverage. With the expiration of the exemption banks had to scramble to find collateral to park at the FED and leave it there. It cannot be withdrawn only moved between accounts. The FED is not allowed to use this collateral, only its own so it sits there to maintain SLR but as credit defaults happen and bank margin increases more collateral must be added to the pile proportional to liabilities. This competes with the FED.

What does this have to do with Crypto?

If Fiat currency collapses crypto will too. Though that is the worst case scenario and they will simply let the banks default before they let the MMF\`s. I see three scenarios; Someone more knowledgeable about the crypto market and its economics will need to chime in if I am missing   something or there was a factor I missed.

1. Due to Asset hyperinflation and the FED needing to make the money printer go Brr to pay off all of the margin debt I can see the bull market extending to Mars due to Asset hyperinflation. Good news, you will have time to move liquidity from Crypto to hard assets that retain value faster than the numbers can lose value as inflation is not that fast.   Everyone will be scrambling to put their money in the Crypto space as assets cannot be rehypothecated. This may be a Pyhric victory.
2. Due to institutions being so overleveraged they will be forced to liquidate their assets to cover margin obligations which will tank the market and may even destroy it. Perma bear market incoming and we are  all screwed.
3. It  does not effect Crypto and companies are able to move their Crypto holdings to shell companies to avoid loss as they do with market crashes. Effectively continuing the current bull market or simply trade sideways. Though the effective value of the gains would cancel out at best or represent a marginal return.

In any case this is not Financial Advice but I would wait until the end of august to start taking profits and begin moving coins I am holding for the long term to cold storage to avoid loss due to exchange failure.

Part two will cover the leverage of Financial institutions and the abuse of Covid Relief funds as well as the corruption of the markets and rehypothecation.

CryptoCurrency,The unstable and the stable: Stablecoins,"In theory, Stablecoins are all the same. They are pegged to the native currency they are meant to represent and that should be the end of it. 

Right? 

**Unfortunately not quite.** Haha. I'm like Dr. Suess. 

Not all Stablecoins are created equal, and I'm here today to talk to you about what makes each of our most boring crypto investments special. 

**USDC** 

USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, and governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. USDC boasts the ""largest Stablecoin ecosystem"" used by hundreds of companies, exchanges, Defi protocols, etc. 

With 27.3 Billion in circulation, USDC is massive. It's a Coinbase darling, and it's widely used and accepted as the Stablecoin standard. 

USDC is largely backed, so it wouldn't have a Tether situation. Which for those who don't know is the FED of crypto. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. 

**DAI** 

My personal favorite. 

The first decentralized, collateral-backed Stablecoin, DAI maintains a 1:1 value with the US dollar by locking other cryptocurrencies into contracts. 

This means that unlike other asset-backed cryptocurrencies, which may be issued by for-profit companies, DAI is the product of an open-source software called the Maker Protocol, a decentralized application running on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

As such, DAI maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars custodied by a company, but by using collateralized debt denominated in Ethereum. 

**How DAI works**

The Maker Protocol, through smart contracts running on Ethereum, enables borrowers to lock ETH and other crypto assets, thus collateralizing it, in order to generate new DAI tokens in the form of loans. 

If borrowers wish to recover the locked ETH, they will have to return the DAI to the protocol and pay a fee. In the event of liquidation, the Maker Protocol will take the collateral and sell it using an internal market-based auction mechanism.

If users want to acquire DAI, they can spend ETH to purchase the dollar equivalent amount in DAI on an exchange or they can collateralize ETH and other assets using the Maker Protocol. 

The latter method allows users who do not want to sell their assets to still acquire DAI.

**Collateralized Debt positions**

Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) are the smart contracts on the Maker Protocol that users can leverage to lock their collateral assets (i.e., ETH or BAT) and generate DAI. 

CDPs can be thought of as secure vaults for storing the aforementioned collateral. To account for the volatility in the crypto collateral, DAI is often over-collateralized, meaning that the deposit amount required is typically higher than the value of DAI.

For example, users must spend $200 in ETH in order to receive $100 DAI, which is meant to account for the potential decrease in the value ETH. As a result, if ETH depreciates by 25%, the $100 in DAI would still be safely collateralized by $150 in ETH. 

In order to recover the stored ETH, the user has to return the DAI and pay a stability fee.



**Supply the DAI** 

Due to its design, the supply of DAI cannot be altered by any party in the network. Rather, it is maintained through a system of smart contracts designed to dynamically respond to changes in the market price of the assets in its contracts. Again, avoiding a Tether situation. 

DAI was founded in 2014 by the foundation that would become MakerDAO, launching officially in 2017.

**Tether**

personalfinance,I am 16 - would like thoughts on opening a credit card,"Good morning all!

I am a 16 year old with parents in the military. I currently have a debit card via Navy Federal. IO would like to open a credit card in my name to start building my credit score. My question is: when I am 18 and no longer want a bank account attached to my parents, will my credit score follow me? If I do not join the military, I will be switching banks. Because of that, is there any reason for me to start building a credit score? Will it follow me to another bank? Is it a good idea to get a credit card at my current age? I am financially responsible and would simply use it as a debit card.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT: Another question: I have done some research and concluded that I cannot have a credit card under my name; only as an authorized user as my parents. My question above still stands - is it worth it?

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency Staking — A good alternative to a savings account?,"With interest rates falling, is moving your money into cryptocurrency staking a good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zn68zdcav4j71.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71ae1c5a973e1610dbf76d503a159ee08b464ef4

2021 has been a crazy year. Whilst we’ve all been locked away with little to do, the cryptocurrency market has been on an aggressive Bullrun, similar to that of 2017. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Whilst not making up the entire market, Bitcoin is a good indicator for the entire market trend. ](https://preview.redd.it/515eeyqdv4j71.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dc88e05ce44de15c5e397fe0dba7d586638df1b)

&amp;#x200B;

Simultaneously, banks have been lowering interests rates on savings accounts for years but this has been particularly drastic in 2020/21. The average interest rate on a UK savings account fell from [**1.39%** in 2019 to just **0.64%** in 2020](https://www.swanlowpark.co.uk/savings-interest-annual). Given that the rate of inflation in the UK in 2020 was [about 1%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270384/inflation-rate-in-the-united-kingdom/), it’s clear that while crypto was on the up, traditional savings accounts were on the down.

# So what even is staking?

The process of owning cryptocurrency is a very simple one.  
After you’ve bought your desired coins/tokens, you can decide where you store them (exchange, cold storage, hot storage etc) and then that’s it. You don’t have to interact with them until you either sell or buy more.  
You buy, you hold, you sell. That’s all there is to it.

Staking lets you do something with your crypto that is otherwise just sitting about doing nothing. By “staking” your crypto, you can earn a small extra amount of that currency on top of your initial holdings. The annual interest from staking usually hovers in the **5%–10% range**, but due to the nature of staking you are **not guaranteed** these returns (explained later).

&amp;#x200B;

[An example of commonly staked cryptocurrencies and their expected annual return](https://preview.redd.it/rhnagsqhv4j71.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df56889cc17be0b73a5ef90fdd330fb71b036774)

 

Staking allows **your crypto to work** **for you** and generate a small amount of passive income. The best part is that you, the holder, benefits in all scenarios;

***If the crypto price increases***  
Your underlying holdings value will increase, **as well as** the value of any rewards gained from staking. You’re essentially “double-dipping” by profiting on both the holding and the reward.

***If the crypto price decreases***  
Your underlying holdings value will decrease, **as well as** the value of any rewards gained from staking -**but** you’ve offset some of these losses with the rewards from staking.

Being able to realize annual returns of 5%+, it’s clear why staking has become increasingly popular recently.

# How does staking work?

Staking works on the concept of “Proof-of-stake” (PoS).  
When you hold enough of the specific crypto you become **trusted** enough to help **validate transactions** on the underlying blockchain. For your help in validating these transactions, you earn a small amount of the same currency.

Not every cryptocurrency works on the concept of PoS. A large amount still operate under the “Proof-of-work” (PoW) protocol. Simply put PoW relies on miners and computation power to solve cryptographic puzzles and validate transactions. PoS and PoW are huge topics, and I urge you to do more research into the similarities and differences.

&amp;#x200B;

[  PoW vs PoS is an ongoing debate in the crypto community.](https://preview.redd.it/37j5s7ipv4j71.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41222fc7a7f0ea758301d9389e367f42e7ccd8c1)

 

**You can only stake on Proof of Stake platforms.** Notably, this means that you cannot stake Bitcoin as it’s based on PoW. If you see BTC staking, it’s likely to be more like “loaning” your BTC for an annual return. This is not the same as staking. Be **extremely careful** that the crypto you are staking is actually based on PoS.

As I mentioned before, staking rewards are not fixed to a particular percentage. Unless you have a huge amount of crypto and the tech skills to setup your own nodes, you’re likely going to be staking as part of a [**pool**](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/staking-pool). The rewards you receive in an *epoch* (5 day staking period) are related to the performance of the pool as a whole. There is an inherent randomness to your staking rewards, but averaged over a year these tend to stay within the 5%-10% range.

# Is staking risky?

Due to the fact that staking requires owning cryptocurrency, there is a high amount of risk involved. Although the term “staking” sounds like you could easily lose your steak (in this case, the held crypto), this really isn’t the case. If you already own PoS backed crypto, then staking is a great choice. If your crypto allows you to stake and keep your own private keys (Eg/ Cardano(ADA)), then **staking introduces no more risk than owning the crypto to begin with.**  
Some staking services keep control of your private keys, which means that there is always a risk of losing your crypto to a hack (and this has happened with ERC20 based staking before). But this is also the case when you keep your crypto on an exchange even without staking it, which is why it is good practice to transfer your crypto from the exchange you purchased it on.

# Summary — Staking or Savings?

Staking, or more specifically owning cryptocurrency, is high risk, high reward. Whilst staking allows you to gain passive income on your initial investment, there is nothing to protect the value of this initial investment.  
The interest rates offered by saving accounts are shockingly bad, but they have the huge advantage of **protecting your money**.

The golden rule of gambling and cryptocurrency is to **only buy what you can afford to lose**. Unless you can afford to lose all the money in your savings account, then comparing figures like 0.63% and 5%-10% is quite misleading.

If you already hold PoS based crypto, then you’re losing money by not staking. But if you hold 0 cryptos, then I wouldn’t suggest dumping all your money into staking. The reality is that crypto will never be a safe investment, it is up to you to decide if the level of risk is worth the potential gains. There is no clear answer to the Staking vs Savings question as it depends entirely upon the individual (**you**!).

dogecoin,Bank of Doge?,"Most fiat currencies are issued by a central bank (Euro-ECB, GBP-BoE, JPY-BoJ, USD-Fed etc.). A ‘committee’ at the central bank decides how many (eg) dollars to print or burn in a particular period of time. The dollar has no upper limit on how many $ can ever be produced (as for Doge and the other currencies). Dogecoin, like the other currencies  could be ‘issued’ by a bank - “the Decentralized Bank of Doge” (DBD). This can be all Dogecoin blockchain participants. The Dogecoin blockchain connects participants directly with one another on the blockchain to verify and record the currency transactions, so the participants are already a bank in any case if you think about it.

Then there is no need for a cap, just a mechanism to regulate the Doge supply.

Bitcoin,Easy to way to calculate desired wealth in terms of today's dollar value,"The M2 money supply is defined as everything in M1 (very liquid) as well as ""near money"" or quickly cash-convertible money. The Fed shows that M2 money supply is very close to 21 trillion which presents us a unique opportunity to calculate how much bitcoin we'd need as a fraction of total supply (21 million) to be worth the equivalent in easily-convertible dollars. Bear in mind this assumes that bitcoin will eventually take over the M2 supply, in other words, bitcoin's market cap is 21 trillion (its currently just under 1 trillion today).

For instance, if you wanted to eventually have the equivalent of 10 million dollars after bitcoin ""takes over"", then you'd need the same fraction of bitcoin as $10 million / $21 trillion. Since 1 trillion is 1 million million, the fraction reduces 10 / 21 million, which equates to 10 bitcoin. If you want your net worth to be $100 million after bitcoin becomes the standard, you'd need 100 coins, and so forth.

tl;dr: The cash and near-cash supply is close to 21 trillion, so you just need 1 coin per $1 million dollars once bitcoin takes over. As printer goes BRR and M2 supply inflates to $100+ trillion the numbers won't be so easy to calculate, so do the easy math while you can, kids!",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,This millionaire gives everyone who is vaccinated free bitcoin,"Every Australian who is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can get 5 Australian dollars (3,5 euro) worth of bitcoin. Now the key question: Who is paying for all this? Fred Schebesta is the CEO of [Finder.com](https://Finder.com) and a millionaire.

**Way to contribute**

When he announced the plan on radio in Sydney this week, the self-made millionaire said he was looking for a way to contribute to vaccination efforts and thought it might be one way to help.

**Request via an app**

Anyone who has already received, or received once, two doses of the available vaccine is welcome to apply for the Bitcoin reward by downloading the [Finder.com](https://Finder.com) app and providing proof of vaccination.

[Finder.com](https://Finder.com) is a comparison site that provides guides and information on a range of products and services. It provides industry analysis in Australia and internationally. One of his recent surveys revealed that Southeast Asian countries are at the forefront of crypto adoption. Another study showed that the gender gap in crypto investments in Australia is narrowing. Let's just say his one study is better than the other.

**100 million dollars**

If all the more than 20 million people in Australia who are eligible for the vaccine apply, Schebesta would have to pay more than 100 million Australian dollars (61 million euros). He says this is an amount he is happy to pay.

The speed of vaccine rollout has been a sticking point in Australia, as less than 30 percent of the population over the age of 16 appears to be fully vaccinated. Supply chain problems and poor communication between the federal government and the states and territories are the cause of the poor adoption. In addition, just like in the rest of the world, there are people who hesitate or refuse to take the vaccine. Schebesta hopes to convince those doubters.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,DeFi Staking Scams: Quick Explanation Of How These Scams Work,"Been seeing a lot of people new to crypto interested in staking, and of course they see crazy projects with massive 100K% APY and think, ""wouldn't it be dumb to *NOT* sign up?""

Wrong. We call this type of staking **Degen Staking**, and though you can earn a lot money, most of them are meant for you to lose money immediately. Here's how they work:

The staking pool will give you a very high % interest rate with a high priced coin. When you stake (any popular coin, like ETH), you are asked to pay a 4% staking fee to the pool (unrelated to the network fees). When the staking begins, the interest rate's returns will slowly diminish, and the price of the coin will slowly drop as well. This means that you are receiving less coins every minute, which makes you want to stake longer, but the coin is dropping in price, so your gains are constantly decreasing until they're almost worthless.

You will not make that 4% back. That's how they get you. It's obviously especially worse if you invest in the staking coin, as you'll see A LOT more than just 4% go down the drain.

This is how staking scams work. They are especially prevalent on Polygon and Binance chains.

Just a note, some people have made a lot of money on the correct services, and I do not mean to diminish these services or actions. But most degen staking is a scam, so please be careful!",cryptocurrency

# Company History

Borrowing &amp; lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)
- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales &amp; Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

&gt; Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

&gt; We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&amp;text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&amp;player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

### Executive degen TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.

personalfinance,"Maxing tax advantaged accounts with more to invest; does it make more sense to contribute to taxable, or swap some traditional-401k contributions to roth-401k contributions?","I'm about to turn 25, and currently make about ~70k in a pretty low cost of living area. I'm maxing my roth-IRA, and currently contribute most of my 401k funds as traditional (instead of roth) to drop me from the 22% federal tax bracket down to the 12% federal tax bracket (about $17.5k/yr). After that, I fill what little is left of the 19.5k/yr max with roth-401k contributions (about $2k/yr), and I still have about $8k per year left to invest.

I do not have an HSA, but will next year and plan on maxing it. My employer unfortunately does not offer mega-backdoor roth-IRA contributions. I'm 50/50 on grad school, so not sure a 529 account makes sense.

For context, my investment horizon is likely 20-30 years, as I plan on retiring somewhat early. My current state is around a 5% tax rate, and I have no idea where I will want to retire.

So what is the most tax-efficient investment option? Contribute the rest to taxable, or switch my traditional 401k contributions to roth 401k contributions?

Thankfully, this has somewhat been discussed before, and in this spreadsheet simulation with his numbers, he determines the extra roth contributions have a -0.2% advantage compared to taxable: https://thefinancebuff.com/roth-401k-for-people-who-contribute-max.html

However, my numbers obviously will not line up with his numbers. My marginal rate now is around 27% (federal+state, not sure if I need to include payroll taxes?), and I have no clue what my retirement tax rate would be. If I assume it will be the same as my current tax rate, then the extra roth contributions actually have an advantage over taxable. I have no idea if that will be the case though. Would it make more sense to just go with a taxable account in case I want to pull the money out for a down payment on a house or new car or something? Or am I missing something, and one is clearly more tax efficient than the other?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 23, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**

Stocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week’s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).

Last week, equities came under pressure after the Fed’s July meeting minutes, which said “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

**Highlights**

* The US Food and Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna’s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. 
* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, “The proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe”.
* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. 
* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.
* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney “shop in a shop” locations in 2019.
* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson’s flight a few weeks ago.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120

gaming,Please help me find this game.,"Platform(s): Android

Genre: Platformer, arcade, Puzzle Maybe. You're a cube and you jump lol.

Estimated year of release: I played it during late 2017 or early 2018 so it must have been recent at that time. (Could be very possibly 2016 or 2019 too, but around these few years only)

Graphics/art style: Very minimalistic like all the ""Ketchapp"" games, but this one was very professionally made and it had a set of certain distinct color pallets such as white being the most common one. Very vibrant and shaded beautiful mesmerizing colors. There was black maybe, I most certainly remember the color red. I HAVE ATTACHED A ROUGH REFFERENCE IMAGE that I just created in my illustration software in under 10 minutes specifically for this post. It may ring some bells, this image is burned in my head, the game almost looked like this. (maybe lol, my memory is shitty tho.)

YOU CAN FIND THE PICTURE HERE: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1elIFGBkNBhLSvdceioBEAKrpksiro-By/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1elIFGBkNBhLSvdceioBEAKrpksiro-By/view?usp=sharing

Notable characters: A cube because you play as the cube. I don't recall any other characters.

Notable gameplay mechanics: Press and hold to see the trajectory of your cube with small black dots. I made them big in the pic for  stressing on it. Release your touch to let the cube jump from one platform to the other. You can see and jump over multiple platforms, even the ones you can't see, since the game was specifically played in portrait mode only, I have made the illustration 720x1280 pixels. The mechanics remind me of angry birds. Side camera view. 3d graphics. 

Other details: There are various worlds/levels in the game and each has it's own color pallet, and very distinct Greek Mythology type names (cant say for sure tho) But I think the cube stays the same color i.e. off white (I could be wrong here). It was certainly not an easy game by any games. When you landed perfectly in the center of a platform, it awards you with a bonus animation where a very thin line of some color (maybe yellow) appears to appear and grow large in size while ultimately fading away. I know the cube is not in the center but I just wanted to depict that. It seems like an important detail to me. AND FOR SOME REASON I cannot get the word ""Rune"" out of my head. My brain is associating this word with the game but google searching ""Rune android game"" was not fruitful. Also, the HIGHSCORE shows in the dead center of the screen as depicted in the picture. Very, very distinct detail right there.

Story Time:- I get my 1st ever smartphone, the LG G3, I purchased it in used condition for very cheap back in Dec 2017. I'm in love with all the relevant games on the play store. Now I don't exactly remember where I got this game from but it must've been on the play store because I was not a phone nerd back then, and I loved my phone too much to take risks like rooting it and installing things from non trusted website giving off apks and mods like Halloween candy and stuff. I get this game, I'm mesmerized by the visuals but hate the difficulty, lo and behold fast forward a year and half, my phone dies to a bootloop. I lose 2 years worth of poetry and almost die from a heart attack but we managed to save it when the phone turned on for one last time. I lived, but the phone died afterwards. I get a new phone in July 2019. A year later I remember this game I used to like. There was no game like it. A cube jumping, simple game. The memory was emotionally strong but I was unable to remember a name. I whiffed it. Then, it hit me again this year, like ""Yo! you really used to like that game"", tears in my eyes almost, I'm searching off my play store history, all the games listed ever installed in my google play account, database websites I found through googling stuff (a half ass effort on them because I lost hope.) Here I am, fellow gamers, in your hands, skipping my dinner to illustrate my last memory of a beloved game, and writing this post (you may find this in various sub reddits If I'm able to copy post it) Help me find this game, ye shall relieve this heart of the sorrow it faces.

personalfinance,Getting Out of a Loan With Abusive Father,"About 8 months ago, my father loaned me $10,000 (25% interest rate) to buy a car after I dropped out of college. I made the mistake of accepting it. The car I bought was a lemon. I’ve already put $3,000 into repairs, and between all of the upcoming repairs I’m looking at an additional $9,000.
The problem is, I make below minimum wage, as I live in a small town with very few jobs. My goal is to move to a more populated city and get a job I can live on, but my father won’t let me leave until I get the car paid off.
So I’m stuck. My father has been physically and emotionally abusive for as long as I can remember, so I’m stuck at home, constantly having panic attacks, with no way out. 

My dad expects me to pay $1,000 a month, which I don’t make enough to pay. On top of that, my car has an interference engine, so if I don’t find a way to get $1,200 to change the timing belt, the engine will blow. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been considering leaving the car behind and leaving my family, and never looking back. That’s what I want to do, but would that be too cruel? Even though I despise them, they’re still my parents.

Would that legally be okay? No contracts were signed and the car is in my name. I know a lot of lenders will take your car if you stop making payments. I just don’t know what to do.

personalfinance,"Financing a home, confused about loan payments","So I'm financing a home for the first time and it's about 282000, I haven't seen my estimated apr yet. I make about 3k a month. Now I'm confused because the mortgage calculators all say my payments with escrow included should be between 1300 to 1700 depending on apr between 2 to 3% which is outside my budget and not something I feel I can afford. I talked to my loan officer though and they say it's about 780 a month depending on my insurance coverage. Is it normal for such a big discrepancy? Am I just getting an extremely good interest rate due to being a first time buyer? Or should I be looking out for something sketchy or vital information I might be missing?

cybersecurity,Question: Best Security Certification for Learning Compliance Requirements,"**TLDR: Is CISA the right the right path for learning CMMC, Fedramp, HIPPA, and PCI requirements from an IT industry perspective?**

Hey all! I am an IT Analyst working as a Solutions Architect for a startup(ish) SaaS IT automation/security company. I consistently get questions about our product and how it either helps organizations pursue certifications such as Fedramp, CMMC, PCI or other strings of letters I have never heard of. My background is strongly geared toward linux automation and configuration as code. I don't know anything about Security compliance. But, rather than continue to defer these questions to my security team, I would like to learn the requirements and be able to provide strong and educated answers to these questions when they come up during the pre-sale process.

To that end, do you guys have recommendations for a good, general IT Security certification for someone with a decent chunk of IT industry experience, but with little security exposure which would prep me to answer questions such as, ""Would your company be able to help us achieve CMMC certification?"", or ""Does your product perform PCI compliance scans?"".

I've obviously been doing my own research, and so far it looks like the CISA certification might fit the bill for the types of knowledge I need to have, but I am absolutely willing to look at other options. I know certification is not a replacement for experience or knowledge. I just learn best when I have a target to aim at, and in a pre-sale capacity, it adds to my credibility during the process to have fancy letters after my name (love it or hate it, that's the game).",technology

We've spent a lot of time looking around at houses and seeing what's out on the market now, we have a realtor, and have looked at a couple of houses. My realtor advised me to get a mortgage pre-approval done so I can see exactly what I can afford (we were just guessing before, on the lower end of what we believed we could afford). We recently completed the application and submitted all our info and they sent us our pre-approval letter with the specific conditions. I noticed that there is no interest rate on the pre-approval letter? Is this common? It seems odd to me to not give an interest rate seeing as that directly affects how much house I'd be able to actually afford.

CryptoCurrency,Reddit CryptoSnoo #4 Auction Failed to Meet Reserve - Possible Reasons Why,"I don't know what the reserve was set at. Is it possible to see it in the OpenSea contract? I couldn't find it. Top bid was 35 ETH, which is significantly below the first 3, which sold for 105, 115 and 175 ETH.  


Some possible reasons:  
 \* #4 ended on a Monday vs a Wednesday  
 \* #4 ended with ETH at $3300 vs $2200 for 1-3  
 \* At the time, 1-3 were thought to be the entirety of ""First Ever Drop""  
 \* #4 was announced 2 months after FED 1-3 sold, said to be included in FED, along with ""approximately"" 8 more snoos  
 \* possibly more marketing/awareness around the 1-3 auction  
 \* synergies/cross-selling realized by selling several items at once  


I think that the uncertainty around the project could be a major factor.  Throwing ""approximately"" 9 new items in to what was thought to be an edition of 3, after the first 3 had sold should be troubling to collectors &amp; investors.  What happens if those 9 sell and another 90 are added?  What's the price floor?  How do I value the scarcity and exclusivity?  What's the hard quantity limit?  How does anyone know that this Legendary #4 won't be aesthetically inferior to the next 8 released?  Should they save their money?  All should have been released at the same time to avoid this.  I think some basic tokenomics/pumpamentals were ignored with this expansion from 3 to \~12.  Reddit should consult some serious collectors before making further releases.",cryptocurrency

retirement,Best approach for medical insurance between 60 and 65,"I want to run by you some possible scenarios related to an early retirement. Just to make it clear, the specific financial situation I am describing below is only tangentially related to mine, which is a great deal more complex (and I am still far from 60), but this much simplified hypothetical would help me to better understand my options. So hear me out.

Let’s say I have a hefty amount of savings in my 401(k), well over a million. I am planning to quit job for good once I have penalty-free access to it, so at the age of 59.5 to 60. Moreover, I am OK to deplete it relatively soon, since at the age of 67 I can apply for “regular” social security, at about the same time my mortgage will be paid off, and with some additional savings and investments I’ll get by. So ideally I’d withdraw $100-$120K per year, which would cover my everyday expenses and unless a significant crash will happen in this 7-year stretch, I’d still have some leftovers just in case. Better yet, at this income bracket federal taxes aren’t significant.

So far so good. Here is the problem: for about 5 years, till I am 65, I’ll still need some health insurance. Commercial insurance plans are expensive (also, my current plan gives me access to a very good hospital near by, and I’d like to keep it this way, so relatively cheaper plans won’t cut it for me). If I keep my income under 4x poverty line or so (currently \~ $50K), I’d qualify for ACA tax credit (both federal and state), which would be a significant saving.

So this is my dilemma. I need about $100K per year which I have, but I don’t want to withdraw more than $50K.

There could be many potential solutions to this conundrum, but unfortunately all of them are costly, erasing most of the expected gain. For example, I can withdraw $250K in the first year, pay health insurance out of pocket for one year, pay higher taxes, and then pay almost nothing in terms of taxes and insurance for the next 4 years. Or, I can take a loan (let’s say HELOC). Of course, the problem (in addition to interest) is that at the end of this 5 years I’ll have $250K in debt, extending interest payments much longer into the future. Finally, I can take a loan from 401k, it will only buy me $50K, solving my problem for 1 year, still better than nothing.

Really quick back-of-envelope computation shows that all of these solutions will *probably* save me some money at the end of the day, but not that much.

Thoughts? Am I missing something obvious? Can’t be that I am the first one trying to find the most optimal solution to this problem.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my Auto Loan?,"I got my first auto loan a year ago last week. This is my first and only line of credit.

As of my last payment I have 64% paid off of a 5 year loan with a 4.59% interest rate. There are no pre-payment penalties. Should I close this loan out as soon as I can financially or should I let it run it's course to let my credit history grow?

I am looking into credit cards right now so that way I will actually be doing myself some good. The soonest I can pay off my car would be Jan 2022. Once I pay this loan off I would have a nice amount of money to put into savings every month.

Is this loan actually doing me any good, credit-wise? Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,I need help getting to a comfortable spot again after quitting a job.,"So I’m a 25 year old male. Got a while I’ve worked at jimmy johns as a delivery driver during the weekday mornings while I pursued my music dream on the weekends. My music means everything to me. It’s my passion and it’s always been my dream to play in a band, release music, get signed to a label, and tour. Well I’ve accomplished some of that. We play shows a lot in Texas. No, we don’t get paid. Most of the time we don’t at least.. Covid had an impact on shows but they’re starting to happen again so we’re back at it. Anyways we play shows and release music and have a fan base, we sell merch, etc. We’re trying to be professional and make this a career. We haven’t gotten signed or toured but we’re hoping that’ll happen soon.

Well life started to get in the way as the need for more money arose. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend, so I have bills. Making around anywhere from 1.5k to 2k a month depending on whether or not I pulled doubles, I found myself scraping by with not a lot in my savings. And with a music festival coming up that has many of my dream bands on there, I needed to find a way to save money quickly after finally buying the 3 day passes for me and my girlfriend. I applied at Pizza Hut and started working at jimmy johns from 10-2 and Pizza Hut from 5-11. I was bringing in around 3k a month. I was financially happy and secure with my current lifestyle. And I was able to reach my goal of a thousand dollars for our trip to the fest coming up in late September.
 
My boss at jimmy johns however changed this. He’s not a good boss and he’s not a nice guy in general. He swears at customers and employees, yells at them too, insults customers with rude and snarky remarks, doesn’t ever really help out our already understaffed team, and is just a plain straight up jerk. We have situations where he’ll disappear for minutes on end, with only the two other guys in the shop making orders and me and two other drivers delivering others. Orders will be at around an hour late. Sometimes 2 if we get really slammed.

So anyways today me and another driver got back to the store at around 2 pm. Our shift ends at 2, however we can’t leave the store until our cleanings are done. So we take ourselves off the driver list and start cleaning, even though there’s still orders on the board. Our boss comes out and says we need to start taking more orders before we start cleaning and leave. The other driver says “but I have school in an hour” and I’m trying to go on break because I work all day Monday-Friday and the store is on the other side of town. 20-30 minute drive depending on traffic. He says “I don’t care” to bother of us and the driver again says he has school and the boss responds by yelling “I don’t fuckin care. I’ll fuckin fire all of y’all” before throwing a bottle at the wall and going to the back of the kitchen, swearing up a storm. I had enough of him and his shit so I said I quit. As I was cashing myself out, he said “where do you think you’re going?” I said home. He said “no you gotta take more orders and clean”. I shook my head, clocked out, and left.

I worked out a new thing with my boss where I’ll be replacing my hours at Jimmy johns with Pizza Hut, so I’ll be working there all day with a break between shifts. However I don’t know how profitable it’ll be in the morning. I don’t know if I’ll be able to hit that 3k a month mark again. So my question here is what can I do to reach that 3k a month again while having weekends off to pursue my music? What are some jobs I should look at? Just in general what can I do and what should I do? If you need anymore info that’ll help just ask and I’ll respond.",finance
personalfinance,Grad student eligibility for California Medicaid,"For graduate students pursuing a degree at a California school, does anyone have insights or personal experience being on California's Medicaid program? Specifically:

1. My understanding is that students are eligible if they make below 138% of the federal poverty level in a year. This equates to $17,609 for a single individual. I make more than that threshold this year since I worked a full-time job the first half of this year prior to being a student. 
2. What happens if you enroll in CA's Medicaid on Jan 1st but then you end up making just above $17,609 at the end of the year? (Summer internship money + part-time job during the academic year) 
3. I graduate in 2023 and presumably would make more than $17,609 over the course of the year since I'd be back on the job market mid-year. Anyone experience issues with getting off Medicaid and back on to student health insurance during the last year of their program?

CryptoCurrency,A good day for Crypto Europe - Tezos Selected To Enable Smart Contracts For Leading European Banks,"[Thumbnail](https://images.app.goo.gl/tqwryoXi6R9Bt9f8A)

Crypto Finance Group, InCore Bank, and Inacta have selected Tezos for the development of innovative, compliant, on-chain digital products for the financial market.

At the center of these products, a new Tezos-based token standard called ‘DAR-1’ has been developed for asset tokenization based on the Tezos FA2 standard.
Bank Smart Contracts
24 August 2021, Zurich, Switzerland — Crypto Finance Group, InCore Bank, and Inacta have selected Tezos for the development of innovative, compliant, on-chain digital products for the financial market.

At the center of these products a new Tezos-based token standard called DAR-1 has been developed for asset tokenization based on the Tezos FA2 standard.

Additionally, InCore Bank announced the launch of institutional-grade storage, staking, and trading services for Tez (XTZ), the native cryptocurrency of the Tezos blockchain.

The DAR-1 token standard on the Tezos blockchain enables smart contracts that provide all of the functions that are necessary to support financial markets in compliance with regulations.

For the tokenization of assets on Tezos for example, all limitations that are necessary to comply with regulations are registered and enforced on the blockchain through sets of smart contracts.

The DAR-1 token standard was developed by Inacta, digitization experts for technology and finance services.

The launch is enabled by Crypto Finance, a leading provider of institutional and professional investor products and services for digital assets, and InCore Bank, a business-to-business transaction bank.

”This work by Crypto Finance, InCore Bank, and Inacta is a tangible example of how FA2 on Tezos broadens the potential for tokenization significantly.

The launch of these Tezos use cases for the financial sector make innovative, compliant on-chain financial products a reality today.”

– Stijn Vander Straeten, CEO of Storage Infrastructure with the Crypto Finance Group.
Tezos was chosen to power the new token standard for asset tokenization, because its on-chain governance allows upgrades without disrupting or splitting up the network.

For tokenized assets that are registered on a blockchain, hard forks cause a serious risk. These assets are heavily regulated and these regulations also need to be enforced on their tokenized form.

A split chain caused by a hard fork, would mean that these tokens that are supposed to have fixed circulating supplies, would continue to exist on both chains and double in numbers.

Very uncomfortable choices would needed to be made by the issuers of these tokens with regulators watching their every move. Tezos fixes this. Read more about these issues and how Tezos fixes this here.

This is highly attractive to financial services providers, who will be able to implement applications seamlessly and offer staking and future innovations directly to their clients.

This collaboration of leading Swiss blockchain and financial players enables banking designed for the future, minimizing legacy issues that imply additional costs and compromises.

Opening the door for institutional customers: integrated staking services
Additionally, InCore Bank will be the first Swiss business-to-business bank to launch staking services for the Tezos network, unlocking new yield earning products for institutional customers.

Financial institutions benefiting from InCore Bank’s fully integrated services will be able to offer staking for their clients’ assets seamlessly and effortlessly.

Staking lets clients participate in the governance of the network and earn rewards generated by the network, similar to mining in the Bitcoin network. It can be initiated directly via e-banking, and clients receive regular statements of the staking rewards.

InCore Bank approached Crypto Finance to provide technology services for secure and compliant digital asset storage and to support the trading and staking of XTZ.

InCore Bank and Inacta are planning to launch a number of issuances on Tezos together with other participants in the ecosystem.

These launches establish the named partners as pioneers in the digital asset industry and open the door to innovative new financial market participants to leverage the attractive investment opportunities on the Tezos blockchain.

It was nice writing for noise. cash and read.cash, and I surely enjoy it, and I will not lie to you creating the token noise cash early adopters have open my eyes to truly sad reality, and for me, it is a truly sad reality, and the problem is that once you learn something it can't be unlearned, so you have no way but to live with that and move on.

As you may know already both my read cash and noise cash accounts have been flagged as a scam and it is a warning and the reason is very simple it is because I was promoting noise cash early adopters a token that is not officially from any of both websites. And the read cash administrator is right I could be in a lot of trouble for copying their name because I am an individual and I can be served an as such taken to court and I will be having issues also with the FCC and SEC, and who knows what other governments branches.

But the first reason why my token was a clear scam is that I was trying to use noise cash name with two more words and read cash administration just reach to me to Reddit saying in a case court I could lose very easily, and he is right I could because I live in the real world.

But the sad part is not that I could be in trouble the sad part is that Bitcoin Cash is doing the same that I was trying to do, which is to take Bitcoin's name. That is the sad truth that I can think of because, in reality, I hate the fact that with Bitcoin you must pay higher fees and that eventually, poor people won't be able to afford the fees, and yet we have a Bitcoin that works like Bitcoin is supposed to work but yet it is also a scam because a very simple fact it shares its name.

I am not attacking Bitcoin Cash, it just that I come to realize that what I was doing using the name noise cash is exactly the same that Bitcoin Cash is doing to Bitcoin, the only difference is that since Bitcoin is decentralized and its creator doesn't care you can create many copies of it and use its name of his creation.

If Satoshi Nakamoto was around he will be able to sue Bitcoin Cash supporters for using the name of his creation same thing that noise cash could do to me, because they are around.

Note I am not attacking Bitcoin Cash, I am just realizing that what I am doing is wrong, it is indeed a sad thing for me. I hope you don't hold it against me. And I wish I never created that token because that way I could be writing about Bitcoin Cash without a care in the world, but now I know I am writing about something that has taken another project's effort, and the only reason why it allows it is because Satoshi Nakamoto is not around.

And yet I hate Bitcoin because now you need $200 to use a lightning network and now even whole countries will use custodians as the way to go and call that shit Bitcoin.

You have created a ""Noise Cash Early Adopters"" token. I was not too happy, but I tolerated it. Then you started *selling* it.

1. By doing this you have created unregistered security (you are a central promoter, you solicit money from people - you pass the Howey test = illegal security), so SEC can enforce legal action against you (huge fines, **up to 5 years federal prison jail time**). If *we* don't distance ourselves from this *illegal security*, we might end up in the same jail cell as you, which we certainly don't want. That's why we're putting a big disclaimer on your token saying that it is in no way related to or endorsed by noise.cash.
2. Since October 2019 I have had 12-16 hour workdays 7 days per week devoted to read.cash and noise.cash. There are about 10 other people who also spent countless hours creating this. I spent upwards of $50k of my own money on read/noise. Marc de Mesel spent $1m of his money on noise.cash.

Then you come in and say ""Hey, I've spent 5 minutes creating a useless shit-token with 'noise.cash' in the name, I'm *entitled to use this name because of my reasons*!""

No, you aren't! We put in a ton of effort and money into this, you are trying to profit from it.

Needless to say, you are violating the trademark law too. No, when you add two words to the name, you still violate the trademark law. If we were to sue you, the judge will explain it in detail to you.

3) [by definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scam): ""A scam is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of something, especially money."". You *deceive* people by using ""noise.cash"" in the token name and you cheat them out of their money by *selling* it to them. People will automatically think that the ""Noise Cash Early Adopters"" token is something related to ""noise.cash"", which it isn't - that's a deception, so this is a scam.

4) The only thing that your token does is making you money. Again, a scam. Again, I was kind of indifferent to it until you started selling it.

What you do is *illegal* (both from a securities point of view and from the trademark law point of view, and yes, we own the noise.cash trademark, yes, we could sue you for this in nearly any jurisdiction) and you don't have any moral right to be outraged. You are wrong.

**I explained it all to you in private and asked you to stop it.** You told me you wouldn't stop. Since my warning wasn't effective, we've put the scammer label on you and a disclaimer to distance you.

If you are so sure that what you do is right, you should create ""Apple computers early adopters"" and ""Facebook early adopters"" coins and start marketing them on Apple forums and Facebook. Let me know how it goes (after they're done using you, of course).",cryptocurrency
Bitcoincash,So I created a token with the name noise cash now I am a scammer.,"I don't know what to tell you, maybe goodbye.

It was nice writing for noise. cash and read.cash, and I surely enjoy it, and I will not lie to you creating the token noise cash early adopters have open my eyes to truly sad reality, and for me, it is a truly sad reality, and the problem is that once you learn something it can't be unlearned, so you have no way but to live with that and move on.

As you may know already both my read cash and noise cash accounts have been flagged as a scam and it is a warning and the reason is very simple it is because I was promoting noise cash early adopters a token that is not officially from any of both websites. And the read cash administrator is right I could be in a lot of trouble for copying their name because I am an individual and I can be served an as such taken to court and I will be having issues also with the FCC and SEC, and who knows what other governments branches.

But the first reason why my token was a clear scam is that I was trying to use noise cash name with two more words and read cash administration just reach to me to Reddit saying in a case court I could lose very easily, and he is right I could because I live in the real world.

But the sad part is not that I could be in trouble the sad part is that Bitcoin Cash is doing the same that I was trying to do, which is to take Bitcoin's name. That is the sad truth that I can think of because, in reality, I hate the fact that with Bitcoin you must pay higher fees and that eventually, poor people won't be able to afford the fees, and yet we have a Bitcoin that works like Bitcoin is supposed to work but yet it is also a scam because a very simple fact it shares its name.

22. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

24. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event.

61. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
62. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

64. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment! [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577) [https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912)

68. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

74. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers. [https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513](https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513)

investing,Upstart ($UPST) DD - A Sleeping Future Giant,"### Executive degen TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.

### For visual learners:

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&amp;oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing &amp; lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales &amp; Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

&gt; Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

&gt; We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&amp;text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&amp;player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

###So let’s be honest with ourselves… Gambling is an essential part of our sports and entertainment culture. We had a War on Drugs in which the Drugs clearly won. And Sex work is literally referred to as the ‘oldest industry’. 
 
- Gambling - (US $44B - Global $516B)  Satoshi Nakamoto included the framework for an on-chain virtual poker game in the original 0.1.0 Bitcoin code (left unfinished). Was he experimenting with an early use case for Bitcoin? Tinkering with a complementary project? Who knows? Then, in March 2010, less than 18 months after the publication of the original whitepaper, the world’s first bitcoin poker tournament got underway, with BTC functioning as the unit of account. Back then, buy-ins were set at 50 BTC, with the winning player making out with a symbolic 1,000 BTC. If the winner had hodled his prize until the present day, he’d be sitting on a $50 million fortune right now. So with security, transparency, privacy and immutability, crypto has always been seen by both the gambling industry and the customers, as a natural fit.

- Drugs - Specifically the cannabis industry (US $21B- Globally $150B) has been classified as an “essential business” around the US (providing non-addictive medicinal relief to patients and steady employment for thousands of people). Despite this designation, the industry still does not have access to the federal banking system, forcing companies to conduct mostly cash-only transactions. With privacy, convenience, and obtuse federal laws, there is a strong use case for cryptocurrencies - although curiously not yet many clear links between the two industries. Maybe the cannabis industry, is hoping to avoid further controversy?

- Porn - (US $12B - Global $97B) OnlyFans with 130 million users, have been threatened by payment processors, Visa and Mastercard to withdraw from publishing ‘adult’ and ‘explicit’ material. However alongside the rest of the porn industry, who have been accepting crypto since 2017, this is just another opportunity for crypto merchant payment systems - if they so choose. Who pays for porn though? I don’t know, but maybe ask one of the webcam performers when you log in tonight?

CryptoCurrency,Exhaustive list of companies and individuals that hate crypto,"Thought I'd give my two satoshis on the vast number of companies and individuals that have changed their views on Bitcoin and crypto over the years. Or if they have not changed it, why that is.

The biggest “excuses” for their harsh stance on crypto are always illegal activities and illegal transfer of funds across borders.

Why do they have a problem with **illegal activities**? Bcs they don’t think anyone else should be doing it. From 2017 to 2020, criminal economic activities were overwhelmingly conducted by [traditional financial institutions](https://www.cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf). [Research](https://ciphertrace.com/2020-year-end-cryptocurrency-crime-and-anti-money-laundering-report/) shows that crypto is not the primary currency for illegal activities. FIAT is. Also, a major part of illegal activities were related to scams, not terrorism or drugs. Remember all those clickbait articles that say a major part of crypto is related to illegal activities? Well, turns out it was clickbait. It fell from a staggering 2,1% in 2019 to half of percent (rounded UP) in 2020. Source [here](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets).

What about **transfer of funds**? Again, this is their territory and they want to protect their business model. Financial institutions are responsible for laundering [$1.6 trillion EACH YEAR](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/financing/facti-interim-report.html). The entirety of crypto is worth slightly above $2 trillion (and we just entered this). They do $1.6 T EACH YEAR.

Out of top 10 banks in the world, four are Chinese (**ICBC, China Construction Bank Corp, Agricultural bank of China and Bank of China**). All of those had their own issues with crypto. It’s safe to say that the Party does not look favorably at anonymity or transparency. But why all the recent FUD from China (and their banks)? it’s because they have their own cryptocurrency out. China has been preparing the digital yuan for quite some time now and ICBC was the first to enable a feature that allows users to convert their digital yuan to cash on actual ATMs.

Out of the remaining big banks we have Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC Holdings PLC, BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Let’s take a look at each.

&amp;#x200B;

Jamie Dimon (CEO of JP **Morgan Chase**) famously called BTC a fraud. Also:

\&gt;It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.”

A few months later…

\&gt;I regret making comments saying Bitcoin is a fraud. The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that.

Why the sudden change of stance? Bcs of the fact that JP Morgan eventually unveiled access to several crypto funds.

Wait, I almost forgot. Shortly after that J.P. Morgan was reprimanded and fined $2 billion after skirting anti-money laundering rules. Since 2000, J.P. Morgan has paid over $29 billion in fines for offenses including toxic securities abuses, banking violations, anti-money laundering deficiencies, and market manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

**HSBC** – banned customers [from buying stocks in companies that own crypto](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/258971/20210411/hsbc-to-prohibit-customers-from-getting-stocks-from-companies-holding-bitcoins-as-of-latest-policy.htm), barred them [from depositing profits](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-holders-barred-from-depositing-profits-in-uk-banks-pgswbfrdz), etc. Well, they surely do it to protect their own customers from high risk plays. No, you guessed it, it’s bcs they want to impose high risk and illegal plays on their customers. Tax evasion, money laundering, cross border banking solicitation are their main business. Even [after paying record fines](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/), HSBC continued to provide banking services to criminals, Ponzi schemers, shell companies and drug traffickers.

**BNP Paribas** – they have blocked transfers to crypto exchanges and banned customers from their banks for “buying bitcoin”. Couple of people here on Reddit also made posts on that. What is their main business, you ask? It’s the usual: [money laundering](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20210521-bnp-paribas-charged-in-france-for-laundering-assets-linked-to-gabon-omar-bongo-atelier-74), [currency rigging](https://www.thetradenews.com/bnp-paribas-admits-fx-price-rigging-accepts-90-million-fine/), [criminal support of countries and entities engaged in acts of terrorism](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bnp-paribas-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-89-billion-illegally-processing-financial) etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bank of America** – their CEO famously said (in 2017)

\&gt;There ought to be a hard look at the policy of anonymous currencies, because the ability to track information of money flowing is one we use seriously against terrorism and as \[a tool\] against improper, illegal behavior.

Bank of America is one of the biggest fine collectors, with over $50 B in fines for breaking the rules and financial fraud. Also, surprise, surprise, [it's opened up a crypto fund to „selected clients“](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bofa-clients-crypto-exchange-traded-products-hedge-funds-report-2021-7).

&amp;#x200B;

**Wells Fargo** \- [Unfortunately, we don't allow crypto transactions](https://twitter.com/Ask_WellsFargo/status/1149728891059261441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149728891059261441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrivet.com%2Fwells-fargo-bans-customers-from-purchasing-cryptocurrency%2F), they said. Something about multiple risks associated with this volatile investment.

Surely a bank that takes such good care about their customers would not be… wait? Fined numerous times for [long standing practice of illegal practice against their own clients](https://news.bitcoin.com/wells-fargo/)? That’s impossible.

Oh, and yeah, [they launched a crypto fund. For the wealthy](https://www.coindesk.com/wells-fargo-nydig-passive-bitcoin-fund). And computer illiterate, I can only assume.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the big 10 banks, only for **Mitsubishi UFJ** could I not find any crypto hate (quick google fu, if anyone finds something, let me know and I’ll edit the post). They even launched [their own cryptocurrency](https://www.coindesk.com/japans-banking-giant-mufg-plans-to-launch-blockchain-payment-network-in-2021) and blockchain payment network, and have recently partnered with Coinbase.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, let's take a look at some of the ""smaller"" ones. And other types of financial institutions:

&amp;#x200B;

**GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC.**

Their chief investment strategist said:

\&gt;Something with a long-term volatility of 80% can’t be considered a medium of exchange. Just because everybody piles into an idea and talks it up doesn’t mean it’s a store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

And their COO said:

\&gt; The Bitcoin system today has no transparency to it. So there are a lot of people that question, why would you need a system that does not have an audit trail. \[It\] lacks some of the basic integrity of a real market.”

&amp;#x200B;

That was the talk before, you guessed it, they [unveiled a crypto trading team](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/goldman-sachs-unveils-new-cryptocurrency-trading-team-in-employee-memo.html) and said that crypto [should be a new asset class](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/podcasts/episodes/06-01-2021-crypto-a-new-asset-class.html).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Danske Bank** is another notoriously anti-bitcoin bank. At one point the bank released an open letter on its website, urging its customers to avoid cryptocurrencies due to their potential for criminal activity, even stating that they have an *obligation to assist in the fight against financial crime and money laundering.* Of course that Danske was involved in [laundering approximately $235 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history) through just one of its branches in Estonia over the course of eight years. Danske wasn’t working alone. In fact, because many of the transactions involved U.S. dollars, the scheme needed help from banks with access to the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire electronic settlement system. It is alleged that J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup’s Moscow branch had all sent or received funds tied to the scandal.

&amp;#x200B;

Torbjorn Magnusson of **Nordea bank** said:

\&gt;For Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be mainstream, they would have to be regulated, wouldn’t they? So that’s a step that is clearly missing.”

&amp;#x200B;

Jan 2018, Nordea bank get caught in money laundering scandal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Director of GLOBAL MACRO, **FIDELITY INVESTMENTS**

\&gt;Even the insiders in that industry don’t really know where it’s going and it’s going to take some time. And for the average investor, you know, buyer beware because you need to do your homework and it’s tough; there’s a very high learning curve to figure out exactly what this all means.”

&amp;#x200B;

What do I read from this? They appeal to their customer base, who is not well versed in using a keyboard and a mouse. That’s why they [offer those services themselves](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/fidelity-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-as-investment-giant-builds-its-digital-asset-business-.html) in the form of ETFs. You know, for the good of their clients.

&amp;#x200B;

April this year, **Peter Thiel** said:

\&gt;“I do wonder whether at this point, Bitcoin should also be thought \[of\] in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar. \[If\] China’s long Bitcoin, perhaps from a geopolitical perspective, the U.S. should be asking some tougher questions about exactly how that works.”

4 months later: [crypto broker platform backed by Thiel](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/peter-thiel-backed-crypto-broker-bitpanda-triples-valuation.html) receives further funding, valuated at $4 billion. Wait. What? I thought crypto was bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles Munger of **BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC**. said

\&gt;I never considered for one second having anything to do with it. I detested it the moment it was raised. It’s just disgusting. Bitcoin is noxious poison.”

&amp;#x200B;

Buffet is famously against BTC and crypto. But he doesn’t exactly hate money. Berkshire Hathaway invested in a [pro BTC digital bank](https://news.bitcoin.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-invests-bitcoin-friendly-nubank/)

&amp;#x200B;

Chairman of **SOCIETE GENERALE SA**

\&gt;We will discover that behind this Bitcoin scam, some funds were channeled maybe to finance terrorism and at that point, we will wake up and realize that this is not appropriate.

That’s… somewhat hypocritical, coming from the bank that paid several billions of dollar for **illegal** transactions to parties in countries subject to embargoes. Also, they launched their own [blockchain on Tezos](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-structured-product-public-blockchain)

&amp;#x200B;

And one of the most mentioned ones here on this sub, none other than **Blackrock**.

\&gt;Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming from the words of their CEO in October 2017 . SO how come you have [$400 mill in mining stocks](https://www.coindesk.com/blackrock-has-almost-400m-invested-in-bitcoin-mining-stocks-report)?

&amp;#x200B;

Gita Gopinath – **chief economist at IMF**, and a heavy shill for USD.

\&gt; *The more people use the BTC, the more useful it becomes to everyone else. This has been reinforced as emerging markets, which rely extensively on the BTC, increase their share of global economic activity*.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait, no, I made an error. She said those things about the $, not BTC. Her main point about the USD is basically the adoption. Can't see why the same cannot be applied to BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

One particular individual said the following:

\&gt; It’s a bubble. Currencies to be exchangeable have to be backed by something. I do not understand where the backing of Bitcoin is coming from. There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally accepteable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or the trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it’s a government or an individual.

His name is Alan Greenspan, and he is responsible for the worldwide economic crisis and subsequent collapse in 2008. It caused trillions in economic damage as well as countless lives ruined. Fuck that guy in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

What does all of this show us is that the agenda is there. Crypto is the solution to their decades of illegal and fraudulent practices. The jig is up. This is their swan songs. And it cannot stop sooner.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need to replace dryer and mattress - should I get two store cards at 0% interest?,"As the title states, I'm in a bit of a dilemma. On one hand, my 10-15 year old clothes dryer broke a while back, which obviously needs to be replaced.  At the same time, my mattress is showing significant signs of wear and will also need to go soon.  Replacing the dryer could cost me $1650 if I buy a replacement dryer only (Bosch 500), or I could replace both washer and dryer for $2,900 (Miele T1/W1).  Both prices include taxes and delivery costs.  My appliance store has a store card which gives free delivery ($100) and 0% rate for 6 months.

Replacing the mattress would cost be around $1-$3k (or more, haven't decided on the mattress yet) at Jordan's furniture. They have a store card which offers 0% interest rate for 72 months (!), making it very affordable.

Now, my question is: should I get both cards? I'm particularly worried about the impact it could have on my credit score (currently 790+, according to nerdwallet and my credit union).  Currently, I'm leasing my car (bad move, I know), but I plan on buying it once the lease is over in May/June, 2022.  I'm worried that getting two cards would impact my credit score and thus interest rates for my car payments next year.

Another option would be to pay for either the mattress or the washer/dryer using the store card, and the other item ""cash"" (pay with my current credit card, then pay it off at the due date), but I'd rather not do that, if possible.

A few points that may be worth mentioning: First, I have two credit cards with a max credit limit of $35k between the two of them. My total balance typically hovers around $2-3k (and yes, I pay in full every month), so credit utilization % is very low.  Second, for the 0%, 6 month card, I obviously plan on paying it in full by then.  Lastly, I have one recent hard pull for when I went to refinance my condo early this year, but I ended up not doing it.",finance
personalfinance,How do I count mortgage loan debt in case the interest has risen?,"First of all sorry for my english. Not my native language. Feel free to ask about words if I use wrong ones which is likely.

So I have a mortgage loan of 5 000 000 currency, I currently pay the bank 50 362 currency every month and the whole amount I'll have to pay back in a span of 10 years is 6 043 391 currency. If I go onto the bank's website and enter their calculator, it says that if the interest rises by 1%, the whole amount I'll have to pay back will be 6 118 075 currency, which is 74 684 currency more than the original amount. The interest rate is 3.89% btw.

How do they count this? How do they come to this new value?

I've tried:

6 043 391 * 1.01 = 6 103 825

6 043 391 * 1.01 * 1.0389 = 6 341 264

6 043 391 * 1.0389 = 6 278 479


I can't think of any way you could get that value from the original. Any answers are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Just found out I'm going to be a dad. Should I continue paying my monthly student loan installments and investing in retirement or save that money for the remainder of the pregnancy?,"My wife and I just found out we're going to be having our first child in March of next year. We're super excited but I'm a bit anxious money-wise. 

I've been paying off the highest interest student loan of mine ($5,800 currently at 6%) since the beginning of the pause of federal student loans last year. I haven't missed a payment yet ($475 per month) and in total have about $32,000 remaining in student loans (multiple installments at varying interest rates). I've also been putting about $300 per month into a Roth IRA Vanguard Retirement account (on top of my work pension). I'm wondering if I should start pushing that combined $775 per month for the next 5 months that loans are paused for into our joint savings account to counter her unpaid three months of maternity leave? This would be about $4,475 more in savings compared to the ~$7,500 in reduced household income we'll have over the course of those three months. 

**Important Information**
* At the time of birth we'll have about $23,000 in savings 
* At time of birth I'll be making about $3,100 per month
* Our mortgage, utilities, groceries (minus any baby stuff), and loans (2 cars and my student loans) will be about $3,250 per month.

personalfinance,"Pre-approved for mortgage, worried about car loan maturing and affecting my credit score thus messing with our rate. Also confused as to when the loan will mature.","Hello! My husband and I are in the process of buying our first home and are currently preapproved on a mortgage with a good (2.8%) rate. We both have great credit, but not a lot of credit. My lowest score of the big three is 792 and highest 813. I never have had student loans, I have one credit card (13k limit) paid off every month and one secured credit card (old, $600 limit), and my car loan is the only loan I’ve ever taken out. I’ve seen some posts on here (Reddit, not personalfinance specific) saying your credit score drops when your car loan matures. Additionally we experienced a bit of a drop in my husband’s credit his car loan was closed, however that loan didn’t officially mature as the car was totaled prior to the loan maturing but we walked away with some $ since we weren’t upside down on the loan, so I’m not sure if that is different. My fear is the loan maturing while we are still house hunting and thus affecting our rate negatively. I also am worried the loan will mature earlier than I thought, as I must have paid more than minimum at one point. Here is the status of the loan: 

Balance: $562
Next payment: $411 
Next payment date: 9/22/2021
Maturity date: 12/22/2021

So does this means the loan will actually mature on 10/22/2021 since I’m ahead on payments? And if so, should we make sure to purchase prior to then? Or because my credit score is high any drop from this car loan will not affect our interest rate? We originally weren’t planning to purchase until November or December. Thank you!",finance

CryptoCurrency,The Dawning of the Age of Utility : How the Blockchain is About to Disrupt the World,"*This is a two-part piece exploring the future of the utilization of blockchain technology, if you don’t like long reads and want to know what exciting blockchain utility projects to keep an eye on, please stay tuned for PT.II which will be released within the next week or two)*

***TLDR: We can predict mass adoption of the blockchain within the next decade.  It's already well underway.***

The blockchain is an often misunderstood, miscategorized and misrepresented technology.  Often this misrepresentation is completed deliberately in the media as a form of straw man arguments in order to discredit the blockchain as an umbrella term for cryptocurrency.  My parents still don’t understand what the blockchain is despite my best efforts to explain it to them.  They will likely die not fully grasping the concept.  To them, Bitcoin is the blockchain.  It represents a rupture in the core of their beliefs and everything they think they know. It stokes fear in their Forbes/Bloomberg reading hearts. It represents a pyramid scheme of epic, the greatest scam in the history of scams.  The blockchain to them is simply a wild west casino:  As Chuck Palahniuk once penned, “What we don’t understand we can make mean anything.”  This phrase has always stayed close to me.

We, the enlightened ones, know better.  We understand the full potential of the blockchain.  The ones who should be scared are not our boomer parents - it is the financial institutions: the lenders and bankers, it is the signing authorities (we’re coming for you, notaries!), the insurance companies, real estate brokers etc.  They are ones who should be shaking in their boots.  If they do not embrace the blockchain, they are primed to become a cassette deck in the world of digital media.  The clock is ticking. Tick, tick tick.

Up until recently, the primary utility of blockchain technology has been relegated to recording transactions of cryptocurrencies.  This is likely how you use the technology when you purchase your cockapoo coins or plutovault tokens.  The blockchain records the transaction of ownership and creates a record, or block, which contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transactional data.  This ensures that your cockapoo coin will forever (until you find a buyer) be yours.  You can pass that plutovault token to your kids as a generational reminder of your investing failures; so that they will not make the same mistake you did.  

Recently however, there has been a revolution in the utilization of blockchain technology. In the next decade we are primed to start seeing this technology break through the cryptocurrency barrier to be used widespread in any industry where there is a transaction of, or proof of ownership.  You should take notice, because predicting this shift will potentially be very profitable, and you won’t need a crystal ball to see why:  the more people understand the blockchain, the less scared they will be of it.  The less scared they are of it the more likely they are to trust it.  The more likely they are to trust it the more likely they are to put their money into it.  We are still at the beginning phases of this exciting new development - the blockchain, cryptocurrency, utility tokens - all still in their infancies.  This is still a new frontier, and there’s lots of high quality staking grounds to go around.

We need to recall that the blockchain was invented to solve a problem - to solve the double spending problem of a digital currency.  **It was invented to cut out the requirement of a trusted authority or central server.**  This is discussed in this The Economist [article](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2015/10/31/the-great-chain-of-being-sure-about-things) back on Halloween in the year 2015. Now, If we were to remove the paywall you would see that they use an example of a woman in Honduras who, despite having ownership records and deed of their property, was visited by police to be evicted from the home she had lived in for three decades.  How could this happen? Unfortunately this act of neo-colonialism by the state is common in certain parts of the world.  Paper deeds and titles can either be mismanaged, or worse; forged.  In this case, the woman's home was demolished - as requested by the person “registered” as the owner.  The woman, despite holding a copy of the deed, was left homeless. She could not prove to Government authorities or the court that the house was hers.  The trusted authority or central server, in this case the Government, completely failed her. At its core, the blockchain was invented to solve this problem. Had the title of property been stored in a secure blockchain database - this wouldn’t have happened. **It couldn’t have happened.** 

Blockchain technology is about to erupt and disrupt many different industries. If you’re still following, I’m going to take some time to dive into five of the more exciting use cases below and why they are important below.  If you’re fading - please keep an eye out for my next piece, to be released in the next week or two, which will detail a few of the exciting projects within these industries:

**I) SMART CONTRACTS**

We will start with Smart contracts since they are the the foundation of utility of the blockchain within most industries. They have been described as contract [vending machines](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), but really they are simply programs stored on a blockchain database that will run when a predetermined condition is met (ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts).  This technology will allow performance of credible transactions without third parties essentially making the requirement of a witnessing by a notary or lawyer, non existent. ***It removes the middle-man from the equation.***  This is a real, tangible solution that offers improved security, improved accuracy,  time savings, and financial benefits.  Smart contracts [**are**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverherzfeld/2016/02/22/smart-contracts-may-create-significant-innovative-disruption/?sh=67875b7c396a) going to disrupt the entire world, and in some ways they already are.  

Currently, one of the primary hurdles to smart contracts is that they are unregulated by many leading governments, but you can hedge your bets that this is going to change in the not so distant future.  We can be sure that some legal professionals will fight tooth and nail to combat this threat to their livelihood and stay relevant - but make no mistake **their time is running out.**

**II) INSURANCE**

Insurance is a multi-trillion dollar industry - and the blockchain is about to completely turn it on its heels. Underwriters everywhere are beginning to take notice. Deloitte, the largest multinational professional services network in the world - recently issued a [lovely infographic ](https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/financial-services/articles/blockchain-in-insurance.html)which clearly outlines why the industry and consumers alike should care.  This infographic concludes that ***the technology can fundamentally alter claims submission processes to reduce fraud and improve customer experience****.* If Deloitte is making this kind of statement, you can be rest assured that you should be taking notice too. 

What Deloitte understands is simple:  the blockchain looks to solve many of the fundamental problems in the industry, including but not limited to; inefficiency, fraud, human error and cyber threats.  The insurance industry loses approximately [$80 billion dollars](https://www.subex.com/blog/the-true-cost-of-insurance-fraud/#:~:text=The%20Coalition%20Against%20Insurance%20Fraud,fraud%20at%20USD%2080%20billion.) per year according to The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud.  That’s not including health insurance fraud. We’ve already  talked about how smart contracts essentially remove the middle-man requirement, and this will be true in the insurance industry -  but perhaps more importantly, smart contracts would be able to track insurance claims and then dissolve if false or fraudulent claims were made - transferring premium payments back from the individual to the insurance provider.  Pretty exciting stuff.

**III)  DIGITAL ASSETS/DIGITAL SECURITIES**

This is one that really excites me.  Have you ever wanted to own a digital representation of the Empire State Building?  In the not so distant future, this could easily become reality as a digital asset. The blockchain will also theoretically make it possible to own fractional shares of property or asset in the form of security tokens.

So what is the difference between a digital asset and digital security?  A digital asset is a digital representation of value of something that has value.  It is commonly regulated as currency (see BTC) or property (see NFTs).   Remember when our money used to be a representation of a store of value (gold) which we hoarded (and still do) at[ Fort Knox?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository), in theory, it’s kind of like that. Currently, the value of our currency is tied only to the demand for it.  The federal reserve keeps [**pumping**](https://brrr.money/) out cash in an attempt to manage inflation.  Having a store of value tied to a real asset is much safer in times of high inflation. 

A digital security on the other hand is a representation of an asset that happens to be a [security](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/8000-6200.html#:~:text=(1)%20The%20term%20%22security,certificate%20or%20subscription%2C%20transferable%20share%2C) or, something deposited or pledged as a guarantee of the fulfillment of an undertaking or the repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in case of default. For example, a tokenized share of a building - or a tokenized share of a company.  

The United States currently has strict laws that forbid digital securities, but this is very likely to [change](https://www.coindesk.com/new-crypto-bill-in-us-congress-is-the-most-comprehensive-yet) within the next couple of years. The ripple effect of defining and regulating digital securities will be massive because it will unlock equity and liquidity in financial markets that were previously locked in place.  If you are able to purchase fractional ownership of the Empire State Building in the form of a security token you will be entitled to the equity that is generated year after year as the value increases.  This is a big deal, and I personally believe this is the next big gold rush - so get ready, and keep your ears and eyes open for federal regulation.  


**IV) SUPPLY CHAIN**

The supply chain is [defined ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp#:~:text=A%20supply%20chain%20is%20a,product%20to%20the%20final%20buyer.&amp;text=The%20supply%20chain%20also%20represents,original%20state%20to%20the%20customer.)as a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer. Blockchain technology is a complete game changer in supply chain management because it effectively eliminates execution errors, mistakes in data processing, missing shipments, duplicate payments and also solves the problem of tracking complicated supply chain activities where orders are split up into separate shipments with multiple invoices etc.  Supply chain management is a nightmare.  It gives me anxiety.

Since the blockchain solves this issue of record keeping, it also reduces auditing processes and costs associated with audits.  The blockchain and supply chain management is a match made in heaven.  Many of the largest distributors are currently [experimenting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/biserdimitrov/2019/12/05/how-walmart-and-others-are-riding-a-blockchain-wave-to-supply-chain-paradise/?sh=2724e9297791) with this technology.  If the big guys are doing it, the rest of the industry is sure to follow.  

**V) VOTING/GOVERNMENT**

Imagine a time when voting fraud will be completely eliminated from the electoral process.  This is the future that is currently being envisioned by many governments and policy makers around the world.  The blockchain will make it [possible](https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-can-prevent-voter-fraud/).  The U.S. has had massive issues with voter fraud and challenges with collecting and counting votes - however since the blockchain creates a tamper proof electronic record, with extreme accuracy,  it only makes sense that governments start looking toward the blockchain to solve these issues.  It could also serve to alleviate voter suppression and provide more accessibility to people who are disabled, sick, or located overseas. The hesitancy is primarily based around the fear of a risk of hacking the results - which is completely valid, but also not without bias.  A phone with malware could potentially be tampered to cast a vote - which means the code will need to be extremely tight and secure.  Certainly very possible.  I’m excited to see how this technology develops.

To conclude, the future of the blockchain is bright - and we are well on our way to see mass adoption within the decade. The blockchain solves too many problems for most industries to ignore, and we are due for a gold rush as regulations evolve to keep up with the technology.  There are too many great projects to mention but I will try to outline a few that I find personally exciting in a follow up post within the next two weeks.  **Please feel free to drop some projects that relate to blockchain utility and mass adoption below and remember to always DYOR!**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Cash out refi to save for downpayment on next place?,"Several years ago I purchased a small duplex in a good neighborhood in CA. I live in one side and rent out the other. It's gone really well — I bought with an FHA and was able to refi into a conventional (no more PMI, yay!) earlier this Spring because of the amount it's gone up in value and my LTV ratio. If I were to leave and rent out my space, I would make at least money because of how hot the rental market is, how low my mortgage is now, and how little inventory exists in my region.

Since I'm now eligible for another FHA loan, I am looking to the next purchase: another owner-occupied duplex.

Since the market is so hot right now, does it make sense to do a cash out refi and sit on that cash until it cools a bit? I figured now might be the time to strike a cash out refi because my of how low interest rates are and how high my assessed value is.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I use most of my savings to buy a car, or would I just be making another bad decision?","Folks, I'm bad at personal finance and don't know what I'm doing. I could really use some advice. 

I'm 21 and make \~$1400 each month and live with my parents. Bills take up most of my income so I have no chance of moving out, which I would like to do soon, unless I get my finances sorted out. 

I have a car that I financed back when I knew even less than I do now about money at a 4.5% interest rate for 72 months. The payment for it and the insurance take up nearly half my monthly income. I've been thinking about selling my car as I've gotten offers on it right at the amount I owe for it. I'd still need a car, but I thought I'd just buy one outright using my savings which are at \~$12000. I don't want to use all my savings on buying a car because I need an emergency fund. I've been looking around for a 2008-2009 Subaru Outback but I can't find one for no less than 8k-10k. I've got my heart set on an Outback, so I'm not sure I'd want to spend money on a different vehicle. But should I just suck it up and look for something else? I really just want something with enough space to sleep and camp in as I plan on travelling in it for a while. I don't want to spend more than 10k, but I'm worried that I'd be making a bad financial decision spending even that. It would take me a while to build my savings back up to that. I want to have this used car for a while and it be something I actually like. Would it be worth it to buy a car outright to get me out of a tough situation with the one I have a loan on? 

Like I said earlier in the post, I live with my parents and my younger brother. My parents are not financially well off, and sometimes need my help with paying their bills, or I have to pay the full amount of bills we agreed to split. I love my family dearly, but living with them is not financially sustainable for me, it's one reason why I want to move out.

here are my bills:

car payment: $330

car insurance: $283 (my car's full coverage, my parents' 2 vehicles liability)

internet/cable: $185 (parents agreed to pay $100, I pay $85)

groceries: \~$200 (household food + my snacks at work)

gas: $80

subscriptions (netflix &amp; adobe): $48

phone: $30

total: $1,056

The food budget is an estimation and likely a bit more than that. This also doesn't include personal expenses. 

I'd love some advice or opinions on specifically the car situation, but any other advice is also welcome and appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Sheltering assets to qualify for tuition assistance (Jr Kindergarten, not college, so not FAFSA)","**TL;DR: Needed tuition assistance for Jr Kindergarten due to low income/high expenses, but application was rejected by 3rd party (FACTS) most likely due to a large amount of cash that we have saved up for a down payment. Follow-up meeting scheduled with the school, but advice needed on how to plan for that... can/should we shelter assets legally? Or should we just say we could have sheltered assets? Thanks!**

We were hoping to qualify for tuition assistance based on our income, based on some comments/guidance from the Director of Admissions, but our application was rejected. The likely reason is that we have a lot of cash, because we've been saving up for a down payment, and FACTS likely looked at all of that cash as eligible for paying the full tuition amount.

When I was in high school, I knew a guy whose parents paid cash for a sports car in order to qualify for (more) financial aid. I think at the time, the idea was that from FAFSA point of view, that cash would have counted against them, but the car was considered a personal possession, so wouldn't count against them.

Long story, but in my case, it has been a bit of a last minute thing to even apply to this school, so I didn't have time to plan everything out in order to shelter assets and qualify for more aid.

But would I have been able to do the same thing as my friend's family? So instead of, say, $100K cash that I was saving for a down payment, I could have gone out and bought a Porsche, and then qualified for aid?

That would have been kinda dumb, since I'd take a hit on depreciation. So what if I bought a piece of $100K artwork instead, with the idea of selling it back in a couple months? What if that ""artwork"" was just a smiley face on a Post-It Note that I ""bought"" from my parents for $100K? Would that still be legit? Or what if I just straight up gave my parents $100K, applied for aid, then they gave it back to me in a couple of months?

Where is the line there? I know that lying on the FAFSA is a felony, but is it illegal to shelter assets this way on FACTS, which is not a federal form? The kinda frustrating part is that I was 100% honest when filling out the FACTS application, and I think I remember seeing something that said that if any assets were found to be underreported etc. that the penalty would just be that any awarded aid would be rescinded and the family would be responsible for payment of the full tuition amount; not even threats of expulsion for the student or anything. And that penalty of being stuck paying the full tuition amount is basically where we are right now :/

The school says that FACTS provides them with a recommended aid amount, but that they will take into account subjective and objective data when making their decision. Just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to address the above in our meeting while asking them to review/reconsider. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Looking to build a house, but worried the one my wife and I love is too expensive for us. Do these numbers make sense?","Hey everyone, I appreciate any comments about my situation, I'll get right to it.

My wife and I have been in our current home (first house) for about 6 years. We currently owe about 200k on the loan and we expect it would sell for around 320k-330k in the current market (most of this has been the value going up, we bought it originally for 240k). So, after realtor fees and stuff, call it 100k we'd get to put down on another home if we sold. We want to upgrade and get the things we couldn't when we bought our current home, and there's a new neighborhood nearby that has a floorplan we really love. But, after base price + a few upgrades we expect the total cost to be 500k.

If we get \~100k from the sale of our current home, we could comfortably put another 50k down making the loan 350k at the end of the day. We have good credit, so I would think we could get a really solid interest rate, although I don't know what they are currently at, hoping 3% ish but I may be off on that. After taxes (estimates are 12-13k/yr) and insurance (estimated at 6k/yr) we're looking at around a 3k/month mortgage.

We both work in petrochemicals and bring home about $4500 each per month ($9000 total). That's after taxes, health insurance, and 401K contribution (we don't max it but we're putting in like 10-12% each plus a 6% company match).

We don't have any other debts. Both of our cars are paid off, no student loans left, we pay our credit cards off every month, etc... I know that with our current take home and no debts, 3k isn't that bad I don't think. I just worry that if one of us loses our job or something, 3k when you only take home 4500 is a lot more rough, right?

We also don't have kids yet but plan to in the next 2-3 years most likely.

CryptoCurrency,Don’t stop buying stocks to buy crypto. DIVERSIFY,"I keep reading these either/or type posts, and they are nonsense. Here are a few reasons why US stocks are still a valuable asset to have in your portfolio (notice how I didn’t use exclusive language):

1) the fed will backstop anything and everything. This isn’t going to stop in the near term 

2) equity multiples are still significantly more attractive than debt multiples 

3) there is zero legislation in place to prevent stock buybacks or other forms of financial engineering in place which will continue to inflate equity values 

4) **risk/reward!** Crypto has symmetric outcomes. You can definitely lose 70% in one month the same way you can gain 70%. That is not true of equities. Unless you are invested in a business that will die (blockbuster esque), the entity can eventually be sold for parts at a discount. That is not true of crypto and that’s one of many reasons why you don’t see huge drops in equities. 

5) crypto carries much more regulatory risk right this moment than equities do. There is a much larger share of Congress that understands the equity markets than those that understand crypto.  As long as they don’t get it, and aren’t reaping rewards, they will consider holding it hostage.  Furthermore, equities have obviously been around a lot longer and therefore the system is viewed by regulatory bodies as mostly fair while it’s somewhat unknown how crypto is viewed 

6) your risk of getting hacked is lower because institutions (brokerages) are [often] responsible if fraudulent activity occurs. There are enough horror stories on here to show that this isn’t the case for crypto.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**

Stocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, “We think the primary trend is higher. We’re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it’s peak growth, we still think it’s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they’re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.”

US Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.

Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.

**Highlights**

* Shares of “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) and others had a great day today, building on advances in recent sessions. 
* Shares of travel and leisure companies are rebounding following the FDA’s full approval of their coronavirus vaccine, which hopefully encourages more vaccinations and allows the country to reopen faster
* Shares of Airbnb (ABNB) gapped up more than 8% amid this broader rebound by travel and leisure stocks
* According to the Department of Commerce, sales of new homes unexpectedly rose in July, suggesting some firming up in housing market activity amid high prices and low inventory. New home sales increased 1.0% in July compared to June, bringing sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000. Consensus economists were looking for a rate of 697,000 homes. Sales in June were also upwardly revised to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 701,000, from the 676,000 previously reported. 
* Shares of Chinese companies rebounded somewhat following an intense sell-off amid regulatory pressure from the government. 
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) rose after the company announced it was restarting sales of its treadmill following a recall earlier in the year 
* Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) self-driving spin-off Waymo is starting testing in San Francisco with the aim to start a robotaxi service within the next 3 years.

**Background (major, recent news only)**

**Sportradar (SR)**

Sportradar was founded in 2001 as Market Monitor AS. In 2015, [Michael Jordan, Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis invested $44m into Swiss-owned Sportradar. ](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/michael-jordan-mark-cuban-betting-44-million-on-sportradars-data/) At the time, SRAD was relatively unknown but this investment was seen as forward-thinking as [PASPA was repealed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/05/14/supreme-court-sports-betting-paspa-law-new-jersey/440710002/) in May 2018. In July 2018, [CPPIB and TCV invested in SRAD at a valuation of $2.4bn](https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2018/sportradar-announces-cppib-and-tcv-new-strategic-partners). The following events then played out:

* In July 2020, it was [rumored SRAD was exploring plans to go public](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2020/sportradar-going-public-1234609311/)
* In March 2021, it was rumored SRAD was going to enter a deal with Todd Boehly’s HZON
* In April 2021, it was announced that [rival Genius Sports (GENI) had won the NFL data rights](https://www.sportico.com/leagues/football/2021/nfl-data-deal-1234626096/) for an alleged $120m per year in cash and stock
* In June 2021, SRAD reportedly pulled the proposed deal with HZON and went for a traditional IPO
* In August 2021, it was announced SRAD would go public on the NASDAQ via IPO with valuation unknown

**Underlying Numbers**

SRAD is a solid, already long profitable company easily passing the “[rule of 40](https://www.thesaascfo.com/rule-of-40-saas/)”    adding together profit margin (22%) and CAGR (25%). They are often    compared to competitor GENI, though there are other competitors (Kambi,  Scientific Games, Stats Perform, IMG to name but name but a few).

SRAD's estimated 2021 revenue of $645m more than double competitor GENI’s    $255m, the latter of which was achieved inclusive of very expensive, negative ROI, NFL rights [costing over $120m (cash and stock).](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31180158/genius-sports-tapped-nfl-exclusive-distributor-data-sportsbooks)  When looking at 2020’s revenue numbers of $489m (SRAD) and $150m (GENI), this is a fairer representation of the difference in scale. When compared with DKNG, SRAD’s revenue is just 50% of DKNG’s $1.25bn but the latter will lose $1bn in 2021.

SRAD’s  numbers tell a story of stability but an increasing profitability    trend, but is it explosive enough? The 2019 vs 2020 small revenue increase could be a concern, though no doubt related to Covid-19 and is offset by the impressive YoY EBITDA gain. The huge increase in 2021 is an encouraging sign for the path to $1bn+ with banked profits.

I am struggling to see any issues with SRAD’s financials but I will update this section if I receive it in the comments. The only question is whether $645m in revenue at a CAGR of 25% with $140m in EBITDA    warrants the valuation of the often quoted $10bn. The rest is solid and  this was the consensus from the public even with HZON looking to invest in SRAD.

**CEO, Board &amp; Share Structure**

* Carsten Koerl – CEO – [founded bwin](https://www.businesscase.at/beispielcase1) and sold it to fund Sportradar

From the filing:

***“Carsten Koerl*** *has served as our Founder and Chief Executive Officer since our founding   in  2001. Mr. Koerl also serves as Group Chief Executive Officer of   Sports  Statistics and Information Systems Ltd, a subsidiary of   Sportradar.

He holds a Master of   Electronic and  Microprocessor Engineering degree from the University   for Applied  Sciences in Konstanz. We believe Mr. Koerl’s experience and   insight, as  well as his deep knowledge of Sportradar, gained through   service as our  Chief Executive Officer, make him well qualified to   serve as a member of  our board of directors.”*

Others:

* Michael Jordan – Investor, Board (less than 5% majority interest)
* Mark Cuban – Investor (less than 5% majority interest)
* Ted Leonsis – Investor, Board – CEO of Monumental Sports (less than 5% majority interest)

* Deirdre Bigley – Board – Ex-CMO of Bloomberg
* Mark Walder – Board – CEO of Ringier, a billion dollar media company

Well you can't say there's a lack of experience..

**Sports Rights**

Rights are bought to be sold to sportsbooks for revenue. No matter how many    “deals” or so called “moats” a company owns, it is irrelevant if no revenue – or more specifically – no net income is generated.

We  know SRAD own NBA, NHL, MLB. But are these rights even profitable for SRAD? One statistic I found was “Sportradar achieved 62% MLB media revenue CAGR from 2015 to 2019.”

We    know GENI own the NFL rights, but having only increased guidance from $190m to $255m including NFL rights monetization and their   acquisitions,  we know they will make a loss on such rights. Before this deal, their  revenue was “only” $190m for 2021, less than a third of SRAD’s. So who  cares?

My approach  will be to  ignore all press releases and mention of rights unless   there is specific  information about their monetization. Instead, I will   focus on revenue,  EBITDA, margin and net profit/loss. If you are interested in a list  from the filing:

“*Sportradar leads on breadth of events coverage for sports data and odds. We  offer   the largest volume of data in the world across our peers,  leveraging   nearly 20 years of historical sports information. We  collect over 1.2   billion live data points per year from over 600,000  events in 37 sports.   In 2020, we generated 3.7 billion live and  pre-match odds changes   collected 1.9 billion betting tickets and  processed 21 billion odds   changes from betting operators. We have a  strong betting data rights   portfolio, including non-exclusive rights  to the National Basketball   Association (NBA) and the Major League  Baseball (MLB) in the United   States, as well as exclusive rights on a  global basis to the NBA   (excluding the United States and China) and  MLB (excluding the United   States). In addition, we hold exclusive and  worldwide media data rights   for the NBA and MLB (including in the  United States). We also have   exclusive and worldwide betting data  rights to the International Tennis   Federation (ITF), Tennis Australia  (TA) and Formula 1 and non-exclusive   rights to the Deutsche Fußball  Liga (DFL) in most jurisdictions. Tier 1   sports, particularly in the  United States, tend to have official   partnerships with sports data  providers to create new revenue streams.   Official sports rights  partners have advantages in terms of renewals   because of tech  integrations. We are highly diversified across tiers of   customers and  tiers of sports content. We are not dependent on any   single sport data  right.*

*In  addition to sports data, we provide our customers with the largest    sports audiovisual content offering including 200,000 events per year    across tier 1 and other-tier sports leagues. Sportradar provides global    coverage, with strong U.S. market positioning, including rights for    major U.S. sports leagues. Our current portfolio of audiovisual rights    includes MLB, NBA, DFL, Copa del Rey, Asian Football Confederation    (AFC), TA, ITF, Badminton Europe and the Professional Darts Corporation    (PDC).”*

**Clients**

As above, we should only consider the underlying hidden numbers of such deals. Therefore, I will only mention paying clients.

From the filing:

*“We have a large, blue-chip customer base, which consists of 1,612    customers as of December 31, 2020 and partners across more than 120    countries globally, including more than 900 sports betting operator    customers and over 350 media and digital platforms. Our customers    include many of the largest U.S. and global sports betting operators    such as Bet365, Caesars, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, Flutter and    William Hill; leading internet and digital companies such as Apple,    Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo Sports; broadcasters and other media    companies such as CBS Sports, ESPN, Fox Sports and NBC Sports; and    league partners such as the NBA and ITF. We have also built a global,    market-leading portfolio of over 150 league, clubs and federations    relationships across 29 sports.”*

**Strategy**

Quotes from the filing:

***“Our Growth Strategy***

*Our vision is to entertain sports fans and bettors globally through    engagement across media, betting, gaming and beyond. We have continually    broadened our product portfolio to better serve our customers and    increase our touchpoints with end users across the sports betting value chain. The more knowledge of the end user that we are able to collect,    the more valuable our insights and platform services become to  leagues,   sports betting companies and media companies. These network  effects  also  enable us to enhance our product portfolio, serving as a  key  element of  our growth strategy.”*

*“We are part of a founder-led organization with a strategy that is focused on innovation and long-term value creation.”*

*“Our product strategy is centered on speed, reliability and scalability to    match the demands of our customers. We use advanced algorithms to   create  scalable, customized insights in real-time with latency   averaging 700  milliseconds (“ms”). We have one of the industry’s   leading cloud native  storage and distribution platforms. We leverage AI   and machine learning  capabilities, based on our rich data lake, to   provide the most accurate  odds. We are innovators at the forefront of revolutionary new  technologies in sports data and analytics including   computer vision,  data visualization, virtual gaming and simulated   reality*.”

Sportradar also believes in a profitable open source strategy but paying when the numbers make sense. A clue to this was [given in a leaked NFL letter](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/):

*(A  single data provider is): “not only harmful to data supply companies like Sportradar, but also to the downstream market (bookmakers and  their   customers) where product choice is being restricted or removed  in  favour of an information monopoly.”* [*https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/*](https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/)

For now, the revenue for SRAD suggests a multi-layered strategy is best rather than monopolistic deals.

**Risks**

A fairly generic set of risks is mentioned in the filing, but there were some business specific ones mentioned:

* Business Model Risks - *We depend on the success of our strategic relationships with our sports league partners.*
* *Social responsibility concerns and public opinion regarding responsible gambling, gambling by minors, match-fixing and related matters could    cause the popularity of sports betting to decline*
* *We are subject to reputational risks related to betting-related match fixing, doping, and other sports integrity threats.*

**Conclusion**

The  evidence points towards SRAD dominating the space over the next few    years. They have competition but contrary to surface level statements,  their underlying numbers are impressive and a good foundation for even more growth.

But what I have not answered is whether SRAD is a buy at $7,8,9, or even 10bn. The upside is too big to ignore and we can’t be missing out on another DraftKings (5bn → 20bn).

CryptoCurrency,My crypto thoughts and experiences,"I got into crypto for the money, and started to fall in love with the tech. I can follow a lot of what I read, but at some point I'm lost and start googling terms and going down a rabbit hole of knowledge. I'd consider myself a noob from the point of understanding the tech. I teach elementary school FFS. I can't program, don't know a lot, but do like to learn. I wish I wasn't so damn old. I bought a little crypto in 2017, and that became a ton of shitcoins. I paid off my car and house, roofed my garage, and now am buying a 67 Mustang while still HODLing a few year's salary of coin on my trezor. I'm rambling, I know - did I tell you this before? I plan to enjoy some of my crypto, and when I have to take withdrawals from my retirement fund it will go right into crypto. Thank goodness my child is into crypto and is great with money.

personalfinance,Laurel Road Student Loan Interest Rate Discount (Can you help me wrap my head around this simple math?),"I just refinanced my SO's private student loans with Laurel Road, for a 3.3% interest rate. Laurel Road offers an additional perk whereby if you open a ""Laurel Road Linked Savings Account"" you can yield additional interest rate discounts on your loan based on the average daily balance in the account each billing cycle. The table is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Savings Account Balance**|**Loan Interest Rate Discount**|**Resulting Interest Rate**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$1,000 - $4,999.99|0.15%|3.15%|
|$5,000 - $9,999.99|0.25%|3.05%|
|$10,000 - $14,999.99|0.35%|2.95%|
|$15,000 - 19,999.99|0.45%|2.85%|
|$20,000+|0.55%|2.75%|

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given the usual modern FIRE- or Boglehead-esque line of thinking, I know none of these interest rate discounts provide any sort of ROI close to what could reasonably be expected for investing that extra cash in a market index over long periods of time, etc. etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, like good PF Flow Chart students, we like to keep a solid cash emergency fund, and have been keeping it somewhat on the fatter side as of late. Point being, it's pretty highly likely for us that we'd prefer to keep at least $20,000 in cash as an emergency fund at any given time, and so it would absolutely make sense for us to park it here to reap the benefit of that discounted interest rate (sidenote, having started this private student loan refi journey two years ago with 9% and 11% loans, the thought of 3.3%– let alone as little as 2.75%– feels unbelievably great).

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, **I'm trying to wrap my head around where the breaking point would be when it becomes worth it to keep the emergency cash in some other account instead (i.e. HYSA).** Is considering / comparing the return here as simple as comparing the discount in column two versus the APY of a HYSA? It's a far cry from the glory days of 2019 when HYSA's were at like 2% APY, and right now the average seems to be around 0.50% or so. The simple-minded part of my brain wants to say something like, ""the $20,000 cash in this Laurel Road savings account provides a 0.55% discount on my loan, which is equal to putting the $20,000 into a HYSA returning 0.55% APY, and any return from an HYSA that is above 0.55% is technically yielding more that keeping it here,"" but I definitely think it's more complicated than that. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Also - the student loan balance is around $150,000. Another thought path is telling me to calculate the ""interest rate discount"" here based on the balance of the loan into a monthly discount dollar amount, then compare that dollar amount to the dollar amount of what $20,000 would generate in interest per month given a HYSA APY of *x*.

&amp;#x200B;

Above all else, the initial 0.15% discount in exchange for parking $1,000 into the account seems like a no-brainer. But thinking about comparison points and ""opportunity cost"" of leaving larger sums of emergency cash there versus somewhere else starts to confuse me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of brain-farting here, and any help thinking this one out would be appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Analysis of DEX Inflation Via Yield Farming Vs. Token Price,"# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

* Algo Supply
* Scheduled Supply
* Governed Supply

&amp;#x200B;

 

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Are we ready to buy a house?,"Hi,

My fiance and I have no financially responsible parents to guide us on the responsible rent vs buy decision - we've done a good amount of internet research but it seems that there is a lot of mixed information out there when it comes down the rent vs buy situation. Add-on to that is a number of my home-owning co-workers who tell me that I am absolutely throwing money away by continuing to rent in our current situation.

Here is our situation:

My partner and I make a combined income of \~315k. She has been in her current job for 2 years. I've been in my current job for 5 years. Neither of us plan on making any major career changes that would necessitate moving anytime soon. We don't have any children and don't plan on any in the foreseeable future (likely never but its still not yet decided).

We have a total of about 40k in savings, though we are hoping to use that to exercise stock options that fiance is currently being offered.

We currently live in the Bay Area so the housing market here is a bit of a mess. We are currently renting 2900/month. She has about 30k in student loan debt through private loans that she pays 600/month (can't recall what the interest rate was but I am fairly sure its close to 4%?). I have \~180k in student loan debt that is through a government backed loan that is currently on an income driven repayment plan. The payments are currently in automatic forbearance due to covid, but will likely resume in January for \~700/month on an income-driven plan. The 180k will be forgiven after about 5 more years of payments due to PSLF. \~500/month car payment for the one car we use between us.

So monthly expenses:

\~3200/month for rent/utilities

100/month for phone plans

500/month for car

1300/month student loan payments

500/month food

Overall, after taxes and 401k/457(b), etc - take home pay is \~13,000/month combined.

Both of us have credit scores in the high 700s.

We both operated under the assumption that we realistically needed to save up for 20% down payment before even considering buying a home, which puts us a number of years out. But I'm reading that we can potentially buy a home right now with a much lower down payment if we are willing to deal with PMI. If we bought now we would ideally like to aim for a place in the 800k/1 million range which seems about average for the Bay Area in the location that would be central to both of our employers. Not sure if that is a realistic range.

Are my co-workers right? Are we throwing money away on rent? Or do we need to get into a home while interest rates are very low.",finance
personalfinance,Almost done with debt. What's next?,"My wife and I are almost done paying off $71k in debt since November 2020. We are starting to look at the future of how we can get our money work for us. 

We make a combined $158k gross income per year. We just refinanced our mortgage so that is lowered, only have 1 car which is paid off and will need to buy another car in the next 8 months or so.

My main question: is it better to either buy a cheap car in cash or manage a car payment and invest more up front?

We have very good credit scores so could likely get a low interest rate and I see a lot on social media that ETFs average 8% return per year. At the beginning of 2022 we plan to both be investing 10% of our income to our 401k.

personalfinance,Getting our finances together after a lifetime of coasting.,"Sorry in advance if this is all really disorganized. I’ve never really made the time/effort to learn about managing finances or evaluate my financial position. I’ve always kind of lived under the assumption of “eh, I make enough money. I’ll be fine”. I want to change that, largely for my family and their future.


I’m 42, married, one kid (born in 2020). My wife is a stay at home mom. I make $140k a year ($7.7k after taxes a month). Bills (including mortgage, car loan, credit payment, utilities) are $4k a month. The rest we generally spend on entertainment or luxuries - hobbies, eating out, more recently baby stuff. We don’t put anything from monthly pay into savings. I do want to change that and see if we can start getting $1k in a month without feeling it too much. I get a bonus every year (was $15k to $20k after taxes, but I changed jobs and now it’s going to be more like $7k to $10k) and we usually get between $7k and $10k from income tax refund which all goes into savings and then gets whittled down throughout the year for vacations, big purchases, home repairs, etc. This year, because of our son, we’re getting a $22k income tax refund (still waiting on it - only filed a month ago with an extension). 


We have a house with a mortgage. The house would currently sell for around $430k and we owe $187k on the mortgage (5% interest rate). I have $80k in vested stock shares (most RSU and some ESPP)  from a former company I worked at. I have $120k in a 401k. I don’t know too much about 401ks. I basically pick the mutual fund recommended for my retirement year and go with that. I’m going to research more as well as see if I can increase my contribution to max, decreasing my monthly take-home pay.


I have $8k in credit card debt (20.99% APR - ugh) and $11k left on a car loan from a new 2018 car (3.9% APR).


My goals are (in timeline order) 1) to upgrade my car to a minivan for family adventures (looking at around $35k) 2) sell my house in the next 2 or 3 years (before our son starts school) and move to a bigger house in a lower cost of living area (I’m a fully remote worker now), 3) save for our son’s education, 4) hopefully retire some day. All this and keep our current standard of living (upper middle class) throughout.  


A couple other things - My dad is in very poor health and probably won’t be around more than 2 or 3 years. I am his sole heir and will inherit his house (fully owned, will sell for around $500k in the current market) as well as his savings (currently about $250k but who knows where it will be). My wife is also the sole heir and both her parents own their homes (worth about $250k each), but inheriting those is probably a decade down the line or more. Just adding that because those are things we can count on in the future, but of course it’s impossible to tell what the housing market will be at those times. It still should be helpful to us, even if there is a decrease in value. I guess I should also say none of them have any major debts.

 

I’m just kind of looking for advice on how you experts would handle this situation. Would you move anything around for efficiency or in order to pay off the high APR debts? Should I do anything with my stock? Any thoughts on best course of action to meet my goals? Should I talk to a professional financial advisor?


Really appreciate any advice and am going to make this all a priority to learn more about at this unfortunately later stage of my life. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Regret: 15-Year Fixed Mortgage during Periods of Low Interest Rates,"**Please see my dialogue with** u/HordesOfKailas **below for revised information.  I have edited my post so as not to spread false information.  I**n summary, interest is based solely on the outstanding balance of the loan and life of the loan only changes interest payments month over month due to the rate/speed at which you are paying down the principal.  Thank you for the explanation and guidance!  Great community!

I bought a house in Southern California in February of 2020.  Interest rates were at a historic low and because I'm fortunate enough to have a decent job, I opted for a 15-year fixed interest mortgage over a slightly higher interest 30-year fixed without much consideration.  Now that I'm two years into the life of my loan, I am having serious regrets.

If I refinance into a 30-year fixed, I'll have paid a ton of interest on the 15-year fixed for nothing.  I am now helping to pay for my brother's medical school and I really wish I had given my house financial planning a little more consideration.  Hopefully some of you who are looking into buying your first house learn from my mistake!  With an interest rate between 2-3%, you may as well just take the longest loan possible.  It's free money at that point that you can invest, use to pay down high interest debt, or fund other ventures that could lead to new income streams.

If anyone has any advice for me in the situation I'm currently in, I would really appreciate it.  ~~Is there any way to pivot into a 30-year fixed without losing the crazy interest I paid at the start of my 15-year fixed?~~  Thanks in advance!",finance
Economics,UPDATE 1-Goldman Sachs raises odds on U.S. Fed taper announcement in Nov,,finance
CryptoCurrency,Unpopular/Popular Opinion: Crypto causes less harm than Governments (or Coins don’t kill people - Governments do!),"Cryptocurrency is often framed as nothing more than a means of financing terrorism, facilitating money laundering, and supporting criminal traffickers with murderous intent, that threatens the national security interests.

Meanwhile, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan have cost taxpayers $6.4 trillion since they began in 2001 and an estimated 800,000 people have died as a direct result of fighting. (Edit- Governance, if accountable, open and directly democratic, can also do many positive things to serve the interests of the public).

This hypocrisy being said, governments are not ‘inherently’ evil, but the nature of centralized institutions, means power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

###Cryptocurrency is BY DESIGN decentralized, accountable, open and directly democratic so can make the world a better place as it proving to do so, as it continues to positively impact our financial lives. 

###1. Reduce the risk of fraud
- Because at point of payment, it is not directly associated with your bank account or cash funds and is transferred electronically and securely with the blockchain recording all transactions, cryptocurrency is in fact LESS likely to be subject to fraud. 

###2. Increase crowdfunding
- Investors can make small investments instead of a few investors making large investments. Therefore, this mitigates risk. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are centered around cryptocurrency which is used as the source of capital for a startup company’s venture.

###3. Change the money transfer process
- The transfer of cryptocurrency doesn’t require all of the same checks and balances processes that banks do before funds can be deposited. Whether a national or international transfer, cryptocurrency transfers are instant, and can be tracked and securely stored in the blockchain.

###4. A distributed, digital democracy.
- Armed with the power of distributed communication technologies and governed by consensus on a blockchain, our progenies could immediately represent themselves with their own voices in the purest figure of democracy ever attained. 

###5. Encourage scientific advancements
- Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can help change the scientific roadblocks we face by providing everyone access to real-time data and eliminating the major institutions, foundations, and corporations sitting on important information.

###6. Keep companies and individuals accountable
- Blockchain technology, is immutable and transparent which helps keep companies and individuals accountable. Also, consumers will potentially know more about the companies that sell to them.  

###7. Make foreign money transfers and transactions safer
- When travelling to other countries carrying cash and money cards can be downright dangerous. Not only does the use of cryptocurrency reduce the danger of carrying cash, it also eliminates any exchange fees or transaction fees.

###8. Offer a stable alternative to unstable currencies
- Cryptocurrency is accepted worldwide and not subject to exchange and interest rates. It would also provide more stability and certainty to those living in economically volatile countries.

###9. Give people control of their own money
- Cryptocurrency allows the control of money to be transferred from the banks, charging fees and penalties, and back into the hands of the people. Anytime that more people can get control over their own money, it’s a good thing.

###10. Improve lives of financially excluded
- It may radically improve the lives of marginalised people across the world. Offering the less financially literate a chance to access services and opportunities, which until this point in time has been mostly denied them.

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. ADA is officially on Bitpoint Exchange in Japan! [https://twitter.com/SebastienGllmt/status/1430317131699163140](https://twitter.com/SebastienGllmt/status/1430317131699163140)
2. Charles gave us a brief update on Aug 24.  Sounds like everything is right on schedule for smart contract launch on September 12. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1430230604071636994](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1430230604071636994)
3. Messari is reporting that Cardano moved more transaction volume over the last 24 hours than ETH. The amazing part was how much cheaper those transactions were on Cardano. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1430128107332280321](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1430128107332280321)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Coindesk really hates us. Now they are writing articles about Cardano and using words like “crypto-colonialism”. [https://www.coindesk.com/the-headache-of-crypto-colonialism](https://www.coindesk.com/the-headache-of-crypto-colonialism)
2. Liqwid says it is on target to be live on day 1 after the Alonzo hardfork combinator event. [https://twitter.com/liqwidfinance/status/1416363542975074305](https://twitter.com/liqwidfinance/status/1416363542975074305)
3. According to maximalists you’re apparently not allowed to be busy with your company authoring papers if you’re in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1415761569082789890](https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1415761569082789890)
4. The IOHK mid-month development update for July is out and available for viewing. [https://youtu.be/U9K-8jILGcg](https://youtu.be/U9K-8jILGcg)
5. Apparently “unsigned Phalices” are a thing in the Cardano ecosystem now. [https://twitter.com/unsigned\_algo/status/1416909454100992000](https://twitter.com/unsigned_algo/status/1416909454100992000)
6. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!! [https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el\_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm](https://elfaro.net/en/202107/el_salvador/25611/Bukele-Plans-to-Launch-a-National-Cryptocurrency-This-Year.htm)
7. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators in the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets that they must move quickly to regulate stablecoins. So, a Salvadorean market for stablecoins might be good for Cardano. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/yellen-says-us-must-move-quickly-establish-stablecoin-rule-framework-2021-07-19/)
8. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
9. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
10. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)
11. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities. This should be scary news for any Cardano projects that are aimed at exactly that! [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-aba-derivatives-futures-law-committee-virtual-mid-year-program-072121](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-aba-derivatives-futures-law-committee-virtual-mid-year-program-072121)
12. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream. [https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135)
13. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/)
14. IOHK has released its Conclave paper on collective stakepools. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/742.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/742.pdf)
15. Here’s the IOHK Development Update for July 23! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1418635822987943939](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1418635822987943939)
16. Cardano received some coverage in the Motley Fool as an eco-friendly crypto! [https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/4-eco-friendly-cryptos-you-should-know-about/](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/4-eco-friendly-cryptos-you-should-know-about/)
17. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)
18. Check out this new video of the World Mobile Team on the ground in Zanzibar. Doesn’t this feel like a better mission for our ecosystem than DeFi? [https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1419051567878221828](https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1419051567878221828)
19. Reports are coming in that Amazon plans to integrate Bitcoin, Cardano, ETH, &amp; BCH in the very near future. This has apparently been a work in progress for several years. [https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/](https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/)

23. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp)
24. Nami Wallet now allows you to mint NFTs for no extra fees (only Cardano network fees) inside the wallet. [https://twitter.com/NamiWallet/status/1420031000017608717](https://twitter.com/NamiWallet/status/1420031000017608717)
25. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)
26. Stephen Wolfram does the first NFT liveminting event where he creates NFTs of cellular automata from the computational universe while live on stream. The first two created were “Crashing Waves” and “Down Arrows”. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1420087229104283656](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1420087229104283656)

28. Project Catalyst now has 30k members! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1420474342253678599](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1420474342253678599)
29. Emurgo has released an article about what we can expect from the Yoroi dApp Connector. [https://emurgo.io/blog/emurgo-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-yoroi-dapp-connector](https://emurgo.io/blog/emurgo-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-yoroi-dapp-connector)
30. Reports are coming in that the new bipartisan Infrastructure Bill contains new provisions that might require a whole host of actors within crypto ecosystems like Cardano to report transactions over $10k. [https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-tax](https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes) [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853)
31. But this bill is an even bigger deal. If passed as-is, we can probably say RIP to the Wild West Era of crypto (2009-2021). [https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307)

35. The differences between the currently dominant smart contract blockchain and Cardano’s upcoming smart contract architecture keep getting highlighted by dramatic failures of the former. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1421064543900418048](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1421064543900418048)

37. In case you missed the July Cardano 360 and don’t have a lot of time. Here is the always great Cardano 360 Mini! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1421803459997835266](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1421803459997835266)
38. Reports are coming in that we’ve got final language from the crypto tax reporting piece of the Infrastructure Bill. It’s better but not great or even good. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1422002228102107142](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1422002228102107142)
39. The Charles AMAs returned on August 1 after a brief break. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKY6VwVq02s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKY6VwVq02s)
40. A quarter million votes were cast in Catalyst Fund 5 voting! Apparently, this is over 10x what we saw in Fund 2. [https://twitter.com/danny\_cryptofay/status/1422253955816505345](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1422253955816505345)
41. Here’s a very good read on one vision for prosperity via CBDC and how such a currency should interact with existing blockchains like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1422270993498705921](https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1422270993498705921)
42. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan! [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)
43. Senators Wyden and Toomey are trying to fix the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill! [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite)
44. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

46. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano. [https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator](https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator)
47. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
48. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system. [https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867](https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867)
49. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
50. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment! [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577) [https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912)

52. It turns out that Janet Yellen lobbied lawmakers on Thursday against the Wyden-Toomey-Lummis Amendment according to the Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/)

54. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)
55. Both Gene Simmons and Ted Cruz came out in support of the competing Wyden-Lummis-Toomey Amendment to the Infrastructure Bill. Gene Simmons has previously revealed his Cardano purchases.

56. After the Senate called it a day on the Infrastructure Bill Amendment debate, it sounded like there might have been some dealmaking going on among Wyden, Portman, Warner, and Toomey. The Senate will be back at it tomorrow at Noon. [https://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/1424143941914566659](https://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/1424143941914566659)
57. No agreement on an amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions of the Infrastructure Bill materialized today. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424543439396429828](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424543439396429828)
58. Senator Lummis (a co-sponsor of the proposed crypto-friendly Toomey-Lummis-Wyden Amendment) is holding out hope that they may be able to get a vote on amendments tomorrow. [https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1424556793506635776](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1424556793506635776)
59. Charles is already planning a strategy for dealing with the bill once it’s in the House of Representatives. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1424561446973628421](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1424561446973628421)
60. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

60. “[Cryptourrencies] may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” Ben Bernanke, Chair Federal Reserve

61. “Online identity and reputation will be decentralized. We will own the data that belongs to us.” William Mougayar, Author, The Business Blockchain

62. “It just identifies how much money laundering there is being done in the world. How much people are trying to move currencies from one place to another.” Larry Fink, BlackRock

62. “Gold is a great way to preserve wealth, but it is hard to move around. You do need some kind of alternative and Bitcoin fits the bill. I’m not surprised to see that happening.” Jim Rickards, Author, Currency Wars

63. “What we want is fully anonymous, ultra-low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going… the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become.” Adam Back, Cypherpunk

64. “The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.” Don &amp; Alex Tapscott, Blockchain Research Instituite

65. “[Bitcoin is] the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade.” Bob Grifeld, NASDAQ chairman

###Hal Finney Quotes
Hal Finney is one of the most popular Bitcoin believers. He was mining Bitcoin since the early days and many suspect that he might even have been Satoshi Nakamoto himself.

67. “Since we’re all rich with bitcoins … we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use.”

68. “Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits the power of the long tail.”

69. “The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.”

###Satoshi Nakamoto Quotes - The person(s) that created Bitcoin. We only know Satoshi by their screen name but their actual identity is a mystery, however we do know its definitely not Craig Wright. 

70. Message in the Genesis block. “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

71. They are coming. “WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”

72. Lost coins “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.”

73. All or nothing. “In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for [mining] nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.”

74. Decentralization wins. “A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”

75. Distributing Bitcoins “As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.”

76. Constant flow. “Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.”

77. Bloody hard. “Sorry to be a wet blanket. Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There’s nothing to relate it to.”

78. Don’t trust third parties. “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.”

79. Not for micropayments. “Bitcoin isn’t currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.”

80. Generate all the addresses you want. “When you generate a new bitcoin address, it only takes disk space on your own computer (like 500 bytes).  It’s like generating a new PGP private key, but less CPU intensive because it’s ECC.  The address space is effectively unlimited.  It doesn’t hurt anyone, so generate all you want.”

81. Central banks. “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”

82. Zero bugs. “I keep a list of all unresolved bugs I’ve seen on the forum.  In some cases, I’m still thinking about the best design for the fix.  This isn’t the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs that we need a tracker for them.”

83. Alternative to credit cards. “Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don’t have a credit card or don’t want to use the cards they have.”

84. Bitcoin “Buy attack” “When someone tries to buy all the world’s supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes. At some point, it gets too expensive for them to buy any more. It’s great for the people who owned it beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high prices.”

85. Satoshi’s language. “It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.”

86. “Sigh… why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case? You should never delete a wallet.”

87. On Privacy “The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use. If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you’re associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under. If you posted under a handle that you haven’t associated with your real identity, then you’re still pseudonymous. For greater privacy, it’s best to use bitcoin addresses only once.”

88. A major battle in an even larger war. “We can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”

89. On investing “It might make sense to get some in case it catches on”

90. In the future “I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.”

91. On Banking “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

###The Ugly - Then, of course, there are those that are not so fond of Bitcoin and it’s peers. These people seem to have taken a position against the world of crypto and make sure everyone knows about it.

92.  “[Bitcoin is] worse than tulip bulbs.” Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan

93. “Stay away from it. It’s a mirage, basically. In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.” Warren Buffett, legendary investor

94. “We know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems,"" Janet Yellen, US Senator

95. “Probably Rat poison squared” Warren Buffet, again.

96. “Avoid Bitcoin like the plague… There is nothing to support Bitcoin except the hope that you will sell it to someone for more than you paid for it.” Jack Bogle, Vanguard Founder

97. “This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” Gary Gensler, SEC Chairman

98. “The hype, the volatility, the wild claims that turn out to be false. As the crypto market grows, so do the risks to our financial stability and our economy.” Elizabeth Warren, US Senator

99. “Instead of leaving our financial system at the whims of the giant bank, crypto puts the system at the whims of some shadowy, faceless group of super-coders and miners, which doesn’t sound better to me.” Elizabeth Warren 

100. “Bitcoin is evil.” Paul Krugman, Nobel-prize winning economist

CryptoCurrency,Most common scams &amp; how to invest safely,"This are the top 5 investment schemes that people fall for:

1. Advanced fee scheme: scammer tries to convince the victim to send money (to pay gas fees for example, or trade for you and make a profit) and claims he will repay you an enormous amount of money for your help. Spoiler alert: he isn't.

2.Boiler room scam: using unfair or dishonest sales tactics. Someone sets up a fake company (usually trading company) and promises low fees/high interest rates. Once you have deposited you will never be able to retire your money, so only use trustworthy exchanges and store your crypto on a cold wallet.

3.Fake Guru (investment seminar scum): self-proclaimed millionaires claim they have discovered the secret to get crazy rich crazy fast. They only want you to buy their course/seminar/textbook so they can make a buck. Once you fail with you own money they will tell you it was your fault and that you must have done something wrong when trading at 125x leverage or doing the high risk-high reward stuff they encourage. Think about it, if they really had an easy way to get rich, why sell it to you and not use it?

4.Pump n' dump scheme: they are the most known. Usually organizated through chat rooms in telegram for example, this schemes target small market cap tokens/coins/shitcoins in order to move the price as demand rises exponentialy for a few minutes. They promise guaranteed returns as other people (bots, big investment firms etc) will jump into and buy when they see the price rises. In reality the organizers of the sheme have already bought a sizable amount of this coin and sell it to you once everyone involved raises the price. In a matter of minutes/seconds the price returns to normal and you lose most of your money.

5.Ponzi scheme: finally the most referenced but least understood. They usually promise incredibly high returns ""guaranteed"" (really high APY). You feel the hype for this great opportunity and call friends, family or coworkers so they don't miss this opportunity. In reality, no value is being generated and investors are paid using money that they/other people have put into the project. Once this blows up, those that ""bought high"" or ""entered late"" are literally left with nothing. They might keep going as people keep joining but eventually the scheme runs out of money or cashes out. 
The pyramid scheme is a variation of the scheme in which you are paid more if you bring other people to the scheme.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student debt paydown VS House down payment,"Would appreciate help on this…

My husband and I are 32yo and collectively make 190k. No debt outside student loans. 

I sold my business and now
 have 49k to do however I see fit. We already have a fully funded 4 month emergency fund. We are contributing only the match to our 401k no Roth/Investments as we’re focusing on debt repayment. 

I have 150k private loans at 3.3% interest from grad school and my husband has 22k which is all federal. We would like to start a family and can’t decide between the stability of owning a house or freedom of being closer to debt freedom.



Option one is : Crawl a little out of debt. 8 yrs post graduation and these loans are still hanging over my head. I wasted 5 years making minimum payments but have buckled down last couple years. Payed down 50k of principle in the last 2 years, making 3k payments monthly and on tract to be done 5 years. This debt is such a huge weight on my financial security. getting my student loan under 100k would be just a landmark and be a beacon of hope for debt freedom.

Whereas Option 2 is: The sale money would bring our house fund total to 78k. Our area we can find a duplex for ~500k or a condo/single family for ~350k.  The renting market here is insane about 2k for anything livable. The apartment we lived in was great but got sold during the pandemic and our leases wasn’t renewed. 

We are now living with my family to save and figure out our next move. Staying with family is not an option long term (more than 4 months)

personalfinance,Should I take a load to partially pay off my student loans to make them pay off faster?,"Edit: Thanks everyone. I'm not doing it. I knew it was a bad idea, I just didn't understand enough myself to explain to her why it was a bad idea. I appreciate all the comments!

//

Hi Folks. 

I have $14,175.91 over 4 student loans each with a 6.8% interest rate. Payment is 214.31/month which is auto-allocated among the 4 loans. (I can give individual amounts for the loan balances, if it's relevant.)

I've fairly recently been able to start working on paying some things off, but this is seeming to take forever to make any progress. 

My mother has found a loan that I qualify for that's $4,600 for 36 months at 35.57%. Monthly payment is $197.

She feels that by taking that $4,600 and putting it directly to the student loan will make everything pay off faster. This is going to add an extra $200 to my monthly expenses.

She has tried to explain to me why it is 'better' to partially pay off a low interest loan with a high interest loan, but neither of us are accountants. She thinks she's good with money, but in a ""I kept this family afloat during the hard times, so haven't I done a good job so far?"" way, so she's getting upset that I don't blindly take out a loan because she said it'd help.

Is she correct? I CAN afford the extra $200/month, but would that not be better to just pay that extra onto the low interest student loan?",finance

If we assume (which I know is total assumption) that the 0% interest rate on student loans continues past Feb 22, how can I best leverage these payments to grow them to make additional progress on my outstanding student loans? I've considered online savings and CDs but those are both at \~0.5% with my bank as of today.

CryptoCurrency,BTC and it's resistance to censorship has been more important than it's tech,"instead of being focused on the technology’s
potential and the mechanics of the payment network, there is an increasing focus on resistance to censorship. 


Bitcoin is not backed by any government. The supply and demand is entirely dictated by the free market, not political or monetary policy. This positions Bitcoin as
an alternative currency for those looking to operate outside their domestic economies. This is especially true for countries where de-stabilizing forces may be
devaluing their native currency and making it difficult to access U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies used in global trade. It also offers a clear alternative to those looking to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar based on political, economic, or trade related concerns. 



Despite their most ardent wishes, it might prove to be almost impossible for a government to shut down access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or prevent its ownership or usage without what would effectively amount to a shutdown of the global Internet. Today, access to the Bitcoin network is enabled by satellites in
areas with unreliable or no Internet connection, which further reinforces its censorship-resistant properties.



Let me introduce you to the BITCOIN SATELLITE. 


""Abstract: We have installed the Blockstream Bitcoin Satellite system, a way to download and verify Bitcoin’s blockchain via satellite, without the need for an internet connection. We were able to set up the system reasonably quickly and the satellite connection does indeed have enough bandwidth to keep the node at Bitcoin’s tip, most of the time. We conclude by establishing that although many Bitcoin enthusiasts are likely to find installing and running the system enjoyable, it is unlikely to serve any practical purpose for most users. However, because this satellite based system does have the potential to improve the censorship resistance characteristics of the Bitcoin network and defend against some forms of eclipse attacks, its existence is probably a positive development.""

CryptoCurrency,PSA: Any crypto you hold on centralized exchanges is NOT insured by the FDIC.,"There seems to be a common misconception that some exchanges have FDIC-backed insurance on your crypto assets.  THIS IS NOT TRUE.

Some exchanges are FDIC insured for USD holdings you keep in your accounts with them, but only for your USD holdings and NOT your crypto assets.

You can verify this in their own FAQ and policies sections, coinbase linked and quoted here as one example:

[https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured.html](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured.html)

&gt; Cryptocurrency is not legal tender and is not backed by the government. Cryptocurrency, (including but not limited to tokens such as bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum, and stablecoins such as USDC), is not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.   
&gt;  
&gt; In case of a covered security event, we will endeavor to make you whole. However, total losses may exceed insurance recoveries so your funds may still be lost.  

This is one area where regulatory classification of cryptocurrency as legal tender or securitized asset that may then fall under the protections of the SIPC could help protect us little folk from things like theft (Mt Gox) or exchanges folding due to something like the collapse of USDT or other such boat rocking potential incidences.

Until that happens though, you should always remember that centralized exchanges are NOT regulated like banks or brokerage houses and should NOT be treated like one.  If you feel uncomfortable handling your own crypto assets, you really should start to get some experience doing so because this is one of the defining aspects of crypto in the first place... that you can have full control and ownership over your own money.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"A lot of people are hoping Cryptocurrency will ""kill"" banks. Banks are never going away. What you should be hoping for is Cryptocurrency to change how banks operate.","Yes, it's the cypherpunk dream - To be part of a financial revolution that topples the current financial system, leading to the overthrow of your overlords, and the rise of an entirely decentralized financial system.

Unfortunately like some dreams, that needs a dose of cold water - It's never going to happen. 

Banks in some form have been around since the earliest merchants in history. They evolved into the religious ruling class and eventually into the privately owned and government subsidized businesses you see today.

And they're doing awesome. Every year is a record profit, paid for by **your money**.

- https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-nova-scotia-beats-profit-estimates-third-quarter-2021-08-24/ 

Banks in Canada are kicking ass. After all, why wouldn't they? They have all the funds in the world (Yours) to play with. Everyone who isn't a crypto nerd like us has money in a bank somewhere, and it is earning banks mindboggling record blowing profits quarter after quarter. Monopolies on people's money is great - If you're a bank.

So, this is where Crypto comes in. Giving people an alternative revenue stream, a choice. Somewhere else to put your money, and if you're smart and savvy, a way to *permanently manage your money by yourself*.

Banks *hate* this. Why wouldn't they? It directly impacts their business, influences their massive monopoly, and hurts their profit margins.

The real power of Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance is *not to tear down the traditional banking structure*.

It is to **force banks and traditional financial systems to adapt and become competitive with a changing market**.

Every time you see a bank, credit union, or big name that previously ""hated"" Bitcoin offering it to their clients, know that you're a part of that change. When wire transfer amounts go down, you're part of that change. When you notice banks changing their fee structures, or interest rates, you're part of that change. 

You're helping banks move out of the dark ages, breaking down a monopoly, and gaining not only financial freedom, but financial wisdom too, which is way more important.

Don't worry about the banks. They're going to be there, doing their thing. There are always going to be people who need a bank, whether it is trust, reliance, or just fear of things going wrong. That's fine.

Every time you take money out of your bank to invest in crypto, you're making people in the financial system think - *""Why isn't this money staying with us, and what can we do to keep it?""* No matter what, this benefits us all.

A competitive and evolving financial system benefits us all.  Don't worry about the banks, build your own future. They'll follow suit.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I pay off Student Loans?,"**$10,800 spread across 3 Fed Loans (0% interest since March '20)**

BACKGROUND

This is just my opinion and I generally go against the grain in this analysis which I see a larger risk of a deflationary economy in the near future rather than a hyperinflation situation, which many would see hyperinflation as the obvious signal with more than a year of the money printing going brrrrr and seeing the affects of that through rising inflation concerns. Moreover, this additional supply of cash entering into the markets leading to over heated economies across the board. However, I will explain why I have seen signals that have concerned me on the opposite. 

As economies have started to slow down in growth from where it has been. We’ve seen in July Wells Fargo shutting down all its personal lines of credit, which in fact is a unusual move by the bank due to the need for loan growth. A signal towards a deflationary situation is when banks become restrictive of where they lend out and leads towards a credit crunch, was this a one off instance or a sign of an incoming domino effect with other institutions following suit? 

Just recently, we had information from the Federal Reserve’s July Federal Open Markets Committee meeting minutes which showed most of the top central bank officials felt it was necessary to pull back on the pace of its purchases this year ($120 billion per month). This is another signal that I’ll be discussing in depth and also interest rates. (Transcript for the meeting can be found [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

So what does this mean? 

WHAT IS TAPERING 

Firstly it’s important to know this is specifically a purchase asset taper and essentially it means a sharp or gradual reduction of these asset purchases over time. 

When the federal reserve does these asset purchases which is designed to control the amount of money in circulation, these purchases essentially increases the money supply through the banking system which is in essence is adding cash into the other banks bank account which can then be lent out to be multiplied. 

So when the federal reserve purchases assets it’s designed to stimulate the economy by expanding the money supply and when tapering occurs this supply reduces and if the federal reserve starts to sell these assets, this in turn withdraws money from the economy and leads to a deflationary affect. 

As described in my inflation vs deflation educational post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p2ixf5/inflation_vs_deflation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when there’s a reduction in the money supply, deflation tendencies leads to cash being more valuable, individuals saving more and leads to you having more purchasing power as your cash can now buy you more goods and services. 

INITIAL REACTION TO SUGGESTIONS OF TAPERING 

Generally the initial reaction to the suggestions of these measures is what’s referred to as a taper tantrum which is a reactionary panic by investors when the Federal Reserve announces or learns of a reduction of quantitative easing. This panic tends to lead to a rise in bond yields as investors worry of a market instability. Due to this, the Federal Reserve tends to reverse their positions and continue the asset purchasing. 

Here is a resource that shows what happens once the assets starts to decrease and is met by a rapidly changed attitude by reversing the tapering: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) 

INTEREST RATES 

The Federal Reserve have reiterated that the intended tapering won’t lead to an interest rate spike. However, if you look at the longer term rates, those interest rates will rise because if the buyer of those assets is no longer there (which because of the current mass purchasing can allow these current minimal real negative interest rates and artificially inflated markets) then bond prices will naturally fall and interest rates go up. 

When I state real negative interest rates I am talking about after inflation has been taken into account so the 10Y Government bond of 1.28% now with inflation would show a negative return and loss of purchasing power. 

EFFECTS OF TAPERING ON THE MARKETS 

With what has already been covered the affect of this is it leads to significant market volatility. The current leverage throughout all the markets are over leveraged and if interest rates do rise then there is a risk of companies becoming insolvent (unable to pay debt owed) because of course debt becomes more expensive. Bond prices will fall and high risk assets and equities will also follow suit. 

You will also see commodities like gold start to slowly fall as interest rate scares occur but when interest rates do actually become introduced, gold tends to actually lead to a price bottom as the interest rates  effect have already been priced in and as we know now gold has risen dramatically since the worries surrounding of rising inflation and hyperinflation scares and we’ve now seen a slow gradually decline in gold as these tapering talks have been introduced. We know that Bitcoin is a deflationary asset and is associated as the digital gold so it will be interesting to see how the correlation between these events happen as I believe it would be a really strong test for the crypto space in how it handles it. 

WHAT DO I THINK COULD HAPPEN?

Well with so much uncertainties surrounding economies, personally my opinion is that if the markets were to tank and interest rates rise, a reversal is likely to happen. A deflationary economy is a lot more dangerous and is emphasised by Japan being stuck in a deflationary economy for 20+ years. We know that nearly 55-60% of the global market is represented by the US so it is vitally important to consider all possibilities of what happens to that economy. I feel that the Federal Reserve is more comfortable trying to manage possible hyperinflation than they would a deflationary economy and if deflation started to set in, the tapering would be reversed and purchasing of assets would resume at a larger scale. 

TLDR: Watch for signs of deflation and the impact it could have.

personalfinance,HELOC/home equity loan vs. Balance Transfer for IVF,"Hello everyone,
My wife and I are trying to decide whether to take out a HELOC, home equity loan, or just use a credit card for our upcoming $35-$55K worth of IVF treatments (rounds 2-4).

Here is our situation:

-We have a home valued at $750K on Zillow, $745K on Redfin.

-Outstanding mortgage balance will be $544K next week.

-Minus the 20%, I believe we have equity of $52k if we use the Redfin estimate.

-We have credit card debt of $72k, mostly at 0% APR. (It was $80k before covid, spent the next 18 months bringing it down to $55k, then we had to pay $17k for our 1st round of IVF treatments on credit)

-No car payments, no student loans, no other debt.

We have never taken out a HELOC or home equity loan before, so this is new territory for us. We're not sure if it is a wise thing to do, but we're assuming it's a good idea because of the low interest rates. We can do another balance transfer with a credit card, but we don't want to put ourselves in too many 0% balance transfers (3% fee), because they only last for 12-18 months, and then the real APR kicks in. 

As for HELOC/home equity loan, we don't even know what the drawbacks are. Do they have large closing costs? Will they even approve if I tell them it's for IVF? Will we be dooming our financial future somehow?

Any advice/perspective will be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.

**EDIT**: I appreciate people’s concerns about whether we can even afford this IVF treatment, but it is not an option for us. Our clocks are ticking, and we have to have a child. I know others think differently about how important it is to have children, and that’s fine. But it’s crucial for us. 

I forgot to mention a few more things:

-our joint income is 185k

-we will be itemizing our deductions, so we expect to get back about 12k from the IVF cost alone

-our health insurance will be paying for about 12k of all the treatment.",finance
personalfinance,401k Loan: General vs. Home Loan Sponsor Directed,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I have ample time to make this decision, but want to get ahead of it.

Will be looking to buy a home with my partner in the next 18 months (not super relevant to this query, but we will likely be engaged but not yet married when we buy). Based on where we’d be looking to buy, I’m expecting a home price of between $350k and $400k. My partner’s current income is $70k a year with a credit score in the low 800s; my current income is $105k with a credit score in the high 700s. The only debt is mine; approximately $70k in grad school loans that should down to $55-$60k by the time we apply for a home loan. I don’t expect any issues being approved for what we’d want.

My partner feels strongly about putting down 20% (I am indifferent but want to put down at least 10%). For our max budget of a $400k home we’d need around $92k to put down to cover the 20% DP and any closing costs. By my projections, if we buy on the earlier side (within a year), I’ll have ~$39k in my HYSA, so I’d be $7k short of my half of the DP/closing costs. My backup plan in this scenario would be to take a loan against my 401k for the remainder, but wondering what the implications are of taking it out as a general loan vs. home loan sponsor directed. In my Fidelity account right now, here’s the comparison:

- Borrowing limit is the same on both options and is well above the $7k I need
- Interest rate is 5.25% on both options
- General Loan term of up to 60 months; Home Loan term of up to 120 months
- Paperwork required for Home Loan but not the General Loan

I had read somewhere that if you take a 401k loan explicitly for a home purchase, you must disclose this to your bank and this can impact your mortgage interest rate. On the surface, the primary benefit on the Home Loan seems to be a longer repayment period, which I don’t think I’d need; conservatively, I probably need max 18 months to pay back $7k plus interest. Would it make more sense to just take it out as a General Loan? Or are there rules against this?

Finally - does the 401k route even make sense in the long run, or am I better off convincing my partner we should just put down 15% vs. 20% in this scenario?",finance

investing,What is your opinion on Barry C Knapp's saying there will be a 10-12% correction if there is tapering announce for Oct. 1st?,"S&amp;P 500 rises to another record on Wednesday, Dow jumps 120 points. 

Powell is expected to make press on economic policy this Friday 08/27/21 
The much anticipated Jackson Hole symposium kicks off on Thursday, where central bankers will potentially provide updates on their plan around tapering monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

I've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. 
This is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. 

Taper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “It’s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn’t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.”

Bell added that the deciding factor could be August’s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.

Several tech companies will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes, including Dow component Salesforce. Box and Snowflake are also on deck.

personalfinance,Should I use Inherited IRA to pay student loans?,"I recently inherited $100,000 and am planning to roll it over into an inherited IRA. I inherited from my parent so I have to withdraw the full amount in 10 years. I don’t currently have any savings besides an emergency fund. I want to open a Roth IRA and max contributions for that but don’t know what’s best for the rest. 

My only thought is that I have around 30k federal student loans &lt;4% interest rate. I have $500 a month budgeted to use on either loan payments or savings so I am working to get them paid down, but I don’t know if it makes sense to pay faster or leave more of the money in the account for longer or use it to fund some other type of account",finance
personalfinance,"I've ran out of federal student loans, I have a couple of private loan questions","Quick back story. I have a BS in psychology from my early 20s. I worked in restaurants for about 10 years and now I'm going back for electrical engineering. Including this semester, I have 3 semesters left. My cumulative GPA is 3.87 and I'm not struggling in any of my courses so far so I think 3 semesters will be all I need. My credit is in the 640s. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't notified that I hit my limit until 3 days before classes started. So, I didn't really have a choice but to sign up for a payment plan and make the first of 4 $1,100 payments. My question now is, what are my options? My monthly income ranges from $2,400 absolute min to $3600 max, depending on if I can work 50 hours a week or only 40. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Bills are:

$300 rent

$100-150 utilities

$150 gasoline

$200 medications

$300 food

$100 streaming services/entertainment

$400 car payment

$150 CC debt

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago we moved into a smaller place to save money and get ahead on my CC debt. We had a small saving that went away during our move so now we're basically back to square one. My spouse has talked about taking on rent herself so I would pay $0 and she would pay $600. I can handle the monthly school payment, but then I will have no savings and if ANYTHING comes up, I'm screwed. So, I think here are my options. 

1. Continue to pay $1,100/month out of pocket (no loans but then I can't save)
2. Get a private loan through my credit union (my rate will most likely be pretty high but the overall amount of loan should only be $10-13k)
3. 3) See if Navient (who my other loans are through) can give me a private loan (I haven't been able to get in contact with them yet)

In this situation, is a private loan really that bad of an idea? I could definitely start paying it off instantly, it would just ease my mind to only have to pay a few hundred a month instead of $1,100. I don't know if this factors in this but average starting entry-level salary for EE majors is $75k+ and cost of living where I currently live is very low.",finance
personalfinance,30 y/o Nurse need advice for what steps to take next,"30y/o, from S. America living in the US (important). Been an RN for 4 years. Single.

$0 debt right now.

HSA $4k, Roth IRA $9500, Traditional IRA $43k. Savings/cash $11k. 529 $2k. Car is paid off, just changed battery, oil and tires. Should be good for a while.

I just moved to a low cost of living area with base salary 80k/year ( I am hourly and overtime is plenty but burnout is real and do not want to go through that again). Sign in bonus for 3 year contract and relocation allowance should be about 7k by the end of October. I have 403b with 4% match at work but no match until I am 1 year with the employer and vesting after 2 years.

I am with family but I am looking to buy a house in the $100k-150k range around November-December ( I do not want to stay too long and rent is increasing to be more than a mortgage here anyways). Plus I plan to stay for a long time and have a family in the next 3-5 years (I am single right now).

I also paid a down payment for a condo in S.A. that is under construction but supposed to be ready by the end of the year; to pay it off it's about $30k. The interest rates if I get a mortgage there is around 11-14% it is also supposed to hit me with a hard inquiry because they will check my credit worthiness in the US. I also want to save for a construction in that same city for Real Estate investing on my family's property so I would need at some point about $50-60k cash to get 4 rental units for like 1k USD a month rent but that is more long term 5-10 years right now.

I stopped having a budget as well, I just keep my expenses under about 50% of my take home pay, so whatever else I could save or spend on vacations etc. Also I maxed my IRA or ROTH depending on if I was going to have deductions or not before but I find it difficult to DCA, I just add a lump sum but I do need the money for other things.

In the 403b (Transamerica) I have access to VINIX, should I just increase my contribution and max HSA to be 15% of my gross and be done with it? Should I only do that when there is a match? Should I skip investing \[temporarily\] to have cash for other goals?

Should I go ahead with the buying a house here or pay off the condo in my hometown? Buy both?

What should I do with the 529?

I am normally very organized and decisive but I am having a hard time deciding what to do with all of these things. Any advice or points of view would help.

Edit: TL;DR: $11k on hand, expecting about 10k more by November. 80k base income just started this job. $0 debt. 403b match 4% but only after 1 year employment. Plan to buy a house 100k-150k by the end of the year. but have plan to finish paying off condo in S.A. for 30k or mortgage with 11-14% interest or get a hard inquiry to my US credit report. Need about 50k as well for RE investment in SA in about 5 years. About same time plan to go to grad school so 529 $2k right now. Bad at DCA. Should I still invest in 403b? Save the cash for house here or in SA? 529?

That seems complicated, but it looks like it would work.

Of course, that's all assuming that salaries and other tax things don't change massively in the next two years.

If I could increase my salary/income for 2021, that would increase the amount we could get for the tax credit. Can I do a rollover of my IRA to a Roth IRA before retiring? That would increase my income for the year. We're already maxing our regular Roth IRA annual contributions ($7,000/year each).

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 25, 2021**

Stocks continued their momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

US Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.

Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.

Yesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Biden’s ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. 

Following the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Passing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country.” President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, “There were differences. Strong points of view. They’re always welcome. What’s important is that we came together to advance our agenda.”

Federal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.

**Highlights**

* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.
* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.
* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.
* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a ""core national security challenge"" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.

But due to these artificially low interest rates for the last 12 years, there is nowhere safe to turn to.  If the FED finally decides to raise rates soon, bond funds are going to take a hit.  Maybe not a crash, but certainly a hit.  Even cash is stupid with inflation eating it up.",finance

CryptoCurrency,A role for blockchain in job searches,"As both an employee of a business, and as a hiring manager, I can tell you that process for recruiting employees is not optimized. Companies seeking to hire a candidate have a number of (expensive) choices:

* Post on the company website - this can be effective for large, well-established organizations; but for smaller businesses that do not draw traffic, it's not particularly useful. 
* Pay for a listing on a national career site - these are expensive transactions, with models that allow for addition fees to promote positions. Employers can spend thousands of dollars on one position posting across several job sites
* Pay a recruiter - even more expensive, this method transfers the responsibility to a third party, who often has a pool of candidates ready to match with openings. Employers can spend tens of thousands of dollars on these services for retained searches or temp-to-perm transfer fees. Additionally, agencies routinely assault businesses looking to sell their services and promote candidates.

As a job seeker, it can be difficult to navigate through the sea of sites and agencies. Postings from different organizations contain different content - there is little standardization. And once you are ready to apply to a job, the endless misery of submitting resumes, forms, emails, secondary logins, etc can throw up a barrier to prevent good candidates from following through. 

Much like banks sit in the middle of otherwise peer-to-peer transactions, for-profit companies sit in between employees and employers, collecting posting fees, agency fees, and even advertising revenue. I submit that a decentralized, common aggregation of career opportunities supported by a blockchain backbone would advance the experience for employees and employers, while reducing costs greatly:

* A common data framework and structure allows for ease of engagement by the seeker, and allows for comparison across opportunities
* Candidates can establish a single profile with all required fields, allowing a user to immediately apply without filling in the data numerous times
* The public transactions allow for users to observe the status of their application - no more wondering if it was received. Employers would be able to demonstrate responses back to the applicants address
* Businesses could be assessed for equal opportunity metrics - important for both claims of discrimination, and for defending against false claims. Data could be fed into reports required per todays EEO/AA guidelines
* Business expenses for hiring could be reduced, or redirected into onboarding protocols

Additionally, as I recently experienced - potential candidates would be able to confirm that postings are real and valid. We are watching a scam unfold where a fraudulent company is posting fake jobs, and charging people to apply. Being able to validate the source of the posting would be huge here. 

I'm not a programmer, an expert on the tech, or even in HR. But, I see that there could be a superior way to match employers and employees while cutting out middlemen using blockchain concepts at the core.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Policy and interest rate risk,"Why is it good to invest in index funds at the moment? I understand that stocks have historically done well over long spans of time. Stocks have performed better than any asset class over time.

You probably noticed that stocks have done phenomenally well in the few past years. It is thought that low interest rates and government spending is the main source of historically high stock prices today, along with high growth expectations. Interest rates have fallen since the 80's and are near record lows 

If interest rates increase by a lot say 2-3%, that could potentially kill the stock market bubble. Larger interest rate increases would be catastrophic to stocks.

Why is it wise to invest in an environment where government policy is the primary factor in your portfolio's long term success?

CryptoCurrency,US Dollar - a deep dive,"Have you ever wondered where the America Dollar came from? Well, the story begins in 1519, when the Bohemian Count Hieronymos Schlick discovered a rich vein of silver near his estate and decided to mint his own coins. Named after the valley where they were mined, these Jaochimsthalers (or thalers for short) became so popular around the world that the word became synonymous with any big silver coin, from the Italian tallero to the Ethiopian talari to the American dollar.

But why would the United States, an English colony, use dollars instead of the currency of its motherland: pounds and shillings? Well, during the 1700s, London was intent on keeping as much gold and silver in the country as possible. They actually outlawed the export of their currency, even to their own colonies. That meant that American colonists had to rely on silver dollars from other countries, and the most plentiful supply came from Mexico. Just south of the border, Spain was producing vast amounts of silver coins at the Casa de Moneda de Mexico, still operating today as the oldest mint in the Americas. Officially called pesos, these silver coins were worth eight reals, which is why you might have heard pirates call them “pieces of eight.” But to the American colonists, they were simply dollars. Still, coinage in the colonies was hard to come by. What little there was went to Europe to pay for imported goods, and it rarely came back. In 1729, a young printer saw how a lack of currency in Philadelphia was stifling the local economy, prompting him to write an anonymous pamphlet called *A Modest Enquiry into the Necessity of a Paper Currency*. This was the same man responsible for many famous financial quotes like “Time is money” and “nothing is certain but death and taxes”, which was Benjamin Franklin.

Franklin’s advocacy of paper currency earned him contracts for printing money for the Pennsylvania colony, but the English crown saw this as a threat to its authority. By 1764, the British Parliament had outlawed the use of paper money in America, just one of many stubborn decisions that would eventually provoke the colonies into rebellion. However, you need cash to finance a Revolution, so the newly formed Continental Congress authorized the printing of millions of dollars of Continental Currency. Originally, these “continentals” were valued at one-to-one Spanish dollar, but as more and more were printed, their value fell dramatically. If you’ve ever heard the saying, “Not worth a continental,” that’s where it came from. Though the American Revolution became the first war financed and won with paper money, the American people felt totally burned. The Founding Fathers decided to avoid the controversy altogether by not mentioning paper money in the Constitution at all, and it would be almost a hundred years before the federal government would print money again.

With the Coinage Act of 1792, the United States officially made the dollar the national currency. At this point, the dollar was backed with the Bimetallic Standard, meaning that holders could exchange their dollars for either gold or silver. Instead of the confusing British system of pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings, the dollar would be neatly divided into 100 equal parts, which Thomas Jefferson suggested they call “cents” after the Latin for “100.” Thus, the American dollar became the first fully decimal currency in the world, and the new coins were struck in the first federal building in America: the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.

The same dollars printed to finance the American Revolution were used until 1861, when we started printing money again to finance the Union Army in the Civil War, under the authorization of Abraham Lincoln’s administration. This not only was the introduction of the first American one-dollar bill but was also the first American dollar that included the face of a person. This person was Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln’s Secretary of Treasury. The Treasury printed over $400 million worth of paper notes, which came to be known as “greenbacks”. Seeking to raise revenue for the war effort without exhausting its reserves of gold and silver, the United States federal government suspended the payments made in gold and silver in redemption of currency notes. As with Continental Currency, greenbacks depreciated as more were printed, at one point only worth one-third their face value. As bad as that sounds, it was a lot worse in the South. The Confederacy printed more than twice as many of their Confederate State Dollars. The value dropped so precipitously that by 1865, a ten-dollar Confederate note would only get you one or two cents worth of goods. Incidentally, this bill printed in Louisiana was commonly known as a Dixie, thanks to the French word for “ten.” Some people think that’s how the area around New Orleans got the moniker “Dixieland,” and how the South generally came to be known as “the land of Dixie.”

As mentioned earlier, neither Dixies nor greenbacks could be exchanged for gold and silver. Their value was based on the promise that the government would redeem them once their side won the war. With the North’s decisive victory, Confederate dollars were suddenly useless scraps of paper, while greenbacks became the main currency. Controversy ensued as debate arose over how these new dollars should be backed, which led to the Resumption Act of 1875 stating that paper money could be converted to gold. But the greenback became such a trusted standard that most people didn’t even bother redeeming them, and America finally became a land of federally regulated paper money.

The next great leap forward for the dollar would be thanks to another war. World War Two was perhaps the most expensive war in history. Economically, it was totally unsustainable, with the US racking up enormous trade surpluses and every other country involved sinking into massive debt. But the world had learned from World War One and as World War Two slowed down, many of the major powers met to work out the first real international monetary agreement, which become the famous Bretton Woods System. Following the first World War, Britain had owed the US a huge pile of money, which they couldn't pay back unless France paid them a huge pile of money it owed them. But much of the war had occurred on French soil, and the French couldn't afford to pay back the British unless they basically made the defeated Germans pay for everything. This of course had all been a disaster that caused huge financial and political instability. So, this time around, things would be different. Reparations would be minimized, repayment of reparations would be on gentler terms, and that whole problem of wildly unstable currency caused by countries like Germany no longer being able to adhere to the Gold Standard after World War One would be solved. At this point in history, the US basically had everybody's gold, because everybody had bought a ton of stuff from the US for the two biggest wars in history. So, the US actually was still on the Gold Standard, making the solution simple: Peg everybody else's currency to the US dollar. And so, every country had to keep some Dollars on hand to redeem their currency, which is how the US dollar became the reserve currency for basically the entire world.

Throughout the 20th century, the connection between gold and the dollar got weaker and weaker, until it was finally severed by the Nixon Administration in 1971. The US dollar is now a fiat currency, meaning its value is based only on the people’s faith in their government. Essentially this means the US government has the power to inflate or deflate it at what any rate they would like. As I would imagine, many in this community are not too keen on the dollar and imagine a future where it is expelled or backed by another store of value with an attractive Stock to Flow ratio, such as Bitcoin. One thing I think we can all agree on though is that no monetary system has proven to work forever, so it will be interesting to see what the future has in store for the dollar.

CryptoCurrency,''Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)'' - one of Hal Finney's last posts - He talks about first meeting with bitcoin and other things..,"I respect Hal Finney so much and I found this post of him that posted in 2013, March. I find it very interesting and it was one of his last posts before he died. It was a good read and I wanted to share with you guys. Here is the full post;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

personalfinance,Got approved for an auto loan at 1.99%. I need help ensuring my numbers are correct to decide whether I finance or buy a new(ish) car.,"I financed a 2018 Honda Accord when it was new in the year 2018. My job and my credit were subprime so I got an interest rate of 8.58% at 72 months. I currently pay $535 per month and have around 40 months left on the loan. Since 2018 I managed to get into a great career and my take home pay is $5,500 per month. My local credit union approved me for an auto loan at just 1.99% and I can either refinance my car or buy a new one.

**The Car:**

2018 Honda Accord with just 44k miles. I work from home now so I only drive during the weekends or weekday nights if I need to get groceries. It's been sitting in my driveway most of the time so it is in excellent condition. I owe $18k and I have gotten trade in offers around $21k.


**Current Loan:** 32 months into a 72 month loan

I financed a total of 29k but I ran the numbers and realized how awful of a deal I got on my financing. If I stayed with my current loan, my total cost would be $38k. I have paid around $5,500 in interest so far and if I stay with my current loan, I will pay $535 for about 40 months and pay an additional $2,900 in interest. The bank said I have paid $17.5k so far.

**If I refinance**

If I refinance now, my monthly payment goes down a whopping $10 lol but my interest would only be around $530 saving me at least $2k. At that point, the total I would have to pay is is around $36k but the total price of the car was around $28k out the door.

**If I buy a new car:**

I feel like the first pro of buying a new car is the fact that I would only have paid $17.5k for a Honda Accord instead of $36-$38k. It would be less if I count the potential $3-$4k of downpayment I could get if I trade it in. With 1.99% I can finance a car with another 72 month loan that is actually $36k out the door and my car payment would be the around the same as it is now. If I were to finance a car that is between $30-$36k I would buy something that lasted me forever like a lightly used or new Tacoma.


I could also finance a lightly used and smaller car for around $18k and pay it off in 36 months. If I do this, then it would mean I will still pay $36k for the span of 7 years, however, it would be for 2 cars instead of one.

**My thoughts:**
I really do not like the idea of paying $36k for a Honda Accord but I have to accept that I should have refinanced much sooner because I could have saved thousands of dollars on a good car. Even though I can refinance with a stellar 1.99%, I will still overpay for this car. But if I get rid of it now, I would have underpaid for it. If I finance less than $20k, I would have bought two cars for the same amount. If I buy a brand new and more expensive car, I would have to start all over but, I could get a great car at a great interest rate and the same monthly payment. My goal is to save money on interest so if my car payment is the same but with lower interest, I would consider it a win.

Am I right to believe that I will overpay if I refinance and stay with my car? Or should I just cut my losses, suck it up, refinance, and stay with the Honda?

Thanks for the insight!",finance

personalfinance,Refinance a second time in year to remove FHA MIP?,"Recently refinanced home ( early 2021) to get interest rate down from 6.25% to 2.75%. I have been in the house for about 3 years. The first round of refinance I was pretty sure that the house would have enough equity given how hot the market has been the past year. I live in a newer development that has been consistently selling house for $60-70k more than us original owners paid. Unfortunately, I think I got pretty screwed on the appraisal. House appraised for for about $25k less than was expected, thus putting me at about 85% LTV and thus again stuck with MIP. My estimate was based on similar homes that had recently sold Talking. The appraiser chose homes that sold over a year prior and were ilder than my home, despite a plethora of homes in my development and adjacent being available. Talking to different neighbors selling their homes, some were also hit hard by appraisers while others faired better than expected. Additionally, due to student loans killing my DTI, I could only really go with a FHA also. I decided to go forward with the refinance because the new interest rate helped me save about $300/month on mortgage.

My question is would it make since to try to refinance again soon to see if I can remove the MIP or should I just keep it until I would like move in about 2 years? The market has continue to grow in my area with homes now selling for more than $100k of what the original owners paid to move in? I don't have the same amount of cash reserves as I previous did, so I would probably need to roll in some closing costs. Removing MIP would save me about $120 a month, but I also don't want to risk paying another $4/500 for another appraisal to come back low.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Tried to get a loan from my lifetime credit union. Denied. Screw these people.,"Been a member of this credit union for 25 years. My whole working life. Tried to get an ""anything loan"" for 20k to refinance ~12k in credit card debt, pay off my 5k left on my car and have a safety cushion. Anything loan was 25k max so I thought 20k was reasonable. Without giving away all of my personal ID info I make a 35k a year as a PhD student, and have a credit score of 7fucking50. I have a masters in engineering and over 90 months of on time payments in a row. No criminal history, leans, missed medical bills, reposessions or even tickets to my name.

They denied me with no counter offer because I dont make enough money.....

I'm litterally already paying this down anyway, this would just make it cheaper on interest and give me 1 payment instead of 2. This was at my credit union. I applied on a Thursday, didn't hear from them so I called on the following Tuesday, and they told me I was denied. 

They didn't care about my tda account, or my crypto portfolio which dwarf this fucking loan. They could give me any offer at all. Banks get 1% interest from the fed, I'm advertised 5% interest on an anything loan, I actually get charged 20% interest on a credit card and have no other ""traditional finance"" way around this. 

They must really want me to sell my shit. I just can't seem to find the sell button tho.....

Before you guys say it, I know about blockfi and celsius and nexo and ""insert your fave here"". I'd like to point out to people tho...

If you pay 1% interest on your loan (celsius), and you have to collateralized 4:1 collateral:loan. Your 4time$ of collateral is not making interest. Say thats btc or eth nominally at 5%, your lost 5% on 4x collateral maths out to be 20% interest on the loan principal. 

Nexo 2:1 you still pay 6% and lock up 2:1 assets. 6% interest on the loan plus 5% interest on your 2xcrypto is a 16% cost of capital. Ffs

And apparently usd printers are going brrrrrr somewhere, huh. Heard of it, but I never seen low interest personally.

Idc if you moon me or not, I just wanted to come here and bitch about my bank to some fellow TraFi haters. 25 years of putting money into this bank to have them not help me now when they really could have has pissed me off phenomenally. Im literally already making the payments. Maybe I shouldn't have expected this to work, maybe I dont make enough on paper, or maybe banks should fucking give competent people loans.

Please proceed to roast me and my financial situation, if you could just pad the insults with a ""but fuck your bank tho"" it would make my day.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Sometimes you have to outsmart yourself,"Hey guys, started my crypto journey this summer when the big guys were at their all time high. Bought my first $200 of eth @4k on the way down, and didn't see green until recently. Every paycheck I would DCA $100 into crypto, eventually I held eth, xtz, bat, and yes even doge. 


Sold my doge to break even and bought CRO, and sold bat at a loss for eth when I started using crypto.com. On CDC I staked everything I had. I locked in my xtz for 3 months for 4%, flexible  time frame for eth for 3.5%, and staked CRO on the defi wallet for 12% flexible rate. 

This week's xtz rip has me over the moon, but I'm glad that it's locked in for another month, because there are plenty of times that I would have sold it to take profits/trade it back into eth/sold for a loss. 


The key thing here is I had to outsmart myself. I bought the xtz and bat to diversify my portfolio and not just be all in on one coin. Then I locked it into the 3 month time frame so that I didn't have access to it when I felt like selling for a loss or taking profit before I was ready. I'm more disciplined when it comes to eth because I believe in it 100%. I still believe in xtz, cro, and bat. I did my research before buying, and I bought them all for a reason. With bat I got too controlling and impatient and sold for a loss. Now I'm glad I set up a block to keep from doing that with xtz. Cro is a hold for me because of the interest rates and I believe the platform will grow soon and be one of the next big competitors.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"El Salvador’s adoption may truly be the flip of a Bitcoin, but is anyone thinking about what happens if it lands on tails?","**This post is possibly going to stir a lot of emotions, and I’m okay with that.**

 Sometimes we need ask tough questions.  People should have been asking tougher questions in 2018, like “Why are there so many alts with so little use  getting billions of dollars in market cap, and “Is crypto *really* ready to change everything?”

Everyone is hyped in crypto about El Salvador.  This is what we’ve waited for right? True adoption.  A country stating that they are trusting their future to BTC.  No more “money printer go brrrr.”  No more hyperinflation,

#No more Dollarization

So in case you don’t know, El Salvador dropped the colón as it’s official currency back in 2001.  **The US Dollar has been the official currency since.**  This is *extremely* important, and I’ll go into why in a bit.  But ultimately, understand that if Bitcoin were to truly take over El Salvador as the official currency of choice, the adoption would soon likely spread to more of Central America.  And perhaps in time somewhere truly impactful, say, Argentina for example, which has a very, very awful history with hyperinflation yet a substantially larger economy.

**Backdrop**

Understand, the US has a very mired history in other countries affairs, and El Salvador is no different.  From 1980-1992, El Salvador was at civil war, and as you might expect, the US set up and financed its own junta to expand its influence during the time.  There is WAYY too much political craziness to review of this time period on, but let’s just say, itis little wonder that 9 years after the war ended later El Salvador dropped its official highly inflationary currency for the “safety” of the dollar.

[El Salvador’s economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:El_Salvador_Product_Exports_(2019).svg)

El Salvador moved away from a 90% coffee export driven economy to an economy of “stuff” the last several cycles. 

As you can see, they export a lot of cheap goods to other countries.  I actually have a couple of shirts made in El Salvador.  Which is good that they diversified, buttt…

**67% of El Salvador’s exports are to the US, and 44% of their imports come from the U.S.**

So this is where I’m getting to.  Even if you don’t believe the global banks are basically a cabal (they are) and even if you don’t believe the federal reserve pretty much runs the world (it does, at least currently,) you have to admit the dollar standard is not something a lot of rich people or politicians in the US want fucked with.  

El Salvador is a $66 billion dollar economy.  It’s a drop in the bucket.  It’s also plagued by gang violence (which has admittedly decreased in recent years) and also has an extreme poverty rate of 20%.  I have family who work in global banks, and El Salvador is one of the money laundering hotbeds that they and the FBI review *constantly.*  and their president, Nayib Bukele, has been accused by the US of Corruption, as well as five of his ministers and aides.  They are already diverting funding away from the country.

**The US maintains its power from its military, its economy, and the strength of the DOLLAR.**  Bukele is 39 years old, a populist, and already being criticized as an authoritarian.  He also acts like a troll on Twitter, which while funny to watch, doesn’t set him in a good place on the world stage.

Personally, I think the US and it’s allies are going to squash this guy like a bug.  I think that this is the -perfect- opportunity for an attack on bitcoin and the idea of bitcoin as money, and a few cyber attacks on bitcoin ATMs, as well as a ton of sanctions, could send the up and coming Salvadorian economy into a tailspin, crushing confidence in the bitcoin concept and eroding the idea that it could ever be sound money.  If other countries see Bitcoin as money turning into an economic crises, the whole crypto market will nosedive, ushering in the next crypto winter.

Call it FUD if you will, but to me, the idea that the most power financial institutions of the world are going to stand by and let “El Salvador” (which translates to, ironically, “The Savior,”) be the first domino in a changing of the order of things completely laughable.  **Crypto is absolutely the future, but the dollar is *not* going to go quietly.**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Right move to pause 401k contribution to pay down student loans?,"Hello! I recently maxed out my company match for 2021 and wanted to pause my 401k contribution for the remainder of the year in order to more aggressively pay down my student loans. What are your thoughts on this move? Here’s a summary of my financial situation: 

- 28 years old 
- $80k annual salary
- $18k savings 
- $53k 401k 
- $8k Roth IRA 
- $7k HSA 
- 2006 sedan (paid for)
- $13k student loans (4.125%, federal)
- $105k mortgage

This pause would free up appropriately $3,000 (pre-tax) through the rest of 2021.",finance

No 401k through my biz, it's crap.  I drive a Pontiac Vibe from 2005, which I love.  However,  I kind of got the itch to buy a new car at 30k.  
So, cash for the whole thing, or is the loan at 3.5% a better option.  I suppose my 30k in a sp500 would do about 7% a year.  Opinions plz!

EDIT:  Thank you for the replies.  Great advice here.  I have decided i will leave my equities and investments intact.  I am going to wait for a little while, save up cash, and if interest rates begin to climb, i may go ahead and just finance.  But i am surely going to wait, probably a year.  Thanks you all!!!

personalfinance,Paying off student loans while there is no interest using an emergency fund.,"A friend (F23) is considering paying considerably more on her student loans while there is no interest, which ends in January 2022. She has over 100k in private loans and about 30k in federal loans. All of the private loans have variable interest rates, which concerns her because they will likely increase as Covid ends. The highest interest loan is 7% but has a principle small enough that she could pay it off before January.

She has a 1-month emergency fund, a well-paying job, and is maxing out her company retirement contributions. She only recently started the job, and will soon have a lot of money to spend on various things, including a 3-6 month emergency fund. She has an apartment lease, but no other dependents or financial responsibilities. 

In general, she wants to pay down these loans as much as possible before the interest rates come back, and she'd like to use the money that would go to her emergency fund. There's some math here that I'm unsure of, in how important it is to pay down the principal of a loan before the interest kicks in. And all of that aside, is it worth it to sacrifice a 3-6 month emergency fund?",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown August 26, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. dcSpark is unveiling a sidechain project called Milkomeda that will use wrapped ADA and so-called “wrapped smart contracts”. The first sidechain, M1, will be an Ethereum Virtual Machine sidechain. This means Solidity devs can deploy their current smart contract code in M1 and those smart contracts will be accessible to Cardano users. This is “the pond”. This will be HUGE! Good work dcSpark!  You guys are killing it! [https://medium.com/dcspark/dcspark-announces-development-of-new-sidechain-protocol-milkomeda-cc28ed764a89](https://medium.com/dcspark/dcspark-announces-development-of-new-sidechain-protocol-milkomeda-cc28ed764a89)
2. IOHK partners with European Business University of Luxembourg to offer scholarships including instruction in Haskell and Plutus to students across 25 countries in Africa. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/24/making-education-in-africa-more-accessible-affordable-and-equitable/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/24/making-education-in-africa-more-accessible-affordable-and-equitable/)
3. It’s interesting to note that (as pointed out by [@Rob98550139](https://twitter.com/Rob98550139)) on June 23rd, EBU of Luxembourg also offered 5,000 scholarship’s in “Plutus Blockchain programming for Cardano Blockchain” to Nayib Bukele for El Salvador. Something unannounced going on there? [https://twitter.com/EBULuxembourg/status/1407594850199953410](https://twitter.com/EBULuxembourg/status/1407594850199953410)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future.

5. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either.

11. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

13. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

18. Reports are coming in that the new bipartisan Infrastructure Bill contains new provisions that might require a whole host of actors within crypto ecosystems like Cardano to report transactions over $10k.

32. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects.

34. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

35. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

37. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

CryptoCurrency,What is Crypto Bonds 101??,"# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.

 

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,HSBC ISA interest rates dropping to 0.01%,[removed],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,As if you didn’t need any more reason to utilise crypto for decentralisation HSBC Bank in the UK has dropped interest rates from 0.1% to 0.02%,"The fact that even at £100,000 you would only earn £20 interest is actually rediculous. Meanwhile the bank is taking your money and lending it out to over people for anywhere between 3-20% APR, especially for the unfortunate people who are in overdrafts getting charged an extortionate 20% interest.

Why keep your money in a bank and earn a tiny 0.02% interest when you can earn 6% interest on stable coins using crypto instead. Let alone if you stake crypto itself you can get much higher APR if you want to take on more risk.

As many of you know El Salvador made to Bitcoin a legal currency, which makes it the first country to do so. Its citizens are using BTC Atms, selling stuff fir btc and quickly getting rid of their soon to be worthless FIAT. They are and will be able to use Bitcoin to do everything from paying taxes and paying off debts to buying goods and services. Massive changes and adoption which we didnt really expect so soon.

Panamanian Congressman, Gabriel Silva, commented on El Salvador's move to adopt Bitcoin as a currency on Twitter and called for Panama to do the same. 

Carlos Rejala, a Paraguayan Congressman is set to present a bill that will set favourable regulations for crypto mining and crypto exchange businesses that want to set up shop in the country and eventually following El Salvador’s footsteps.

Many of the comments here on Reddit were about how small and insignificant these three countries are when it comes to adoption but…hold right there.

defi,Feedback on an idea to bring DeFi to everyone,"I had been dabbling with Defi Protocols for some time and something that struck me was when you have proven protocols like AAVE, Compound, and Curve that give you yields anywhere between 4% to 12% why aren't more folks participating in it. 

I'm planning to build a [wallet](https://brew.money) that abstracts out complexities around cryptocurrencies and DeFi and provides an experience that is similar to say something like Venmo or a Neobank such as Chime. 

Essentially, 

&amp;#x200B;

* You can earn up to \~4% APR on a Savings Deposit. The interest is computed and credited to your account every second. You can withdraw it back to your traditional bank account anytime you wish for no fees. This will be powered by AAVE.
* We also have an offering similar to a term deposit. You can set up a time-bound financial goal where you deposit money every week or month. We’ll enable faster fulfillment of the goal by providing a higher interest rate (\~12% APR). This will be powered by Curve
* In addition to the above, you can use the product to do P2P Payments with no transaction fees. The wallet works on top of Polygon.

You're the power users of DeFi, and will have deep insights on this, would love to know your thoughts about the idea and is this something you see people using. 

Would love to know your thoughts.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"Hi, looking for some insight into potentially refinancing student loans. Here's my scenario: 

* $23k federal student loans @ 4.5% weighted average interest, standard repayment plan (can't find remaining length but \~8yrs remaining)
* MS/BS in biomedical engineering, working as a test engineer in medical devices (stable income that will only increase)
* I want to prioritize maxing my Roth 401k and Roth IRA annually before paying loans
* SoFi estimated 2.5% APR w/ $400/mo payment over 5 years if I wanted to refinance

My questions are:

1. If I refinanced, would I be able to pay over the $400/mo or am I stuck paying that rate? Ideally I want to lock in a lower interest rate and then pay more than required so I can burn through my loan faster while accruing less interest. However, I'm still limited by wanting to prioritize retirement funds. 
2. Is it worth refinancing if I throw $800-1k/mo into my loans at my current 4.5%? I could probably throw in upwards of $1.5 - 2k/mo and be done within a year, but at the cost of lowering my retirement contributions.",finance

personalfinance,Should I Pay Off My Car Loan?,"I recently had a bump in income and currently making around $35k working part-time and going to school. I am 22 and have zero credit card and student loans (parents are paying). I have a loan for a car that has a balance of $8,400.

I have $5,000 in my emergency fund to cover 5 months' worth of expenses and I still live with my parents to keep expenses down. I also have another $6,700 sitting in another savings account that I have saved from my lower-income job.

Based on these numbers my plan was always to keep 5 months' worth of expenses. If this loan disappears my expenses will go from $1000 - $380 (min payment) = $620. Based on this number now my emergency fund for 5 months will be  $620 x 5 = $3100.

So should I take the $6,700 in one savings account and take $1700 from the emergency fund account to pay off this loan in full? The logic is that the new expenses disappearing will still cover my 5 months' worth of expenses.

Thanks everyone for your thoughts, opinions, advice, and perspective. I really needed the reality check in some places and the words of comfort and reassurance in others. I clearly need to think about and discuss a lot of things before doing any thing. 

# The situation

I need help making a decision. My family just moved from Colorado to the Raleigh, NC area. We sold our house in CO for a decent profit, and we're currently searching for a home to buy in NC. Our current housing situation is not ideal, but comfortable enough and technically indefinite and rent/mortgage free.

However, given the insanity of the current housing market (especially in this area), I'm having very mixed emotions on our plan to buy a house and at what price. It seems that for what we want, we'll be hard-pressed to find anything less than $500k, and much more likely over $600k.

Given that our last house was purchased at $280k, this is a hard pill for me to swallow. Our mortgage payment would likely close to double and having that much cash tied up in a non-liquid asset for a market that (to me) seems very unpredictable and possibly might crash or go down over the next few years.

I'm stuck between deciding to

* Keep looking for a house now
* Stay where we are and wait
* Look for rentals (and either stay there or buy later)

We're planning on being here at *least* 5 years, but assuming we like where we end up, likely closer to 10-20. We've got a 2-year old, and hopefully another on the way. We're looking for somewhere to raise our kids.

# The financial details

**Relevant assets:**

* $150k *available* for down payment, appraisal gap, and offering over asking price ($2k is being added to this every month)
* $10k set aside for closing costs, etc (conservative estimate)
* $5k set aside for post-purchase costs like appliances, furnishings, minor repairs, etc

**Income:**

* Current gross pay: \~$160k/yr, plus \~$7500 year-end variable ""bonus"".
* Current *budgetable* monthly net pay: \~$9000/mo

I'm the sole earner; my wife is currently a full-time parent. I'm about to receive a promotion, but I don't know exactly what the pay bump will be. Eventually, my wife wants to re-enter the workforce, in a relatively lucrative field. Depending on the exact timing and nature of the hopeful-second-child, her starting to work in about 2 years is reasonable. We planned on having her entire salary go towards aggressively saving for retirement. Ideally, we wouldn't count on it at all for our regular budget.

**Fixed expenses:**

* $400-500/mo *estimated* utilities (unsure on some things because of the variability of electric and whatnot)
* $75/mo various monthly bills
* $365/mo for yearly (or greater) expenses
* $700/mo vehicle loan (\~$9k to pay off)
* $500/mo vehicle loan (\~$10k to pay off)
* $300/mo student loans (\~$23k to pay off)

All three loans have fairly good interest rates. I'm not in a rush to pay them off except to free up monthly budget.

**Savings/investments expenses:**

* $400/mo to retirement savings (currently on pause to instead increase emergency fund from $10k to $20k)
* \~$100/mo to various ""speculative"" investments (individual stocks and cryptocurrencies)

**Variable expenses:**

Either:

* $3750/mo for *actual* 12 month average (arguably being very lax/careless about spending in some cases)
* $3040/mo for *idealized* ""what we should be spending"" or ""being a little more frugal than usual""

# The financial summary

All in all, not accounting for the mortgage/rent itself, **I'm looking at the following amount ""available"" in the monthly budget:**

* \~$3000/mo *actual average*
* \~$3700/mo *idealized frugal*

Our absolute max budget to purchase a house would be **$685k**. This keeps the principle amount under the cutoff for jumbo loans (which we're not really comfortable getting into) and, by my estimate, would put the mortgage payment at **\~$3000/mo** for a 20% down payment (including property tax and homeowners insurance). This would leave **$13k** of cash left over. That cash could be used to pay off the more expensive vehicle loan, freeing up room in the budget.

On the flipside, if we decide to rent, we can take the cash we would use to buy a house to pay off all our debt and invest it. Eventually that could add to our retirement savings or be used to buy a house in the future. The paid-off debt would free up an additional $1500/mo to add to that capital.

# The dilemma

We've found a house that would be absolutely perfect for us and that we *may* actually have a shot at getting an offer accepted at $685k. But it really gives me pause dropping that much cash and maxing out our monthly budget. Especially because we need to act pretty soon. But we'd need to do almost no work to the house.

I think what I'm really struggling with is losing the flexibility of having disposable income that unspoken for. Our previous mortgage was \~$1500/mo. It's nice not really having to think about how much groceries cost or being able to spend $1000 in one month to buy a 3D printer because it would be fun. Or my wife buying a $3000 motorcycle on whim because she's short and it was a tiny bike with a cool engine swap already done. Or buying everyone's dinner when we go out to eat because it feels good to do so.

I don't want to count on future increases in income or the additional income of my wife to make this purchase work. However, I work in a very in-demand industry and have an in-demand skillset that pays pretty well. I'm generally not worried about being unable to find work. In the past, I have gotten let go, and found (my current) job within 2 months that came with a decent pay bump. But I would still like to insulate against gaps in income and give myself the freedom to choose.

investing,"Some Thoughts on Fed Policy and ""Policy Mistakes"" As We Start Talking About Tapering","For the people out there who follow the macro environment, there is always a lot of discussion in past market bursts (such as 2008 or 2000) that there are or were fed policy mistakes that either caused or contributed to the meltdown.

This is relevant now because as we come into talks about tapering, there is a lot of chatter about a potential fed policy mistake one way or another. 

But I think this is a poor way to think about these items, and views of mistakes completely ignore the context of the macro environment and ***why*** the fed made the supposed mistakes in the first place. 

**Most Policy Mistakes Are Fed Decisions Where They're Forced To Choose Between Two Bad Choices**

# Fed Policy Quick History: Caught Between Tough Choices

Lets start with a quick history of important fed decisions, many which have been labeled policy errors in the past. 

* **1980-1982 Volcker Rate Shock:** This was the worst recession the USA had since the GFC, and capped off an era where Inflation was the boogeyman and there were multiple bad recessions and employment shocks. At this time, inflation was running extremely hot (over 10%), and it was starting to get out of control. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Raising interest rates would kill the economy, which was already having a tough time dealing with the inflation of the time. Rates would have to rise to 18%, which would seriously cut off lending growth. But it would effectively stem the tide of inflation. Volcker chose the very tough decision to raise rates to 18%, which effectively cut inflation down significantly.   
Another point worth making is that the introduction of Reagonomics was a key factor in reversing the age of inflation of the 1970's, where there was a significant lack of investment in new productive capacity.  At the time, this was extremely beneficial. OF course, we're more or less at the opposite end of that spectrum right now where we have a glut of overinvestment and have possibly taken the 80's policies too far (obviously subject to political debate and views).  
* **1998 LTCM Bailout:** This was a historic bailout that occurred during a time of a lot of international market turmoil (Asian financial crisis + Russian default) and a burgeoning US equity bubble (dotcom bubble was starting to really pick up steam here).  The sudden failure of LTCM however threatened systemic issues in the financial system, and thus became the first bailout of a private hedge fund by the FED. This was a new precedent, and many believe it kickstarted the parabolic phase of the dotcom bubble. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Do you allow the LTCM meltdown to spill into the rest of the US banking system and economy, or do you bail out LTCM and support the economy + job growth? The fed chose the latter, which at the time supported their mandate of stable prices and full employment. They did not have a crystal ball suggesting an even greater equity bubble would form from this. 
* **2000-2003 Dotcom Bubble Burst:** After likely contributing to the dotcom bubble with the LTCM bailout and interest rate decrease, inflation started to rise a bit in late 1999, and credit growth and equity mania forced the Fed's hand to cap the bubble before it became even more difficult to control. The fed did a few emergency rate hikes, and the credit cycle quickly turned down, which had been feeding the dotcom mania. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Critics of the fed would have said that the emergency rate hike burst the bubble. Critics of the fed also said that they let the bubble get out of hand. Literally, there was no good choice here except to bite the bullet and hope the landing wasn't too hard. In reality, the *real* economy did have a soft landing in the dotcom bubble, partially thanks to the fed's interest rate decrease after the bubble really started to get going. 
* **2007-2008 GFC:** After dropping interest rates to keep the economy afloat during the GFC, very few people wanted anything to do with equities, especially tech stocks. This caused a shift in behavior towards real estate, which was already quite strong and resilient even during the dotcom crash. At the same time, the global economy was recovering from the crises of the late 90's and dotcom era, the euro was being adopted as a currency, and China was rising as a member of the world trade organization. All of the above created a perfect storm for US real estate getting piled into via carry trades, while the US Dollar was getting depreciated by all the above factors. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** The fed clearly started to see the monster that was being created in 2005. Not only was credit growth going parabolic + real estate lending going off the charts, but inflation was also surging in the USA due to all the aforementioned factors. Gas prices surged to over 4$ per gallon (at a time when many drove ""clunkers""), Copper surged to very high prices, and real estate / rent was also going parabolic. Greenspan was looking into a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen since the 70's, and was forced to decide between allowing real estate and inflation to go completely unchecked, or to raise rates very quickly to stem the flows from getting more and more out of hand.   
He chose the latter of raising rates, which then led to the chain reaction causing the GFC. Thing is, we don't know how much worse things may have gotten if Greenspan chose to ***not*** raise rates. Think of how much larger the US real estate bubble would have become if it wasn't cut off at the source. As bad as things got in 2008, they could have been worse if they allowed things to continue. 
* **Post GFC Environment:** After the GFC, the Fed shifted stance and most central banks became far more accomodative. The reaction of policymakers to any asset drawdowns has become far quicker and far larger. With that said, there have been some scares where the fed was tightening a little bit, which threatened to choke off the economy. The most noteworthy one was in late 2018, where the rate hikes and QE Rollback caused a 20% drop in markets before the fed reversed policy to engineer the 2019 rebound. This was likely a close call in some regards.   


# Lessons and Takeaways

From all the above, there are a few important lessons for investors when it comes to understanding equity and credit cycles + risk in the macro economy.   


1. **The party likely will or can continue so long as the central bank / government are accomodative:** You'll notice that all of the above recessions occurred during a time when the central banks were ***forced*** to tighten financial conditions.   

2. **Inflation (asset inflation or economic inflation) is always what takes the punch bowl away:** So what causes the fed or government to reverse accommodative policy? Almost always inflation. With a mandate to maintain stable prices and employment, inflation in the real economy tends to damage consumer's wallet and destabilizes prices. Inflation in assets typically comes with credit expansion, and threatens to destabilize employment and prices as it becomes larger and increasingly more fragile. These items generally tie the central banks' hands and force them into tough decisions. The ***levels*** at which the fed is forced to take away the punch bowl however is a lot more subject to opinion, and definitely not precise however.   

3. **Raising rates or tightening policy into an overleveraged environment creates systemic risk:** If you note the difference between the 1980's rate increase from Volcker, and the interest rate increases from the GFC or even in 2018, you'll notice how much more sensitive the economy is to rising rates. And furthermore, you'll likely realize how much more convex the downside gets with the more debt that exists in a system.   

4. **Debt in a system puts a soft cap on long term inflation rates:** Because central banks tend to get forced into action when inflation rears its head, and because the central bank behavior causes debt defaults and credit issues to arise, this forms something of a natural soft ceiling on how high both inflation as well as interest rates will go before triggering a deflationary shock. Once again, this isn't any set level, but you get a good broad view of this by looking at long term interest rates since the 80's, and then looking at aggregate leverage / credit.   

5. **The fed shifting to less accomodative stances isn't consistent with timing of market selloffs or recessions:** If you're trying to time the market based off this alone, you may get it right some times, but other times you would be far off. This timed the top of the dotcom bubble, but also missed out on the top of the GFC by over two years and quite a few rate hikes. It also missed out on most of the gains in 2017 and 2018 despite rising rates.   

6. **The fed doesn't make ""mistakes"", they make choices to deal with the problem at hand over the problems that may occur in the future:** In nearly every situation, the fed's dilemma caused them to choose between dealing with the problem that is currently occurring in the market with the risk that their solution could cause a problem somewhere else down the road. In every instance, the fed chooses to deal with the ***current*** problem over the problem that may be. And most people would not do anything different, because we don't have crystal balls and can't predict the future. I do think the fed has made bad choices, but most of the choices actually fit their **mandate**. In other words, don't hate the player, hate the game.",finance

personalfinance,Buy down on a car loan?,"I was pre approved for a car loan from Bank of America of $23,000, and I decided to put $9,000 down. The total cost of the car plus fees was $32,493.83. At the time of purchase, I was told that BOA would likely approve me for the entire unpaid balance instead of the $23,000, but if that wasn't the case I could make another down payment to ensure my pre approval interest rate. The dealership called me a few days later and said that to keep my interest rate on the loan, I could only be approved for the original $23,000 and that I needed to make the second downpayment to cover the difference. I paid $505.19 via credit card to the dealership (which would make the principal on the loan $22,988.64). When I got the loan paperwork the loan principal was for the $23,493.83, and there was no sign of the $505. The dealership then said that it was a ""buy down"" requested by BOA and that they misspoke and called it a down payment. They sent me the email communication from BOA where they requested the buy down from the dealership.

I called my loan officer and on 7/9, she assured me that I would be refunded the money from BOA as a check in the mail. After two weeks and no sign of a refund, I tried calling her again. She submitted a request and gave me a few other departments to call. Everyone I spoke to either didn't understand what the buy down was or told me that this was a mistake and I should be refunded or have the $505 credited towards my current loan principal. Last week, the servicing department filed an internal claim and told me the credit would show up in my account within 5 business days. After 5 business days and no sign of the credit, I called back yesterday and was told that the servicing department did not handle buy downs and they gave me the original loan approval phone number to call. The person I spoke to also did not seem to understand what the buy down was and said they filed another internal request. I submitted at better business bureau complaint this morning.

personalfinance,Why are asset allocations of retail investors measured as a % of net worth and not as a % of assets?,"I think the title summarizes it quite well, but I'll give you a bit more info about what I'm trying to wrap my head around:

If we take for granted that an individual's monthly income (from paycheck or whatever source) allows to cover for monthly debt obligations, then I don't understand why the asset allocations are always measured (at least in the media) as a % of net worth, and not as a % of assets. I just believe it is just overcomplicating it and leads to misleading conclusions. 

Let me put you an example:

Let's say Joe's assets add up to $100.000, and they are formed of $40.000 sitting on the bank,  and $60.000 worth of investments in the stock market. That means, that a 60% of Joe's assets are invested, whereas his cash position is 40%. One could say this is a relatively conservative allocation. 
At the same time, Joe still owes his bank $50.000 of his university loan. This is not a problem, since Joe's salary covers by far the monthly installments of the loan, and the interest rate of the loan is low enough so that Joe can lever on that to further build wealth with his investments during the payback period. 
Joe's current net worth is therefore $50.000 ($100k of assets minus $50k of liabilities). If we measure Joe's investments as a % of net worth, he would have a 120% of his net worth invested ($60k out of $50k). Looked from this perspective, it seems that Joe is really an aggressive guy in managing his wealth. 

Looking at Joe's example, measuring investments as a % of net worth leads to the wrong conclusion that Joe is maybe over-invested. 

Why are investment recommendations in general done made as a % of net worth and not as a % of assets? (eg. Why do you always hear ""Man, you should really have a 5% of your net worth in XYZ"", and not ""man, you should really have a 5% of your assets in XYZ""?)

I just don't get it, am I missing something?

financialindependence,"Recasting (not refinancing) your mortgage: A middle ground for the frequent question, ""Should I pay off my mortgage?""","One question that is frequently asked in this subreddit is, ""Should I pay off my mortgage or invest the money?"" Every time it's posted, we get the same arguments from both sides, and both sides have really good points. In general, not paying off your mortgage is the better long-term financial decision, but paying off your mortgage gives you a sense of freedom and stability that can't be beat.

One financial argument for paying off your mortgage that I've seen discussed recently is that by paying off your house, it's easier to lower your yearly income enough to qualify for ACA subsidies, which can save thousands of dollars every year. And if that's your goal, or if you just want to strike a middle ground between the two sides, consider paying off *some* of your principal, and recasting your mortgage instead.

I haven't seen recasting discussed much here (a search for the term ""recast"" revealed no posts from the last year), so here are two good articles on recasting:

https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/recast-mortgage

https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-recasting/

Basically, you pay off a good chunk of your principal, then ask the bank to recalculate your monthly payments, with the same interest rate and final payment date that you currently have. Unlike a refinance, nothing about the mortgage changes, except for the size of the monthly payment. And also unlike a refinance, it doesn't come along with hefty fees, a credit check, or tons of paperwork. For example, with Rocket Mortgage, it's a simple $250 fee to recast your mortgage.

As I approach FIRE in a few years, I'm going to look at the ACA subsidies at that time, and determine my best way to stay under the caps. I might pay a good chunk towards my principal at that time, and lower my monthly payment enough to stay at the necessary annual income to qualify.

Hope this helps others in the community!",finance
MachineLearning,[D] I don't understand AlphaFold,"The alpha fold paper recently got officially published in [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2.pdf) . I tried reading it, then tried reading the code on Github, then tired reading [various articles](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2021/07/alphafold-2-is-here-whats-behind-the-structure-prediction-miracle/) explaining it. Plus the original discussion [here from November last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k3ygrc/r_alphafold_2/). 

I'm still super confused about what's happening in it, so I thought I'd write down what I understand in order to explain my confusion and maybe someone here is both very bored, very familiar with the subject, and might take the time to correct some of my horrible views.

As far as I can tell:

Alpha fold takes the sequence of a given protein as input. But it then processes that via some ""undifferentiable"" database lookups into:

1. MSA data, which essentially represents the original protein and presumed variations of that protein across multiple species. So you've got the protein in humans expressed as a function of similar proteins in yeast, parrots, and fish. Then the protein in yeast is expressed as a function of similar proteins in humans, parrots, and fish... etc

2. A pair(wise) representation which as far as I understand is:
&gt; Identifying proteins that may have a similar structure to the input (“templates”), and constructing an initial 2D representation of the structure. This is, in essence, a model of which amino acids are likely to be in contact with each other.

  

Once this happens there are two modules. One formed of ""evoformer"" blocks that output a single MSA representation and a pair representation. Both of these representations are then fed to the next block *and* feed into a ""recycling"" process that makes the whole differentiable part of the model recurrent.

  

The final module determines the actual 3d structure (coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms) from the single MSA and the pairwise representation. This 3d structure is also recycled.

  

The whole cycle repeats a bunch of times and we end up with a final 3rd structure.

  

The interesting (?) feature of the evoformer transformer block is that it's structured in such a way to encourage/force certain constraints between the pairwise representation and the MSA representation, as well as constraints regarding the pair representation it outputs. But it's unclear to me if this is just because of the operations being used, or if those operations simply encourage those geometric constraints to be imposed during backprop.

I really want to say I understood this bit, but I don't think I did, so I refrain from explaining it further.  (see pages 3 &amp; 4 + reference image)[https://i.imgur.com/O8TV4Sa.png]
  

The structure prediction block seems more straightforward, with the only caveat being that it generates a backbone representation (angles of certain structural elements) and an improved single-sequence MSA representation (single-sequence meaning the MSA features of the ""original"" protein rather than that + that of analogs in other reference organisms). Then it combined these two to form the final 3d structure.

  

The recycling step is still mysterious to me. In that, I *get* how one could take the single-sequence MSA plus the pairwise representation and recycle those. I also get how one could take the 3d structure and generate the pairwise representation from that. But all 3 of these are feed into the recycling loop... So how exactly do these combine? Or are there 2 separate loops, one for the evoformer based module that uses its outputs and one for the whole network that uses the 3d Structures? Or am I missing something here? I [stared at the code](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/alphafold/model/modules.py) for a while and I only got more confused.

  

Another interesting note is that it attempts to optimize the structure locally (without global constraints imposed by the loss function, i.e. heavy penalties upon structures that are close in terms of coordinates but nonsensical due to physically impossible overlaps); Allowing for nonsensical structures from the perspective of a global loss. Global constraints upon the structure are only achieved afterward using a separate library (Amber). But I'm not sure I quite understand why this is possible and why making the global optimization differentiable wouldn't help.

*Note: I copy-pasted and edited this form a [longer writeup with the same purpose](https://cerebralab.com/I_don't_understand_AlphaFold,_a_review), since I hope the crowd on this subreddit might be better informed than the people I'll send that to.  *

Is my understanding here even close to reality? Am I missing some important bits? Are the questions I have even coherent?",technology

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, August 26, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 26, 2021**

Stocks fell, with all three major indexes logging their first day of losses following a remarkable five-day winning streak despite elevated volatility following the release of the Fed’s July meeting minutes. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) retreated from record levels, falling 0.59% and 0.63% respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.57% while the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its streak of outperformance to finish 1.06% down. Market participants are digesting a key Federal Reserve event and a speech by chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow. Market participants are looking for any new clues regarding a taper timeline that might emerge.

The annual Jackson Hole Symposium is a conference that brings together members of the Federal Reserve, economists, policymakers, academics, and government officials in order to discuss issues and challenges relevant to monetary policy and the stock market. The Fed’s July meeting minutes stated about a potential taper timeline, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.” As the Jackson Hole meeting kicks off, market participants are anxiously waiting to see if any more information or details regarding the taper timeline are divulged.

In my opinion, which is shared by many pundits, Powell will likely keep his messaging in line with his other recent public remarks, signaling the economy has progressed toward the central bank's goals while still remaining a ways off from fully reaching the thresholds necessary to begin tapering.

Wells Fargo Senior Macro Strategist Zach Griffiths said, “We don’t think the Fed is going to do anything suddenly, and we really don’t think Chairman Powell is going to indicate that they’re ready to move policy anytime soon. If you look at the July FOMC statement, they did indicate that they have seen progress toward their goals, but if you listen to \[Powell’s\] press conference, he really walked that back and said they are still a ways off from the ‘substantial further progress’ threshold. So we expect Chairman Powell to remain resolutely dovish.”

How? We do this by changing interest rates.  


Why? This will change people's behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.  


Don't get it. Explain that again? When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $Dai now, since it is cheaper.  


When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $Dai because it's more expensive now.

personalfinance,Cosign on my moms refinance plan. can someone walk me through the downsides to it?,"Preface: using a throwaway for obvious reasons. i am not new to this subreddit and i frequent it often. I am more financially savvy than the average individual. but not when it comes to mortgages and real estate

with that out of the way. couple important no negotiable things in this picture are

1. i am 29yo male. mom is 60
2. I am my moms retirement plan. I currently live with her and plan to have her live with me throughout her life. (hence why i have no reason to move out)
3. i currently pay for on average ~~80% of monthly bills. things like utility, mortgage, etc.

my mom bought her home in the height of the housing bubble. she has lived paycheck to paycheck. currently her home is worth about 600kish according to zillow (lets say 500k for conservative value).

my moms currently mortgage plan got help by the gov back in ~~2008ish~~EDIT: checked, it was in 2012ish so her mortgage has a specific special plan about it. the gist is, loan of $x, with $y amount deferred. 40 year term (yes 40 years. not a typo) interest is accumulated only on the $x - $y. the $y amount is due in full at the end of the mortgage. her interest rate is i believe a bit above 4% (EDIT: found it. its 4.625%). about ~~13~~ 10 years paid off.

i tried to do research on whether she can refinance, especially when the low interest rates hit in 2020. but i believe because of her low income, her chances are basically zero. i did some mortgage calculations and i found that (assuming my math is right) her current mortgage plan is close to if she changed to a traditional 30 year low interest plan. primarily due to the $Y deferred amount.

with that in mind, is there really a reason i shouldnt want to cosign on a refinance with her? (note: there is NO concern for defaulting in payment, or her ""running out"" on me and leaving with the payments, etc so please ignore these concerns) i will address any other things that my be relevant that i missed.

personalfinance,"Accountant told me to make a refundable tax payment on my returns, but I was never refunded. What do I do?","When I was filing my tax returns this year, my accountant told me he would need to extend my tax deadline and that I would need to make estimated payments of $100 (state) and $250 (federal) with those extensions.

I was charged by the respective state and federal entities and eventually ended up receiving the money back for my state return. I also received a refund from the IRS, however it did not include the $250 over-payment and I never received any communications from the IRS explaining this discrepancy.

When I followed up with my accountant about it, he first told me that the IRS typically sends a notice explaining such discrepancies, then he told me that they may be backlogged and that I should give it some more time.

It seems that after every little dip, the markets go back up. Futures at the moment are trading at a healthy level after yesterday’s small decline. It seems to me that people are buying as much stock as possible before the Fed changes policy. I also know that there’s a lot of cash on the sidelines with investors itching to jump in and buy up on any meaningful level of correction. 

But even with uncertainty of Fed policy as well as inflation hovering in the background, there’s the whole issue of Covid. The economy hasn’t completely reopened, unemployment isn’t at the level before Covid, and there’s the risk of more resilient strains emerging because enough people aren’t getting vaccinated. 

So I think the next year could be one of the following: 

1. Covid goes away for the most part or is easily manageable through increased vaccinations, no additional serious strains emerge. The economy reopens and the Fed gently and slowly increases rates. We have less growth than this year but still stable. 

2. Inflation is much worse than predicted and the economy slows significantly. The Fed has to increase rates faster. The question is how this turns out depends on the Covid situation.  If Covid doesn’t go away, then what does the Fed do in this situation? The risk is if the virus mutates again and the vaccines are less effective. 

I’m just thinking openly and have no idea about anything but with Covid, rates, record levels of participation in the market, there’s a lot of uncertainty. I’m curious what other people think the next 12 months could bring?",finance

11. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

13. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)

35. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

personalfinance,"A cautionary tale: target, the red card, and how it will screw you over when Target messes up","I just wanted to share my story so that others can avoid the same issue I'm having.

Several weeks ago, I purchased a prepaid credit card from Target so that I could link it to one of those places that are very difficult to cancel.

Just after I left the store, I tried the purchase and the card didn't work. It was empty. I went back inside and was told there was nothing they could do. 

I tried calling target corporate, but they told me, in their exact words, ""not their problem."" Credit cards are not required to be warrantied so they don't. They told me to call the company that serviced the card but, of course, they claim they never got the money from Target. 

Here is the kicker. Because I purchased this on my red card, the target branded card, there is no way to challenge the charge. Target gets sole approval for if charges are valid or not, they investigated themselves and found (surprise, surprise) they did nothing wrong and the fact that the card doesn't work is normal. 

Ultimately, I have a bit of plastic I paid 100 dollars for that does nothing, and a company that refuses to take any responsibility for the products they sell. 

In the end, this is a 100 dollar lesson for me to avoid using the red card, and that Target doesn't deserve the image they have. Hopefully this post will let you learn the same lesson for free.


---------------------------

Edit/Update:

My goal with this post was to try and help others. I have come to terms that the $100 is pretty much gone. Before posting this, I had spent close to 30 hours and multiple gallons of gasoline going to various targets and calling their help line. As someone who works nearly 60 hours a week, I've reached the point where I've decided that losing more weekends trying to resolve this isn't worth the money I could get back. I hate letting a big corporation bully me into this position as much as anyone else on Reddit, but at a certain point I have to call it. I've had Capital One save me from numerous companies trying to take advantage of me, but I decided to trade the security they offer to save a few pennies on a target red card and paid the price. 

That being said, several people have asked for an update or additional details, so here goes.

On escalation. I have tried to move up the chain several times. The Target reps at the non-U.S. call centers are all very nice but ultimately powerless to do anything. The Target reps in Minnesota are extremely hostile. After asking to be elevated 3 times, I was told that it was ""not their problem"" that I was wasting their time, and was hung up on. It takes about an hour and a half to get to someone in the U.S., so continuing to try after being hung up on is a huge time sink. It's the right thing to do to keep trying and fighting the good fight, but I've decided to cut my losses on this and reclaim my weekends.

On social media. This is a great idea, but unfortunately outside of Reddit I don't have much of a social media presence. I'm not sure that Target will care about me tweeting them when my last tweet was in 2012, and I have 8 followers.

On CFPB (and FTC). While I don't want to go into too much detail here, I actually work with them in a professional capacity as part of my job. The standard response is what u/garlicsinger said in this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/pcl4cr/a_cautionary_tale_target_the_red_card_and_how_it/hak9n8v?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 . While they can and often do go above and beyond, since I work with them they will want to avoid the appearance of favoritism. They are so understaffed not everyone can get the special treatment, and elevating my case and not others would throw red flags. This is a risk that comes with my job, but the CFPB is not a real option for me. Obviously, this is very specific to my case and others may find value there that I can't.

On States Attorneys. I didn't mention it in the above post above, but I have already contacted the states attorneys office for both the state I live in and the state the card was purchased (the closest target to me is over the state line). It's been several weeks with no word from either, but if that changes I'll be sure to update further. 

On TD running Target's Red Card. I wasn't aware of this. I plan on emailing them Monday to see if that gets any traction.

On Privacy.com. I should have been using them all along, but I have bought several cards from Target in the past with no issues. It was one of those ""it it isn't broke, don't fix it"" things. Moving forward I will be certain to do so.",finance

Gapping DOWN:

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning after we saw some selling off in the market yesterday. I think it's worth noting that we saw higher volume on the red day yesterday, and I'm taking this as a bearish indicator for the near future. There is a lot of speculation on whether or not the Fed will begin the asset purchase tapering, and we should have more clarity on that issue after the Jackson Hole Symposium finishes up today. In other news, multiple explosions at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan killed dozens, including US service members. This is a tragedy, and it will be interesting to see if there are ramifications in the coming days/weeks. 

SPY is trading a bit over 447, and after the choppy session we saw yesterday, I think there could be more indecision today. DIA is trading just under 353. I'll be watching for potential weakness, key support level at 352. QQQ is trading a bit over 373 and is in a similar technical area compared to SPY. I'm guessing we'll see some more choppiness today. Gold and silver are each slightly up this morning, while crude oil continues the recent strength as well. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 47,400, and today will be important in terms of trend confirmation. I'm still bullish on cr\*\*to at the moment, so I'll be expecting a strong day. My bullish sentiment will shift to bearish if we drop back below 46,300. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are up a bit in premarket trading as a result. If B\*\*coin sees strength today, cr\*\*to stocks should see strong days as well. Airlines and cruise stocks are up a bit in premarket trading, after seeing further weakness yesterday. Will be interesting to see if they can break out of the downtrend, or if the selling will continue. Delta variant fears have me feeling cautious still. Meme stocks are still worth keeping on the radar, as they have been seeing increased attention in the past couple days. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,MEGA bull incoming as Japanese banks start going negative interest rate,"Lately several central banks in Europe have implemented a negative interest rate policy aka NIRP on excess bank reserves in the financial system. Japan is the next country that will be affected with the NIRP. 

For a country where there are 7 national banks operating and many, many other megabanks and postal banks, residents are estimated to have as much as 8-10 accounts per adult on average. This is mega ultra bullish. Not resident but adult, keep that in mind. 

I used to live in Japan in my youth and people store insane amount of money across several different banks in order to get those sweet returns. And crypto is far from popular there. US and EU is years ahead in terms of adoption compared to Japan where its still almost unheard of to be holding crypto. People think Japan is super ahead of others when it comes to tech but its quite the opposite. Fax machines are still the king of sending the documentation and important data in banks. 

According to the data from Bank Of Japan, there are approximately 920,000,000 reported bank accounts in Japan. Given that there are about 125 million people in Japan and about 13% are children this brings you to about 10 accounts per adult on average. 


According to the latest [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/topics/7629/banking-industry-in-japan/#topicHeader__wrapper) the banks assets in Japan are worth above 18.5 trillion dollars. Coinbase knows that and thats exactly why they decided to go in Japan now. They see this opportunity of a lifetime.

With negative interest hitting the Japanese hard, we will very likely see a massive influx of people coming to crypto. And when that happens…market will go insane. Mark my words",cryptocurrency

5. QE not a signal for rate hikes

“There has also been clear progress toward maximum employment. At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks.”

“The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.”

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to invest my money in stocks right now or wait a few months?,"Hello

I am 27 y/o and i started investing with collective stock funds with my bank as soon as i saved money in 2018 to mid 2020. And it was great. I also still live with roomates like a student to save money.
I accumulated around 220k right now thanks to investments and low living costs.

I did not invest in 2021 because i was looking to buy a house but now after some visits i realised that the houses that were reasonable for me to make it better than rent were in bad condition and needed repairs that would make renting the better choice and i appriciate the freedom that comes with renting as well.

So now i am fully decided to rent+invest rather than buy a house.

Now my investing plan is long term like 10-15 years+ so variation or small crisis wont really affect my overall earning. So i think that for me i will go with a full 100% stocks investment. Wich is volalite but good in the long run. And it will be an international balanced one.

Also i am thinking of investing a whole 200k and keep 20k wich is what i need to live for 1,5 years.

But i am hesitent to invest now or wait a few months to see the effect that less governement help and the higher interest rates for 2022 and 2023 will do to the stock market before jumping in? And also what do you think about my decisions? I will take an appointment soon with my financal advisor and i want to be prepared for it a bit.

financialindependence,Buy your Mortgage Free Forever Home with Negative Mortgage Points so the Bank Pays Closing Costs,"Yesterday's post on mortgage recasting was great. We did that on our most recent mortgage to good effect.

But what if you are nearing FIRE and plan to buy your forever home outright?

There is another mortgage approach you can use in this situation. Yes, a mortgage, even if you don't plan to carry a mortgage.

Negative Mortgage Points, or, Selling Points to the Lender: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative\_points.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative_points.asp)

Normally people buy points with cash at closing to reduce the rate. With negative points you're receiving cash at closing in exchange for a higher interest rate. If you are buying a home that you intend to own outright, you can use negative mortgage points to have the bank pay your closing costs, and then pay the mortgage off soon after.

To do this you should **verify there are No Prepayment Penalties!** You want to be in a mortgage you can pay off whenever you want.

When we bought our downsize FIRE home we had 3 main purchase goals:

1. Overlap with our previous house to make the closing/moving process less stressful.
2. Own the new home outright soon after closing so that down the road we could more likely use the ACA subsidy.
3. Minimize costs and taxable account churn (didn't want to liquidate assets and incur capital gains).

To do this we talked with several banks. The two we went furthest with were Ally and Bank of America. Both offer (or did at the time at least) negative points mortgages with no prepayment penalties. We made it clear with both that we planned to retire early and pay off the mortgage (all true, but we didn't discuss timelines), and they expressed no concerns with this.  In the end we used Bank of America.

The negative points gave us &gt;$4000 toward closing, leaving a small three-figure sum that we paid. There are some rules - you can't pocket cash, and I think some costs may have been unable to be paid with this credit. Non-lender-related closing costs were about $2500. So we netted almost $2k vs closing with no mortgage. Edit: And after accounting for mortgage interest paid, our overall net savings were about 2/3 of that. 

Downsides?

* A home purchase with a mortgage is a lot more hassle since you're dealing with a lender. And the lenders who we found that offered this were big banks, which can be a pain to deal with.
* You have a higher interest rate, so if you change your mind you have higher monthly cost. But it will be a while before the benefit of up-front cash is negated by that difference in interest rate. So an extra year or more carrying the mortgage isn't a big deal.

This worked out well for us. We had a nice overlap of the two homes, and then paid off the new mortgage with funds from the sale of the old house.  We had that new 30 year mortgage for less than 3 months.

In the end it didn't end up being our forever home. After a bunch of appreciation plus the pandemic we decided to make a change after only a few years. For that next step we up-sized just a bit for more WFH/SchoolFH space, and wanted a mortgage again. That early payoff of the previous mortgage didn't hurt us in shopping for a new lender at all, and this is when we used the recast for another low-stress move.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Proof-of-Work is still a great investment, that offers better ROI (return on investment) than staking.","Let me first state that, staking is still vastly superior than  simply keeping your money in a bank. 

Alright so let's start with two projects that offer staking as a control. We will use Algorand (ALGO) and Polygon (MATIC). 

Algorand APY = 5.5%
Polygon APY = 13.67%

So what can a $10,000 USD investment get you? At current prices you're looking at roughly 9,803 ALGO and 6944 MATIC. If you use their projected APY figures you'll earn 539 ALGO per year, or roughly 1.48 per day, an equivalent USD value of $1.50/day, $45/month. 

With MATIC, you will earn 949 MATIC per year, or 2.6 MATIC per day, and equivalent USD value of $3.75/day, $112/month. Mind you this is still 55x and 137x better respectively than the interest on your average bank account. 

But what could you do with a $4,500 investment into a Proof-of-Work setup? Well you could build a mining rig with 8 x 1070ti. (Which go for around $425ea on the resale market.). You could build a mining rig which will earn you the following AFTER ELECTRICITY COST (calculated at a cost of $0.14/KwH at 1120 watts)

- Ethereum: 0.0053 Ethereum or $12.95/day, $388/month
- Ravencoin: 120.7 Ravencoin or $11.75/day, $352/minth
- Ergo: 0.631 Ergo or $7.45/day, $223/month.

(Reminder this is income after electricity costs, you will earn more.)

This puts your APY% on a $4,500 at the following:

- ETH: Yearly Earnings: $4,726, APY = 105%
- RVN: Yearly Earnings: $4,288, APY = 95%
- ERGO: Yearly Earnings: $2,719, APY = 60%

So what If energy consumption is your concern? It's a well known fact that PoS uses very little power compared to PoW. So how much would it cost to build a solar system that could offset the consumption/cost of running that 1070ti rig 24/7. And would it still be worth it? 

Running a 1,120watt machine 24 hours/day will use around 26.88kWh of power per day. At a cost of $0.14kWh, that's a price of $3.76 to run per day. (We have already taken this out of our profits). So how expensive and big of a solar system would you need to offset almost 27kWh a day? 

Assuming you can get at least 5 solar hours per day, you would need a system capable of producing 7.17kW. A 8.5kW system through Tesla (one of the cheapest solar providers) will run you around $17,000 (BEFORE INCENTIVES). If you add a 2.5% annual interest rate to the solar loan and divide that into a 20-year loan you're looking at payments of around $90/month. This means you'll actually be spending LESS money to run you your rig and effectively increasing your APY% as you will be going down from $112/month to run your rig to $90/month. At an electricity cost of $0.11/kWh you'll be paying roughly the same. It's also not common knowledge that most solar companies do not require money down out of your pocket, there is very little reason to not go solar in 2022, especially with an over 20% federal incentive.

stocks,Powell Says Fed Could Start Scaling Back Stimulus This Year,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank’s emerging plan to begin reversing its easy-money policies later this year while explaining in greater detail why he expects a recent surge in inflation to fade over time.

At the Fed’s meeting late last month, “I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace” of the Fed’s $120 billion in monthly asset purchases this year, Mr. Powell said Friday. 

Since that meeting, the economy has seen “more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant” of the Covid-19 virus, Mr. Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery Friday morning at a virtual symposium hosted by the Kansas City Fed. 

The central bank slashed its short-term benchmark interest rate to near zero when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. economy in March 2020, and it has been buying $120 billion monthly in Treasury and mortgage securities to provide additional stimulus.

CryptoCurrency,The future of stablecoins and their use as tender,"I just made a post about which coin do you believe will be used as tender in the future, to buy goods or services outside of the crypto market. 

I was surprised how many said stablecoins. What is the future of any stable coin and what is the usefulness? In my opinion they are here to help transition from fiat to crypto. Many are scared and uninformed to the world of crypto and as such need a relatable currency such as stable coin. I equate this to the hybrid electric vehicle. They are really only of use to bridge the gap between ICE and EVs. Hybrids will serve no purpose in the future.

But I think if we really look at what the crypto market is trying to do and the advantages for humanity, then we see no use for a fiat linked inflationary stable coin. Inflation is a tool used by the feds to manipulate value down. That's why a car today costs over 10 times what it would have costs 80 years ago. 

So don't we want an independently valued currency that is not manipulated by governments to use as tender? Don't we want an anti inflationary coin to buy our products? A coins value stabilizes as support for it stabilizes. You can see that in price charts anywhere. I think the coin we'll use to buy goods and services will have stabilized to a degree but will not be matched to a us dollar or artificially manipulated to hold value, because if we do that then really all we're doing is creating a digital marketplace that does not transition to the real world and instead a controlled bridge needs to be in place such as a stable coin. The point is to take back the financial power and give it to the citizens.

If you see a future use for stable coins please explain why we need fiat in crypto markets.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Strategy to pay back (a lot of) student loan debt,"Apologies if this isn't the right sub to post in, but I'm hoping for some advice on the best strategy to pay back significant student loan debt. Thanks for any suggestions!

I graduated from law school in May with a total of $211,000 in federal student loans (a mix of unsubsidized and Grad PLUS loans). I am starting work in a few weeks, and my salary is $202,500. My job is in NYC, and I believe my take-home after taxes and health insurance will be around $10,500 - but I may be slightly off on this. I haven't signed a lease yet, but I expect my rent to be in the range of $3,000.

I've seen a number of different options with regard to paying down student debt - refinancing at a lower rate, paying the minimum, paying it down quickly, etc., but I'm a little overwhelmed by all the conflicting advice. I obviously would like to be debt free as soon as I can, but I also keep hearing that the market is great and it's better to park money there for the time being. And should I start paying immediately (October) or wait until the freeze ends to begin repayment?

personalfinance,Cash Out Refi - Is it normal for a lender to say I cannot back out of a cash-out refinance once the appraisal process starts?,"Some background on the house I bought last Sept.

Home value: $520k

Current Loan Balance: $433k

Interest Rate: 2.875%

Given the current market, my lender thinks my home is valued around $576k.  What I'd like to do is a cash-out refi to get some cash for home improvements.  Looking to get around $20k out.  Another great byproduct of this would be getting rid of PMI (only $56/month right now, but still a nice benefit).

When I spoke with my lender today he said that we could move forward with a cash-out refinance, but once the appraisal is ordered, there is no turning back.  For example, if the appraisal comes in at $525k (and I wouldn't have much cash to take out), I wouldn't be able to stop the process and I'd have to move forward with the refinance.  

Is this normal?  It seems odd to me.

He also came in first with just a refinance option where the home is already valued at $576k, no appraisal needed, and I get a lower rate (2.75%).  The only thing is, I do not get any cash out (which is the whole point here).

In a perfect world, I'd order the appraisal, see where the house comes in at, and then make my decision.  What is going on here?  Can anyone share their experience with a cash-out refi?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"The Next Month of Crypto Movement. Guy from the Coin Bureau List all ""Black"" and ""White"" Swann Events","So first Guy from the Coin Bureau is excellent if you haven't watched his videos you need to. He is concise, details information to the way you can understand, and it is fact driven without emotion. The information in this post is directly from him and I give him all credit. I did want to synthesize it briefly and give an opinion of mine on each major event he spoke of. All the events he discussed are set or are believed to occur in the next 30-40 days. His link can be found [here if you would like to watch](https://youtu.be/3cvUpAy_aXQ). For each point I will insert the time stamp if you'd like more in depth explanation from Guy himself. 

Black Swann Events: Guy discusses these first. Break you down first then build you back up again later. I always ask for the bad news first.

**BS 1: The US Infrastructure Bill**: The bill has passed the house and is set to be approved after recess is concluded for politicians (must be nice to have a vacation) on September the 20th. The bill has been slated to pass no later than October the 1st. The infrastructure bill is $1.2 TRILLION dollars of American tax payer money to improve roads, power systems, bridges and infrastructure type stuff. However, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, slid in crypto regulations. ""It requires loosely defines brokers to collect KYC on their customers"" He goes on to discuss that it the treasury department noted that Miners, validators, and wallet developers will not be required to abide by this poorly worded regulation we won't know for sure until it is amended and passed as they Department has noted. (2:15)

**BS 2: SEC Crypto Regulations:** In short the SEC chair Gary Gensler is targeting all coins except for Bitcoin. The chair must have some on in his portfolio..... The reasoning for this is they feel that crypto are more like stocks. ""You invest in them expecting profits because of what the devs are doing."" In the eyes of the SEC this sort of asset requires registering with them which many projects have not. So far he has not been able to act as he requires resources and the authority from  politicians who are at the beach currently. This bomb could go off as early as September 20 just like the infrastructure bill. It is likely if power is given early October would be when the killing spree began. Guy believes DEFI products will be the prime candidates for targeting due to the anonymity  and functionality of these projects. Primarily, because of these projects offering the unregistered security tokens as discussed previously. (5:00)

**BS 3: Stock Market Crash:** ""What must go up, must come down"" as Guy said. This would hurt crypto. If they crash we surely will tag along for the ride. The crash could come from 2 sources. First COVID19. If it ramps up and shuts the economy of many major countries all over Europe, Asia, and America we can expect a heavy hit as we did last time this happened, just check the charts before our recovery began. (9:11, this is where he has a nice reminder for you who forgot what happened in March of last year). The other event could be the federal reserve reducing its government bond purchases. In short this increases the interest rate that individuals have to pay on debt. This could cause many issues as you could imagine. If interested check out Guy's explanation. I will note that people do not believe they would do this as it puts the US at risk on defaulting on the massive debt we have taken on. However, Guy is not convinced as the bond buying is contributing to the hyper inflation and if we continue things will go tits up. September 22 is the date to keep your eye on for this, approximately. (8:14).

OKAY. No more FUD. Lets get to the White Swanns.

**WS 1: Companies Accepting Crypto:** Acceptance of Crypto by some of the largest companies in the world. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart. All are looking to begin accepting crypto as payment options for goods and services. Tesla is assumed to begin accepting BTC AGAIN, yes again, once BTC mining was on more renewable energy. Well after leaving China, BTC mining is over 50% green now. This means we should expect an announcement form Tesla soon. Remember what happened last time BTC was announced to be accepted by Tesla? Once this announcement comes Guy believes other companies will follow in. Apple has been looking for an alternative payment manager since the end of May. Amazon announced it was looking for the same thing 2 days after the B-word conference. Recently, Walmart said it is looking for someone to help with its digital payment strategy. Paypal is set to launch a crypto ""super app"". Imagine if in a month they all announced acceptance of even just BTC. We would soar. Not only from the announcement but these companies will need to buy BTC in heaps to have to exchange with customers. When? Guy thinks weeks. 2-3 weeks is possible putting us in mid September.

**WS 2: Companies Buying Crypto:** We have seen companies buying. Coinbase will be buying $500M in crypto and 10% of its profits into more buys. This is bullish. Besides BTC and ETH we don't know which but alt coins will be getting some love. Fidelity. One of the largest assets manager in the world. They manage over $10.4 TRILLION dollars and assets. 90% of their largest clients want exposure to crypto. And they want to HODL. BULLISH. Guy said if this happened, the moon would be a pit stop on the way to the next galaxy. In June El Salvador made BTC legal tender and and more South American countries are looking to do it. If so those governments will have to hold BTC on its balance sheet. They also airdropped $30 of BTC to all their citizens which is an estimated $150M in BTC. Coinbase and Fidelity are expected to make announcements at their quarterly earnings reports in early to mid September. Coinbase will reveal then which altcoins it will invest in. I sure hope my alts are on the list. (13:51)

**WS 3: Crypto Upgrades / Events:** I will just list these (17:00)

Possible BTC and/or ETH ETF futures backed or coin backed. SEC looks to approve the BTC ETF. Early to mid late September for these

ADA smart contracts upgrade goes live. September 12th

PolkaDOT parachain slot to go live soon.

BTC upgrades 

In conclusion, Guy believes that September to early October could mark the top of this cycle. I was shocked to hear this. He also said the Black Swann events could or could not happen. However, the White Swann events will all but happen for the most part. So much bullish news and a spread of some FUD. I remain Bullish but once we get deep into September and around the FUD dates I may place stop losses. Again, if you want to watch the video I marked each section for you and the link is at the top. 

What do you think will happen? What is your strategy? Which coin do you hope Coinbase puts on its balance sheet? What are your EOY price predictions now? If all 3 White Swann events happen BTC to 100k is childs play.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Hear me out: Crypto is literally the ONLY thing standing between the world and a Complete Global Financial Dictatorship,"***“In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.”*** - Franklin D. Roosevelt

I started investing in crypto a few years back because I saw it as a good investment opportunity, and I also liked the concept of decentralization. However, only in the last 18 months have I come to understood that what I’m investing in is literally the ONLY hope we have, so to say crypto is our Ben Kenobi.

I finally started connecting the dots, everything makes sense to me now, and I’m scared to see what they are trying to do. As we all know the global financial system is literally at the brink of collapse. They’ve lowered interest rates to the point of no return, because they literally can’t raise them again, because everything would collapse immediately, however they also can’t lower them any further or we will have negative interest, which quickly would lead to hyper inflation and the same result.

THIS IS IMPORTANT, after so many years we have almost reached the point where there is absolutely no way out of the current system, and hence the big guys (aka Big Tech &amp; the big asset managers such as Blackrock in collab with corrupt governments) are working on a complete new system in the background while plundering the current system as much as they can before it collapses. 

The new system, if we really think about it, is also quite obvious, it’s already been proposed: **the complete abolition of cash money, and the introduction of digital central bank coins.** The end goal is that everyone of us only has ONE “bank” account, where every single transaction is being made from, and this account won’t be with a regular bank anymore, but directly with the central bank. 

***The thought behind that is obvious, digital central bank money is programmable. And since central banks can “print” unlimited amounts of money out of thin air, you could actually have negative interest rates this way, without destroying the system.***

That of course wouldn’t be the only benefit they’d get from that. It would also enable the state to oversee EVERY transaction, to give us differing tax rates, handing out individual fines, etc. They could also have expiration dates for the money and thus force us to spend a certain amount within a certain time frame. Or they could restrict the money to certain purposes/regions. Most importantly however, the state would be able to completely cut us off every financial resource with a single mouse click. 

*“Well, the public would never go for this” you may think now. So what does they do, what do they always do?…*
They’ll alter circumstances and then present this to us as THE solution. The most effective way is probably social unrest, a world in demise, refugee streams, wars, fear, anxiety etc. Or, ***do you really think that the US “accidentally” left the Taliban military resources worth $20 billion USD, a complete Air Force and 11 air bases, after they had discussed getting out of Afghanistan for years?*** I’m not stupid enough to believe that lmao. 

Regardless, this is where we come in, and hopefully many many more people. Crypto is the biggest threat to them, **it stands for everything that world is supposed to be: fair, transparent, equal etc.**, so naturally they will do anything to stop this. We need to stand up anytime we can and voice our opinion, demonstrate, and of course support the decentralization of the financial system, politics, etc.

Forex,How awareness of fundamental news can save your skin on days like today.,"I recently posted a brief summary of the issues surrounding ignorance of news in another sub (check my posts) and thought it would be useful to post the links below. 

As I said elsewhere, being completely in the dark regarding today’s dollar dive is something that will happen again and again for any retailer who doesn’t keep up to speed with news which is freely available if you put in less than half an hour per day. Not knowing that Powell was to speak at the annual Jackson Hole symposium is a problem if you’re taking your forex career seriously. 

Relying solely on free economic calendars won’t cover the information gap. You need to be checking for announcements regarding any currency you trade. Relying solely on technical levels will ensure you continue to run into issues like today’s Powell speech on tapering. 

Forex easily has the most complex web of determinants of any market in existence, and keeping on top of all of that information takes time and experience. Yet by just checking the sources that should be considered **standard** you will avoid trading around events which produce massive volatility and potentially wipe out any positions you have. 

As per my other post, if you don’t know what tapering is then you need to get up to speed **fast**, as it’ll define the USD for many, many months to come.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, August 27, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 27, 2021**

Stocks shook off yesterday’s jitteriness and powered higher, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday highs while the treasury yield fell as market participants considered a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, vastly outperformed on the day, rising roughly 3% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) remains slightly below record-levels. 

Today, Powell gave his annual Jackson Hole speech, which provided a fuller picture on what his thinking is regarding the pace of economic recovery and inflation in light of the recent threats by the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant. Despite some comments by more hawkish Fed members that favor tapering the pace of quantitative easing (QE) sooner-rather-than-later, Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.”

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”

Regarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated his view that current inflationary pressures are transitory and broadly due to pandemic-induced factors but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, “Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.”

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy

* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said.

* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers. In my humble opinion, even being backed by Amazon, this valuation is insane.
* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apple’s ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.

I won't be depositing much money, I'm only working part time right now. And I probably won't be spending much either. So I'm not really worried about high cash-back rates on a checking account. For the most part I just want an account that's safe, simple to use, and (if possible) has no fees.

One feature that would be nice is an easy way to put money aside and save, ideally with a way to easily transfer from checking to some sort of savings. One Finance has a cool auto-save feature like this, so I'm considering them. A decent interest rate on the savings would be nice as well.

I'm not too worried about easy ATM access, I shouldn't need cash often.

I've also looked into Discover Cashback Debit, Chime, Axos Rewards Checking, Ally, and a few others. So basically I'm wide open right now. I'd love for someone to make a convincing argument for one of them.

I know some people recommend using credit cards for basically all your spending and using your checking account just to pay off those cards. If I should go that route, let me know.

Thanks in advance for your help, let me know if there's anything else you need to know to help me decide.",finance

personalfinance,auto loan refinance question,"I currently have a 2020 F-150 XL financed through Ally at a 9.4% interest rate.  I owe approximately 40K  left on the truck, I've made 8 payments on it of 780 a month.  I just came out of bankruptcy last July and am looking to refinance.  I qualify through Capitalone at the same remaining payments and dropping my monthly payment to 710$ with a 5.4% interest rate, or keeping the payment similar and cutting the loan to 61 months from 67.

I have just have a couple of questions and need advice.

1. Is this is a good enough drop in interest rate to refinance.  I want to choose the drop the payment to 710 option and keep 67 payments, becuase the extra money would be helpful.  My wife's vehicle is getting up in miles and may need to be replaced.

The truck is currently worth what KBB says the value of the truck is, 40K.  Is GAP worth it in this instance.  I currently have it with my original loan but would lose it in the refinance.

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin is the first geopolitically self-sovereign asset on earth?,"Realestate is tied to the country it is located in.

Stocks and securities are tied to the country their exchange is located in.

Bonds are tied to the issuing government of the country that issues them.

Gold is tied to the country where the vault you store it in is located.

Cash is tied to the monetary policy of the country that issued it.

There is no other asset on earth that exists completely outside the control of all countries governments while simultaneously being able to be stored in multiple jurisdictions all over the world at once and is able to be moved instantly all over the world in seconds.

This makes bitcoin arguably the best form of property on earth inherently upholding the strongest form of property rights while being the one asset with the least geopolitical risk on earth.

CryptoCurrency,Inflation and the Importance of Crypto,"Every day, we see another news story about rising inflation in the US (1). Inflation is at rates not seen in 30 years (2). It’s obvious to anyone living in the US and paying attention that prices are going up. Anecdotally, it seems to me that the prices of things like groceries and rent are increasing higher than the reported numbers. Others within the FED seem to agree that inflation is not being treated seriously enough (3). By holding fiat, you are guaranteed to lose money. The value you lose contributes to low interest rates that big banks and corporations are able to take advantage of to get cheap money (4). This monetary policy results in a redistribution of wealth from the common person to these organizations.

Here is where crypto comes in. The dollar is traditionally a bastion of safety and a good place to keep money (5). But with the high inflation rates we are seeing today, holding the dollar means losing money, possibly more than is being officially reported. To hedge against inflation, you have several options including stocks, real estate (if you are able to save enough for a down payment on an asset whose price has been inflated), and foreign currencies (6). However, inflation is a problem that is not limited to the US (7). Crypto is a relatively new kind of asset that allows for decentralized finance and free movement of money (8). It allows people to chose what sort of asset they use to exchange goods, store value, and invest in hopes of future returns.

As evidenced by ongoing inflation, US monetary policy has the interests of large organizations at heart, not the common person. By using crypto, people are better able to hedge against inflation. With increasing inflation and no signs of any immediate slow down in inflation, it is more important than ever to hold crypto in order to help secure you finances.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Inflation is making it more important than ever to diversify and take control of your own finances, which you can do with crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDRDR: Inflation bad, crypto good.

Seems today we’ve gotten about half the normal crowd back**

Welcome to another great tale of this day in crypto history, August 26!  Here we review some of the interesting facts and figures in the storied history of crypto on this date in previous years!

**August 26th 2011**. The polish bitomat.pl. exchange collapses, causing a loss of **17,000** BTC.   **F!**

**August 26th 2012** Bitcoin goes for an astounding $10.02.  “It’ll never catch on!” Says the 6000 or so people who have heard of it.

**August 26th 2013** University of Memphis law Review publishes “I’ve got 988 problems, but Bitcoin ain’t one.”

An interesting read if you have the time:

https://www.memphis.edu/law/documents/johnsonpub3.pdf

Also: Bitcoin advocates meet with a handful of federal agencies to discuss how it might be regulated.  Haha…

yeah…

**August 26th 2014**

Daily forex advises shorting bitcoin if it falls to $481.

**LOLLLL**

The VERY FIRST Bitcoin ATM is housed in Manhattan which converts cash to BTC, but not the other way.  Seems like that was probably the way to go!

“Cannabis Road” closes, an online marketplace for well… cannabis products, after 2000 BTC were “hacked.”  Perhaps we would call this a *DRUG* Pull?  🥸

Eastern District Court of Texas holds that Bitcoins are Securities.  More secure than the dollar, right fellas? Wink wink nudge nudge.

Canadian Online Retail Giant Newegg announces it will begin accepting Bitcoin as payment! Adoption baby! 

Speaking of Canada, shout out to my favorite Canadian u/amandamichelle90, an extremely early adopter of BTC. By the way, check out some of her posts and charts  people, she does some real work for this community!

**August 26, 2015**

Ethereum Bubble? Ethereum runs at a whopping $1.08 Boy oh boy, what a speculative fervor!

Hey, you know that worthless joke currency Doge? The one that will never be worth anything? Yeah, some fools are paying  **.000136** for it.  Ha! Like anyone will ever want *that*

And hey, check out this neato article with old-timey-ish cartoons about Consensys.  They mention this weird Smart Contract nonsense.  Better not tell that Hoskinson guy, he might try and come out with one or two.

Bitcoin,Earning interest on bitcoin,"I am very new to bitcoin. Bought on etoro about a month or so ago. I intend to hold what I have bought long term. I have seem people talking about and have been advertised sights where I can earn interest on my investment. This seems like a good idea obviously as I am holding for a long time with no intention to selling anytime soon, so why not earn some passive income in the meantime and build my bitcoin. I did some research and saw that hodlnaught had the best interest rates but other sights like nexo keep popping up on my feed aswell. I was hoping I could get some insight from some of the more experienced holders here. I am a bit apprehensive to move my bitcoin from etoro to another place as I thought there seemed safe and was worried about these other sights getting hacked or whatnot(I saw coinbase had some troubles) how safe are these alternatives? How secure is my bitcoin? Is the transaction moving from etoro safe? I assume I'm not gonna have to do something as retarded as sell my bitcoin on there and then rebuy on a different sight. Saw that there was a process for not doing this but simply transferring it across.   I realise that I definitely come across as very naive but would really appreciate any help I can get in this matter. 

TLDR: where to get best interest rates? Is it safe? 

Thanks guys",cryptocurrency
gaming,Unpopular Opinion : GameShark was pretty dope,"So when I was much younger, I always looked for cheat codes online and even walkthroughs. But one game I got so fed up with was Mega Man Zero 2. There was this huge snake mini boss that I could never beat. When I was looking for cheat codes online I kept coming across like actual codes and thought ""wtf, my gameboy doesn't have a keyboard, what is this?"" Then I remember going to Wal-Mart and asking what Action Replay was and the guy explaining was ecstatic and even used his employee discount for me. Then he had to explain how to put codes into the damn thing. I FINALLY beat the giant snake boss, got my sweet ability from the actual boss and well, the rest is history. 

Every time I had a really hard time with a game, I would take out the GameShark, look up codes, do the thing, and then used it to help me keep the game going. I know it was cheating, but as an 11 year old with no older bros to help with the hard parts, I had to get help somehow. 

Anyone else have any sweet memories with cheat devices?",technology
personalfinance,View on paying off student loans or investing for a house in a few years?,"So basically I’m looking to see if I should invest my 40k I have saved in cash (liquid in a bank account) or pay off my student loans (23k with 7.625 interest rate). If I pay it in full I save around 7.5 K. I have around 700 credit score and had zero credit really getting out of college (was around 540 before). 

Other assets are just an old 401k I need to roll over with about 15 k in it and a Roth IRA with 20k. 

I make roughly 105k a year before tax and 70 K after tax. California taxes are pretty high so not too happy about that. 

Probably make around 5.8 k a month to 6.2 k ( work in tech sales and varies). 

Main expenses are renting a house. Pay 1450 a month (shared rent). Student loan=353 a month (also 155 a month in accrued interest). Phone= 85. Internet=45. Food a month is nearing around 500. And 500 with various other bills and random expenses. Got rid of car since working in pandemic so no car costs or insurance.  After all is said and I Done I should have 3200 if I’m frugal. 

Question is should I invest towards a brokerage firm or just pay it off outright and just bite the bullet. Thinking about talking with an advisor with Schwab or Fidelity. I was looking at roboadisors too. 

My main thing is that I don’t want to rent because just feels like I’m throwing money away to a landlord and rather buy my own house. 

I realize it’s a couple years away ( want to buy a house and put twenty percent down) houses I’m looking at would probably be 650-700 k adjusting with inflation.

personalfinance,Buying a used vehicle right before moving states?,"Let me start of by saying I didn’t know the best place to post this kind of specific question. I [21M] currently live in south Texas and am planning on moving to Colorado within the next year or so. I have a RWD Ram 1500 Lonestar that I am still making payments on. The loan for the truck has my mother as the primary owner and me as the secondary owner (I make all the payments). I did this to have as low of a interest rate as possible. That being said I am wanting to trade the truck in right before moving for a few different reasons. 1, it’s RWD and I don’t think it’ll sell very well in Colorado. 2, with my mother as the primary owner I believe she would have to be there for any transaction involving the truck (she lives in Texas).

gaming,Does This Annoy Anyone Else? (Betas),"I'm so disgusted and annoyed that the trend of using a beta as a selling point seems to have yet again started to become the norm. 

When I see ads or videos for a game that say ""Pre-Order now for beta access"" I want to slap the publishers so hard. 

A beta is a testing phase. You, the developer/ publisher, should be kissing our feet to help bug and stress test your game for you and we even do it for FREE. 

Reality? They expect us, the consumer, to PAY to access a beta (Pre-Ordering), to use OUR time to test and Q&amp;A their game for free. They think they are doing us a favour or giving us a privilege to do free work for them? WTH are they thinking? 

It seriously makes angry that they even had the nerve to switch a beta from ""community input"" to ""consumer privilege"".

personalfinance,Paying taxes on a Backdoor Roth IRA,"Hello all, 

Here's my situation. Earlier this year I accidentally made a 6k contribution to my Roth IRA, forgetting that I was about to get a big salary increase in the middle of the year and thus would be ineligible for Roth IRA contribution. So to fix my mistake, I recharacterized the 6k from Roth IRA to a traditional IRA. When I looked in my traditional IRA account, it actually had \~6250, which I think the extra 250 is the gains. So I took all 6250 and rolled it back into my Roth IRA. On vanguard, I clicked the box ""I elect not to have federal and state income taxes withheld from the distribution. I understand I am responsible for paying any taxes due, and that if my estimated tax payments are insufficient, I may incur penalties."" 

So my question is, 1) Do I just owe tax on the $250, or do I owe tax on $6250? and 2) How and when do I pay that tax, do I wait until April of next year when I file my 2021 taxes? Do I pay it now? Thanks all!",finance
Bitcoin,Cash out refi loan to build my stack,"With the housing markets up so much, I have heard people talk about refinancing their home. Then with the equity getting cash to purchase Bitcoin. 

The way it was explained to me was with rates being so low and with the dollar devaluing it makes a lot of sense. Interest rates are lower than the rate of inflation so your cash is going to be worth less later than what you get now. So why not use your equity and throw it at Bitcoin. 

You would have to have a strong conviction for Bitcoin and enough extra cash flow for the additional payment. I just think it could pay off big in the long run. 

In my situation I don’t have a house but a newer automobile that’s paid off. I heard some places offer equity loans on cars so it just made me think. Especially with the market for used cars right now. It’s worth more than what I bought it for two years ago. Not sure of the rates but worse comes to worse maybe I’ll just sell it and get something about half the price and throw the difference in.

CryptoCurrency,What happened to MapleCoin? - A deep dive,"I know the hype about a coin backed by maple syrup is exciting, but let's look at the facts behind this privacy coin. 

**What is MapleCoin?** 
MapleCoin (henceforth known as MAP) is a ""a new anonymous cryptocurrency based on Cryptonote technology, that uses one-time Addresses for untraceable and unlikable transactions."" This coin differentiates itself from: Maple.Finance, a DeFi Lender and MarcoPolo Protocol, a protocol solution for connecting ecosystems. 

preface: 
Interestingly, there are two different twitter's for MAP, @Maple_Coin and @MapleCoin2014. Both have nearly identical logos, bear the same name, and refer to the coin as ""MapleCoin,"" respectively. Therefore, they will be deemed as the same entity. Furthermore this LinkedIn page, https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maplecoin, confirms the suggestion– the location is based in Canada and promises no KYC P2P transactions– similar to what is described in the @Maple_Coin twitter biography. 

Let's get in:
MAP prides itself on every coin being backed by a fixed unit of real maple syrup: ""Thus we have created this MapleCoin National Syrup Reserve and set a permanent fixed exchange rate of one MapleCoin to one milliliter of Maple Syrup."" This immediately sets off red flags as the Canadian maple syrup industry is largely run by mafia like groups who control Canada's maple reserves. (You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Quebec_Maple_Syrup_Producers) on this group– any more description is unwarranted.) The ""Maple Mafia"" has access to countless reserves filled with maple syrup, some in locations unknown. If this group has any ties to this project we could see distrust in the community and a failure of adoption. 

One quote from the creator's states: ""We will deal in only the finest grade **Federation** Syrup.""  Federation syrup is just maple syrup, but clearly those behind it know what is up. This federation the refer to is the Maple Mafia, the controllers of almost all of Canada's maple supply. another quote goes as: ""Our Reserve is modeled on and located in the same city as the world famous International Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve, and we have direct physical access to that facility."" Surely, they can't be colluding? 

Let's go back to what MAP claims to actually be about then, ""a new **anonymous** cryptocurrency based on Cryptonote technology, that uses **one-time Addresses for untraceable and unlikable transactions**."" Surely a privacy coin that can almost be assured to have mafia hands on is horrible optics. The company that has obvious knowledge on the maple market. 

Lastly, MAP hasn't been active since 2018. I haven't found any details that point elsewhere. All their accounts on every platform and website have been deleted, expect for the short amount of tweets up on twitter. Their last post indicated a hopeful listing on coinpulse.io but now redirects to bitcoinera.io, it seems the listing never happened. Interestingly in 2018 there was a reported maple shortage, right when all their accounts went dark. 

What's interesting is MAP is claimed to be working in 2014 as the digital currency of Canada, yet it's creator is entirely unknown and the project just went dark. The @MapleCoin2014 twitter account ceased tweets in 2014 and the @Maple_Coin account ceased tweeting in 2018. 

Just know i am stupid as fuck. 
Good bye.

Shorts and Longs continue to fight while the $50K BTC level remains the next breaking point for a short to Long term bull market.

It's a massive fight between bulls and bears, and with the amount of current and looming market chaos, Crypto markets are proving their worth as an option of stability.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the market, while projects like ADA, Litecoin, Monero, Nano, and Algo continue to challenge the status Quo.

Let's go...

Newly covered today:

1. Cardano competitor Ethereum suffered a consensus bug today (Aug 27) that impacted 54% of nodes. Apparently they were able to upgrade the version of Geth being run by a majority of the pools in time to head off a majority supported fork to the bad chain. But, the go ethereum developer in the link described it as “a really close shave”.

2. IOHK has initiated the testnet fork (Aug 27)! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1431286232278085634](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1431286232278085634)
3. The “go/no-go” meeting was today (Aug 27) on initiating the Alonzo hardfork combinator event for the 12th. The result was a “go”! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1431286232278085634](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1431286232278085634)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/)

5. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities. Bucket shops have been around for 150 years and illegal for 100 years. It turns out that you can’t do it in crypto either. [https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420) [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1418961999539712006)
6. Check out this new video of the World Mobile Team on the ground in Zanzibar. Doesn’t this feel like a better mission for our ecosystem than DeFi? [https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1419051567878221828](https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1419051567878221828)

11. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

13. More pressure for Crypto regulation is coming to bear today in the U.S. This time it comes in the form of a letter from Senator Elizabethe Warren to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (in her position as Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council which brings together 10 different financial regulators including the SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve). The letter was sent after a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?” [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/elizabeth-warren-presses-yellen-financial-regulator-to-manage-crypto.html)
14. Stephen Wolfram does the first NFT liveminting event where he creates NFTs of cellular automata from the computational universe while live on stream. The first two created were “Crashing Waves” and “Down Arrows”. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1420087229104283656](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1420087229104283656)

18. Reports are coming in that the new bipartisan Infrastructure Bill contains new provisions that might require a whole host of actors within crypto ecosystems like Cardano to report transactions over $10k. [https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-tax](https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes) [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853)
19. But this bill is an even bigger deal. If passed as-is, we can probably say RIP to the Wild West Era of crypto (2009-2021). [https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307)

21. John O’Connor was on SkyNews discussing the Ethiopian Ministry of Education project! He stressed that this was not a profit center for IOHK, and had a chance to refute the “crypto colonialism” strain of thought. [https://vimeo.com/581137605](https://vimeo.com/581137605)

32. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

34. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano. [https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator](https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator)
35. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

37. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment! [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577) [https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912)

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers. [https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513](https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513)

personalfinance,Inherited debt from a deceased parent-help!,"My mom passed away in 2019 and, for better or worse, left me with 4 mortgages (three 1st mortgages and 1 HELPC) The homes are rentals that generate income, however the interests rates are on each are somewhat high, with the HELOC being the worst of the lot.  
I have been declined for a refi twice now for a variety of reasons. (I was trying to refinance the HELOC along with the 1st mortgage on the same property). 
The HELOC is for 50k, and my monthly payment on it is $333. I throw an extra $50 at it and pay $383/mo. The rate on this is just shy of 7.0% so even though I pay over the minimum payment I’ve hardly made a dent in it after 2 years of monthly payments. 

My question is this: I have about $140k in cash saved which I planned on using as a down payment for my own home. I hate the idea of using such a substantial chunk of my savings (50k) to pay of the HELOC, but because of the high interest rate I am having a hard time paying it down. 

Any tips or tricks? Pay off the big HELOC debt and lose my down payment, or keep making the monthly payments? Other options?",finance

It's ability to behave like an actual currency that you can transact with as-well, is a major contributor.

I have been with them for 9 years but I’m ready to drop them. I am so sick and tired of being barred from online/mobile banking services because they refuse fo connect with Plaid. Literally everyone uses Plaid now. PNC got big mad that they used their logo in the search feature apparently and sued them, and now PNC users are shit out of luck when it comes to linking their accounts. And they don’t even provide official documentation about it. A quick Google search of “PNC and Plaid” shows this has been a major customer complaint for a long time, and they can’t even put out a statement? Just a misleading “help” page that says to add a mobile number, but failing to mention that the connection will still fail 99% of the time even with an access token provided. 

Phew. Sorry, it’s been pissing me off for months lol. Anyway, I’m a little intimidated by finding a new checking account. Any suggestions? My online desires are having a good mobile app and being able to be linked to third party services.

personalfinance,What are the risks of buying an overpriced home right now?,"I bought my first home in 2017 as a fixer-upper. I spent about 50k modernizing it and about 2 years of my time.

I sold the home last September at a profit when people were desperate to leave cities and buy rural properties and find a better place to live.

Since then I've been living at my in-laws with my wife and daughter waiting for the market to cool down a bit. The inventory of houses has been getting better, but not the prices. The average sell price in our area is around 450k compared to 300k a year earlier.

Interest rates are low and I can afford a house up to 600k, but I'm nervous taking out that much money. Do I run the risk of buying a house at an expensive price at a low interest rate, or if I have to move in the future will I be stuck if the market normalizes? What other risks come with buying an expensive house? I doubt waiting will put me in a much better situation either. Am I missing something?",finance

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html)**
*****
&gt; With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
&gt; Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
&gt; # Jobs are the focal point
*****
&gt; Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
&gt; “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
&gt; The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
&gt; # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
&gt; “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
&gt; Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
&gt; Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.
*****
&gt; “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
&gt; # Market risks
*****
&gt; State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
&gt; “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
&gt; Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
&gt; The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
&gt; “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
&gt; He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
&gt; There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Watching Ida
*****
&gt; The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

&gt; # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

&gt; In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg))**

&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

&gt; # Small-Caps Bounce

&gt; ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/indices0827.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWC.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png))**

&gt; Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png))**

&gt; Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

&gt; # 6 Charts on Stocks Making New All-Time Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&amp;P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”

&gt; As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

&gt; Another interesting stat about S&amp;P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&amp;P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&amp;P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&amp;P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

&gt; # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

&gt; It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

&gt; Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png))**

&gt; The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png))**

&gt; Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

&gt; # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

&gt;As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-II-Bull.png))**

&gt; Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082621-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

CryptoCurrency,Lower and lower interest rates paid by blockfi,"I’ve used blockfi for about a year now and have recommended many of my friends to do so with extra crypto they don’t mind holding on an exchange. But since I’ve joined month after month is feels like interest rates keep getting lowered more and more. This latest September interest rate change almost makes it look like rates have increased. Until you realize that above 0.1 bitcoin is considered tier 2 now as well as only 1.5 eth. Tier 2 now only offers 1 % and 1.5 % APR 

First question:
Does anyone have any suggestions for platforms similar in nature that they trust?

Second concern:
The network has fees on Ethereum are so damn high to move it to another platform (granted I found one I’m interested in) a significant reduction in annual return would be eaten up just by the fee of moving it.

I don’t mean to complain because any interest in crypto holdings is a neat concept but these new thresholds for what is concerned tier 1, 2, and 3 are saddening. I have a decent chunk of ethereum staked but I liked the ease of use of blockfi so that granted prices ever explode to a place I would consider taking some off the table, I could do so with the click of a button and just the hold the newly traded stable coin on their platform gaining further interest being paid in bitcoin.

personalfinance,Auto-refi then personal loan or one larger personal loan?,"I've tried searching and can't seem to find a similar scenario to mine. This is about auto-refi and taking a concurrent personal loan due to an extenuating circumstance. Unfortunately, I purchased a used 2016 ford fusion and just after the extended warranty ended I find out it needs a new turbo engine for $8100 due to a manufacturer's defect and Ford refuses to issue a recall/assistance (there's a mass action lawsuit being organized). Anyway, my current financing has me owing 9k at 14.5%. At the time I took the loan I had no credit history and score was barely in the 600's. Now my fico8 is 740 w/100% on-time payments. I'm also making about 7k more. My debt to income ratio as it stands now, I believe, is just below 35%. Should I refi the car to shrink my DIR first in order to secure a personal loan @ lower interest for the engine replacement? Or will a refinance hurt my chances at securing the personal loan right away? I've never had a credit card and have a limited credit mix. Alternatively, should I consolidate it all in a 5 year personal loan in order to get the title and own the vehicle with an interest rate that should be significantly lower than the auto refinance rate of 14.5%. Keep in mind that I do want the car back now and have shopped for used cars and don't see that as being an option compared to my vehicle with a brand new engine and warranty on parts/service. Could really use the experience of the PF community on this one, thanks!",finance
economy,It all makes sense now (just had an epiphany),"Ok... so step 1 is ""create a fuckton of money that you sterilize from being ""in the (real) economy"".  Step 2 is create inflation well above the artificially low ""risk free rate of return"" interest rate.  Step 3 is to simply wait for the differential between those two numbers to seep into the real economy.  Step 4/Tweak 1 involves juicing inflation, if it drops below 2%, via direct government transfers of some of the debt directly into the wallets of the real economy.  

With enough area (time) under those curves, the debt created is both inflated away and/or becomes the ""new normal"".  

The sub single digit risk free rate of return combined with high single digit/low double digit inflation is here to stay for at least a medium double digit number of years.

personalfinance,Opinions on buying a new car?,"Hello,

I'm 19 years old with the following financials:

Salary (gross): $75k/year ($6250/month)

Salary (net): \~$55k/year ($4582/month)

Credit score: 730

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: $16.5k 

Roth IRA: $1200

&amp;#x200B;

I put away 15% minimum into savings each month and will be maxing out my 401(k) contributions soon along with a cash dump into my Roth IRA at the end of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the situation:

My current car is a bit old (90s) and runs well but shit is starting to fall apart (lol) so I'm thinking about getting a new car next year. 

The new car would cost about $25k and I'm planning on putting 50% down and financing the rest with a 36 month loan. My interest rate would probably be around 3%. Insurance on the new car would be $230/month which I got directly from my insurance company. 

I don't have much expenses currently other than car insurance ($70), partial rent ($600),  and miscellaneous stuff (\~$400) which adds up to \~$1000/month. If I moved out (which I'm hoping to do), rent alone would be \~$1200/month.

With tax &amp; insurance, my monthly payment is $1156.  My ratio of principal to interest at the moment is something like $375 to $550.  

For the past year, I’ve been watching interest rates, and they’re at the point now where going to a 20-year loan at 2.75% gives me a slightly higher monthly payment of $1212.  This would take 5 years off my current loan, and drastically shift my principal/interest ratio.  First payment would be roughly $570 in principal and $415 in interest.  This is all using a refi service that does zero-closing cost refi’s, with the closing costs NOT inserted into the loan.  I used them for the initial purchase and the subsequent refi in 2016.

personalfinance,"The IRS misidentified, is claiming I made way more than I did, and now I owe. What do I do??","I don't frequent this place much so I'm sorry if I'm doing something wrong.  Let me know.

I got a letter from the IRS yesterday saying I owe a not insignificant sum of money for my federal income taxes for 2020.  I completed my H&amp;R block taxes and they said I should expect close to $2,000 as a return.  I went to the IRS website and on there it says:

* The Social Security number of one or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent was missing or incomplete.
* The last name of one or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent does not match our records.
* One or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent exceeds the age limit.
* Your adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 if married filing jointly, $112,500 if head of household).
* The amount was computed incorrectly

This is all wrong, and I made significantly lower than 75k (much less 150k) and have a single income family.  The only person that could ""exceed the age limit"" is my kid who's under 10 years old.  I did double check my form and the names and SSNs of all people are correct.

Obviously I'm a bit floored.  I know I can get ahold of both HRBlock and the IRS, but I was wondering if there's anything I should know/do before or during those interactions.

CryptoCurrency,Let's talk about Exit Strategies and Profit Taking!,"**Introduction:**

* Having experienced how deceitful, insanely volatile and punishing a full blown crypto Bear market can be back in 2018, I'll be the first to tell you how vital a planned Exit strategy is in order to **maximize profit and minimize losses**. So let's dive in.
* Many, including myself, believe we follow the lengthening 4 year cycle with a current bull market, where we for example will see a 2nd top in late 2021, or most likely early-mid 2022 before a probably Bear market.
* A ""Black swan event"" beforehand, such as stock-market crash, increased interest rates or the dreaded Infrastructure bill smashing the stable coins can incite a sudden bear market.
* Not taking profits, trying to time the top (spoiler: you will not), being to greedy or too attached to your investment (echo chambers) are the most common, and yet severe mistake us rookies do.
* The charts will not go up in a straight line forever, and  **there will come a time somewhere in the future where we go downwards before going up again.**
* The goal should in most cases be to have a predetermined Step-by-Step Strategy, that you can live with yourself should it go further than you expected, crash more/before you expected.
* If you can **sell high and buy in lowe**r, you increase your position and gains. **More Sats, baby!**

# When you invest, you should already have decided what you want:

1. What is your realistic price target/expected top? Is it in % gain, or is it a $ or Sats your goal?
2. How much gain will satisfy you? How much loss can you take before you close the position/admit your mistake?
3. Which do you consider high or low risk?
4. Which are your short term holds? Which are long term holds?
5. Are you taking profits from Alts into BTC? Crypto into gold/metals, stocks or FIAT?
6. How do you want your portfolio to look like once the bear market happens? 20% BTC, 10% ETH and rest FIAT? 50% gold and 50% stabile coins?
7. When do you **Enter again** for the next cycle?

# Thoughts on strategy:

* Many start by taking out their initial investment as a start, but this typically leads to more riskier and often bad decisions with the rest of your crypto trying to time the top.
* Many investors will keep 5-10% of their holdings, just in case of a bigger up-cycle or because they firmly believe in the project.
* By DCA (dollar-cost averaging) OUT you will most likely ""time"" the top better than you ever would trying to find the peak
* Hence, most ""expert"" investors recommend the predetermined step-by-step plan, for when and how much profits you are going to take.
* This is typically done with limit/stop orders that is set beforehand, as the market progresses.

# And make the ""profit taking road"" ready!

1. When the time comes, make sure to have your assets on the exchange or wallet needed to take profit. Have in mind many exchanges will ""crash"" when we get to the top!
2. Do you have enough gas in your e.g. BTC, ETH or BNB etc. account to cover potential insane Tx/swap fees of the thousands or millions trying to use the network?
3. Does your bank approve FIAT deposits from your exchange?
4. Have you calculated the tax implications?

# As an example, here is my current Exit Strategy for BTC (this is getting long, so simplified):

* I believe might see a BTC peak $150 - 200k, then a drop potentially back to 60k.
* My upside trigger of limit orders will be when BTC is closing in on $90k.

1. 20% sell at 88 k
2. 20% at 98 k
3. 10% at 108 k
4. 10% at  118 k
5. 10% at 128 k
6. 10% at 138 k
7. 10% at 148 k
8. 10% to try to time the peak or HODL in cause of crazy upcycle (not decided).

* My downside of stop loss from a unexpected ""early"" peak/downtrend:

1. If BTC - 25% from presumed peak,  35%
2. If BTC - 50%, sell rest of assets but leaving 10% of BTC.

* I will buy/DCA on the way down again, hopefully increase my BTC position by &gt;2 times.

# Closing:

* I'd love constructive feedback on my strategy, and by any means feel free to share your BTC or ALT-coin Exit Strategy! Hopefully we can inspire some of the new Redditors, and all learn something new.

**EDIT 1:**

* I did not expect all these downvotes. I'd like to explain why ""forever HODL"" might not be the smartest thing. Back in 2018-2019 I had the same mentality as many of you ""**NEVER SELL, ILL HODL UNTIL I DONT HAVE TO SELL""**... and sat and watched **my portfolio decline with 90-95% of its peak value**. I still have **not forgiven myself** (it's horrible) for not having an Exit Plan. I could have EASY 2-3 x my current positions and now gains! You want MORE crypto? This is the way.

**Edit 2:**

* I'm still looking for inspiration to modify my strategy by going through the comments. No one have a profit taking strategy for BTC, ETH or Alts? Come on guys!

CryptoMarkets,"According to reports, the SEC has hired a blockchain analytics firm to keep an eye on the DeFi business","According to reports, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has inked a $125,000 agreement with blockchain analytics startup AnChain. Artificial intelligence will be used to monitor and control the decentralized finance industry. MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave, and Xfinite are just a few of the major platforms.

An [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI) business representative confirmed the deal with the federal regulator to Forbes on Friday, adding the SEC and blockchain startup have the opportunity to sign up to five separate one-year contracts for $125,000 each, for a total of $625,000. According to reports, the first contract began in May.

“The SEC is extremely interested in learning more about what is going on in the area of smart contract-based digital assets,” said Victor Fang, CEO, and co-founder of [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI). “We're giving them technologies to evaluate and track smart contracts,” says the company.

Following SEC chair Gary Gensler's call for decentralized finance, or DeFi, initiatives to register with the agency, saying they are ""decentralized in some respects but extremely centralized in others,"" the government body and the blockchain business have reportedly reached an agreement. According to Gensler, DeFi platform developers and others may create a centralized team that falls under the SEC's regulatory umbrella. The SEC recently stated that it has filed an enforcement action in the first case involving securities employing DeFi technology.

The sector has a market value of more over $126 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Uniswap is the biggest decentralized exchange by volume, with over $1 billion in DeFi tokens moved in the previous 24 hours; its UNI token is also the most valuable, with a market valuation of $14.2 billion.

vet,4-5 month kitten urinating and defecating outside litter box,"Hi my girlfriend and I have rescued a 4-5 month kitten named Meredith that we have had for almost 3 months. She lives with 2 other adult cats. One is 3 year old female and the other is a 9 year old male. Both spayed/neutered. Meredith gets along with both cats extremely well and plays with both often. The two adult cats do have tension between each other. Meredith has gotten all of her shots and was just spayed 2 days ago. Our issue is that for about a month and a half she has been urinating in random spots. The front door mat, inside our roommates work bag, on our bed. After cleaning up the mess with a deodorizer, I fed her in the locations where she peed and this helped for awhile until last weekend we were out of town and when we came back we found a small pile of fecal matter behind a mirror. It was smaller poop so we figured it was her. Today, which is 2 days after she was spayed, we found some poop on our bedroom floor that she must have created overnight after sleeping in our bed with us. We have also found a fresh pee spot in our bathroom on the shower mat. The vets have given her a check up during her shots and I have asked them about the issue but they offer very little help. We have 3 litter boxes that are in the basement that are cleaned every day and are spread out.

Sorry about the long post and throw away, but I'm looking into purchasing a  home in December near the Bay Area (California) to start a family and  wanted to do my homework before going out and getting serious about  looking. Can't go anywhere else because family is located close by here.  I've been browsing Zillow for properties and their estimated monthly  payments, but I'm wondering if there's other pitfalls / fees I should be  worried about. I was wondering if you guys could help break down my  situation, if it's even feasible, or propose other budgets.

My situation:

* Early 30s, job is stable (remote work)
* \~70k a year before taxes (bi weekly pay 1.9k)
* Credit score is high 700s.
* 20k in savings (""emergency funds"")
* 40k in retirement (Roth iRA)
* 0 debt

My partner (unmarried):

* Early 30s, job is stable  (remote work)
* \~70k a year before taxes (bi weekly pay 1.7k)
* Credit score is high 700s.
* 40k in savings (""emergency funds"")
* 90k in retirement (401k)
* 0 debt

No kids -yet-.

I  have a total of 200k for a down payment ready on the side. I picked a  random property in Gilroy for 900k since I -think- that's the highest  I'm able to support. Zillow's estimated monthly payment is around 3.7k a  month (including property taxes + home insurance) with a down payment  of \~170k ish @ 20% with a 30 yr 2.7% fixed interest rate.

If  the monthly payment is accurate, that means at a combined take home pay  of \~7.2k a month would leave us with only \~1.7k take home pay for each  person. We live pretty frugally, so I think that allows us to be  somewhat comfortable. Anyways, with that said, is there any other fees I  might be missing? Should I rent out to someone while we live there make  this more feasible? Can I even afford this / pre approved for this?   Let me know all your thoughts and ideas! Thanks in advanced!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Edit -

So, quick recap about some of the suggestions, advice, and take away I've gotten from here:

* 900k with the plan to start a family is not a great idea on a combined income of 140k near the Bay Area
* Down payment of 200k doesn't really matter if you don't have the income to match
* Don't do this without marriage (note: I get how this sounds, but really it's on me since I've been lagging in that department)
* Be prepared for more than the down payment in terms of closing costs

I  mean, the overwhelming consensus is not to do it. Which leads me to  figure out what I can do to accomplish something like a home purchase:

* Kids are going to have to wait regardless (I do have family in the Bay Area to look after them to take away the day care costs)
* Get higher paying jobs somehow
* Maybe shoot for houses / condos / apartments in other areas @ the 600k -700k ranges
* Apply for BMR and hopefully that pans out?",finance

CryptoCurrency,The American Dream - George Carlin,"Notice how the school systems don't teach us financial education?  How the media constantly spreads FUD about crypto?  Inflation is supposed to be ""2-3%"" a year but arguably could be as high as 7% or more a year.  The purchasing power of the dollar keeps decreasing every year.  The cost of goods rises faster than wages.  Banks only give you 1-2% interest on savings accounts if that, and some banks in the world even have negative interest rates.  You're losing money just by having it in a bank account.  With all that being said, the system was designed to keep the general population uneducated and poor.

Life Is Worth Losing.  Performed on November 5th, 2005 at the Beacon Theater in New York City, New York.


""But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this, there’s a reason education SUCKS, and it’s the same reason it will never, ever, EVER be fixed.  It’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you’ve got.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: 

They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That's against their interests.

That's right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.

By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.

It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.""

 Does anyone know any DEFI projects that follows Compound's cToken exchange rate/interest rate method of yield aggregation?

Thank you!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,15 year vs 30 year home loan?,"We are looking to buy a house in a “not forever” location, but we are willing to hold/rent out if the market isn’t good for selling when we are ready to move. We have enough for a 20% down payment. We are seeing interest rates of 1.9% for a 15yr vs 2.2% for a 30yr. Doing the math, the 15 year loan can save us tens of thousands of dollars of interest over the life of the loan. If we can afford the monthly payments, what are the downsides? 

We are new to this process and trying to avoid any terrible mistakes!",finance
software,Any Defrag program suggestions? I'm fed up with waiting 30-40 minutes to analyze with O&amp;O defrag! (anyone come across that before?),"Windows 7, I know, outdated, but still works for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried Auslogics Disk Defrag, where they removed the optimize feature. 

I have the latest O&amp;O defrag, which I regularly use, It's totally fine on most of my drives (i have a few) where it will scan my 3 external drives (8TB 8TB and 5TB)  in about 2 minutes, which have over 4 million files on. 

But the drives I absolutely need to defrag, my game drives, they're 2 TB each, take over 40 minutes just to analyze (yes, i've checked the SMART status, nothing logged out of the ordinary or worrying, Yes i've contacted O&amp;O customer support, they where useless).  This never used to happen before and Auslogics can scan them in like 3 minutes, but O&amp;O defrag, forget about it, takes ages!! 

&amp;#x200B;

So are there any decent (free) Defrag programs out there??",technology

CryptoCurrency,Analysis of DEX Inflation Via Yield Farming Vs. Token Price,"# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

* Algo Supply
* Scheduled Supply
* Governed Supply

&amp;#x200B;

 

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.",cryptocurrency

MachineLearning,[D] Mini-batch and Batch 'mean gradient' term.,"In Batch Gradient descent, from what I am reading, is that for every sample it calculates the gradient of the loss with respects to the weights for one sample but does not update it. So effectively you need to store the gradient of the loss w.r.t the weights (imagine you had 1000+ weights) for each sample, and once the whole dataset is feed through, you get the average of all gradients and that is the 'mean gradient'. You use that mean gradient to update the weights, i.e. after 1 epoch.

For mini-batch, does the 'mean gradient' per batch mean the same thing, but instead of waiting for all gradients to be calculated for every sample, it gets all the gradients for the batch samples, and once the batch has been fed through it gets the mean of all those gradients and updates the weights with that 'mean gradient'?

Just need some clarification that I am thinking about this correctly",technology

35. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

37. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Crypto and alternative governance systems,"It is generally accepted in the crypto community that governments hate crypto 

Regardless of the type; they all seem to dislike it. From authoritarian communist China, oligarchs in Eastern Europe, kleptocratic Nigeria/ Afican nations and 'Democratic' USA/Europe 

Why are nearly all traditional and modern forms of political systems adverse to crypto adoption? 

To me the answer is that crypto offers an alternative governance mechanism that is outside the sphere of influence of centralised; including ""centralized democratic"" governance systems 

Ourselves here on this sub experiencing this alternative governance ourselves each day through Moons. We vote in governance polls on the rules and regulations of the sub. Including recently punishment for wrong doing. We have established:

1. Laws 
2. Internal Financial markets 
3. Defined borders 
4. A recognised international currency
5. A recognised and established population 

In a sense this sub is functioning more efficiently than most nations. More so in democratic resolutions  regarding the day to day affairs of the population. While in reality the most democratic nations are constantly gridlocked in ideological debates 

It's no wonder that Global Warming has failed to find a solution as it isn't in the hands of the majority. But self imposed authority or 'democratically elected' officials obsessed with power maintaince. If it had been put to a vote on the block chain with the funds of offending parties withheld. I assume there wouldn't even be a debate 

When you see headlines of "" China officials warn of crypto's financial risk"". It isn't the financial implications they fear but the political 

In China as in Venezuela, Sudan, Canda, UK and Russia the government ultimately governs through a monopoly on 

1. Wealth creation 
2. Violence 

Wealth creation being the traditional printing of federal currencies but more importantly the creation and maintenance of a property rights system. The government ultimately through its regulatory bodies decide who owns what and can sell/ buy what. On the block chain this level of regulation is not required as shown in NFTs; ownership is easily verified and protected by the block chain 

In China the use of governmental oversight in regards to property rights had even gone into reproductive rights. But to achieve this the government implemented its second tool, violence! 

If block chain is adopted by the Chinese population it could create an alternative to the governments monopoly on wealth creation. As a result they are using more violence to suppress it

""As every king ultimately hates God; for he can not exact his will upon him. But God his upon the king"" 

In the financial world, crypto has been undeniably proven to be divine 

As its consensus mechanism is the voice of the people 

And the voice of the people is the voice of god",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Ever gave someone crypto as a gift? I gave some ETH and BTC to my wife who wasn't sure whether she wants to invest or not,"It didn't really get her into crypto but I'm glad to know that she now owns a little bit herself and can see what's possible with it. I made her a Celsius account so we can both get that sweet referral bonus and bought some BTC and ETH for her while the previous promo codes were live which was a good entry point as she could see how much free crypto you can get just like that.

Since she probably won't fall in love with crypto as I did even after this I came to a different conclusion (I probably just talk about it too much and she's a bit fed up with that so I don't blame her haha). I'm DCAing each week and time to time invest in random alt for fun so now every time I would feel guilty for buying too much crypto, I'm simply gonna buy crypto for her send it to her Celsius. You can't feel bad about buying a gift for someone and you will always feel good when buying crypto. Especially when it's for your loved one! It will eventually pile up and after some time with all the collected interest, I will let her do whatever she wants with it. 

Happy HODLing everyone and consider giving someone you know a little bit of crypto, it might change their lives!",cryptocurrency

IMF tweeted this today just few days before El Salvador is about to make Bitcoin legal tender. They also linked to a blog warning countries that making cryptocurrency legal tender is a step too far.

[IMF blog](https://blogs.imf.org/2021/07/26/cryptoassets-as-national-currency-a-step-too-far/)

The blog says it will be bad because central banks will lose ability to set monetary policy and cross border activities will make it problematic to regulate. It contains usual energy FUD, money laundering and terrorism FUD.

IMF is also showing complete lack of understanding of how El Salvador is adopting BTC. BTC lightning network is used mainly as payment rail for remittance and cheap and instant payments. It will give the people there option to have a savings account on their phone because 70% of population is unbanked. Payments can be instantly converted to USD or kept as BTC so price volatility is non issue.

Saying that Bitcoin is privately issued is the easiest way to make it clear from your first words that you have no idea what you're even talking about. 😂",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"How stable are stablecoins? And the largest stablecoin controversy, explained.","**What is a stablecoin?**

USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, PAX are examples of stablecoins. These digital currencies, which are pegged to other assets such as the US dollar or the Euro, are primarily used as payment mechanisms. The idea is that the peg makes them less volatile. Typically, when someone sets up a stablecoin, there’s a reserve for the assets, which are held as collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

**What** **do people use stablecoin for?**

First, for payments. Most of the time, the fees they charge for transactions are relatively low. Tether’s fees are usually less than a dollar, while out-of-network ATM fees are about $3.08. The same is true of USDC, another stablecoin.

Second, as a place to store value when investors exit cryptocurrency trades. If someone wants to lock in some profit he made in Bitcoin, he can convert it to stablecoins easily.

Third, it is used for margin trading. Stablecoins are helpful as a collateral for the loan borrowed from an exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**Big brother wants to regulate**

SEC chairman Gary Gensler has suggested that stablecoins might actually fall under the SEC’s authority. Specifically, he said that stablecoins *“also may be securities and investment companies. To the extent they are, we will apply the full investor protections of the Investment Company Act and the other federal securities laws to these products.”*

This has not happened yet, but the SEC want to get involved because stablecoins are huge. Tether, the largest stablecoin as of August 2021, has $67B in market capitalisation.

&amp;#x200B;

**History of Tether and where the first controversy began**

In 2014, it was originally called Realcoin. Its website stated: *“Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.”*

In February 2019, this text changed to: *“Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’).”*

The first controversy was to do with this “affiliated entities”. In 2014, Tether also announced a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In 2017, [the leak of the Paradise Papers](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464) established that the same people control both Bitfinex and Tether.

In 2019, [New York state Attorney General Letitia James said](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company), *“Our investigation has determined that the operators of the ‘Bitfinex’ trading platform, who also control the ‘tether’ virtual currency, have engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million dollars of co-mingled client and corporate funds.”* ***Tether’s lawyer admitted that Tether*** [***was only 74 percent backed***](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents).

The case was settled, which bars Tether from doing business with anyone in New York. Bitfinex and Tether did not admit wrongdoing but paid an $18 million fine. Tether must also provide quarterly reports on its reserves for the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

**To add insult to injury, the second controversy**

According to the most recent report, about 76 percent of Tether was backed by cash and cash equivalents, including unspecified commercial paper, which is a kind of short-term debt issued by companies.

Now, that is where the second controversy began. ***The “cash and cash equivalents” are composed of 4 percent cash; most of the rest of it is commercial paper***, which represents about half of Tether’s collateral, or [about $30 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a).

&amp;#x200B;

**Comparison with USDC and other stablecoins**

USDC is the second largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. USDC is backed by 61 percent in cash and cash equivalents and 9 percent commercial paper. Better than Tether, but USDC has its own issues. Coinbase had been [promising that there was $1 in a bank account backing each token](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/coinbase-drops-promise-of-token-s-cash-backing-that-wasn-t-true). The attestation showed that wasn’t true.

Of the top 10 stablecoins, the most transparent is Gemini, says Mizrach. It’s completely backed by dollars in FDIC-insured accounts. *“That’s the model of transparency,”* he says.

&amp;#x200B;

**1 USDT = 1 USD until it isn’t. What will happen if Tether goes belly up?**

For now, 1 USDT = 1 USD. Most people who own Tether bought it from someone else, and they’re probably not going to try to redeem it — they’re just going to sell it, instead.

In history, a lot of other stablecoins have failed! For instance, of all the stablecoins created in 2015, 80 percent failed, according to Mizrach’s research. And 25 percent of those created in 2018 also failed. That makes the failure rate of stablecoins comparable to other digital assets.

If people start to feel nervous, a lot will try to redeem Tether. As per Tether’s terms of service, the customer might not get his money back right away — or he might find himself holding some of the mysterious commercial paper Tether says it’s backed by instead of US dollars. Tether’s terms of service say that they can’t be held liable.

But according to Tether, there’s no need to worry. *“Tether has never refused a redemption to a customer — and stress-testing of Tether is not hypothetical,”* a Tether spokesperson said.

CryptoCurrency,"Yes, Bitcoin is a bubble","*Bitcoin is the first truly global bubble whose size and scope is limited only by the desire of the world’s citizenry to protect their savings from the vagaries of government economic mismanagement.*  
Hell, every kind of monetary good had been in some kind of bubble during its initial phase!  
 
Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe — a catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve.  

Owning bitcoins is one of the few asymmetric bets that people across the entire world can participate in.   
Much like a call option, an investor’s downside is limited to 1x, while their potential upside is still 100x or more.   


**Furthermore, one day hopefully global trade will be settled in a manner that satisfies Charles de Gaulle’s aspiration that no nation should have privilege over any other:**

stocks,Am I screwed?,"First of all a small rant, it really bugs me how people here state their opinions without disclosing their positions or their intent. So people will say ""there's a massive crash coming imminently"" and clearly they have a vested interest in that happening because of the plan they are pursuing. But they never say that, they just say there'll be a crash, not that their financial future depends on that happening.

Anyway rant over, now on to my question, am I screwed?

I have 80k of savings in various funds/stocks, investing since around November 2020. Currently the portfolio is up around 5%

In terms of distribution on the funds, it's probably around 40% USA, 20% China, and 40% rest of the world e.g Europe, Japan, UK. Mostly it's various managed funds and also some passive funds. And it's a mixture of large/small caps, different industries etc. Obviously hard to avoid a lot of overlap with the big American stocks which seem to appear in lots of different funds.

So here it is. I know nothing about investing, everyone here seems to know everything about fancy graphs and ratios and special magical historical metrics and so on. And now I'm terrified because everyone is constantly talking every day about how Chinese stocks are totally worthless and not even real, and the whole American market is going to crash any day now, and I'm just totally freaking out.

Should I just sell everything now? But then everyone will say, aha but what inflation!?

personalfinance,Joint mortgage account with partner,"**back story** 
Me and my partner were together for little under a year and I thought she was the one, so we started looking for a house to buy during lockdown. I was the one that put down the deposit and paid all the fees from my savings. 
After 8 (covid) months of trying to get everything in place, we finally moved into out new home, and everything was going great. We've been in the house little over 4 months at this point,and We've split up. Im staying in the house and she has gone her separate way. As things stand now, I'm paying the mortgage and she's not, but her name is still on the house and she isn't putting anything to it.

One of the reasons it took us so long to get a mortgage in the first place was because she's got a bad credit score and so have I, mine was due to not having a credit card or anything of the type. 
Our mortgage is slightly higher than average because of this. 
Out mortgage advisor put us on a 3 year fixed plan on a higher interest rate. 

So my 2 questions come down to this: 

In 3 years time, what are the possibilities of me remortgaging in just my name and it being somewhat affordable? 

And if she's still 'on the books' for the house for the next 3 years but not paying towards it, in the 3 years time, can she force me to sell? My thought here is to write up a contract stating that she's not got any financial interest in the house(something on those lines)

personalfinance,CC debt/finding a way out,"Been reading this sub and trying to take responsibility of my financial situation. I have laid out a plan + started to look at the root of my spending problem but wanted to post and see if there is any additional advice to get through this. 

I have about $9k in credit card debt, earning $50k a year. I am very mad at myself because I started off the pandemic in a pretty financially healthy spot, minus student loans and one auto loan (almost paid off!) I have one child and between my partner and I, I have always made more money (he has typically worked customer service/restaurant jobs, landed a new job a few months ago and is now making about $40k). For most of the pandemic, I was paying about 90% of our living expenses and childcare costs. Somewhere along the way I got approved for a $7500 credit line and started to put most things on credit. I finally felt like I had a little more leeway month to month and in addition to this, I think “treating myself” and “treating my family” became an outlet to working in a very stressful field the last 20 months (healthcare social worker). I am now waaaay more conscientious about this and have radically tried to cut down my spending (this credit card debt has started to cause a ton of anxiety). 

I’ve laid out each credit account with balances and interest rates. I am thinking I may start with the snowball method because I think I can pay off about $3500 in the next few months and cut up those cards (all with about &lt;1500 credit limits). My highest balance is about $6000 on a capital one card with 24% APR and here is where I’m wondering the best course of action. I’ve tried to apply for a 0% balance transfer card but was denied (648 credit score). Does a debt consolidation loan make any sense here? It is just the hardest balance to cut down because it is what I have used on daily spending and the interest is high.

CryptoCurrency,Four key reasons why people should care about cryptocurrency and iys future.,"1. Cryptocurrency functions similarly to any traditional, national currency with a few fundamental differences.

Current “fiat currency” is created and regulated by a governmental body, all of which now represent debt. Anyone that owns a country’s currency holds an “IOU” issued by that respective country.

Cryptocurrency does not stand for debt. It strictly represents itself, and its value is determined by what someone is willing to trade for it.

The fact that cryptocurrency is decentralized plays an essential role in how its currency value is determined.

Nobody owns or regulates a cryptocurrency. Its value is not subject to a country’s political whims or a central bank’s monetary policy.

2. Cryptocurrency Is Almost Impossible To Forge

Cryptocurrency operates on a blockchain, which is the distributed ledger we talked about above. Understanding blockchain technology helps you understand why this is the key to the power of the digital currency.

The “block” is composed of chunks of encrypted data. The “chain” is the public database in which the blocks are stored and sequentially related to each other.

Every block in the blockchain has a specific code that distinguishes itself from all other blocks in existence. This unique code is called a hash. Blocks of information being added to a blockchain are added chronologically. A new block is added directly after the last block created, which also has its own unique hash.

The ledger or database of blocks in the chain is simultaneously distributed worldwide spread among thousands, or in Ethereum and Bitcoin’s case, millions of computers.

Suppose someone wanted to forge a single block of data on the chain. In that case, they need to manipulate all the blocks from a point in history forward AND update all the computers holding copies of the blockchain ledger.

This is theoretically possible, but the amount of power and money needed to do it successfully makes an attempt virtually impossible.

3. Cryptocurrency transactions are mostly confidential. 

With traditional currencies issued by governments, you can privately transact or pay for something in person using physical cash.

Paper, metal, cloth, and plastic currencies make up a tiny fraction of the total amount of most fiat money in circulation. Large withdrawals of physical cash are quickly flagged and reviewed by a central authority like governments and financial system regulators.


Cryptocurrency is different. It depends on well-designed math to track the exchange between two people or companies. This occurs mostly anonymously. While the ledger or list of transactions is publicly viewable worldwide, the parties exchanging cryptocurrency are more private. By definition, cryptocurrencies are held electronically in digital wallets. The owner is the holder of the private key to the wallet. The currency is exchanged digitally from mostly anonymous wallets owned by the users.


4. Cryptocurrency security grows with time and value. 

So we talked about how a hack or manipulation would require an enormous amount of power and money to the point that it would essentially become a worthless endeavor. To elaborate, a hacker would need to control over fifty percent of the computers making up the “consensus” network.

The consensus network is simply all the computers that receive copies of the blockchain or distributed ledger. For more established cryptos like Bitcoin or Ethereum, the cryptocurrency networks are so big that a hack undertaking is mostly impossible.

In the early days of cryptocurrency, it was easier to gain the majority of control as the cryptocurrency network itself was much smaller.

This is an important fact to remember for investors or users of newer cryptocurrencies whose networks haven’t grown to a relatively significant size. The smaller the network, the more vulnerable it is to hacking.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,3 mill windfall + investing/retirement accounts help,"I recently inherited just under 3 million dollars from my last living parent. I know about things like roth IRAs  (and have some money invested in them) and CDs but this is totally new territory for me. I have read every thread on the windfall FAQ and there are still a few things I'm uncertain about.

Basic facts:  Age: 39, 2 kids, spouse 38, oldest kid starting college in 10 years (and will now obviously get $0 financial aid), younger kid in half day preschool. Spouse stays home with kids while I work at a very stable state job that I enjoy and I plan to stay at until retirement at 65. 

Savings before windfall: Savings account: 35k, Roth IRA: $37k (all invested in a vanguard target retirement - 2045 mutual fund). State pension: current value: 17k/year when I retire (will be worth 54k/year when I retire based on years worked if I don't get any raises before then, amount goes up w/ income so will actually be higher). \~200k home equity. 3yo car fully paid off.  No 401ks or 529s or anything like that since I never had enough money to fund them. 

Debts: 97k owed on mortgage, 4.25% rate. Paying $50/month extra principle, in total $1230 a month with 12 years until payoff. No other debt. $900 is actual mortgage, the rest is insurance/taxes.

Income: $68,500, sometimes \~5k more per year from extra gigs, but thinking I will stop the extra gigs now that I don't \*have\* to do them to save anything for retirement, since I hate them and they are killing my soul. Take home pay is \~4k/month.

Windfall: \~2.5 million invested with an investment firm. Don't know full details yet, but some is in my parent's retirement account that needs to be withdrawn within 10 years of death (with taxes paid on any interest accrued since parental death) and some is regular investments that it can be kept in forever, and no taxes as long as we don't withdraw any more than the amount there was at parental death. These are currently being transferred to an account in my name run by the same investment firm/person that my parents chose over a decade ago.

Also 200k in life insurance that we recently got, and house is being sold that will likely bring in another $200-$250k once sold (currently doing repairs before putting on market). 

I am somewhat conservative with investing...I know people here will suggest keeping or refinancing my mortgage but I'd rather be debt free and have the house paid off (and $900 extra/month) vs. investing it all in the stock market and then all of society collapses in a few years or something. 

What we have done so far:  Opened up spousal roth IRA, put in 6k (never had enough money for this before), 6k to my roth IRA, invested both in vanguard retirement target date mutual funds. 

What we are tentatively planning to do with 2.5 mill invested money: Keep invested as is, take out money that must be taken out in 10 years right at the deadline and pay taxes, reinvest with same firm in non-retirement account, withdraw from account to pay for kids' college, help them with first mortgages, education fund for grandkids if any, etc. Never withdraw the entire principal so don't really pay taxes. Live off retirement accounts/pension/social security when I retire and leave the rest for kids to inherit. 

What we are thinking of doing with the 400k in life insurance/home sale liquid money: 

1.  Pay off mortgage with 97k. 
2. Use mortgage money (\~11k/year) to fund supplemental retirement accounts at work 
3. Transfer 12k into Roth IRAs every year 
4. Do some necessary but not urgent home repairs we have been putting off, maybe splurge on taking down a rotting pergola over my front porch and replacing with a covered porch instead of just fixing the rot and new fencing (maybe 5-15k? no idea). Also new computers for me + older kid since ours are both old / slow AF and kid is getting into gaming. 
5. After home repairs put all but 35k into a few CDs set to mature at different dates (will probably split money in 5 and have one mature each year at first and then reinvest what is left into a new 5 year CD when each matures), so can re-invest 12k into roth-IRAs each year and spend on vacations and future cars / home repairs when needed, but won't be earning basically 0 interest in my savings account. 
6. Go on some dream family vacations in a few years when younger kid is not a nightmare to travel with and the pandemic is hopefully over, like disney world or hawaii or something. 

What I still have questions about: 

1. I'm thinking I should invest the full $19,500 that I can in supplemental retirement accounts (vs around 11k from the paid off mortgage money) and use some of the liquid life insurance money / house money each year to make up the difference in my income...this way I am kinda indirectly slowly investing that money into a retirement account. Good idea/bad idea? Right now with preschool costs we are basically almost living paycheck to paycheck so I would definitely need to use some money from savings to meet expenses until at least preschool is over and/or I get a promotion. 
2. It's not clear to me whether taking the money out of my parent's retirement accounts (which I have to do within 10 years) counts towards income limits for retirement accounts...assuming it does, does that mean the year I take it out I can't fund a roth IRA or other retirement accounts? Should I do something like take out some amount each year (like 120k, so I would be under the income limits , but would make my income tax go way up? Although only interest counts as income so maybe I could take out a lot more?) and then pay taxes/reinvest in non retirement accounts, or should I take it all out at once so I have a lower income tax, and skip funding retirement accounts that one year in 10 years? Does it count as withdrawing interest if you still have principal left- that is, if I did this for a few years would the first few years just be ""principal"" so not on my taxes anyway?   
Also, is waiting the full 10 years a bad idea - like what if there is a huge stock market crash exactly 10 years from now? Should I spread it out over a few years for that reason? Is it pointless to keep in these accounts since I have to pay taxes on the interest anyway? Should I just take the money out next year before it earns too much interest and transfer it all ASAP? Would rather not do it this year since I may have to pay back stimulus checks and stuff and I'm already invested in my roth IRAs this year so seems like a huge headache...although maybe not because it's only the interest that counts and it's ony been about 2 months?? I'm assuming this has a lower interest rate since my parents were past retirement age and usually those types of accounts are more conseratively invested...
3. My employer has a bunch of different supplemental retirement options...a 401k and 457 through the state, and a 403(b) and 457(b) both through Fidelity or TIAA. Which one should I use? 
4. Should I be opening a 529 account for my kids, or don't bother since we'll have to withdraw that parental retirement money right around when my oldest starts college anyway?  I work in higher ed and there is word that they may be extending tuition benefits to kids of employees (although they haven't yet and who knows with covid cuts), so I'm not entirely sure I would need that money (also my kids may decide to go to a trade school or public higher ed may become free...who knows?).  If I move money from one of these investment accounts into a 529 account do I have to pay taxes at that point? 
5. Should I be investing in something other than vanguard target retirement funds with our roth IRAs so we don't have all our eggs in one basket? Although with the other investment funds + CDs + work accounts + home ownership it's not really all eggs in one basket at all....
6. Am I doing anything stupid here? Should I be immediately hiring an independent financial advisor (and how does one find a good one?)? Do I need one? We can get financial advice from the investment firm person that my parents used but his advice may be biased by the fact that he is in charge of all those accounts now.  How can you find a financial advisor who is not a scam artist or bad at their job? 

Thanks r/personalfinance! I have been reading posts here for years and I think I'm a lot more financially literate than I used to be but this stuff is just overwhelming and I feel like I am bound to fuck it up in some way.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Should the FED issue a stablecoin? POV of a 3rd world country guy,"I live in a 3rd world country, we have lots of problems with inflation and can't buy dollars legally. Plus we have a 50%+ inflation rate per year.

My idea is the following: if the FED issues a stablecoin tied to the value of the dollar (1 USD = 1 FED stablecoin, fully backed). What would the results be?

Pros:

A.USDT bomb would explode, as well as other stablecoins. Why use unbacked tether when you can use this fully backed coin?

B.Transparency: all transactions would be stored in the blockchain so black markets would be difficult if we eliminate physical currencies

C. Low fees and transaction costs: this applies mainly to countries were having dollars is not allowed. We would be able to transfer significant amounts of money for low/non-existent fees.

Cons: 

A.Those that want to avoid goverment control would be unable to do it. (Monero may come in?)

B.The FED gains the ability to use emisions of stablecoins to do QE (quantitative easing) to crypto prices. Maybe a possible stabilization policy in the prices of crypto?

Final thought: isn't it the centralization that we want to avoid?

CryptoCurrency,Educational Crypto Resources,"I am, like many others, fairly new to the trading (and crypto) space. I have holdings in certain coins/tokens like Bitcoin, ETH and other relatively “safe” ones. Because I already have money in place, I want to learn to make those positions more beneficial for me. I really want to become more educated in this space, possibly day trade, and have a career in crypto. However, I’m having a hard time self-educating if you will. Although I’ve spent hours and hours on YouTube looking through educational content that’s as unbiased as possible, it’s pretty overwhelming to figure out all the things required to be successful in the crypto space, as well as figuring out how to apply them. There are not many resources out there for ground-up learning that aren’t trying to sell you something or hype you up for a certain shitcoin. 

Some of these subjects include:  
- Tokenomics/ Fundamentals Analysis
- Wallets (Hot? Cold?) 
- News Resources  
- Basic Technical Analysis 
- DeFi 
- NFTs
- Dollar Cost Averaging
- Sentiment Analysis  

All of these things can seem quite overwhelming, and I know many people like myself have a hard time figuring out which to focus on learning and in what order. I’d appreciate it if anyone could drop some educational resources for me and people in similar positions. Bonus points if it’s not on YouTube as most people, including myself, default there.

economy,Is this really all there is to the market?,"I'm very confused as to what the hell the current markets are supposed to be. The only thing that matters seems to be predicting what the federal reserve will do.

None of this makes sense to me as a young investor. By literally every marker we are in the biggest market bubble of all time, and many experts are talking about it. Yet this is somehow just the new status quo.

It's no longer about investing in how good the actual economy is doing, is it? I mean if you were sitting there in summer of 2019 before the virus started to become known, and I came to you in the future telling you there would literally be lockdowns and economic shutdown, what would you do?

You would sell many of your investments, maybe even short the market. Warn people of what's to come. This is the rational decision, isn't it? Things go up, and they also go down. What the hell has happened?

But actually the federal reserve decided to prop up the markets at the expense of savers and the dollar itself... so what was the point of speculating on the economy? It didn't even matter that we had a literal pandemic (or atleast the response of one), asset prices just went up and up. Imagine that was you, shorting on literal visions of future events, and still losing because the recession got cancelled.

Which leaves me very confused. Obviously you can't just create wealth out of nothing, there is always a downside to QE and that is inflation (more specifically, loss of purchasing power).

What the hell happened to the markets, how did we let it get this bad? Why would the fed not use QE to turn a crisis into a less painful downturn, instead of creating so much new money that they somehow turn a shutdown into a bull market?

Am I going crazy here? We read the statements made on Friday and the Federal reserve STILL is scared to stop pumping money into the market. But nobody's doing anything about it. How did things get this bad? No bubble resolves sideways. This is no longer investing, this is gambling, or something far worse.",finance
vet,My dog has her period. Is this happening because of the period? Or could it be something else?,"(a little history)
I have a boxer. She’s a year and a half old. She turns 2 in December. My uncle gave me the dog in January. When I first got the dog I notice signs that he was abusing her. The dog was under weight. He never fed her or gave her water. He told me he never gave her water because she would pee a lot. 


as I got the dog I started feeding her Blue Buffalo. The can she would have in the morning and I would leave Dry food out for her in case she was hungry. After awhile she gained weight. Every time I would give her water she would finish it in one take. As time passed by she stopped doing that. I started training her. she doesn’t have anymore accidents in the house and now she knows when and where to use the bathroom. 

4 months ago in may I took her to the vet. I gave her all her shots. i paid for a microchip, paid for a stool samples. the stool sample came out normal. She had no issues. I always felt like something was wrong because she was peeing a lot. I notice droplets of blood in her urine so in June I took her back to the vet. I paid for urine and sensitivity test. She did have a infection so I got antibiotics for the dog. Last month my dog had a allergic reaction to something which she broke out in hives. I took her again to the vet. 


(the end)

I started noticing today that my dog has her period. She’s in heat. Her private area is swollen. I notice droplet of blood on the floor and the blankets. I also notice that she had diarrhea. Her stool wasn’t bloody. It was like a droplet of blood. is that happening because of her period and she’s in heat or no? Should I get another stool sample for her?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: Algorand's decentralization is no better than Binance Smart Chain's,"Among the darlings of this sub is up-and-coming chain Algorand. The founder claims to have ""solved"" the Blockchain Trilemma using their revolutionary consensus algorithm. From their marketing page:

&gt; Algorand uses cryptographic sortition to select users to propose blocks for a given round. When a block is proposed to the blockchain, a committee of voters is selected to vote on the block proposal. If a super majority of the votes are from honest participants, the block can be certified.

What they fail to mention is the backroom selection of the validator nodes that actually run the network. Let's suppose the user proposing the block is truly random. How do they propose a block? Specifically, how does the user that owns the selected Algo token have any influence over how the block is proposed? So far as I can tell, the user has no real agency; in contrast, other delegating PoS chains like Tezos or Cardano let the user directly delegate their block proposal responsibility to a baker or stake pool, respectively. By choosing the baker/pool to whom I delegate, I do my part in ensuring the decentralization of the network. In turn, bakers/pools are incentivized to act in the best interest if the network in order to attract and retain delegators.

The responsibility to select validators is a critical element in decentralization. The fact is, as an Algo holder I have no influence over the network. Instead, the network is run by a secret list of validators, owned and operated by ""early backers."" What guarantees do we have that those validators hold (and will continue to hold) the health of the network as highest priority? For all we know, Algorand could be a long con with a charismatic (and qualifed) figurehead.

This critical flaw calls into serious question the long term value of the Algorand project. I choose not to use BSC for the same reason (centralization). At least BSC doesn't lie about being decentralized - their solution to the Trilemma is to sacrifice all decentralization in favor of speed (and presumably security). Algorand claims to be decentralized, but so far as I can tell it's all smoke and mirrors.

This sub has a lot of Algo supporters. To you I say: change my mind.

Disclaimer: I hold some Algo, but I'm much more interested and invested in decentralized chains: Ethereum, Tezos, and Cardano (and learning about more as my time permits).

Edit: so far it has been pointed out that anyone can run a producer and delegate their own tokens to that producer. I did not know about this feature. I am not convinced that is much of an improvement, though. Running a node 24/7 is not easy for most people, is costly, and has no direct benefit for the party running the node. Chains with delegated PoS provide the facility to run your own node, or basically pay someone else to do it on your behalf by splitting a portion of the stalking rewards. If Algo doesn't add a delegation mechanism, I don't see how its level of  centralization will ever change.",cryptocurrency

Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

37. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

btc,I need proof that BCH mining isn't centralised on Antpool,"I frequently need to defend Bitcoin Cash against the extremely common notion (especially among crypto enthusiasts I meet IRL) that it's a 'knockoff' coin created specifically to be centrally controlled by miners. This is the perception that most everyone else out there has. Previously, I have combatted this perception with reference to the block mining charts on cash.coin.dance, but they are no longer useful for this purpose, because they keep showing Antpool with more than 50% of the hashrate. Some people claim those numbers might be spoofed or inaccurate. That is not an effective defence, because it lets the accusation of centralisation stand, merely casting doubt rather than attempting to disprove it. So while I accept the possibility of spoofing, it doesn't solve my growing problem when talking BCH, which is that most even slightly crypto-savvy people tend to run for the hills upon seeing a chart showing one mining pool dominating the hashrate.

You can talk to them about how you think there might be spoofing going on until you are blue in the face. It will make no difference. You can *try* to talk to them about how you think a mining pool isn't actually centralised so it's OK, but their eyes will glaze over, and they will not take you seriously after that. You can even tell them that hordes of hashrate cavalry will come galloping over the horizon from BTC to save the day, whenever necessary, but they will not buy that either: it sounds too much like blind faith to them, as if you're depending on the Elves to show up in time at Helm's Deep. These popular counterpoints seem to function as a way for Bitcoin Cashers to reassure each other that the wolf is not at the door, but none of them are genuinely persuasive to someone who has been avoiding Bitcoin Cash due to believing it is centralised.

So how do I 'prove' it to those people? More accurate pie charts are welcome, or else direct evidence of spoofing. If there is no longer any way to show the skeptics that Bitcoin Cash is decentralised, then fine. But just be honest about it.

CryptoCurrency,Friendly remember. Most probably we aren't early in this bullrun,"I'm sure that with all the hopium here this is something that no one wants to read, but I feel that is important to know some of the major risks that this September can bring to us:

The **infrastructure bill** is in the final stage of its approval and can be passed between the 20s and the 1o. If it has not major changes, the level of the FUD can be immense.

The **SEC** can say that almost everything is a security. It can potentially happen if the XRP case is lost, and the most affected tokens could be the Defis. Checking the Gary Gensler last letter the SEC could go for the next thing even if the case is won or settled. Also is not crazy to expect more requirements in the dollar stable coins.

The **FED** and the strength of the usd: The **stock** market is hot. So hot. There's no way to explain the current gains since the covid crash without the free money printer working in full mode. And the printer soon or later would need to stop. If the stonks crash, everyone here would become instantly a bag holder.

End of **futures** of the quarter. I'm sure that everyone remembers what happened in the last quarter end of futures. May.

To have new **covid** restrictions or lockdowns in the northern hemisphere.

You can put all of this with the romantic idea that the whales and **institutions** are going to hold forever. In simple, they don't. They are playing with hundreds and thousands of millions. And if there's enough risk, they will cash out. So, is not even necessary to have anything of this list of things to happen.

We can also have some white swang events, like new big companies or institutions showing that they have crypto in their reserves. To have big players accepting them as payment, most probably they will wait for a crash before.

So remember, stick to your plan, and practice risk management

edit: on the xrp, I added the Gary Gensler reference. Even if the case is settled or won, it doesn't mean than the SEC can go for the next thing the day after

California has gone entirely the same direction as U.S. Congress.  If you're still in California, and you have assets with an exchange or other financial institution that is incorporated in California, or you have assets otherwise located (personally held) in California that you are now concerned about due to the evolving and increasing restrictions from both California and the federal government, take action.  Move your assets (move your money) out of California (see link above for some suggestions), if maintaining the asset(s) in the USA.  If not, then you will need to consider an alternate jurisdiction and that's another analysis (El Salvador? Slovenia? Somewhere else).

stocks,The best PLTR bear case I found,"Update: added paragraphs. Somehow reddit messed them up when copy pasting.

The following is a comment in the comment section from a Seeking Alpha user “GrowthandValu” posted on an article “Palantir: Explaining The Unexplainable” on (published date Aug. 25, 2021 11:32 AM ET)

Unfortunately reddit doesn’t allow links from SA.

I think this is the best “bear case” summary of PLTR so far. However, it would be interesting to read some input from other people who have touched Palantir - maybe they will have very different thoughts.

 I hold some PLTR myself so I am interested in both: bull and bear sides. And I am interested in what people will have to say after reading this.

The comment:

“This is simple. There is no mystery here. They like to create a mystique about themselves by overstating their role in projects, but there is absolutely no mystery.
I will preface this by saying I have known this company for over 10 of their near 20 years. I know former salespeople and engineers, and I know current salespeople and other client facing employees. I have also been directly involved in this industry for 25 years and I sell roughly $15 mil a year on average in professional services for BI/Data/AI initiatives to about a dozen Fortune 1000 companies. I work as an account director for a publicly traded consulting firm, but I began my career in a technical capacity (data warehousing, modeling, coding, BI, analytics) and transitioned here about 11 years ago. That said...
Palantir **software** is a Business Intelligence platform with advanced data integration capabilities. This platform is an **enabler** of deep analytics and AI. Neither main component is unique in any sense of the word.

High level, Foundry is essentially a MicroStrategy clone. It has a server that maps data sources into a logical model of objects that makes them easy to use for reporting and analytics. It has a good ""in memory"" capability in terms of local data storage, but it also can ""live query"" source data. There is a visualization component for web and mobile with all the basics. (mapping, data grids, charts, graphs, etc.) MicroStrategy is the best comparator, but Cognos, BOBJ, and OBIEE are also enterprise grade peers.
Gotham is basically an ETL tool that connects to data. It can bring in multiple streams and relate data sets so that they can be reported on and analyzed in a single view. It has a decent associative engine, but nothing better than anything else, and it requires a lot of human intervention. Foundry leverages the ""model"" Gotham creates. When you hear Gotham, think Ab Initio, Informatica, Talend, ADF, etc.

Inside of these components you can write code/algorithms with Python, R, etc. that seek a variety of things. You need to know the use case and where to look, of course. Some seem to feel there is a ""magic button"" you click and it tells you when the next embassy bombing will take place. (HINT: It doesn't)
Data is just data. It can be numeric, text, binary, image, etc., but it has no character, no emotion, no intelligence. Human need to understand what that data represents, then they code for what they want.
Facial recognition is an awesome example. The process doesn't compare pictures, it is comparing the numerical expressions behind them, and it associates common expressions as a linked result. Google photos is a great example.

Palantir is a platform that can do this, BUT -- big BUT -- they didn't invent anything. Let's pretend they are looking for possible terrorists in an airport. They start with a known set of images. Then a camera sends images to a server, the numeric translation is run, the result is compared to the numeric strings that are stored, and if there is a high probability of a match, an alert pops up.

At the end of the day, this is a query. You are taking in a variable and comparing it to a set of literals. Palantir **enables** this functionality, they didn't invent it, and it certainly is not unique. Some good coders can make it sing, but it is a human effort.

That is just one example.

So, Palantir as a platform is ordinary. Feel free to argue the finer points, but the competition is endless, not to mention cheaper. Most enterprises these days are recreating enterprise BI platforms in the aggregate by using something like Talend and Databricks in between source data and presentation layer, for example.
Now, Palantir as a **business** is a different story entirely. They made a very calculated and firm decision to focus on the federal space, not commercial. They built a platform that was meant to run largely on-prem (or in their cloud) and it required a lot of horsepower. They opted not have a real partner program, so they maintained full control of sales and delivery. They essentially turned themselves into a federal consultancy that catered to government use cases. Their software has been approved, they have a known procurement method, and they know how to work together well with government. Palantir hires smart, expensive, US citizens (no offshore or H1 for gov't) to implement. They call them Forward Deployed Engineers, but they are just developers, business analysts, and PMs. These people are hard to find and hire at scale. The bulk of their work is fixed price, not T&amp;M. They understand federal budgets and how to win these contracts. They primary ""fix price"" bid, which conceals rates and allows play with license. (Software and consulting are accounted for differently on both sides) Their terms are also fixed, say 3 years. Up front price basically includes maintenance for the term. After 3 years then you start again. I know there is chatter now about different models, but I will believe it when I see it.

I am generalizing, but this is essentially how they operate. Unfortunately, that model doesn't scale at all, as they have no outside sales channels, no partners, and no delivery scale.

Software companies rely heavily on partners. When I say partner, think Cognizant, Accenture, etc. These are ""scale"" partners who are everywhere and can have great influence over commercial spend. They also have the resources to implement. Software companies have SAAS offerings and relationships with the major cloud platforms. They have consulting arms, but they are generally more software focused and technical, not business focused. They install, they guide, but they rarely do large implementations over a long period of time.

The commercial space doesn't play the game that Palantir wants them to play. It hasn't happened in 20 years and unless PLTR completely changes course, it will never happen.
Never.

I mention Databricks above. They are a software company and their platform is a superior alternative to much of what Palantir is. They have been in existence for 8 years and have over 6,000 clients and growing. Palantir has been around for 2 decades now and has 146 clients total. How many are net new and over $1 mil. in the last 12 months? I bet not many.
Why is that? Why is such a ""superior"" platform lagging so poorly in an industry that keeps exploding? I don't know...

I won't talk about stock compensation, valuation, or anything else. I am merely pointing out what Palantir is and how they generally operate. It is obvious how misunderstood they are, mostly because of slick marketing (outrageous in many cases) and Cathie Wood.

In summation:
- Business Intelligence and data integration software
- Very expensive compared to a multitude of competitors and options
- Business model geared to federal, not commercial
- Heavy consulting model that doesn't scale well and hurts margins
- No real partner program or channels for sales or implementation

Bukele has been talking about this. He tweeted a long thread in Spanish few days ago telling the people not to believe the lies. He explained how El Salvador economy and the people will benefit from Bitcoin and that no one will be forced to do anything under the new law.

IMF yesterday warned countries that making Bitcoin legal tender is a shortcut and a step too far. They said countries shouldn't do it because it will affect the ability of central banks to control the monetary policy and it will help countries escape trade sanctions.

These boomers don't understand that's exactly the goal. No country should have the power to sanction another country and stop others from trading with them using force. Each country has the right to decide on their own.

personalfinance,Chase is grading 2nd home as 'investment property' even though I will live there 24/7,"Hoping I can get some clarity around whether this is a normal practice, or if I should just find a new lender. Here's the scenario:

Wife and I owe less than 25% of the appraised value on current home. The mortgage  is incredibly cheap \[we bought at an excellent time in an excellent area, and made early payments\]. Have lived here for 7+ years. We'd like to keep this home and rent it out after buying another one.

New house would be about 10 miles from the old one. Chase is saying that even if we move immediately after closing, they will not finance the new house as a primary residence, it's an investment property and we'd have to put 25% down to meet their standards. We have the cash on hand to do this, but is 25% and an investment grade interest rate really the best I can do here?

Is this right? This is making it seem like my current house (where I will no longer be living) is permanently stuck as my primary residence. Do I have to re-fi my existing house (which will have significantly LESS debt on it) into an investment mortgage at the same time? Should I just find a different lender?

CryptoCurrency,The first big crypto currency election issue in the USA,"Fellow crypto enthusiasts, what do you think will be the big, hot button issue in the cryptosphere that will make-or-break a candidate’s election in the United States?  

Internationally, the debate has come to a head, as of 2021.  The United States government is lagging behind tremendously at this point.  Particular issues within the scope of the SEC are virtually unaddressed, as it is, thus, are Americans, duly, to expect any legal course of action or framework from the “proper authorities”?  Would regulation prove to be a blessing or a burden?  Is regulation, at this point, even necessary?  (I think DeFi has this, sorry IMF+banks.  🤷‍♂️)

At some point in the very near future, I believe America will see an election (local, state or federal,) similar to the one in Canada, where a shrewd politician outwits their opponent as well as the common voter by pivoting an infant political issue against their rival, specifically for political gain.  Putting an opponent on the spot to debate a relatively unknown territory is no new concept, but doing so in this way streamlines crypto toward new considerations and it might not be unwise to believe that this cycle is just beginning. 

Personally, I think it will either be one of the big gambling localities, like Las Vegas or Atlantic City (mayor, treasurer, etc.,) or a gigantic municipality like in New York or LA or Houston (Congress, state legislator, etc.,) that will propel the crypto debate to the front lines, effectively and further normalizing the underlying and subsequent issues, therefore, bringing to the forefront the utility of the theoretical underpinning that is blockchain tech.  

I also think that publicity itself will play a specifically key role in this discussion that it otherwise wouldn’t; exposure is already peaking at all time highs, in many respects, however, when the time comes, the issue itself might not even be critically necessary to functionality as a whole, for example, transactional anonymity- not a huge dealbreaker for most, but if a candidate supports it, the campaign may begin to virally grow some steam for the overall [crypto] economy ... wouldn’t be a bad idea to politically turn a mountain into a molehill.  Hope a potential representative reads this and picks up what I’m putting down!  

I’m interested to these what others may speculate on this topic.",cryptocurrency

This isn't necessarily following what people say literally but rather getting a read on the general mood. On the flip side my worst trades have used traditional TA, of course it could be that I have no clue what I'm doing with TA but it seems to be a 50:50 shot whereas if I'm sure enough about the mood of the market to make a move it has only ever been correct. I have maybe 100 trades under my belt so it could also be a very small sample size plus confirmation bias.

Since 2017 I pulled out one day before the crash, re-accumulated my initial investment during 2018-2019. During this time I figured around with TA and day trading, got a slightly bigger bag but nothing major. Happened to sell off before covid due to my industry being super at risk for a shut down. Unfortunately I decided to play it safe and keep the money and stimulus checks in fiat during the first shut down but as soon as I could get back to work in my industry I re-accumulated everything plus locking in some alts right before they popped. Folks were getting greedy so I locked in profit around April for a down payment and bought back my initial investment in my three main coins when things corrected. In full transparency I left a lot of money on the table by not biting on most of the hot alts. I also totally biffed it early on with FIL (sold when it was trading sideways at $22 for the tiniest profit), LINK (missed my limit buy at $3.94 by $0.03, figured I missed the boat at every pop along the way lol), and ALGO (bought it around $0.22, sold when it doubled) so my intuition is not always right... Also I bought $100 btc back when it was $7, it was lost in a fake wallet scam that scared me off for a while. Then figured I missed the boat when it hit $100, then when it hit $1000. Finally gathered that it might be around for a while and accumulated a tiny bit of btc for the second half of 2017. Maybe intuition isn't the best tactic after all... Definitely would be better off if I just DCA'd in from when I started.

Anybody else just kinda read the room and go with their gut? Is crypto this way because of the relatively small market size making market manipulation easier to read? Am I imagining things and just got lucky?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I think I'll stop paying my credit cards,"I am M 25y/o in a fairly unusual financial situation. When I was 18/19 I got my first credit cards, they paired poorly with some other bad decisions I was making at that time and after buying a few too many things I did and didn't need I had \~$5k cc debt (+$25k federal student loan debt) by the time I was 22 which has been annoying but did not seem unresolvable (the cc debt at least).  I also got a 4or5yr auto loan around 20, it is finished now. I have used the cards &lt;5 times during the last couple of years and made all my payments but they remain nearly maxed out.

Around this time (2-3 yrs ago) I decided to drop out of college to pursue a startup. I'm very glad that I did this as it stopped me from amassing more debt, ending up in a field I would have regretted due to its oversaturation, and I have learned orders of magnitude more developing this startup. Unfortunately due to the high R&amp;D nature of the product it will still be at least a year or two until it can sustain me again and during this time I am doing basically freelance engineering work and selling some simpler products. I expect it will be able to cover my minimal living expenses but in the recent transition money has been kind of tight and I have missed a few payments on my credit cards. Initially it was purely an accident but the late fees made me unable and eventually apathetic to paying.  I have like $500 in checking at the moment (of which about $400 is needed for living) and my 4cc account look like so:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1:  2 bills past due, $160 due now is too much for me to cover living expenses, $80 repayment plan is more feasible however when I factor in cc2 it basically leaves me with $0 to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2: 1 bill past due, $120 due now even if the $40 late fee is voided I still cannot pay it and the others and have any money to work with

&amp;#x200B;

\#3: 1 bill past due, could repay with or without late fee but doesn't exactly seem worthwhile considering the others

&amp;#x200B;

\#4: good standing

&amp;#x200B;

If I were able to just pick them back up in a month or two at my original payments I would agree to that but by that point they will all be covered in late fees that make them unpayable to me, be multiplied, and they will have already done their number on my credit. So at this point I see only two options, I can make the payments which will likely make me unable to afford my living expenses at practically no benefit. Or I can let all of the credit cards die together.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of what happens if I stop paying them:

&amp;#x200B;

they will ruin my credit score, they will send it to collections, collections will be annoying, they may eventually sue me, I may be able to win, I may also wait 4 years for the open debt SOL to expire. With this understanding I only wish I would have stopped paying them 2 years ago. I suppose another option is bankruptcy but it seems kind of extreme for $5k and a waste as it wont absolve my student loans but perhaps it is easier than being harassed by collections for years?

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely never want to touch debt again so my credit score does not wield much power over me. I can see the value when it comes to buying a house for example but I am sure that in the next 5 years I will not be (willingly) doing anything that looks like settling down in one place with a super steady job so it's not in the cards for me regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I am failing to consider? because for the next few years not having an extra \~$250 of monthly payments and $5k in debt sounds a lot more appealing than *maybe* being able to get a loan (they wont give me one anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Investment Strategy before a crash?,"I am 33YO and I currently have $50K in a 401K (90% stocks/10%bonds) and $30K in a brokerage account (100% in stocks).  
I have $30K in a savings account.

I recently received a good amount of cash ($200K) from family event. I don't want to put all of it in VT or similar ETF for 2 reasons:

\- I think there is a good chance of a huge crash coming in 1-3y and I want money available to buy during that crash if it happens, and also money available to face several months of unemployment and provide for the family.  
\- I have a medium risk profile and I don't feel comfortable having most of my money in stocks. I prefer bit less risk than being 100% stock with less returns.

But I don't want to keep $200K in a 0.5% savings either. What I am looking for is an ETF that would not tank during a crash (allowing me to sell some and put it in VT at that point) and that can provide decent returns if market stays flat or goes up.

What ETF or investments should I look at that provide decent returns in flat/up markets (although less than a regular index fund) but more protection in downturns?  
Bonds seem out of the question due to low interest rates. I found NUSI that looks good but more generally, what would be your strategy today if a crash was likely soon?

Bitcoin,Drop your pride and listen,"I consider myself very lucky. I bought several properties over the last 8 years. I did NOT understand the money supply going up, but I did understand that the low rates made payments affordable (while many argued bubble I knew the payment is what mattered).

I remember a condo I looked at (and ended up buying) was bought at the bottom by the seller who had an all in payment of $1300 (hoa, taxes, principle/interest). That condo was renting for $1500. Literally the condo paid for itself AND generated cash flow. The market for that condo rent is now $2100 a month.

While I got lucky, I will tell you that I had many friends that had a chance to buy and didn't. Their general response was ""it's going to a crash"". What the truth is that they put in little research and were frustrated because they thought they missed out. Life was fine for them, and it still is-but they missed out on massive financial gains. Many of the highest educated and also some of the highest IQ people I know have way less wealth than people I think are dufuses.  Why did the dufus get rich? The dufus was willing to listen. Just like I missed out on bitcoin in 2015, and many of my friends missed out on housing, I implore you to listen. 

The moral: Don't be jealous. Put in the work and make a decision. Don't make a decision off one post, one article. Read, listen, ask questions.

The reason I write this is because it helps me make sense. If you are not buying bitcoin, I hope you have a very good reason. I hope you have a reason to believe rates will normalize, a reason to believe the fed will stop supporting markets, a reason to believe worldwide adoption will slow down/go stagnant/reverse course, a reason to believe the fed's balance sheet will get paid down, a reason to believe debt to gdp won't keep climbing. 

I hope you have a reason to believe that it will stop at 1 S&amp;P 500 company. I hope you have a reason to believe wealth inequality goes from widening to lessening (that the increased taxes really stop this-ha!). I hope you have a reason to believe that more billionaires will not join, and a reason to believe wealth management firms throughout America, including ones in the heartland and very conservative, will stop dipping their toes into GBTC. I hope you have a reason to believe our world is not going to continue to go digital, and a reason to believe that governments in the first world will outlaw it even though the trend is strongly showing adoption/regulation/acceptance. 

I hope you have a reason to believe that most new cell phones in the next 3-5 years will NOT come with digital wallets, and a reason to believe that the large banks will not offer bitcoin services to their customers even as they see coinbase lighting up bank statements. I hope you have a reason to believe the world will go back to the way it was, though history shows this never happens. 

The reason most will miss this is pride. People think they are smarter than they are and better than they are. As I reflect back on housing-DROP YOUR PRIDE AND LISTEN.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Savings/Emergency Fund To High (no interest) Where to put funds?,"I have a bad habit (at this point) of putting too much cash into savings. I know I need to stop and at this point of time anything that is not allocated to a specific expense (house project primarily) needs to go towards kid's college plan or paying off debt. 

My question is where should I put my current savings? I have yet to have a need to take out of my savings account before other than purchasing our home 3.5 years ago. Even home improvements typically can come out of checking as we tend to keep a decent balance in there and move funds to payoff loans or savings at the start of each month after we run the budget for the month. We typically earn more each month $2-4k than we spend unless we have one month where we make a big payment or pay for a home project, big trip etc.. 

Current savings account earning little interest is at $75k. I was thinking of taking $35k and putting it into a mix of bond and utility fund, low risk, but something that will pay 1-3% range. 

Should I keep $75k completely liquid? Is there even a need to keep $40k liquid? 

Monthly debt is: 
Private Student Loans $980/month at 3.9% over 20 years ($159k) 

Fed Loans $650 month in a payment plan at 6.5% going to make extra payments to this one. ($89k) 

Car Loan $25k at 3.6% $395/month 

Mortgage $440k at 3.25% $3,400/month with taxes and insurance. 

Child care for two kids at $1.1k/month. 

Then typical expenses, travel, eating out, buying things, groceries, taking care of the home, car insurance, medical etc.. $3-4k a month. 

Gross wages are in the $300k range for my wife and I combined.

TL;DR:

&gt;Whilst the divergence between price and on-chain activity is  historically abnormal for a full scale bull market, it is not an  uncommon signature for the pre-bull, and pre-supply-squeeze dynamic.  These periods often accompany the end of bear market accumulation where  the investors who remain, are the strong hands, those with the highest  conviction.

&gt;Supply dynamics seem to suggest an extremely robust  underlying demand is present, and this should continue to be quite  constructive for prices if the trend continues. Aggressive spending of  older coins would be a key invalidation signal to watch out for.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"""Free your mind, Neo"" - How have/will you personally break free through crypto?","I'm on what I would consider a pretty solid path. I came into crypto four years ago with no expectations, only my hopes and dreams. Today, even though I still don’t know fuck about shit (or is it shit about fuck?), I'm operating from an informed position, and I’m hell bent more than ever on making my dreams become reality.

My end goal (or let's call it a significant milestone along the way) is to eventually reach a point where I can effectively retire from the workforce. If I can do this, I plan on dedicating my full attention toward following an endless bucket list of pursuits. Of paramount importance to me is making this happen as quickly as possible. Ultimately, I just want to live happily and comfortably to the end of my days.

I decided sometime back that I would not sit idly by and just wait for things to hopefully play out the way I wish. Therefore, I view my role as an active one, doing everything that I possibly can to maximize my chances to speedily *manifest* my reality.

Mine is a multi-pronged approach:

-Investing in the right ""trophy"" coins

-Hodling long term with no plans to sell my appreciating crypto assets

-Earning passively by putting my crypto to work 24x7. Not just that, but earning a compounding yield on my coins in kind, to grow my stacks (this equates to perpetually DCAing)

-Possibly and cautiously borrowing against my crypto (only in times of need), rather than selling, thereby avoiding taxes. Ideally, I would only do this during the bottom of a bear market and using the minimum LTV percentage, which minimizes risk of liquidation.

This, in my opinion, is best done through a very low to zero interest rate loan program such as that offered by Celsius Network. This can be done through the collaterization of a portion of your crypto. No credit checks, immediate funds availability. And you can pay down/off higher interest debt, use the funds for a down payment on a home, etc. 

Another huge upside: IF the price of your crypto continues to increase from the price point when you got the loan, your LTV effectively decreases. This enables you to formally request (Celsius allows you to do this once per month) a “Reverse Margin Call.”, whereby you could, for example, receive half of your collateral back and keep the original loan.

-Continue to stay abreast of evolving trends and new opportunities to maximize my holdingsand results. 

Of course, some of the above reflects my own appetite for taking on risk. I fully realize that not everyone embraces my perspective on risk versus reward, but I'm perfectly okay with that. I'm in this with eyes wide open.

“I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it. You have to let it all go.” With this famous quote, I'm trying to impart an imperative to you aspiring retirees to challenge yourselves. Ask the important questions now in order to formulate your own plan of attack. 
For instance, you might ask yourself:
Am I passively involved in crypto, or am I truly involved to the point where I am fully utilizing the knowledge gained and tools available to actively steer my my own destiny? If not, what else can/should I be doing?

Also, for me, just the simple act of writing this out is helping to sharpen my own game plan as I examine and organize my thoughts. I’m looking forward to your comments, as I fully realize that there are those here much wiser and more experienced in the ways of crypto and finance. My mind has already been set free and is wide open now, so I'm here acknowledging that my plans could possibly shift as a result of some spark that is ignited in the comments.

personalfinance,"Mortgage rate differences, EU VS USA","I hope this is not off-topic but I'm curious about a general question regarding interest rates for mortgages in the EU vs USA.

I've been lurking on personalfinance for a long time, and I noticed that interest rates tend to always be much much higher in the US than they are in the EU.

Reading this sub I see people talking about historically fantastic rates with 2.20%. I got a mortgage this year with a ""bad"" rate (because I'm self-employed, almost no bank would lend to me, I went through 5+ outright rejections) and my rate was 1.24%. My best mate who is a full time employee got 0.9% on his mortgage. We're talking 25 year, 600K€+ principal. (for reference, that's in France, although we regularly hear how rates can be lower elsewhere in the EU such as the nordic countries).

What's driving such a difference in interest rates? Are mortgages more often defaulted on in the US? Is it intrinsically less risky to lend for a mortgage in the EU due to the legal environment?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 30, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 30, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) extending gains from last week to reach new intraday record highs. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) was driven slightly lower due to weakness in financial and energy stocks while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its winning streak to close 0.41% lower. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.

Despite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minus, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.”

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”

Regarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated the need for caution but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, “Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.”

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

Regarding Powell’s speech, BTIG Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist Julian Emanuel said, “Powell ""did three things very, very right, and obviously the markets are celebrating that. First was keeping the speech succinct. Second thing he did risht is, he sent the rest of the Fed governors out over the prior four weeks to basically tell us all that the taper was coming. He merely had to reiterate, and reiterate softly, that message, which he did very effectively. The third thing is he really tackled inflation head on. He knew that’s been the preoccupation of the markets for these last couple of months. While he didn’t give any new real evidence as to why he views inflation as transitory, he did cite the ongoing moderation in commodity prices and the view that past history would indicate that inflation is likely to be temporary.” 

Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive more data on the strength of the labor market recovery this week, with the Labor Department's August jobs report due out on Friday. Consensus economists are looking to see that 750,000 payrolls came back during the month, representing an eighth straight month of gains but a slight pullback from July's 943,000.

* July pending home sales unexpectedly dropped, according to data from the National Association of Realtors, likely due to high housing prices. Sales dipped 1.8% in July compared to June, nearly matching June’s 2% decline. Economists were looking for a gain of 0.3%
* McDonald’s (MCD) sent a notice to instruct franchisees on steps they should take to re-close indoor dining in areas where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading. Originally, barring any COVID resurgence, McDonald’s planned to fully reopen indoor dining by Labor Day (Sept 6)
* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apple’s ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.
* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said. ESPN has existing marketing partnerships with both companies already. This is huge for the sports-betting industry, will be closely following this story.
* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers. In my humble opinion, even being backed by Amazon, this valuation is insane.

gaming,FPS games aren't fun anymore (rant),"As the title says, I can't find any enjoyment in First Person Shooter games anymore, at least not ones with a multiplayer. I'm not even on about the Battle Royale trend (which really has to end now). 

Until a few months ago I played a lot of Warzone, until the only people left that I played against were either hackers or players that were so good/sweaty/tryhards that I couldn't compete with them anymore and I got destroyed in every game.

I moved on to Overwatch, I used to play it when it was a fairly new game and loved it, it was a bit toxic at times but was still very enjoyable, but after re-visiting it in recent weeks I've found it to be insufferable. Everyone was screaming at each other in voice chat, so I stopped joining the voice chat, then it was people turning into keyboard warriors mid game spending more time typing than playing. So I turned off text chat, so I can just play the game in peace, but even that wasn't possible. People started throwing the games (because I wasn't communicating with them I guess), because almost every game people were just spawning in, and either running into the enemy to let them kill them or just jumping off the map repeatedly.

In the end I got fed up with that and moved on to Escape from Tarkov, which was really enjoyable for a while until I started getting killed in the first 30 seconds of most raids, or the first player I encountered would 1 shot me, even if I had level 6 armour (highest rated armour in the game) I did some research and as it turns out, even escape from tarkov is in the middle of a hacker pandemic and the devs have no way of dealing with it because the unity engine is so easy to cheat in and get away with it. So for me even tarkov I'm finding really not enjoyable anymore. 

FPS games used to be my bread and butter but now I find I'm mostly playing singleplayer games or simple co-operative games with a few friends that don't involve anything competitive.

It's honestly depressing, gaming used to be my escape from the real world, a chance to just relax and forget about my very real problems, but now I find I am more frustrated when I'm finished playing than when I started.

Either I'm getting old or some games are just getting less enjoyable.

CryptoCurrency,SEC to Monitor Illicit Activity on DeFi Platforms,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will monitor decentralized finance transactions, after contracting with the [blockchain cybersecurity firm AnChain.AI](https://twitter.com/AnChainAI/status/1431340148852084740), which confirmed the agreement over social media last week. Legal experts suggest this and other recent moves preview increased regulation of the decentralized finance space.   


The San Jose, California-based analytics firm - which uses investigatory and predictive analytics to track illegal activity across exchanges, DeFi projects and traditional institutions - confirmed the agreement via Twitter. The contract will help the SEC identify suspicious addresses and transactions, as the commission assesses the DeFi space and considers regulatory actions involving cybersecurity, data privacy, risk management and other investor protections.

On Twitter, the firm wrote, ""We're proud to work with the SEC to protect all #Crypto stakeholders in the virtual asset economy, and to contribute our technology to critical regulatory oversight efforts.""

The SEC's contract with the firm - which reportedly went into effect in May - is worth $125,000 per year for up to five years, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/08/27/sec-signs-deal-to-investigate-defi-transactions/?sh=2f74e4a3787c).

The SEC and AnChain.AI did not respond to requests for more information.

AnChain.AI CEO and co-founder Victor Fang told Forbes, ""The SEC is very keen on understanding what is happening in the world of smart contract-based digital assets.""

### 'No More Immune'

Some experts say the latest activity reflects a desire within the SEC to rein in digital assets.

Kara L. Kapp, an attorney for the Philadelphia-based law firm Cozen O'Connor, says the contract with AnChain.AI ""is consistent with Commissioner \[Gary\] Gensler's prior comments that the SEC is going to closely monitor the DeFi space.""

""It also demonstrates that the so-called decentralized exchanges are no more immune from oversight than any other cryptocurrency exchange,"" Kapp adds.

Ross Rustici, former technical lead for the U.S. Department of Defense, adds, ""This move by the SEC is a continuation of a trend of increased regulation in the U.S. and globally. … \[It\] only furthers the efforts by governments to wrestle control back in this space.""

""Governments across the world are becoming increasingly incentivized to solve both \[de-anonymization and asset tracking concerns\], especially as the criminal element that leverages the technology is becoming more brazen in their activity,"" adds Rustici, who is currently managing director of the global advisory firm StoneTurn.

[David Cass](https://anchainai.medium.com/def-con-29-you-cant-stop-the-trillion-dollar-virtual-asset-market-but-you-can-and-must-36e3c984691e), vice president of cyber and IT risk at the Federal Reserve Bank, said in a recent blog post, ""\[With smart contracts and DeFi\] you need attorneys who understand code; you need coders that really understand the business aspects of what's going on - so you can get things properly aligned.""

""Otherwise … clauses can come up in the code that move money before conditions have been properly met,"" warned Cass, who's an advisor for AnChain.AI.

### Cybersecurity Risks of DeFi

Cybersecurity risks remain at the core of DeFi, an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries. Indeed, DeFi does not rely on central intermediaries such as banks, brokerages or exchanges to deliver financial services, including lending, borrowing and trading. Instead, DeFi applications rely on smart contracts across blockchains.

DeFi projects involve participant-based blockchain transactions mediated by a ""DeFi protocol."" Many of these protocols use open-source software. A lack of security controls remains a concern, although DeFi investment has grown exponentially since 2020, with some $82.4 billion locked in related platforms, according to tracker [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/).

Some DeFi projects get hacked because of ""developer incompetence, which causes coding mistakes that hackers can abuse,"" says William S., a security researcher for the virtual private network firm [Atlas VPN](https://atlasvpn.com/blog/defi-related-hacks-account-for-76-of-all-major-hacks-in-2021), in a recent blog post.

### Eyeing Regulation

Lawmakers and federal regulators alike continue to wade into the cryptocurrency space - citing its volatility and recent high-profile breaches with initial losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars (see: [*Hacker Steals $97 Million From Crypto Exchange 'Liquid'*](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacker-steals-97-million-from-crypto-exchange-liquid-a-17333)).

The Senate-approved $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill would impose expanded tax obligations on crypto operators. A proposed amendment to soften the requirements failed to pass the Senate. Supporters say the measure will generate $28 billion in new tax revenue, while critics say it burdens a wide range of crypto operators and can stifle innovation (see: [*Senator Seeks Input on Securing Crypto, Blockchain*](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/senator-seeks-input-on-securing-crypto-blockchain-a-17400)).

Additionally, a bill introduced in the Senate earlier this month - called the Sanction and Stop Ransomware Act - recommends regulatory actions around cryptocurrency (see: [*Countering Cyberthreats: 2 Legislative Proposals Introduced*](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/countering-cyberthreats-2-legislative-proposals-introduced-a-17235)).

On Aug. 3, SEC Chairman Gensler called crypto markets ""rife with fraud, scams and abuse"" (see: [*PayPal to Hire Dozens of Cryptocurrency Security Experts*](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/paypal-to-hire-dozens-cryptocurrency-security-experts-a-17214)).

Gensler called on lawmakers to provide the independent agency with additional authority to regulate crypto markets.

In an Aug. 19 interview with The Wall Street Journal, [Gensler said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401) DeFi projects, in particular, are not immune to regulation - with features that may warrant federal oversight.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., echoed the call for regulation of the cryptocurrency space - [penning a letter to Gensler](https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-asks-sec-chair-gensler-about-risks-posed-by-cryptocurrency-exchanges) in July addressing several concerns around cryptocurrency.

In a reply, [Gensler again indicated](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-releases-response-from-sec-chair-gensler-affirming-need-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-protect-investors-and-our-financial-system) that cryptocurrency platforms lack adequate protections and potentially run afoul of securities, commodities and banking laws.

In June, House Financial Services Committee Chair [Maxine Waters, D-Calif.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5LhZ4G4s-A), said a new working group under her charge would be reviewing the ""minimally regulated"" cryptocurrency space. The group, she added, will partner with regulators and industry experts.",cryptocurrency

I'm in my 20s with a job and going to school part time. I have enough savings to straight up pay for all of uni (a state school in California). My credit score is in the low excellent range but its only based on paying credit cards with low utilization. If I want a higher credit score or at least a more solid credit score should I take up student loans? How fast should I pay them off if I want to get the credit score benefits but not pay too much in interest? Any recommended loan providers or is better to go federal? 

Some other notes about me:

\- I don't have a car, so no car insurance or car for a loan to help me build credit. I just walk, commute or carpool with people to save money 

\- Sadly, no house mortgage :(... its too much for my at the moment. But, I want to qualify for a mortgage loan in maybe 10yrs or less when I can afford it and get a better job. My current job doesn't pay well enough for that. 

\- Credit card utilization is less than 4% in total (credit limit is around $5k but I havn't asked for a credit increase yet)

\- Separate from my savings I plan to use for uni, I have an emergency fund that can sustain me for 1 year and I've already been maxing out my roth IRA contribution and investing a small portion (less than 10% of my savings) in an individual brokerage account to consider inflation

personalfinance,Student Loan Refi,"Hello everyone, going to break down my situation and wanted to hear any input. I am 22 years old, graduated this May with about $90k in student loans debt (60k private/30k federal). I am planning on refinancing this week, my average interest rate is 6% (wow!) and I've shopped around and looking to bring that down to mid-2s. 

Started working in July, making a healthy salary for right after college. A couple of questions:

1) I have about $23k sitting in the bank right now and have a suspicion I am sitting on too much money that should be used to bring my debt balance down. How much should a reasonable person have at my point?

2) There is one promotional offer from a refi provider that is offering a 6-month 0% APR, followed by a longer-term loan around 3.5%... curious if there are any drawbacks to selecting this option, then simply refinancing after the 6 months again? Not sure if that works

Is 25-30K unreasonable? Would rather get CPO than normal used. Trying to get my rent to the 1500 range all in, but I live in a big city so not sure if i can squeeze that. No state income tax though.

personalfinance,"I would like to refinance my home, but I think my DTI is too high. Should I try anyway?","Okay this’ll be fun. 

Situation: Decent income, mountains of debt. 

-	about $180k in student loans at various interest rates, all federal, been growing for years under IDR. Currently in national forbearance, total payments about $550/mo come February, full payments would be about $2000/mo
-	$54k HELOC, maxed out, 3.74%, $350/mo
-	$19k “off the books” mortgage. It’s actually a heloc on my dad’s house; he lent me the money to buy my house cash ten years ago and I’ve been making the payments, but nothing is in my name on it. My bank statements show I’ve paid $350-400/mo forever, but I just lowered it to the minimum of $250/mo as my father no longer wants me to pay it off 
-	15k construction loan at 9.9% from a roof job. Was $18k in January, I’ve made a few extra payments. $228/mo
-	40k/800/mo car loan. No, I am not selling my car so please don’t ask. It has an unlimited mileage warranty and I drive almost 50k miles a year. Part of that is driving Uber, which brings in around $1500 a month. 
-	$55k in credit card debt, on a credit counseling plan with total payments of $1200 a month, interest rates 6% or less
-	$30k in tax debt, in theory. The IRS has not processed my last three years of tax returns. I am paying about $800 a month toward what I believe I owe, but I gave up a while back on my weekly calls to try and get the returns accepted. The relevant office does not answer or accept messages. 

Income:
Salary from law practice $75k/year. Unreliable, because sometimes the firm runs low on cash and I have to skip a paycheck. I am hoping to lower this number further soon in favor of more stability. 
VA disability: $1887/mo. I am a 90% service connected veteran, due to an impairment that legit reduces my work capacity. 
Rideshare ~$1000-3000/mo, highly variable based on my motivation but also some factors external to me

How did it get this bad? Years of struggling to get by as a solo attorney with significant mental illness. About half of the credit card debt happened in the last quarter of 2019 when I lost a major client and had negative income for three months, while sinking money into a startup I mistakenly thought I was financially ready for, and weathering some personal issues at home. The rest was a mix of just not being attentive and a few episodes of putting payroll on credit cards. 

The firm is doing reasonably well lately and I have enough of a pipeline of clients and cases that the firm should be healthy and growing for the foreseeable future. My organic SEO has been improving to the point that I can drop my $2000/mo Google ad spend and put that money into other more efficient marketing services or just have healthier margins. I’m also expecting a final round of Covid aid to give me some safety margin at the firm. 

The last six months have been great for me financially. I really got my spending under control and have been able to save up a decent emergency fund ($5k) while being able to make extra payments on debts averaging $2000/mo. If I can sustain this pace, I should be able to pay off the high-rate debts and the tax debt within about two years, nuke the remainder of the credit cards within a year after that, and get started on the student loans. Maybe I’ll get them paid off before I turn 50, likely long before they get old enough for forgiveness. 

Anyway, refinancing my HELOC into a fixed-rate mortgage could really help me out, but I know I won’t qualify based on DTI. My rideshare income doesn’t count toward DTI, and worse I’m told that my salary doesn’t either because I’m self-employed; my bank says they will look at the average over the last two years considering both my personal and business returns. That’s going to hurt me; in 2019 my profit on paper was only $28k (gross revenue $140k) and in 2020 while my take-home was good at about $80k and revenue was good at $200k, the corporation technically took a significant loss for tax purposes. 

A refinance of my home equity could save me a lot of interest and monthly payments, which would let me pay the rest of the debt off a lot sooner. Based on comparable sales, I would estimate my home value at between $80k and $120k, most likely somewhere around 90. I qualify for a VA loan, so theoretically I should be able to get 90% LTV so we’re talking about around $80k. That would mean refinancing the existing HELOC ($53k), the construction loan ($15k), and then about $12k worth of other debts, which could for example close out two of the accounts in the credit counseling plan. 

But, I know that if everything is added together (including the semi-undocumented tax debt) my DTI is going to be over 40% even after the refinance. And in addition, my home is in questionable condition, with a few repairs needed that may come up on an appraisal. 

So after all that, my question is this: Are there banks out there that are eager enough to lend that they would consider refinancing a house to a debtor with a DTI over 40% and tax debt? Would it even matter that my current “uncountable” income puts me back in line with the 40% guideline, and that technically the tax debt hasn’t even been acknowledged yet?

I’ve kind of come to a place of accepting that it’s not going to happen, and I’ve planned around it. I’m already on track to have the 10% loan paid off within a year, and after that my interest rates are all manageable except, ironically, my student loans. Then I just have to make a hard decision between snowball and avalanche, with fairly extreme numbers - the most expensive debt at 7.9% also being the second highest balance at around $60k, with the next worst debt being an $80k balance at 6.8%, while I’ve got no shortage of smaller debts at lower interest rates. I’m also facing the conundrum of whether to focus on repaying student loans when forgiveness might be on the horizon; maybe a political solution, or maybe my mental health degrades further, as is likely inevitable, and I’m able to get disability forgiveness. 

Maybe my question is silly. It’s certainly starting to seem so after writing it all out. Should I even care whether I can refinance at this point?",finance

[https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-tax](https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes) [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-allies-rally-against-ignorant-new-tax-rules-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-11627578844) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1420724068286926853)
19. But this bill is an even bigger deal. If passed as-is, we can probably say RIP to the Wild West Era of crypto (2009-2021). [https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307)

34. We’re now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

35. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy “some things” minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano’s closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it’s EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We’ll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano’s deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system. [https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867](https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867)
37. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

38. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment! [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577) [https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912)

42. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

48. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the “broker” definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers. [https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513](https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513)

It feels like a comedy show the last few days and I just wanted to sum some things up that should make you question your belief system.

1. There was no wallet at launch, and still no good explanation for it than just technical difficulties.
2. the wallet link on their website wasn't connected to anything just to a page refresher
3. there was a report from Doxxlocker about the LP, still no good explanation for this then just business expense
4. Rob's Crypt made a live-stream at the wallet launch and showed in the first few minutes that the creator can do what they want with the LP. they transfer some hours before the launch over 4000 BNB from the LP to a newly created wallet in the last 48 H ( this doesn't prove anything just sketchy)
5. The swap is now live on the Website you can now swap BNB or ""Etheurem"" never heard of the second one but yeah this just shows how professional the team is and we just have to believe right?
6. Price still looks like a soft rug pull

So yeah I could go on and on and yes I have too much time I'm in my exam phase right now and sfm is right now my Netflix show so I just wanted to share it with you all here.

Expect of all the copium in their sub, a shill made an interesting statement I just picked one sentence out of it, you can look it up in the daily from yesterday

""If perhaps sfm was never meant to truly be successful. Hype up a product…under deliver until everyone sells. While all along the devs have been cashing out as top whales. Investors get fed up with the devs underproduction and leave the project.""

And in the End, if you look at it as a gamble I have no problem with it I just wanted to summarise the last few days. That people who may are new or still believe that you just need to believe in the professionalism of the team overthink this a little bit.

But if you still believe this Project will reach 0.1 in the next year I just have a quote for you from the legend himself Carlos mantos:

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency vs other investment,"Hey guys,

The post might be a bit too broad and not solely related to Crypto, but I would rather ask here than in r/Investment.

Some background, I live in Istanbul, Turkey. Have bought some crypto back in January or February at ATH across the whole market, DCA every other month on local minimums. About 70% return on total portfolio, even though half the investment was made back in February/March. I know, I know, shouldn't get too excited, it's the bull market.

So far, the amounts have just been ""gambling money"" aka, amounts I can afford to lose. It got me into Crypto, encouraged me to DYOR, follow the market and get to know the tech. Even made me learn how to create apps on ETH network.

Now, I am at a crossroads. I want to invest more but the risk seems a bit too high for more significant sums of money (for me personally, at least).

The thing is, other investment opportunities seem as risky or have a very low return these days.

\- Right now, the interest rate on Turkish Lira is at about 17% APR. Seems not too bad, considering it has been stable for a couple of month. But it's Turkish Lira, so it can drop 20% any day from a random tweet or a press release. Inflation is also pretty high.

\- Keeping USD also seems unreasonable. The APR is about 0.40% and admittedly it does hold value over TRY. But we all have been hearing about inevitable inflation.

\- Index funds seem very lucrative but again, at the moment they seem very inflated and a near-future correction is on the horizon.

\- Real estate in Istanbul is very overpriced right now. In the past year there has been anywhere near 30-100% increase in house sale prices and rent, depending on the location.

Given all this, what do you think is the best way to invest right now? Of course, if I was thinking long term (10+ years) it wouldn't really matter and I could just throw 75% on an index fund and the rest in Crypto. But I am rather asking about a more short term, say 5+% APR (in USD) in the 2 - 5 years range. Do you think the current bull run is too unpredictable for such a goal?",cryptocurrency
defi,Fixed Income — DeFi’s Next Frontier,"I recently have read an insightful article wirrten by an crypto expert, Terry. He predicts that fixed income will become DeFi's next frontier due to its intrinsic advantage of preserve wealth and diversify risk. 

I excerpt the essence of the article for you to read. If you are interested in the original, you can click on the link to view the column of Terry.[https://medium.com/@terrycktse/fixed-income-defis-next-frontier-3673aab241a8](https://medium.com/@terrycktse/fixed-income-defis-next-frontier-3673aab241a8)

The cornerstone of fixed income markets is the benchmark interest rate. While the mechanics can confound outsiders, the core concept is intuitive. Market players assume bonds issued by governments of G7 sovereigns to be free of credit risk — that is, the full faith and credit of those governments will always redeem their debt. These governments borrow at a rate set by their central banks — the benchmark. Everyone else — including other governments — borrow with a spread on top of that benchmark, where that spread theoretically reflects the credit risk of those borrowers. For instance, if the benchmark is 2%, and one bond yields 5%. The 3% spread, theoretically, reflects its credit risk.

Such was taught in finance textbooks, and such was the way of the financial world for many decades before the crisis of 2008.

The story is now familiar. In order to resuscitate financial markets and to nurse the badly wounded economy back to health, benchmark interest rates effectively became zero for more than a decade since. Governments could borrow at virtually zero cost, so could highly-rated institutions.

And borrow they did. Ministries of Finance around the world effectively conspired with their central banks to print money, and highly rated institutions levered up to buy financial assets. Stock prices soared. Startup valuations soared. Bitcoin soared. Paradoxically, as governments printed more money, government debt piled up, and governments must print more money. The addiction slides further into the deep, and that assumption of no credit risk seems less and less secure. When some US politicians openly called for not paying back China for holding Treasuries, a US default has become a real plausibility.

And yet, the benchmark interest rate stays at zero. Not only is zero interest rate depressing yields of all other fixed income assets, it also fails to price sovereign credit risk. Suddenly, the strange land of DeFi, one where benchmark interest rate does not really exist, does not look so absurd anymore.

As mentioned in the previous article *On the Sustainability of Decentralized Finance*, DeFi must fulfill the need for fixed income in order to attract the vast swath of traditional capital, and pricing it without a benchmark interest rate will be its chief obstacle. There are two broad paths to overcome this:

\- Creation of synthetic fixed income assets through derivatives, for example, a total return swap on a portfolio of crypto assets

\- Introduction of real economy assets that generate cash flows

These paths can cross and combine. They both trace back to the first principles of finance: time value of money, regular payment schedule through economic production, risk and expectations. However, ultimately, no derivative can replace real assets.",cryptocurrency
bonds,"Bonds For Noobs: Part III; RATES, YIELDS AND CURVES","*Central banks do not control long-term interest rates.

CryptoCurrency,How the Fed’s Tapering Impacts Cryptocurrency,"With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently hinting that the central bank could begin tapering this year, investors are curious to see how this could impact cryptocurrency.

Definition: Tapering is when the Fed will gradually decrease its monthly asset purchases, which was done to help the economy during the pandemic. This was known as quantitative easing (QE).

Crypto Connection: When the Fed buys more assets, this results in more liquidity for investors to buy new types of assets, which include crypto. Meaning, it is possible that the surge in crypto prices during the pandemic was linked to the Fed’s QE program.

Fear: There is concern among some investors that tapering will be bad for stocks, which will then make it bad for alternative investments such as crypto.

Bullish: But not everyone is fearful. In June, a portfolio manager at SkyBriddge Capital told Bloomberg that assets such as gold and cryptocurrency will rally if the Fed begins tapering.

Final Thoughts: While there’s no way to know the impact of tapering this early, investors should prepare their portfolios for anything.

2. My immidiate reaction was: ""This does not sound right.""
3. I then proceeded to boot up my computer and look for articles. I found a few articles from 4 days ago claiming ""Cuba is looking into legalizing cryptocurrency"", but official sources (as in, actual legal/official documents) were lacking. I had to dig deeper.
4. One article claimed *""According to the* ***resolution published by the*** [***Central Bank of Cuba***](https://www.bc.gob.cu/)*, a series of rules will be established for the granting of licenses to providers of cryptographic services within the island.""*
5. So the article was claiming there's a resolution by the Central Bank of Cuba related to Cryptocurrencies. This is what I needed to go after.
6. I followed the provided link only to discover it just links to the main page of The Central Bank of Cuba. Lucky for me, I do understand a bit of spanish and looked around for more information. It was easy, and I managed to come upon [this article.](https://www.bc.gob.cu/noticia/banco-central-de-cuba-regula-el-uso-de-criptomonedas-en-el-territorio-nacional/1273)
7. The headline is *""Banco Central de Cuba regula el uso de criptomonedas en el territorio nacional"".* This translates into ""Cuba's Central Bank **regulates** the use of cryptocurrencies on national territory"".
8. Notice how it says ""**regulates**"" and not ""**legalizes**"". As a lawyer, I gotta tell you there is a big difference here. Speaking from a very foundational basis, nothing is illegal unless there are laws to dictate it as such. So, for something to be ""legalized"", it needs to no longer be illegal. Marijuana use, for instance, is *illegal* in some states and people claim for it to be *legalized* as in ""not a crime to consume marijuana"". Regulating marijuana use would be a whole other thing, like limiting who can buy, who can sell, a minimum of standards for the product to follow etc etc etc.
9. In the case of Cryptoassets, from what I can tell, there was *never any law saying using/having cryptoassets are illegal in Cuba*. Thus, if it **wasn't illegal in the first place, then it's not being legalized**.
10. However, as I said before, the Central Bank of Cuba is, indeed, **regulating** cryptoassets.
11. The regulations come in form of  ""GOC-2021-814-EX73 **RESOLUCIÓN 215/2021**"", signed by Marta Sabina Wilson González, ""Ministra Presidente del Banco Central de Cuba"".  This is the official document, made public on the official government website of ""Gaceta Oficial"" (Cuba Government's very own 'Official Diary', where they publicize laws, regulations and such for the public): [https://www.gacetaoficial.gob.cu/sites/default/files/goc-2021-ex73.pdf](https://www.gacetaoficial.gob.cu/sites/default/files/goc_2021-o73.pdf)
12. The document is **3 pages long**, so it's very succinct.

&amp;#x200B;

This is about to get heavy/boring, so bear with me. If you would kindly open the link in point 11, we can look into the actual document.

&amp;#x200B;

Legal/official documents that have a purpose usually have a few ""preceding points"" that give context to what's being passed/proposed. This is the case with this document. The words ""POR CUANTO"" appear in all caps five times, and they mean, essentially, ""CONSIDERING"".

&amp;#x200B;

The third ""CONSIDERING"" point reads as follows:

`POR CUANTO: El Decreto-Ley 361 de 2018 antes referido, dispone en sus artículos 60 y 63 que la unidad monetaria de la República de Cuba es el peso cubano, y que los billetes y monedas metálicas emitidos por el Banco Central de Cuba son los únicos que poseen curso legal con plenos efectos liberatorios para todas las obligaciones en el territorio nacional`

Let me translate this one for you:

*""CONSIDERING: The before mentioned Law-Decree 361 of 2018 disposes in Articles 60 and 63 that* ***the monetary unit of The Republic of Cuba is the cuban peso, and that bills and metallic coins emitted by the Central Bank of Cuba are the only ones that have any legal tender*** *for all obligations on the national territory""*

In essence, this new regulation says that **Cryptocurrencies do not have legal tender** in Cuba. THIS DOES NOT MEAN CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE LEGAL OR ILLEGAL. This people are not obligated to take Crypto as payment, but they are obligated to take Cuban Pesos (in the form of bills and/or metallic coins) as payment.

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth ""CONSIDERING"" point reads as follows:

`POR CUANTO: El uso de activos virtuales aconseja exponer la posición del Banco Central de Cuba al respecto, pues aun cuando dichos activos virtuales y los proveedores de esos servicios operan fuera del Sistema Bancario y Financiero, su manejo implica riesgos para la política monetaria y la estabilidad financiera, debido a la alta volatilidad que los caracteriza y llevarse a cabo en redes de datos en el ciberespacio, por lo general descentralizadas, sin que exista control de emisión, regulación, supervisión oficial, régimen sancionador, ni respaldo de autoridades monetarias, lo que implica además, peligros de que sean utilizados para financiar actividades delictivas, dada la excesiva anonimidad de los usuarios registrados en dichas redes y de las transacciones que de su uso se derivan.`

Let me translate this one for you (my spanish isn't very good so I'm taking a few liberties here and there)

""*CONSIDERING: The usage of virtual assets forces The Central Bank of Cuba to expose a position about it, because* ***while said virtual assets and their service providers operate outside of Cuba's Financial and Banking System, their handling implicates risks for monetary policy and financial stability thanks to the high volatility that characterizes them***\*. While generally decentralized, without control of emission, regulation, official supervision, sanctioning regiment, nor being backed by any monetary authority, it's implicated there are dangers that they are used to finance illegal/delective activities, given the excessive anonimity for users registered in said networks and the transactions that derive""\*

In essence, this means that Cuba's Central Bank considers cryptoassets a risk to monetary and financial stability, while also recognizing they are too big to ""criminalize"". This means, instead, they rather regulate it instead of fight it. This is important, and pretty much the conclusion so it will be *verbatim* down there.

&amp;#x200B;

Article 5 of the Resolution says

`QUINTO: Los órganos u organismos de la Administración Central del Estado, las organizaciones políticas, de masas y sociales y demás instituciones, controlan y supervisan que sus entidades subordinadas y las formas asociativas de las que son órganos de relación, se abstengan de utilizar activos virtuales y los servicios de estos, en transacciones comerciales, monetario mercantiles o para satisfacer obligaciones pecuniarias, salvo en los casos que autorice el Banco Central de Cuba.`

I'm not going to literally translate this one for you, but this essentially says that Oficial State organs, political parties, official institutions and such **abstain** from the usage of cryptoassets, *unless expressively authorized by The Central Bank of Cuba* (as in, a written document authorizing the usage of cryptoassets).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR**

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't know about you but I'm getting tired*. **What's the fucking conclusion, then, Harucifer?**

The conclusion is this: **Cuba's government considers cryptoassets a risk to monetary and financial stability, while also recognizing they are too big to ""criminalize"". This means, instead, they rather regulate it instead of fight it. This is what this document is: Crypto regulation, not ""legalization""**. Also Crypto is not going to be ""legal tender"" in Cuba.

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever says ""this is BULLISH FOR CRYPTO!"" clearly doesn't understand **jack shit** about politics, economics, and probably has a very small clue about Cryptoassets too. This isn't bullish, this isn't bearish. This is just a State regognizing crypto as a big deal and regulating it. Don't trust random posts. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

personalfinance,Bi-weekly payments for refinanced mortgage. Not!,"I recently refinanced my mortgage for a lower interest rate and everything went according to plan. Well, everything except the bi-monthly payments part. Yes, the loaner accepts both bi-weekly and advance payments. The kicker is a sentence included in my statement that says the loaner will not apply any money unless the full required amount is available. This means that the 1-of-2 payment is held in limbo until the 2-of-2 payment is received.

So, the loaner collects interest on my first payment while waiting for my second payment, and also while interest accrues on my loan. So, what's the point of making bi-weekly payments? Will I benefit more from making additional principle payments as a second payment or just pay every four weeks along with the principle amount?

Damn it! I actually feel like steam is coming out of my ears. Am I overthinking this?

CryptoCurrency,"How to: Start compounding Crypto by Staking, Lending or Liquidity Providing!","**Introduction:** I’ve noticed many are still uncertain on what, how and where to compound their crypto. Not having time to doing research or being wary of doing something wrong many chose to let their BTC, ETH, ERC-20’s etc. sit idle in their mobile wallet.

One of the wonders of crypto and [DEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance), is that you easily can beat a banks interest by many multipliers, on top for your asset gaining value! Especially interesting is easily being able to earn great interest rates for stable coins for up to 8% [APR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp) or more! If you compound your interest  e.g. weekly, the % rate of return increases and its what we call [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp). An example is if you have 70% APR but compound your gains weekly, you get and APY for 100% (A nice [APR-APY calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/apy))

Always examine if there are staking, or lending options for your crypto; because it almost always is. Let me show you a few examples to explore. *Disclaimer: Prices are per 30.08 and 31.08; I started writing this yesterday.*

# Staking and Earning:

**1) Staking with your own private crypto wallet**(*reminder: always use hardware-wallet if possible like* [*Ledger*](https://www.ledger.com/) *or* [*Trezor*](https://trezor.io/) *for security)*. By staking your coin or tokens on your protocol of choice: You typically contribute to the security of the chain by validating blocks (like ETH, SOL and MATIC). Usually you have  delegate to validator such as on (ADA or FTM), or just let it sit in your wallet (ALGO).  In DEFI-projects, typically help vote on governmental proposals and/or earn percentages of the revenue (AAVE, SUSHI, Pancakeswap, YFI, 1Inch etc.). Typically you get a lock-up period, but this varies. Examples are of popular ""stakable"" crypto and APR  are:

* **Polkadot** 13.4%
* **CRO** 12%
* **MATIC** 11%
* **AVAX** 9.68%
* **FTM** 9.64%
* **SOL** 6.27%
* **ADA** 6.24%
* **ETH** 5.62% (wait until you can join staking pools or use 3rd party – see below)
* **ALGO** 5.5%
* **AAVE** 4.61%

**2) Staking or “Earning” via. Centralized 3rd party/client:** By letting the platform hold or lock-up your crypto, they give you rewards. The mechanism here varies. Often you get great rates, and insurance, however you are no NOT in charge of your coins should something happen like regulation! Examples are:

* **Staking for you:** Example is Ethereum since it ATM is complex to stake by yourself, platforms such as [Lido](https://stake.lido.fi/) (stake via ledger), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/eth2) and [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/eth-2-0-staking) provides staking options (Careful, your funds will typically be locked until Eth 2.0 launch). Soon Staking-pools ([Rocketpool](https://www.rocketpool.net/)) will go live, making staking a lot more easy.
* **“Earn”:** Platform’s and Wallet providers such as **Celsius, Crypto.com, NEXO** and **BlockFi** acts like a crypto bank, where you hold your crypto in their wallet, while they make money lending it out. Examples are:
* [Celsius](https://celsius.network/rates/) APY (**8.8% on stable coin**s like USDC or DAI, and variable rates on a great selection crypto like **BTC 6.2%, ETH 5.35%**, MATIC 10.5%, AAVE 4.86% and UNI 2.5%).
* [NEXO](https://nexo.io/earn-crypto) APY (**10% on stable coins** like USDC or DAI, **and up to 8%** on other crypto such as **BTC, ETH,** LINK and XRP but fewer options than Celsius).
* [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/eea/earn) APY (10% stable coins. BTC 4,5% and Eth 5,5%. If you hold CRO the rewards can be increased)

# Decentralized Lending:

Decentralized protocols like [AAVE](https://app.aave.com/), [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/) (COMP) and many others on different chains give you the possibility to join a decentralized bank, where you can use your own web3 wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Trustwallet](https://trustwallet.com/), Coinbase wallet etc.) to lend/deposit your crypto via battle-testet smart contracts. I personally access my funds via Metamask in my browser, and sign transaction on my hardware wallet Ledger.  The only risk here is if the smart contract gets hacked. Oh, and when you deposit your crypto, it can work as a collateral where you can borrow other crypto or more of the same crypto, that you can trade or deposit again to earn interest on the borrowed crypto.

* **Aave** current APY on following assets (On ETH Mainnet, other rates on Polygon and soon Harmony): DAI 6.95%, USDC 7.5%, **ETH 0.38%, wBTC 0.96% etc**.
* **Compound** current APY on following assets: 2.7%, USDC 3.29%, **ETH 0,13%, wBTC 0.45%** and AAVE 0.4% etc.

Interestingly there are protocols like [Yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/vaults) (YFI), where you deposit your crypto or LP-tokes (see below) into a “vault” smart contract where it through complex algorithms tries to find the best rates through various DEFI platforms for you.

* Current APY on Yearn: DAI 5.18%, USDC 6.41%, **ETH 1.08%, wBTC 3,45%** and AAVE 34.96%. There are many choices here and more to come here.

# Liquidity providing (LP) and “farming” with LP-tokens:

The one with **highest yields**, but also ***highest RISK!*** Here you [provide liquidity](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi), typically by depositing a pair like e.g. ETH and USDC to a “Pool” (smart contract) that will be traded upon by the users. Here are many options, but the most know being e.g. UniSwap (UNI) Curve (CRV), Sushiswap (SUSHI). Where Curve and Sushiswap also have integrated other blockchains than ETH, such as Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, BSC etc. You in return receive LP-tokes (Liquidity Provider).

* You earn percentages of the trading fees on the pair on the platform. exchanges has “Farming options” where you can deposit the LP-tokens to receive additional rewards, such as Sushiswap.
* LP provides new forms of risk besides hack of smart contract, such as [Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) (You REALLY need to understand this first!) if your pair has high volatility and “Rug-pulls” (cool [list](https://rugdoc.io/)) from sketchy exchanges exiting or scamming with the liquidity.
* Here is potential for insane farming APY’s on new exchanges on the growing “Alt-coin” chains, that offers these rates in order to draw the much needed liquidity from other exchanges and competing blockchains in order to grow, and provide low price slippage to its customers.
* “Yield Farming” on the new protocols has since it’s introduction been one of the hottest trends in DEFI.
* Ethereum being congested causing high gas fees, has drawn many Yield farmers to other growing chains like Polygon, BSC, Fantom, Harmony, lately Solana and AVAX.

Examples of front-running DEXes (there so many more on the different chains) with Farms on these chains are:

1. Polygon’s [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick) (QUICK) APY: ETH-USD 35%, wBTC-USDC 30%, MATIC-USDC 68%, ETH-BTC 9%, AAVE-ETH 13%, LINK-ETH 17%, QUICK-MATIC 40%, ETH- MATIC 24%.
2. BSC’s [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms) (CAKE) APY:  BTCB-ETH 7.4%, BTCB-BUSD 20%, ETH-USDC 14,8%, BNB-ETH 13.4%, CAKE-BNB 37%, CAKE-USDT 49% etc.
3. Solana’s [Raydium](https://raydium.io/farms/) (RAY) APY: RAY-pairs high with RAY-ETH 124%, RAY-SOL 92%, RAY-USDT 143%, RAY-SRM 99%.
4. Fantom’s [Spookyswap](https://spookyswap.finance/farms) (BOO) and [Spiritswap](https://app.spiritswap.finance/#/farms) (SPIRIT): FTM-USDC 392%, ETH-FTM 138%, BTC-FTM 114%, BNB-FTM 161%, SUSHI-FTM 150%, LINK-FTM 143%, YFI-FTM 162%, FTM-AAVE 114% etc.
5. Harmony’s [Viperswap](https://viperswap.one/#/staking/pools) (VIPER) APY (*Though Sushi-swap is the biggest here*): ONE-BTC 76%, ONE-ETH 26%, ONE-1USDC 138%, BNB-VIPER 675%, LINK-VIPER 216% etc.
6. AVAX’ [Pangolin](https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/png/1)(PNG): AVAX-PNG 68%, AVAX-wETH 116%, AVAX USDT 260%, AVAX-LINK 60%, PNG-ETH 75%, PNG-LINK 33% and more.

There are literally hundreds of different “Farming pairs” on these exchanges, and many shady or up-and-coming exchanges on these chains.  Be careful, as many of the token pairs are hardcore “shitcoins” money-grabs and probable scam that can offer e.g. &gt;300% APR. Often if it’s too good to be true, it most likely is! I recommend staying to only known crypto pairs you trust and DYOR before trying to ride the wild horse of price dumps, exit scams and bad tokenomics, like the millions lost in the TITAN “bank run”. However, the DEFI-pro’s find the gems (both pairs and exchanges) with high APR and move around chains and exchanges when the APR falls or price pumps for maximize gains. Their path they keep a secret, as most gains are when you are early.

# Ending:

Now that you got an idea, go out and explore your options. Don’t spoil this opportunity to earn interest and compound your crypto while these wild rates exist in order to draw users to their platforms while this space is new. Congratulations, you made it thought!

personalfinance,Tax Filing Status,"\[throwaway account bc I'm including some personal financial details here\]

My husband and I got married earlier this year (yay!), but are struggling with how we should file taxes given our financial situation. His gross salary is \~60K, mine is \~130K.

He has a decent chunk of law school loans (\~$200K), all federal, and is on an income-based repayment plan, so he's been paying \~$300/month in loans (pre-COVID forbearance) while Single. If we add my income to the mix / file jointly, that monthly payment jumps to \~$1100/month. It's obviously doable, but puts a dent in our take-home pay and our ability to save/invest the difference instead. The obvious solution (at first) looks like it makes sense to file separately then, but I know there are considerable downsides to this as well.

I can't imagine we're the only married couple to face this situation, so looking for some guidance from anyone that's done out some back of the napkin math to see what makes the most sense or any tools/calculations anyone has used to solve this conundrum. (I've tried reaching out to a few local accountants, but have yet to hear back from any of them. We'll still explore that route as official guidance, but figured we'd see what reddit had to say in the meantime!)

Other details in case it matters: we have a mortgage, but no other debt. No children (yet). Live in MA.

CryptoCurrency,The problem with the current state of NFTs,"People falsely believe that owning an NFT means that they 100% ""own"" that image. This is untrue and it's kind of sad the depths that people go to defend this stance.

When you purchase an NFT you essentially own a random string of characters on a blockchain (this is overly simplified but it just means a smart contract called a ERC721 or ERC1155). Most individual marketplaces (opensea, rarible, etc) then have their own **centralized databases** where the metadata (the actual image and all of its characteristics) is stored. They then assign that metadata to the number you own on the chain so they can keep track of which image is assigned to each smart contract.

Extremely loose example of a marketplaces database:

|Metadata|Smart contract|
|:-|:-|
|X (your actual ape jpeg image)|Y (the numbers you own on chain)|

They do this because things like Ethereum don't have enough capacity to handle both the metadata and the contract on-chain. This is known as an ""off-chain storage solution"" and is the most common method of storing NFTs.

In short, when you buy an NFT you simply own a smart contract while the marketplace you bought it on holds the metadata (the image itself).

Where this can cause issues:

**Centralization**: If the server (aws or their own servers) that one of these marketplaces hosts NFTs on were to go down the metadata (your image) could simply disappear and there would no longer be an image connected to your NFT smart contract.

Hypothetical examples: Let's say you bought something on opensea and the company failed and their aws server (amazon web services) or their own server went away. If you were to try to open your nft in another wallet there would no longer be the metadata (the actual image) connected to it. Not only this, but say there was a bad dev at one of these marketplaces that had access to the centralized database of NFT metadata. In theory, this bad actor could alter the data of an expensive NFT and make it connect to their own smart contract, making the NFT essentially their own. With the way NFTs currently work buyers are completely dependent on these individual marketplace databases.

There are some more temporary solutions to this (sorta) like distributed filesharing databases where NFT metadata is stored and immutable. But the effectiveness of this depends on how many nodes contribute and how long it stays up. Keep in mind there is no incentive to run this like there is to be a node on a blockchain as there are rewards.

**Existing legal structure**: If the original artist were to go copyright that image with the U.S. copyright office they would then have full legal rights to the image via a real federal entity, regardless of what a blockchain says. The string of characters you have on a blockchain, and the metadata connected to it in a marketplaces server, are not legally recognized as ownership of anything. If that original artist tried to claim your NFT or the money you earned from it you could potentially win in court but it would be hard to make an old judge understand the complexity there.

How this will work better in the future:

Things like bitcoin or some other cryptos work because they exist entirely within the blockchain and people have an incentive to continue running it because of mining/staking rewards. If you own the string of characters in the chain then you own that crypto and no one can take that away from you unless you lose your seed or give it to someone.

We need chains that can also house both the metadata of an NFT and the contract under one roof for this to really work as cryptos are intended to work - completely decentralized without the need for a third party. This way the NFT is represented from top to bottom within the chain. We could also add copyright data in the same way. Or, perhaps one day we will all begin relying on blockchain data as legal proof of ownership and have no need for a legal authority such as the US copyright office (Ideally). This is 100% necessary for physical art. Until we all recognize that ownership of an NFT represents legal rights we can never use it for physical art.

Until that day the ""ownership"" of an NFT is still very wishy-washy. You just own a thing on a chain that may (hopefully?) represent a one-of-one image but it is entirely dependent on where and how the metadata is stored.

I respect those who have gotten crazy gains on NFTs and it's fun to speculate. It just seems that the purpose and intent of crypto to begin with has been lost and forgotten. An overwhelming majority of traders or investors are in it for insane gains and it feels like very few actually understand the point of it all... which makes me sad but apes gunna ape I guess.

If I am off in any of my assessments then pls correct me in a non-condescending douchebag way. Keep it chill

Edit: People have noted that either a ""hash"" or the URL of the metadata stored in the marketplace's database may be stored on the smart contract itself. This is somewhat helpful, though it doesn't entirely solve the issues I have mentioned above imo.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,FTX (Formally Blockfolio) offers some of the best interest rates for cryptocurrency,"As the title says I’ve recently found out that FTX (Blockfolio) offers a flat 8% APR on a host of crypto including BTC, ETH, LINK etc which pays daily in the crypto held.

This is particularly interesting especially as other interest aggregators like BlockFI have lowered their APY rates and Celcius advertises 12% but that is only for Stablecoins and getting paid in the Celcius token.

While there are a few key coins missing like DOT, and you can get higher APR on stablecoins and coins like MATIC elsewhere it is a very good place to hold your coins like BTC, ETH and LINK as it has the best rates I’ve seen.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 31, 2021","The rally in equities somewhat cooled today, with all three major indexes trading modestly red today but are on track to close out a stellar month, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) gaining more than 2.5% in August, its seven straight month of gains. So far, the SPY is up a staggering 20% year-to-date. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.

BMO Capital Markets became the latest financial firm to raise its end of the year price target for the SPY. Brian Belski, the company’s Chief Investment Strategist, wrote in a note to clients that he now expects the index to end the year at $480, up from his original estimate of $450. He cites the “blistering rate” of corporate earnings amid a strengthening economic backdrop. 

Despite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minutes, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.”

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy-maker thinks of the current state of the economy

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

James Liu, Founder and CEO of Clearnomics, said of Powell’s speech, “We do think that tapering, in general, will be a non-event, most likely because first, the market has had time to react throughout this year. The Fed has done a great job telegraphing this. Whether it’s September or November for the announcement of taper will really depend on the jobs report coming up and some more economic data. But regardless, the market seems to expect it at this point. This is very different from 2013 when the market had to adjust very abruptly to taper.” In my humble opinion, I totally agree with this sentiment.

**Highlights**

* U.S. home prices surged by the most in 30 years at the beginning of this summer as tight inventory levels and elevated demand combined to drag on affordability. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index jumped 18.6% in June over last year, accelerating from a 16.8% rise in May. This also marked the 13th straight month of accelerating price increases.
* Footwear startup Allbirds, which is known for making shoes with only environmentally safe and sustainable materials, filed to go public via IPO. Its backers include Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Adidas, which has partnered with the company to make a range of sustainable sneakers. 
* The intense regulatory crackdown in China continues. Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party announced minors were forbidden to play video games for more than three hours a week (only on the weekends). Recently, state media has been rallying against video games, calling them “spiritual opium”. The restrictions apply to any devices including phones and are a massive blow to the global gaming industry that caters to tens of millions of young players in the world's most lucrative market.
* Shares of Zoom (ZM, the defining work from home stock, slid more than 15% after reporting earnings due to concerns of growth slowing down.
* Tesla (TSLA) received regulatory approval from the Indian government that certifies all car models as “roadworthy”. This is big as India is the world’s second-most populous country.

solar,"New to Solar, looking for Feedback on First Quote","So I recently started the process of looking at solar, had my first visit with a company and was hoping you guys could help me with feedback on the company (don't worry I'm getting two more quotes) to see if anyone has dealt with them, and then feedback on their proposals and where I am leaning.

I live in Connecticut and use Eversource for my power.  The company is Venture Solar ([www.venturesolar.com](https://www.venturesolar.com)). They utilize LG 375 watt panels, saying they are a tier 1 panel that even at the end of their life will be at 91% utilization.  For battery they are quoting an Enphase Encharge saying they are superior to the Tesla Powerwall they were previously using.  They also use Enphase microinverters. 

I have a larger home, and are quoting me a yearly system of 13,151 kilowatts per year.  He acknowledged this is a massive system, but is basing it on the two months i've lived in the house during the summer and had insane electricity costs.  There are two options:

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1 - PPA (not a fan of)**

* No upfront, charge me $0.192 per unit (vs power company of $0.22. 
* Yearly escalator of 2.9%
* End of 25 years zero dollar purchase

**Option 2 - Finance/Purchase**

* 1.9% loan 
* No prepayment penalty
* Average monthly payment would be $335/month for the panels and the battery, which if I do not apply my federal tax credit towards the purchase would end up being $462/month (which means this is the real monthly charge and they are using the tax credit to reduce the interest burden)
* They said that eversource gives its customers an connected solutions incentive to draw on my battery when I'm producing at set rate that he claims is contractually written for 5 years

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm leaning heavily towards the finance purchase option.  Like I said I'm getting multiple quotes, but wanted to see what feedback everyone had on the company itself, and if this seems inline with what I should expect.",energy
CryptoCurrency,"Politics are in our crypto sub to stay, but it's how we respond and conduct ourselves that matters","I've observed lately that some folks here tend to get outright upset or otherwise bristle at the very idea that politics come into play when discussing certain crypto subjects. And other times, I've seen things just get flat out mean and nasty. However, like it or hate it, politics are a major part of our society and daily lives, and so they naturally will bleed into the cryptocurrency sub at times. As distasteful as this may seem to some of you, I would contend that, *where relevant to the subject matter*, the inclusion of politics interjected into a given crypto discussion should be embraced and welcomed by everyone here. 

We all know that monetary policy, financial reform, regulation, security, privacy, and related concerns that directly impact cryptocurrency, are chiefly proposed, decided, and passed into law strictly outside of this sub in the ""real"" world. However, to counter this, I’ve witnessed a tremendous groundswell of response, support, activism, and solidarity from this community that is simply awe inspiring. From this, I know that when it matters, we do have the strength of character and unity of purpose to amass an effective response. This sincerely makes me proud to be a member of this sub!
 
Now, some cryptocurrency posts are created with a specific embedded political agenda to be discussed as it relates to crypto, which is needed and great. And, of course, not every post requires or needs an infusion of politics in the discussion nor would we want to see that. However, I guess what I'm saying is, that sometimes there is a good reason to rope in a political point of view into a crypto discussion (again where relevant) that wasn’t necessarily coming in with a political point to make. And, in those cases, IMO we shouldn’t necessarily shit on those comments just for the sake of shitting on them like the unmoderated, mind numbing savages at Facebook and Twitter. Rather, IMO, we should strive to be better than that; hell, we are Reddit and we ARE better than that! We should be more open-minded and accepting in these instances, while also practicing a reasonable and respectful tolerance for the hopefully constructive political views expressed by others here in our community. 

I realize that this is a contentious issue and a hot button topic for some, and I’m not trying to stir up a big pot of shit. I just hate to see a degeneration into political haymaker throwing on Reddit, when I know that we are fully capable of taking the high ground and having fruitful and constructive discourse.
 
The above being said, I'm frankly not a fan of politics regularly being seeded into our crypto banter, and thankfully this is not the case. I get it, many view this sub as sort of a refuge from the political chaos that taints many of the other subs outside of this one.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,DeFi- Beginner's guide,"Decentralized Finance

or “DeFi” is an independently operating financial system that does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries like banks, unions or insurance funds.

The users, with the use of smart contracts, have the ability to trade, invest, and transact peer to peer using crypto currencies.

This eliminates the middle man which in this case are the slow and costly intermediaries.

DeFi is a complex financial use case of blockchain, helping in taking the right step towards mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain technology. Other such cases include flash loans, derivatives, yield farming and lending.

Why DeFi?

Centralized financial systems are slow, costly and vulnerable to data hacks, breaches and security issues. To make understanding the concept of DeFi simpler, think of a scenario where your bank makes a bad investment, or increases its fees. It ends up with the customer losing out.

In DeFi, the products, applications, and services, as well as the assets they service, are decentralized and therefore free from these points of failure found in centralized financial systems.

Advantages of DeFi

Users have the flexibility to trade and transact with nothing but an internet connection, eliminating any scope of discrimination taking place

Instant and fast transfers along with reduced fees and charges are the most immediate benefits a user can observe while using DeFi. There are none to minimal intermediaries, reducing the need of paying the said intermediaries using fees.

DeFi lending protocols offer high interest rates for deposits along with low fees and favorable terms on loans and line of credit

DeFi offers equitable access to financial services to all and anyone with just an internet connection.

Yield farming allows investors to borrow and lend their crypto currencies at much higher rates than traditional banking and investments

This has been a thorough overview of what DeFi is, and how it is useful to the crypto community. I would like to make a follow up post on DeFi in detail

ethereum,Battle royale gamified governance: BRGG,"Battle royale gamified governance: BRGG

User logs into ""game"" using web3 wallet, the ""game"" detects governance tokens present in their wallet.

The user chooses the ""weight"" of their vote, which is how many tokens they want to vote with.

Based on the weight the game will make the playable character bigger/smaller and slower/faster.

For example if a player is only casting one vote their speed will be 100 and their size will be 1. If a player is casting 100 votes their speed will be 1 and their size will be 100.

The game itself is very simple. It will be a battle royale style 3rd person game with basic 3d graphics wherein at game start each player needs to run to a central point and ""cast a vote"" by interacting with a pillar in the center of the level before a timer runs out.

Game is online multiplayer with crude 3d graphics so virtually any device will be able to run it. So anyone with any mobile or computing device + an internet connection can “vote”.

So if lets say a VC whale wants to use 1 million tokens to sway a vote they will get a huge slow character that cannot keep up with the movement speed of the others with fewer votes, and they will be so big they will have to move around obstacles the smaller players can run underneath for example.

It will be very difficult to reach the pillar under the time limit to vote if the player is too big/slow thereby incentivizing casting a single vote. The player can choose any vote weight they would like but the game mechanics will punish them if their player is too big/slow. Other players can also punish them.

The game could have two abilities- jump and leg sweep. Players run/jump to avoid obstacles and can leg sweep each other which causes a player to fall down/get up thereby wasting time.

Since the game is multiplayer 3rd person the players can ""see"" the bodies of the other players. A number of single voters could ""mob"" a whale player with melee attacks to further prevent them from casting a vote further incentivizing using a single vote to ""play"" this voting game. To leg sweep a whale- lets say 10 single vote players would need to leg sweep them at once.

Since an experience in World Of Warcraft reportedly encouraged Vitalik to pursue permission-less decentralized systems I thought gamifed governance might be appropriate.

Video games are so pervasive in todays society and so many people are so knowledgable and comfortable with interacting with them I don't think gamified governance would be such a crazy thing for current and future generations. Online games also have very advanced ""anti- cheat"" mechanics which would be used to help make ""fair elections"".

dogecoin,RIPER;SECURING A BETTER FUTURE,"**🚜SECURING A BETTER FUTURE** 

💰Bad debt is on the rise in the agricultural sector, with the number of debtors growing exponentially over the past decade. In 2017, bad debt owed by the farming and agriculture sector increased by 362 percent. With tales of farmers being shunned by financial institutions. In despair, farmers turn to illegal money lenders, whose interest rates are outrageous and they exploit farmers that are trying to survive. But what choice do they have? In amid economic meltdown, seeds, fertilizer which are critical to productivity can not be obtained,  

🌲Nature also plays a part in the circle of bad debt, the damage caused by flood and unseasonal rainfall usually affecting the rural areas that are already burdened by the fall of price. Additionally, the lack of storage resources has led to food wastage and the delivery of farm produce that is not fresh, which can’t meet market demand. 📋The Few farmers that succeeded in getting loans in the first place, end up defaulting as a result of drop in price.

🌾The impact of agriculture in every nation is significant. In India for example, the agric sector accounts for 15 percent of the country’s  $2.8 trillion economy and is a source of livelihood for more than half of its 1.3 billion people. With the rise of interest rate and drop in price, farmers earnings will reduce considerably, impacting the overall industry, especially the rural areas 

Various schemes have been announced by the government and corporate entities to write off some of these debts but such promises were never kept. Lenders no longer lend as usual because farmers fail to pay back.

Centralization has failed to effectively play its role in the agricultural sector. Financial institutions are more profit-oriented than value-oriented. However, this is not the case with decentralization. Blockchain has provided means of fighting the anomalies that lurk in the agricultural industry. 🎈Blockchain is delivering innovative means of curtailing the defects, such as the opportunity of farmers to set up their own price, which will optimize the supply chain.

🌻Different agricultural projects are coming into the cryptospace to help transform the niche. One of such brands is Riper, which is focused on alleviating the plight of farmers, helping farmers get out of debt while providing options for them.

⛓️With such a concept in place, farmers can sell their farm produce conveniently, lowering transaction fees, providing a means of receiving payments and microfinancing. There’s also a provision for crop insurance, which is an absolutely brilliant means of protecting farm produce. This can be done by providing more visibility across the supply chain, documentation and registration of the parties involved (price, location, date),😜 securing insurance documents, Dot numbers, pickup documents and much more.

It has been an unfriendly adventure for farmers, a sad tale, 🔧 living as low-income earners because they lack the tools and resources to “work right”. But with the rise of blockchain and the platform provided by Riper, we witness new dawn in the agricultural sector.",cryptocurrency
