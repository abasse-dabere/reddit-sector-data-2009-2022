personalfinance,Trying to figure out our withholdings to see if we'll owe next year,"Hello everyone - hoping to get some answers/guidance on my wife and I's tax situation... we owed $1980 this past April and are just trying to make sure we don't owe next year, or at least get prepared to owe something and see what we can do about it.

We will make around $156,000 in 2019 and I'm due a bonus of around $9000 - but that won't be paid out until 2020, which I don't think applies to 2019 tax year. This past March, I received a bonus of $2,200 which I would think is applied to 2019 tax year... For the sake of this, we'll go with yes. So gross income in 2019: $158,200

We have no kids. We own a house. We live in NH. I put 6% in a 401k that has a 100% match at 6%. We are both claiming 0 and using the married filing jointly w-4 status. We both combined add $220 on top of our fed taxes each month.

With all that known, I used the withholding checkup calculator here: [https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/index.jsp](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/index.jsp) and it's telling me that we will owe around $2800 next year... I'm just a bit confused as to why... Is this simply because our withholding amount from our employers just isn't high enough? And if so, is that because of the new tax law that wen into effect March 2018 that later in 2018 people started realizing they need to check their withholdings?

We also don't know if we should file separately, or change the w-4 to married but withhold at single higher rate...

Any input on this would be great! Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Paying For College,"I am a 21 year old chemistry major who is currently registering to go to Clemson University. I will be transferring from a small school where I was a junior. Transferring to clemson will give me sophomore status with credits most likely. I will need to have two years to finish the BS, taking no less than 17 credits a semester and maybe a summer course.

The degree at clemson is high quality. The issue is money. At clemson, financial aid will allow me to have about $5000 per year, all federal loans + grants. I do not have family financial support so I will have to pay through a private loan most likely.  This is also problematic since I will need a cosigner on these loans. I have gone to everyone in my family and no one, absolutely no one will be a co signer. I dont know what I can do about this.

I can work a part time job, to ensure I have rent money. But this will never come close to doing anything regarding my loans.

By the time I finish, since I already have more loans, I would be around 100k debt, if not more. I have a previous loan that requires $427 a month after graduation. I am not independent financially for government aid purposes as I am under 24. I would like to know if anyone knows of any programs or loans or other alternatives that would be helpful compared to the high interest private loans I know of, which I may not get if no one cosigns. Tuition or payment plans are due August 15.

Is there any way that I can gain independent status so I can try and get some more financial aid money. None of my family will help so I am alone in this. Any advice is good advice.",finance

personalfinance,HELP! Need guidance on how to pay for college.,"(Posting for my SO)

PLEASE HELP : NEED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE ASAP

*Please be easy on me, this is all very overwhelming for me and I am trying my hardest not to fall apart* 

Backstory (very short and not detailed compared to what I can write, but I don‚Äôt want to right too much of a novel):

I will be going to Rutgers starting September this year. (for ecology, evolution, and natural resources, and minoring in animal science) Will be going for about 3 years, and am at a loss of how I am going to pay. I am 24, have my associates from CC in NJ (only was I was able to go was because my dad is an electrician for the school so tuition was free). I moved to CA for 3 years and tried to go to school out there but not a lot of my credits were transferring, so it was going to take me 3 extra years just to have the classes I needed (retaking a bunch that I took in NJ) just to be considered to get into a uni there. So, made the decision to come back and go to RU. 

Mom passed away in 2014. Doing all researched basically by myself and I am going crazy. My dad does not understand a lot of this, and barely anything about college since he didn‚Äôt go. I am extremely grateful he is trying to help me, but it is also exhausting trying to get him to know its just how college is and he can‚Äôt just ask the college not to charge so much. He really lives in his own world and is not up to date with a lot of views and technology. Not in an ‚Äòold tough dad‚Äô kind of way‚Ä¶ more like he‚Äôs just a super happy guy that doesn‚Äôt realize how cold reality can be, very naive and little kid like. 

The dilemma; I am broke:
I moved from cali to nj recently and barely have any savings, about 300-400 to my name. I got a new job and make 18 an hour. Trying to save but only have a month left until school. I am able to transfer in the same company to a location 15 min from RU. Not exactly sure how much I will be working (at the same rate): probably 4 hours 3 days a week.

-My bills are about $800 a month
-my credit score is 663 
-I am $23,175 in debt between my car loan and credit cards (1 wells fargo that I don‚Äôt use that is probably saving me, 1 navy fed, 1 victorias secret)
-Dad does not make a lot of money and lives paycheck to paycheck. 
-Dad makes about $50,000 a year, bills are about $3000 in bills a month.
-Dads credit score is 700
      -he has gone bankrupt in the past but it was 7-10 years ago so it should not show 		       up (according to what I read while researching)

Costs/$ values:
Grand cost for everything per year: about $36,224 (estimated)

-Grants: $8445
    -I also applied to a couple scholarships but have not heard back, they are not for much, maybe 6k total

-Federal loans: I will be taking all that were offered: $6,000 unsubsidized, $4500 subsidized
-Somehow term bill came out to be $5,139 for 1st semester 
	-I called and was on phone for an hour making sure this is right and there won‚Äôt 			be anymore fees added on later. next semester should be about the same 				amount.

Options:
I have tried to prequalify for some private loans by myself but they say I'm not eligible without a cosigner. (I am going to apply for 1 loan just to see what I will be offered) Dad does not want to be cosigner or take out loans since he has had bad credit experiences in the past‚Ä¶ however he recently said he will if its the last option. I have no one else that would be able to cosign but my dad. I know any interest rate will most likely be high. But according to my research if you have good credit it is worth looking at private loans as interest rates could be lower, but if you have ‚Äòeh‚Äô or bad credit and credit history the PLUS loan would probably be a better interest rate.

Got dad to apply for parent plus loan and we did not receive and interest rate yet, but my dad is overwhelmed by how expensive it will be and is scared of it all. He keeps coming up with new plans like : refinance the house to have money to pay half in cash and half with credit card (dont think this is a good idea) ‚Äî dad called around and it won‚Äôt work out anyway. I will be the one to pay my student loans off but he is still scared because he will be on the loan. (Don't get me wrong I am scared too and hope I will have the money, since my field is not the most profitable)

I need to pay my term bill by 8/14/19 or else we get a $140 late fee (which is not a big deal in the grand theme of things) but I am getting nervous because if somehow we come up with the money, we will need another 5k in 4 months for next semester. Dont like the idea of more loans but at least I will not have to worry about getting the money for college each semester while going to school. I really want to make my RU experience as good as it can be and be in certain clubs (such as the equestrian team which will be more fees).

Sorry I know this is long but I wanted to give you guys a backstory so you can see the whole picture. I am really feeling defeated and need guidance. Any suggestions to help me pursue the best route? I am not sure what my next step should be. Any input is greatly appreciated, THANKS GUYS! 

PS sorry if there are any typos or if the setup of the post is confusing, I have no energy left to make it as good as a college essay, and just want to get this post up.

EDIT:Someone requested I provide a breakdown of tuition so here and three screenshots of the breakdown. Thank you!

personalfinance,What happens to my 401k/Roth IRA if I leave US,"Hi everyone,

Background: Age: 27. Not a citizen/permenant resident. Federal tax bracket: 24%. Currently investing in 401k and thinking to open a Roth IRA. Investments: 401k - VINIX60/VTIAX40. ROTH IRA WOULD BE: VTI60/VXUS40. I'll probably change the percentages but keep the funds and add bonds later stage.

Scenario: Considering that I will invest around 6-10% in my 401k and maxing out IRA every year till age 40 (investing monthly for approx. 15 years). If I have to leave US forever, what happens to my IRA or 401k?

Case 1: what would the growth for my IRA and 401k if I stop investing in these accounts after I leave the country. Consider that I'll keep all money I've contributed and gained in these accounts until retirement but I will not make any other monthly payments after leaving the country.

Case 2: For some reason, if I wanted to cash out all the money from either accounts, I've to pay taxes and penalty. Since I will not have any employment, my income would be zero, what would be my taxes then? And 10% penalty?

Case 3: I'll keep my 401k contributions and gains in the account and do not withdraw. What would be the best case for my ROTH? Opening a ROTH IRA or individual investing account? Since I'm not sure whether I'll leave the country or not and even if I leave I don't know if I will withdraw my money, let's assume that I've opened a ROTH IRA. How much more penalty will I be paying if I have to withdraw all of my Roth IRA in comparison with an individual investing account. 

Please advise.

Thank you very much in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"Just opened a Vanguard Roth IRA, now I have nothing but questions","I am 24 years old and just opened my Roth IRA through Vanguard. I'm financially responsible, just not yet savvy to the terminology or the way any of this works.

I deposited $1500 initially and it looks like my account has been confirmed as the funds are available.

I initially planned on putting everything into their 2060 Target Retirement Fund, but would I incur a trading fee every time I contribute money and invest it in this fund? Say I deposit $100 monthly, would it be better to immediately invest this or wait three months and invest $300 due to fees. With this, I was also exploring investing 100% into VTI, then progressing to the mutual fund version when I hit the mutual fund minimum. Are there any benefits to choosing this more fluid approach rather than selecting one of their Target Retirement Funds? I do not plan to be an active trader; this is more of a set-it-and-forget-it approach.

Also, I was trying to set up monthly automatic deposits, but it said I had to ""select a holding"". I have no idea what this is. Further showing my lack of knowledge, ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund"" shows on both the deposit and buy screens. What is this?

I've been searching their website and I can't find answers to much of this (or answers that make sense to me). I know these are probably dumb questions, but I don't want to take stupid actions that are going to lose me money. Thank you so much for any help.",finance
Forex,My Entry Strategy,"So a friend of mine was asking how news updates like the Federal Interest rate being cut affects the marking and how it can be used to trade.

I‚Äôve been trading for a little over a year and becoming more consistent but don‚Äôt have the years of experience under my belt yet so if you have any advise on how this strategy can be better, I‚Äôd love to hear it. 

I really only look at price action. I don‚Äôt use any indicators expect having a 200 SMA on my chart. So if you have an indictatoe you would use trading like this, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.

Anyways, here‚Äôs me responding to my friend with my strategy for the EURUSD trade today. 

___________






EU has been in a downtrend on the larger time frames. I‚Äôve been watching it creep it‚Äôs away down to the major support level indicated with the pink horizontal lines. 

https://imgur.com/a/3aDBkR6

My goal was to wait for it to reach down to that level to see if it bounces off and heads back up, or breaks through the support. It hit support last week and bounces up but failed to pass back over the resistance zone indicated with the black horizontal lines. So when price hit the pink support and failed to cross back over black resistance, that‚Äôs another reason it might breakout below support but still I waited.




.The upcoming news events and their importance are posted on Dailyfx.com and other sites.

From what I read and experienced, big news decisions cause volatility in the market. And for the most part, volatility is usually required for a breakout to happen.  So this is even ANOTHER reason prices might break below pink support but we can‚Äôt know until the news is released.  

As soon as the federal rate was cut and the news came out , the breakout happened and prices fell below pink support and closed below on the 4hr time frame.

(entry option 1)That was my signal to enter a sell position with a stop loss above the pink lines (support now turned into resistance).  

(entry option 2) The smarter thing to do would be wait for the price to pull back to support, retest, fail to climb back over, then I‚Äôd enter. Which would give me a way better risk reward and a greater confirmation that price will continue to drop.

So the key was waiting to see how the news updated would affect the market, then trade the aftermath using technical Analysis


But let‚Äôs say if I had no idea about the fundamental side or the Fed decision, I still had my technical set up ready so once I seen the breakout happen I would of done the same thing regardless.

In this situation, the fed rate decision gave the market the volatility needed for price to break that important level.

So it seems like it‚Äôs good to know when news updates like this happen cause then you can anticipate market volatility and prepare accordingly instead of being blind sided by a sudden spike in price.

https://imgur.com/a/eyPiowe

On the 1H time frame you can see the breakout consolidated for a few hours, then push lower. My plan is to wait for the price to pull back up to retest that last swing low (the yellow highlighted zone) and if the price fails to break and close above my yellow zone, and i see candle sticks with a small body and a long wick on top, that‚Äôs confirmation it‚Äôs going to keep dropping. 

So I‚Äôll probably enter another sell order with a stop loss a few pips above the yellow zone.

My take profit target would be a few pips above the next major level on structure aka support.",finance

I've been browsing it for months now and want to get a step ahead in managing my finances. Thank you all for the great content and helping me become proactive in my finances! &lt;3 

So as the title says, yes, I want to pay off one of my student loans as much as I can within a 6-month time frame and I need help calculating an ideal biweekly payment without breaking the bank. 

For background, I am a college student who will be starting a 6-month marketing internship that will be paying me $20/hr. My program starts in August and ends in December and since there is no guarantee that I will be staying with the company, I want to pay off as much of my loan as possible with this position. 

This specific loan (we'll call it Loan 1) is a private loan of $2500. with a 7.24% fixed interest rate. The total balance with deferred interest is currently $2555.84.

My new job will be paying me every two weeks and I am expecting to work between 20 - 25 hours a week. 

With all that said, how much should I contribute each paycheck (every 2 weeks) to ensure that I can completely pay off or reduce the loan drastically within my 6-month time frame? I currently do not pay any other bills besides general living expenses (food, transportation, etc) and whatever life wants to throw at me. 

I apologize if this is simple math and if I'm overthinking the situation lol. Not the best with numbers so any insight will help. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

 ""You don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'm going to lie to you, make it sound fly to you."" The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. To travel between two points, in a zig zag pattern, you arrive at the final destination, but you have traveled a greater distance, and likely have taken more time. However, for certain terrain, it may be necessary to travel the zig zag path instead of the straight path. And so it is with Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding. What distinguishes and separates mythology, allegories, and science fiction, from pseudo-science, misinformation, and outright lies is that with pseudo-science, misinformation, and lies, the intention of the deliverer of information is to deceive and disempower the receiver of the information. With mythology, allegory, and science fiction, the deliverer of the information has informed the receiver that the information is not true and is intended for entertainment. Thus, the receiver of the information is empowered to separate any fact from the fiction and find knowledge within the information, or just take it as entertainment. One peculiar thing about people is they seem to prefer mythology, and mystery, over reality and reason. Myths have a way of fascinating people, and likewise spellbinding them to the point of no return, no return to Reason and Reality. But, if a person is intelligent enough, he or she can escape to the Real-World of facing facts. The appropriate thing for people to do is come back to reason and reality, come back down to Earth, and deal with the mundane problems, and miserable conditions that affect our lives here on planet Earth, and do it with the laws of Nature and Reason. And this means that we people must use what is in our own power, to solve our own problems, and stop looking to outer space to do for us what we must do for ourselves...

Someday, it's coming soon, if you're reading this, you're going to have to explain to your progeny, or loved one(s) about Bitcoin. Sure, you might be tempted right away to go straight into the technicals, how it works, or the price action. But there's a missing story that a lot of Bitcoiners miss the mark on when introducing Bitcoin, and that's why is this important, how did it come to be... We need to be more cult-like. People of the future will come back to the early years of Bitcoin, and read all the infamous reddit-posts, like the time traveler, etc. what have you, but all this happened after Bitcoin's existence. Yes, we have the genesis block, but we barely have any information about what came before. I was born in the very early 90's, yet much of it has been memory-holed. For the first time ever, we have this truth machine, that'll record anything forever. While I'm not advocating you necessarily lie, we need to tell the story of WHY Bitcoin came to be. Rogue central bankers have methodically, for generations, been trusted with the money supply. Unfortunately said bankers are also fallable. They'll issue new supply of money, and use it to fuel the military-industrial complex, or expand the reach of the state beyond it's borders, or any number of not-so-great ideas they do with the money. Our most precious commodity is our time. These bankers didn't spend their time to earn that money, and you did. It's important that you hodl your Bitcoin. What's also important is explaining to your progeny that this monetary experiment is bigger than them. That if they want to retain their sovereignty through multiple generations, they must do what they can to preserve as many Satoshi as humanly possible. The facts of the matter are that the issuance rate of new Bitcoin every four years gets cut in half. In those four years, you need to plan for your future. We must keep Satoshi a myth, because the truth is while insightful enough to come up with the novel concept that is Bitcoin, he walked away, likely destroyed his own keys, so as not to be tempted to spend his early coins, because he knew that it was going to be us, us that came later, us that aren't even born yet, that will fulfill the legend of Bitcoin. The price will forever remain volatile, because governments are addicted to money printing. You need to have your wits about you, and not be tempted to sell your Bitcoin back for fiat, instead use the protocol, engage in commerce with Bitcoin-accepting merchants. Make sure to visit your mom-and-pop retailers. Don't worry about the mega-corporations, they'll be fine, and don't need your money, so stop giving it to them. Yes, even now as Bitcoin flirts in the $10k range, you are still in the early days. We have to manifest destiny, and make the Bitcoin dream come true. I say this on the morning after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008. Did anyone knock on your door, and ask you how that was going to affect your quality of life? NO, I didn't think so. Forget about the naysayers. They're losers, and forever-always will be. You're bright and intelligent enough to have come across this post. Don't feel bad about continuing to stack Satoshi. Children learn by what they see their parents doing. So if your kid sees you stacking Bitcoin, until they reach adulthood, they'll know what to do automatically, and believe THAT is the norm. We need to save as many Satoshi as possible, because the central banks of the future need to be reigned in and kept in check. There may even come a time where they print money, exclusively for the purpose of buying ALL the Bitcoin. It's important you not succumb to ""greed"" and sell your Bitcoin back into fiat. USE the protocol. Remember we're exiting THEIR system, and creating our own new one. We are Satoshi!",cryptocurrency

Big thanks to anyone kind enough to offer constructive advice, I didn‚Äôt grow up with any parents and I honestly struggled just to get by for so long, I never learned what it‚Äôs like to handle some ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù income.

I want nothing materialistic. 

That being said, please help me create a plan of attack. 

I have paid off all my student loans. It was because I worked 5 years getting 30k a year at a Gangsta Paradise type school. It sucked. Now that I‚Äôm out of that fiasco, I now have 30k (annually) set aside for paying down my credit cards. 

They are: 
$15,329.00 @ 17%
$21,730.00 @ 22%
$2,777.00 @ 25%

I want it paid off in 12 months. I have a notarized contract with a business partner that requires paying 8k in 12 months or less. 

Additionally, I can do a balance transfer of 5k from the 21k card to the $2,777k card.. effectively making the 8k balance on the 25% card with the 5k at 0% for that one year. 

****This agreement was part of the stipulation of business partner taking the 8k balance.****

That being said, where does that leave me?

If I have *at least* 2k set aside each month to pay off these cards, how can I accomplish that within a year, all things considered?

ETA: this means in order to accomplish my goal of paying off the debt in 12 months, one must accept business partner will take $7,777.00 @ 25% and I am left paying off $16,750.00 @ 22% and $15,329.00 @ 17%

My math says that is $32,070 at 19.5% is and additional $6253.75 in interest alone over 12 months .. Making it $38,325.75 / 12 months is.. $3,193...

Where do to allocate my funds each month to pay them down? 

How do you get a lower interest rate with a (now) low credit score - yet I have a black card -_-
What do you say to a credit card CSR to get interest lowered?",finance

I don‚Äôt quite max out my 401(k) ‚Äî my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) ‚Äî but I put in, with matching contribution, a total of $16,500.  That is pretty much all I save each year. 

I have an an IRA with about $260k in it right now. The TSP balance is also about $260k. I also will receive, if my plan to retire from federal service at 62 holds out, a pension of approximately 23% of the average of my three highest salaries in government (which, today, would be 23% of $167k, which is about $38k per year).  That‚Äôs not all mine. Eventually half of the IRA will go to my ex (as part of the divorce agreement), and she will get a percentage of the pension, but less than 20%. 

I have alimony and child support that eats up almost half of my monthly take-home of $8,200, but that ends in three years when my youngest graduates high school. My kids are great students and I think there will be some scholarship money, but my ex and I are still in the same mortgage on the family home, and she agreed to sell it when the youngest goes to college, and I am guaranteed to get at least $70,000 out of that sale, all of which I‚Äôve told her would go to college costs. 

I have a house with a $174k mortgage, and pay $1280 per month on mortgage/insurance/taxes. I have some other personal debt, but under $10,000. I worked through college and law school and long ago paid off my student debts.

I am also an only child, my parents are in their mid-70s, they own free and clear a home worth about $300k and about $150k to $200k in cash. I‚Äôll get all of that when they die. 

I tell my friends that I am panicked I do not have enough saved to retire, and will not have enough saved to retire when I turn 62 (I won‚Äôt stop working then, I‚Äôll never stop working in some form, but I want to retire from federal service and no longer make a 3+ hour commute from Baltimore to DC and back every day ‚Äî I want to open a practice serving low- to middle-income folks here in Baltimore, Maryland high won‚Äôt make a lot of money, but it will make some).  

I live modestly and don‚Äôt do anything flashy. I shine my own shoes. I bought my first new suit in 15 years (I don‚Äôt wear suits that much). I have pretty simple tastes and lifestyle.

personalfinance,"Do NOT use CreditWize to monitor your credit score, it is ran not just by Capital One, but by the same group within the company.","So a brief overview of Capital One's Card Services Technologies. There are multiple teams under this unit that work out of McClean VA. One group is ""Secured Card"" which is the group responsible for the data breach (They are understaffed and force developers, new college hires, to not just write code but also to secure it themselves).

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hearkened back to the central bank‚Äôs 1990‚Äôs policy successes by suggesting he can sustain the record long U.S. economic expansion with just a modest reduction in interest rates.

Powell‚Äôs remark raised comparisons to 1995-96 and 1998, when Alan Greenspan headed the Fed. In each instance, the central bank ended up cutting rates three times in a successful effort to prolong an economic upswing that until this year was the longest.

If Powell succeeds with his strategy, that may end up being beneficial for investors, the president and -- the chairman made clear -- the American people, including many who are just starting to see the fruits of a super tight jobs market.",finance

personalfinance,Planning on Refinancing - Should we decrease our term?,"There was a lot of uncertainty when we initially purchased our home and we opted to go for a 30 year fixed mortgage.  Now that interest rates are so low, we planned on refinancing, but are now considering the option of decreasing our term to 15 years. My wife and I keep our finances separate and pay a ratio of our salaries into the joint account every month to cover bills.  She basically has no savings, where I save a substantial amount of money per month.  I am only using half of my take home right now, and I am keeping that extra money in stocks (Most of my savings is in index funds, except emergency fund) as a way to grow my savings.  However, I was considering doing a 15 year mortgage and paying the difference so my wife's input will not change.  This change would decrease my take home by 13% and therefore my net savings per month by 26%.  What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Go from 30 to 15 yr mortgage, use 26% of the money I am putting in index funds to pay for the difference monthly.  Good idea or no?

personalfinance,Should I buy a duplex or keep renting?,"Hi all,
So I'm 26 years old, single and making around 40k a year. I'm just trying to figure out what might be the best move to make in my housing situation. I bring in about 2200 a month after paying for health insurance, IRA contributions etc. I have about 20k liquid and about 10k for closing/emergency funds. 
I don't have any debt to speak of and my monthly expenses are cell phone, car insurance, groceries, dog stuff -- around $350 total. 
I'm currently paying about $500/month to rent the bottom half of a duplex (with a roommate), which is owned by my boss. The boss has said she'd sell the house (around 180k) to me. I totally love my job and I expect to get consistent raises and stay in the area for a while. In terms of being a landlord, I consider myself to be pretty handy, have access to tons of tools and have family in the area that are willing to help with home ownership type things. So I guess I'm wondering if getting a federal loan with something like 5% down (there are 1st time home buyer programs in my area), biting the bullet and paying the mortgage/PMI with the help of my roommate and upstairs tenants is a good idea? On the other hand, I could wait and continue renting until I have a full 20% saved. 
Any thoughts are greatly appreciated, and my apologies if this post would have been better suited for r/realestateinvesting or something. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Tax credits sunsetting: should I install solar this year?,"tl;dr below.

Hoping for advice from this community.  I've always been interested in solar panels for my home and began talking to some companies this summer, as this is the last year to get the full 30% federal tax credit on solar energy property.  (The credit decreases to 26% in 2020 and ratchets downward from there.)  My utility also offers a $6k rebate.  I can finance the cost of the system at 0% for 18 months, allowing me to collect both the credit and and rebate before having to put out any cash.  At the end of that term I can pay it off in cash or refinance with my credit union via home equity line.

I'm currently sitting on two proposals: the first is more conservative, only placing panels in the very best area of the roof, and the second would maximize most of the usable area.  I do have some tall trees which cause us to be a less-than-ideal candidate for this.  This is the main reason for my problem, as we won't be generating the maximum amount of power due to the shade at certain times of the day.  This makes the time period for the system to pay for itself that much longer.

The conservative proposal would be approx $25k total cost, but only $11,500 out of pocket after the tax credit and rebate.  Based on what they expect me to generate and assuming electric rates increase 3% per year, the system would pay for itself in about 12 years.

The aggressive proposal is $35k total price, but $18,700 out of pocket after credit and rebate.  The time period for the system to pay for itself is basically the same.  The allure here is more future savings after that point because I'd be generating more power for myself.

More pertinent facts:

\-I have about $50k in cash in savings ignoring HSA money.  A very aggressive 6-month emergency fund would be $30k (we could get by on less).  Everything else is 401(k) or equity.

\-I still owe about $170k on my primary residence at 4.25% and $100k on a rental property at 3%.  The rental property cash flows itself; I am only out of pocket if major repairs come up.

\-\*No other debt at all\*

\-HOWEVER, we just had our first child and my husband will be staying home with the baby.  His salary was 1/4 of our total income.  But we got hosed on our taxes every year because I push us into a much higher bracket, so the 'loss' here is actually less than 25% of our 'true' income.

\-Leaving aside that he can no longer contribute to 401(k) or get employer match, ignoring changes in our taxes, gas/insurance/lunch savings etc. and ONLY considering the loss of his take home pay, this means we should still have about $1k per month to put into savings after all bills are paid and my 401(k) and HSA are maxed.  My car was just paid off so I am assuming that savings roughly covers increased monthly baby expenses for diapers and formula.  Major baby expenses are already done with or will be covered by HSA funds that I am not counting in the $50k above.

tl;dr - 

The solar FEELS like a ""good deal,"" I'm feeling some time pressure because of the credit, and it's something I've wanted to do for a long time.  I have the cash or could easily finance and I believe I can ""afford it"".  But I'm not sure it is a great investment.  And if I'm going to part with the cash, does it make more sense to pay down mortgage principle or contribute to the baby's 529 instead?",finance

During the finance discussion, they mentioned they would like to do a hard credit check to confirm if we could get better interest rates. At this time, we explicitly asked for a soft credit check, since we did not want to have a ding against us at this moment. 

A couple days passed and nothing came up on my credit report. Last night, I got a notification my score had changed on Credit Karma. So I opened the report and lo and behold, I was dinged for a hard inquiry by the dealership and it affected my score. 

I called the dealership and talked to their finance department and they said they had not sent anything to the banks, so it was a soft inquiry on their part. 

I know it's negligible, but it still is bothering me that it adversely affected my rating. Is it possible that a soft inquiry can incur negative ratings? Or is something happening at the dealership that isn't quite above the table?",finance
personalfinance,Trying to fund a return to school at 29... I need big-time help!,"So as briefly as I can, here's my story:

- Typical ""gifted and talented"" student in high school, graduated from top of class but with no scholarships or plan

- Shy, poorly adjusted, no idea of what I wanted to do, just decided on local college where I got into an accelerated program studying physics (I liked math and science), living at home with near-poverty-level parents

- Accelerated program basically skipped all gen ed-type classes, left with only upper level physics classes (I was forced to take at least 4 a semester for federal aid to come through, to be a ""full time student"") 

- Couldn't keep up, too meek and uninformed to get help, unused to struggling, I bugged out and failed a bunch of classes, left town and worked retail while couch surfing

- Worked for like 7 years, meanwhile ignored loan went into default and moved to collections agency 

- Grew up a lot, learned responsibility, learned about how to adult, learned to communicate, got my own place, etc. Figured out what I want to do with myself

- Now back with decent job at a hospital (I want to go into physical therapy) trying to get back into school

- Got accepted to return, now have to figure out how to pay for it

- Defaulted loan is on rehabilitation program for another few months (10 month plan where I make a small payment every month since March) at which point it will come out of default and school will accept FAFSA again

So now my options seem to be only to take out a personal loan if I don't want to wait for the federal loan... what is the best option for that? Is there a most recommended bank to use? Is there other ways I don't know about to get funding?

personalfinance,26 years old with somewhat sudden lump of cash. Need helping investing.,"I'm male, nearing my 27th b-day, and living in Chicago. 

Recently my income has spiked, and I've found myself in a short period of time going from making 50k/year to 200k/year. There is a promotion that has been promised that would bring me over 300k/year.  The income is not super stable, and I have no way of knowing whether it will continue another 6 months, so I choose to live like I make a modest living. I probably spend about $2500 a month on everything, and save the rest. 

Right now I have $35k held up in company stock. In October (assuming stable prices) roughly $12k of that will qualify for long term capital gains tax rates. I contribute 10% to an ESPP. 

I have $130k in cash in checkings and savings. 

I have $19,500 in 401k. Currently contributing 6% of income. Employer matches 100% up to 4%. 

I have $16k remaining in student loan debt. Roughly $4k of this is on a ~%6 interest rate, the rest are on subsidized low rate loans. 

I have no car payment, no mortgage, no credit card debt, and no other debts other than student loan. 

I presume my income may be too high for a Roth IRA. 

My current plan for the end of the year is to try to max out my 401k, and then to pay off my student loans. 

My question, how should I go about investing the $130k in cash? I intend to keep a very conservative emergency fund (thinking 12 months expenses), but that still leaves me with a six figure sum to look at investing. 

How can I make that money work for me while limiting my exposure to risk? I feel like if I suddenly invest $100k that really leaves me open to losses from a sudden market downtown that many are predicting to happen in the next couple years. 

I'm pretty uneducated about investing, and really hoping there are some friendly knowledgable folks here who can help point me in the right direction.

personalfinance,Which one to pay off first?,"My husband and I are currently paying off our debts and we have three left all of which have significantly different balances but none have outrageous interest rates. Income after taxes monthly is about $9,000 combined

Mortgage is $1,161

Day Care $1,108

Other bills including Groceries utilities insurance etc: $2,000

Car Payment  $530

Home Repair loan $170

Savings $500-$1000 a month

Three debts are as follows

Mortgage Owe: $159,771.22  3.5% Interest Rate

Car payment $27,959.69 3.5% Interest Rate

Home Repair: $8,511.38  0% Interest Rate

I have considered paying the smallest debt first if we pay about $3,000 a month we can pay the home repair off before the end of the year, then the car 9 months later and then work on the house. But I also look at it and think hm.. its 0% and its not like it opens that much cash up compared to the other two loans. Then the concern with the car is this if I pay the car off and god forbid wreck it and its my fault its a sunk cost whereas if that happened and I have GAAP coverage I lose less or is that nonsense? I am not sure....   please fill me in on this one I know nothing about that and then I am like why am I planning for a terrible event that is unlikely???

So, 3 years ago I wasn't aware that student loans and federal pell grants are only provided for 2 of 3 semesters in the academic year. I enrolled in a summer semester to finish sooner and was told to fill out a petition and having been given no indication that the petition would fail, I attended that semester. Half-way through the semester I discovered that  nothing was going to be covered. I had to spend the next three years saving to pay off the balance. I just recently paid a little less than 7,000 directly to the university. I enrolled in my finial semester and now am finding than while I was paying the university I also had to be paying my student loans. Now because my loans have gone into default, I am not eligible for federal aid until I get my loans out of default, but it looks like that can only happen through rehabilitation which requires 9 consecutive payments. Which means I wouldn't be able to finish my last semester.

Also, just to get an idea of where I am financially. That 7,000 was most of my money and I broke my wrist 5 weeks ago and haven't been able to work my job. So, not great.

I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed and could use some financial advice. 

I‚Äôm a recent hs grad and am planning to go to college in the next couple of weeks if things go as planned. Due to some extenuating family circumstances I had to leave my moms house (in June) for my overall safety and well-being. 

This means that I am solely financially responsible for myself. I currently work full time at Fedex and make $16/hr. And have saved a little over $3k this summer. The school I plan on attending gave me dependency override and about $22k in aid, and $2k in outside scholarships. The tuition over all for the school is $30k for school related costs (books, general fees, health insurance through the school,etc.) , and I plan on living with an old family friend off campus (rent would be $150/month)


So with my calculations my cost to survive for the school year should be be between 12-13k. I pay $25/month on phone, $60-80 on gas/month, and thankfully have help from my stepdad with car insurance. 


The thing is with the school I plan to attend starting soon I would stop working at FedEx, get an on-campus or near campus job, until the holiday season, then I can come back and work at FedEx again during peak season. 

Is it reasonable for me to work to pay half of my tuition off and take loans out on the rest? And if I go with the loan route -what one is best/should I get?

CryptoCurrency,Why I'm a Bitcoin Maximalist,"The fact is that pretty much every single altcoin is trying to solve for a problem that doesn't exist yet. Faster transactions? Pretty sure nobody has a problem with visa in that regard. Low fees? Who cares about low fees if your coin has to instantly be transferred back into fiat at a 20% tax rate because no cryptocurrency is stable at all and wont be in the near future? ""But wait! - Blockchain will save all of our personal data!"" - Wut?

The question you should ask yourself before plopping 100's to 1000's of dollars into any coin is - how many fully validating nodes are contributing to the network stability, and do you see that number increasing or decreasing based on the coin's monetary policy?
Unfortunately, this plays out as a chicken or egg scenario, since the mere fact that a low node count means the monetary policy could likely change at any time, unbeknownst to the holder. And what chance does the node count have to grow if potential node runners don't have expectations of a good store of value?

Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all because it solves for the problem that currently exists today - which a system with an unchangeable monetary policy, with massive decentralization due to it's small block size, with the security of 80 million terahashes behind it.

People need to wake up to the fact that this is why Bitcoin is popular. Not because it has instant, low fee transactions. Therefore this market is highly irrational right now, and we are going to see a massive shift away from all altcoins to Bitcoin in the near future.",cryptocurrency

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **Australia is now moving forward with its proposed legislation to ban cash purchases over 10,000 AUD ($6,900) for business purposes. According to the treasury website: ‚ÄúThe Black Economy Taskforce recommended this action to tackle tax evasion and other criminal activities.‚Äù While many Aussies are celebrating Bitcoin‚Äôs exclusion from this clause, others find the move away from hard cash somewhat chilling. After all, if this finally goes through, banks and the state will be given sole power to deny or approve any and all purchases above this limit. Crypto is not yet affected, but when cash is erased, and the control grid is tightened, be sure that centralized shitcoins are not going to save anyone, either.** 

&amp;#x200B;

 There‚Äôs always been a lot of zealous hype in crypto circles. Search ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù on Twitter and you‚Äôll be overwhelmed with an avalanche of largely meaningless noise. ‚ÄúFeeling really bullish right now thanks to X, Y, Z!‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have any Bitcoin by now, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrypto #Revolution.‚Äù These hyped-up voices flash in the pan like cheap sparklers, and tend go quiet when the markets tank. They talk about being ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù and the revolution of all things ‚Äúpowered by blockchain.‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

 

But at the end of the day, what the hell does all this really mean? A lot of people seem to think that freedom in finance can come easily, without a fight or intentional action. That the dynasty of powers that be are just going to roll over and accept a money they cannot control. For all the shouts of ‚Äúditch fiat!‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy are people still using statist play money?‚Äù very few seem to understand the real score, which is this: there‚Äôs no war being waged on your technology, but on its ability to provide you with financial autonomy, self-sufficiency, and privacy.

The really bad news for these folks, though, is that if Australia pushes through this [ban on cash](https://www.treasury.gov.au/consultation/c2019-t395788) purchases, and they are forced to use only digital assets and credit, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much of whatever centralized crypto shitcoin anyone holds.

Aussies are no longer allowed to be secure in their communications thanks to a controversial new law [outlawing](https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-is-part-of-free-speech-and-free-speech-is-everything/) encrypted devices and chat applications. Now they are moving away from the privacy of paper money as well. This ostensibly to combat drug trafficking and terrorism via almost completely state-supervised monetary transactions for everyone.

It likely won‚Äôt be long until similar laws make their way into other FVEY countries like the United States, the U.K., Canada, and New Zealand. If that happens, the only cryptocurrencies that will be able to help secure value are those that are open source, private, secure and decentralized. Not surprisingly, these are the very coins now being specifically targeted by these nations, and [slandered](https://news.bitcoin.com/how-they-will-attack-bitcoin-the-hypocritical-shock-campaign-of-us-monetary-policy/) as ‚Äútools for criminals.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

 

If sound money is to survive this financial tyranny, it seems there might be some kind of battle. Many believe technological innovation can make this struggle a more or less peaceful one. When dealing with groups that do not respect the individual, inalienable rights of human beings to their bodies, minds, and property, however, there always comes a point where ‚Äúno‚Äù must be uttered.

Whether it be boldly proclaimed from a stage in the spotlight or silently through a private action or transaction, it still must happen. There is no change without conscious, human action. [Bitcoin](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH) allows for this by being decentralized. No state has control over the network. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is still an option. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is still somewhat of an option with fiat paper as well, as much as sensationalists might hate to hear it, or fear to say it.

&amp;#x200B;

 

These aforementioned hypesters don‚Äôt get that the propagandized fiat money they rail against (and indeed they are correct in their criticisms) is still much more private and useful than a centralized, government-regulated digital money could or ever would be. The Ripple crowd, for example, brags about how realistic and adoption-friendly they are, the company itself writing a saccharine, syrupy [letter](https://www.ripple.com/insights/open-letter-to-congress/) to Congress on July 29. They speak about wanting to comply with whatever regulations must be put in place:

&gt;***We don‚Äôt take for granted the vital role of central banks in issuing currencies and setting monetary policy in concert with the complex dynamics of economies around the world. For centuries, governments have been well suited for the job because paramount to the acceptance of any currency is trust.***

Well-suited? For what job? Is debasing and devaluing people‚Äôs money, letting terrorists and violent traffickers off the hook, and losing trillions, spending trillions to finance the death and destruction of hundreds of thousands in war and democide ‚Äúwell-suited‚Äù? They‚Äôve lost their minds.

If crypto is to be useful, it has to resemble the models of gold and cash, as far as privacy and user autonomy is concerned, and improve upon them immensely‚Äìnot make a mealy-mouthed return to state-sponsored, central bank-controlled play money irrelevancy. Imagine being an Australian business owner and trying to buy something, but it‚Äôs too expensive to pay for with cash. For whatever reason, your bank cannot approve the purchase. Your account is frozen, or their servers are down. You‚Äôre stuck. This issue doesn‚Äôt exist with physical money. But it already does with bank accounts and centralized crypto exchanges.

&amp;#x200B;

 

The moment someone tells you in your private life that you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to have something that is rightfully yours, and they try to steal it, you cease trusting them, and cut off the relationship. Why, when it comes to the state, should things be any different?

Like a patient off his head on painkillers, these people talk about pie-in-the-sky crypto utopias to be brought about by ‚Äúblockchain revolutions‚Äù controlled by the very people who oppress them the most. Writing letters to Congress. Laughing at the ‚Äúidealists‚Äù who wish to retain the keys to their holdings.

When cash is out, erased, kaput, if blockchain is going to save people, it‚Äôs going to be secure money, and not state shitcoins or digital, [bank-regulated](https://news.bitcoin.com/unbanked-for-buying-bitcoin-how-the-financial-system-criminalizes-crypto/) credit and debt.

personalfinance,Cool thing I observed on my 401K funds.,"I know you're not supposed to watch your 401K daily, nor try to move money around timing the market, etc.

But some time ago, I added the ticker for all the funds available in my 401K to my Stock Market Watchlist app.  

When the market started selling on Wednesday after the FED made comments regarding the interest rate cuts, and then on Thursday the selling continued amid new fears of Tarrifs and ""trade wars,"" etc, I noticed a very funny but very satisfying thing to see.

It's kind of cool, and I felt like I was basically seeing what some people do when this kind of thing happens.

All of the tickers on my watchlist (so all of the funds available in my 401K) were all showing like minus one percent on Wednesday after close, and about the same drop on Thursday... EXCEPT the ""safe"" funds.

The 3 funds available that are labeled as ""safe"" or partially bond or however that works, those ones actually showed GREEN on both days, increasing sometimes by .5% or even .9%

I was literally seeing people move their money into those funds and out of the stock funds, right?  That has to be what that observation means?  So basically, those safe funds aren't going to start rising, they'll fall like everything else, they went green and increased because everyone was moving their money there trying to reduce the losses?

Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I feel like that's what I observed happening pretty much, and it made me feel smart lol.  (I'm not smart about market or economy at all, but felt slightly so.)

So, was I right on the mark?  Or am I clueless?",finance

**This means there is MORE INFLATION in the US economy,** and by extension, the world. This means your fiat money is worth less today than it was yesterday.

The only risk in Bitcoin is thinking Bitcoin is somehow more risky than fiat when literally two days ago, someone at the top of central banks, just decided to print trillions more money out of thin air in order to devalue everyone's USD currency.

investing,Some questions arising from an article about the Fed's stress tests,"Currently reading [this article](https://www.fatrader.com/p/analysis/Fed-Stress-Tests-and-One-Interesting-Bank-201907059940.html) and have a couple questions:

&gt; Credit Risk: The risk of experiencing asset losses. This is what most people focus on, and where well-capitalized custodian banks and mortgage banks hold up reasonably well, while credit card and investment banks get slammed.

In what environment is she speaking about? Is this in a deflationary recession or in an inflationary recession? Correct me if I'm wrong: In an inflationary recession, purchasing power is diminished because it falls relative to rising prices (demand outstrips supply). In a deflationary recession, prices fall and the central bank lowers interest rates to make the cost of capital lower -- if those efforts are unsuccessful in providing economic stimulus, manufacturers/service-providers close which causes unemployment furthering the shortage of capital injected into the market (supply outstrips demand). (Can anyone explain the impact to purchasing power during a deflationary recession?)

Mortgage banks are a lot more sensitive to interest rate risk than credit card companies. This sort of makes sense. Because credit cards are unsecured they can afford to charge higher rates to customers (which offsets the bank's risk). In good times, this provides the credit card bank with a large moat. Mortgage rates on the other hand are tied more directly to the fed funds rate so they are more sensitive to interest rate risk.

&gt; Interest Rate Risk: Some banks are more focused on fee income (asset management, trading, insurance, etc) while others are more focused on interest income (the spread between longer-duration higher-rate asset yield assets and shorter-duration lower-rate liability yield liabilities). 

What does the second half of that sentence mean? Is that right? Or is it a typo? (Sounds like a good game show idea.) I thought interest income was just the amount of $ earned over the lifetime of a particular instrument that was attributable to interest. Where does the spread come in? 


&gt; Stagflation Risk: During a rare event in which interest yields unexpectedly spike, most banks would suffer, but banks that focus on fixed longer-duration assets, such as mortgages, can run into particularly severe trouble. Banks with variable rate lending activities (including credit card issuers), or that focus on fee income can hold up better. 

Staglation risk = inflationary recession. Why do interest yields unexpectedly rise in this case? In an inflationary environment prices are increasing relative to purchasing power. So why would interest rates rise? If interest rates rose, the cost of capital would be hiring which would further deplete purchasing power. Right? I'm obviously missing something. 

Why are custodian banks the safest during high volatility? Mortgage banks are safer because these are long term financial instruments and volatility is spread out over long time lines. Credit cards/auto are shorter term and therefore more tied to periodic changes in the credit health of the average consumer. What about custodian banks? 

Why is deflationary recession the most common type of recession for developed countries? Does somehow controlling your own money supply make us less susceptible to inflation?",finance

personalfinance,"I want to start investing in a Roth IRA, but I still have debt. How do I manage my situation?","Hello, /r/personalfinance 

This year, I finally got serious about managing my finances. Unfortunately, I'm still facing the consequences of some past mistakes.

If you want to skip the details, please scroll down to the ""What I Need Help With"" section of this post.

&amp;nbsp;


Here's my situation:

24 yrs old, 79k/yr, stable job in Cyber Security. Monthly non-negotiable expenses equal ~ $2500/month (this doesn't really include debt payments).

&amp;nbsp;

**Debts:**

(Listed by greatest interest rate)

$6400 - Student Loans. 5% interest rate. ~$1900 un-subsidized. $4500 subsidized. Started paying this last month. Paid $400 last month to the un-subsidized loan as it is accruing interest right now. Not worrying about the subsidized quite yet.

$9800 - Auto Loan. 4.1% interest rate. Paying $300/month (considering increasing this).

$2200 - 0% deferred interest credit card debt. Currently paying just enough to pay it off before the deferred interest hits. ~$200/month

&amp;nbsp;

Debt Rounds up to: ~ $18,500‚Ä¨ 


&amp;nbsp;


**Current Plan of Action:**

Began utilizing YNAB to get a grasp of my spending and set a hard budget for myself. I've only been using it a month. Still not where I want to be with spending on ""fun"" stuff. But I have made a decent improvement in the amount spent there.

I have a small emergency fund set aside. It's about 1 month of expenses (I know, I know).

I am already contributing employer match to 401k with Fidelity. Selected a Target Date Fund.

I want to ""aggressively"" pay off my debt. I want to be completely debt free within the next 2-3 years at the most. The sooner the better.

I will be beginning the process to get my tuition paid for by my employer. They would be able to pay ~ 80% of my tuition. Ideally, I'd like to pay the remaining 20% of each semester in cash.

I am currently paying $300 to my vehicle loan. minimum payment is $233. Refinanced it earlier this year from a 5 year to a 4 yr loan. Dropped interest rate from 8% to 4.1%. Trying to pay this off in 1-2 yrs.

Credit card debt is something I wish I could go back and not do. Needed a washer/dryer for my new apartment. Used a deferred interest Best Buy card to get a decent set. Need to pay it off by November 2020 to avoid interest.

&amp;nbsp;


**What I Need Help With:**

I have been reading the /r/personalfinance wiki, including the [steps on how to handle money](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). However, my trouble is with step 3 and 4.

I want to begin investing in an IRA right now, as I feel like I am losing out on the benefit of compound interest. I have an idea in my head of how I could do this. 

I have a checking account with Charles Schwab. I'm thinking I'll open up a Roth IRA with Schwab, contribute the minimum $100/month to the IRA, and invest in mainly index funds. Contributing the minimum would have a minimal affect on my ability to aggressively pay off my debt. I feel that I could easily allocate just $100/month to the IRA. Once my debt is paid off, I plan to move on to the next steps and increase my emergency fund, max out the 401k and the IRA, and begin aggressively saving and possibly investing for other goals.

&amp;nbsp;

So, finally, my question:

**Given my situation, would you recommend I open a Roth IRA and contribute $100 a month to it? Or should I instead utilize that $100/month towards debt?**

btc,China's central bank: Speeding up the pace of China's legal digital currency,"**To discover more news and opinions from China,** [**Get BitKan APP now!**](https://bitkan.com/app?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=PBOC)

\[**BitKan**, Singapore\] On August 2, the People's Bank of China held a conference for 2019Q2. The meeting showed that the pace of research and development of China's legal digital currency (DC/EP, digital currency/electronic payment) will be accelerated. China will track the development trend of domestic and foreign virtual currencies, and continuing to regulate Internet financial risk.

[ People's Bank of China](https://i.redd.it/sxsv5v2vt1e31.png)

**Five design ideas**

In the article ""Interactions between Information Technology and Financial Policy,"" **Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of the People's Bank of China**, revealed that the design ideas of DC/EP promoted by the People's Bank of China include:

(1) In the design of DC/EP, we should not pre-select a certain technology, but rely on distributed R&amp;D, market competition, and respect for market choices. These include improvements in account-based electronic payment channels, mobile payments such as code-based payments, **blockchain, distributed ledger technology (DLT) encrypted digital currency systems**;

(2) Some different systems of technology may develop in parallel, which can encourage multiple collaborative development and rapid switching, but mainly to exert market enthusiasm. It is not easy to know who is best beforehand. The central bank can also have its own system, but don't worry about entering the retail payment link, and don't think that it can do better than others;

(3) The central bank needs to accurately measure accounting and establish custody rules, to achieve 100% reserve to maintain stability, and to correct the incentive mechanism;

(4) The pilot should limit the scope as much as possible. It must be designed in advance. Technology inventors and innovators may not be keen on this design, but the central bank should require it to do adequate design;

(5) It is necessary to prevent the cash burning and relying on disguised subsidies (including direct subsidies and cross-subsidies) to grab market share and distort the competition order. In fact, as Yao Qian, former director of the Central Bank's Digital Currency Institute, said, the R&amp;D of the central bank's legal digital currency is aimed at helping innovative currency issuance, circulation and regulation, thereby improving the efficiency of digital economic and reducing the cost.

[Beijing](https://i.redd.it/46tp1djxt1e31.png)

Yi Gang, the governor of the central bank, believes that China is at the forefront of the current global study of digital currencies. According to the PBC's Digital Money Research Project Team, China's issuance of legal digital currency has several distinct advantages:

(1) The construction of financial infrastructure has the advantage of latecomer, the history is short, and the level of digitization is high;

(2) China has become the most active economy in the global e-commerce economy. The potential demand for end users to use digital currency is strong and the application scenarios are abundant.

Therefore, the establishment of China's legal digital currency issuance and circulation system is of great significance to the construction of financial infrastructure, the implementation of monetary policy, the maintenance of financial stability, the strategy of RMB internationalization, and even the promotion of economic upgrading and efficiency improvement.

personalfinance,More loans to pay for college? Or?,"Hi, long-time lurker here.  I can honestly say that now I have found myself in a financial dilemma. 

Basically, I have been working my ass off for 3 years in high school in order to give me a good cushion during college. (Saved about $18K) Now, I can say that I have picked the most affordable University to go to, and am already enrolled in the fall semester. (Community College wasn't a viable option because some, if not most of the credits would not transfer to the University) 

I have applied to FASFA and am awarded $12,617 for the entire 2019-2020 school year. Let me break down my award:

* Fed. Pell Grant - $6,195
* UNC Need Based Grant -  $922 
* Federal Direct Subsidized Loan - $3,500
* Fed Direct Unsubsidized Loan - $2,000

My bill for the semester was due yesterday (Aug 1st) which was $7,967.76 and my financial aid that I was awarded for the semester was $6,281. Leaving me with $1,686.76 to pay; which I paid out of pocket. I am now sitting at $17k btw. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since FAFSA did not give me enough aid to cover my entire year, my question is: 

Should I continue paying this out of pocket?  (Which will deplete my savings by a good amount)

Or should I take out loans in order to pay this and pay it later while still having the money in my savings? 

If so, I don't really know how to take out a higher amount of loans in order to cover these costs, whether its private loans or what have you; (Which I have been taught to stay away from private loans) 

I think the thing I'm more scared about is not having a cushion whenever I get out of college, since if I did pay the remaining balance every year out of pocket, I would have used a good chunk of my money to pay for it.",finance

personalfinance,"$3,000 KBB valued car, $6,000 remaining on loan, and $4,000 to repair it to working condition (Ohio)","TL;DR - Fixing my broken, financed car back to drivable condition will cost way more than it is worth. Looking for advice.

Hey guys, this is my first post to this subreddit so please forgive me if I forget some details. So basically over a year ago, I was desperate for a car and I got a super high interest rate loan (24.99%) on a 2014 Ford Focus since I was just starting out on building my credit. I've managed to make every payment and I've been slowly building my credit since then but my credit is unfortunately still in the crapper. I think the primary reasons for that are 1.) I, again, was desperate to find another car since this Focus has had a plethora of other expensive mechanical issues so I had a few dealerships rack up a ton of hard inquiries on cars I was interested in and 2.) my three credit cards that I do have are fairly close to being maxed out (money has been really tight for me.)

Anyway, my car died on me a few days ago and hasn't started since (even after a few stabs at jumping it) so I took it to the Ford dealership for them to diagnose the problem. They said it was going to be almost $4,000 to just get it to even start again and it'd be even more money to fix some other issues that has been going on like the wheel bearings. They said that it would need a new wiring harness and something called a Power Control Module which they'd have to order straight from Ford (idk if Ford has allowed aftermarket parts to be made for those specifically but I doubt it being critical electrical components and all.)

Now I'm really scratching my head at what kind of options I have here. I, like most people, need a car to get to work and don't have the ability to use public transportation for that. So with all of that in mind, here are the options I currently see that I have:

1.) Go with a voluntary repo but that would obviously really harm my credit.

2.) My good friend has an older car that he said he'd be willing to let me make payments on. Nothing glamorous but it does work. This option doesn't consolidate my loan for the Focus though.

3.) Try to get a loan on another car, trade my Focus in (more than likely for pennies on the dollar given what is wrong with it,) and roll the negative equity onto the new loan.

 Now with all of this being said, what advice could you guys offer me with how to proceed?  Here are a couple other tidbits that may be helpful to know:

- I just started a new job.

- I don't have a lot of money for a down payment on a new vehicle. Probably only $300 if I scraped up every penny I had.

- My friend is going to loan me the older car until I figure out what to do with my Focus. Again, one of my options is to buy it from him.

- The Focus isn't financed from a buy-here-pay-here place. It's through a financial agency.

- The wiring harness has been supposedly resolved by this dealership once before although they did mention that their fix was most likely semi-temporary since they simply attempted to repair the old part rather than buying a new one.

- I can get a second opinion on the Focus but the mechanic my dad spoke to about it (whom he trusts) at another shop said if that's indeed the problem, the dealership will probably be the only ones who can fix it.

personalfinance,Should I look into a balance transfer?,"Hey folks! A little new to Reddit and even newer to the world of personal finance. I‚Äôve read the intro materials and have just started to put together a working budget and am able to live on a little over 50% of my income, so I am able to put a decent amount of money towards savings or debt. 

A little background- I‚Äôm 24 and recently finished with college (not graduated per se, but finished lol), and got a job in my career field making enough to live very comfortably for my lifestyle.

However, when I was in college I managed to rack up just over $8000 in credit card debt, but now that I‚Äôm being more responsible and thoughtful with the money I‚Äôm taking in, I‚Äôve put away $1000 into an emergency fund, begun saving for an engagement ring for my beautiful girlfriend (woo!), and paid my credit card balance down to just below $5000.

I commented but unfortunately OP deleted the post shortly after. I hope at least someone finds this useful! This is basically what I have lived by and it has served me well.

You are already ahead of most people because of the fact that you are interested in finance at such a young age so great job. I'll give you the basics!

1. Start saving young. #1 above everything else is to have savings for emergencies and unexpected expenses. Take a chunk of each paycheck and toss it in a savings account before you have a chance to spend it and rarely touch that money. Online high yield savings accounts are great. But for your age, it's not going to make a big difference. Just force yourself to at least save 10% of your paycheck. The more the better. 50% is superb.
2. Learn to budget. A budget is the backbone of every financial plan. Account for all of the cash flowing in and allocate it to your reoccurring necessary expenses first. Your budget might be very simple for now (assuming you make $1000 per month...$500 to savings, $300 gas and phone bill, $200 for fun). I cannot stress enough how important it is to include fun spending in your budget. This way you do not need to think about fun purchases. If it's in the budget, spend it and enjoy it!
3. Credit cards are your friend and your enemy. You'll want to open a line of credit to start building credit. Credit will allow you to take out loans (such as a mortgage or a car loan) at a low interest rate. CAUTION: credit cards are dangerous. Only use them for purchases if you will pay off the statement in FULL each month and not overspend. If you don't pay the full statement you will get destroyed by interest and debt can snowball into a very scary thing! Remember, your budget is the foundation. Stick to it religiously. If you are disciplined, you can reap the benefits of credit cards (cashback bonuses, building a good credit score, and borrowing money for free!)
4. Invest in your education. Your education is one of the single most valuable tools you could possible use. Study hard, get good grades. If college is the right choice for you, go for a degree that will pay well and you will somewhat enjoy (STEM majors are excellent). You don't have to love your major. At the end of the day, a job is a job, but you will want to minimize your debt to income ratio. In other words, do not take out $200k in student loans for a $40k salary. A good rule of thumb is don't take out more than one year's salary in student debt but this doesn't need to be a hard rule. Just be mindful of it.
5. Investing for retirement is a bit down the road for you, but if you are willing to start, you will basically be set for life! Your best bet will be to open a Roth IRA and contribute a little bit each month. Most people recommend low cost index funds. Even $100 per month in a Roth IRA will be a HUGE step in the right direction. I started investing just $50 a month at 20 years old and it taught me how to live below my means and set my money aside so it can grow. As you get older and increase your income, you can start investing a bigger chunk of your pay. If you invest just 20-25% of your income for thirty years, you will be able to retire before most people and be able to live comfortably. Investment accounts will fluctuate and it is important to ignore the ups and downs. If you feel you will panic when the market drops, then pick safer investments that won't be as volatile. Just remember, the lower the risk, the lower the return.

This might be a lot of information for you but it should be enough to get you thinking about your future. I've tried to cover all the major key fundamentals of finance. The #1 theme is to live below your means and put money aside. Delayed gratification is the name of the game. Increase your income by investing in your education and decrease your spending by sticking to a budget. Please ask me any questions if you want me to go deeper on any of these topics.

Good luck!

personalfinance,$10k Left in Student Loans - Worth it to Refinance?,"My student loan balance is about $10,500. Using the NerdWallet weighted interest calculator my combined interest rate is 4.86% (actual interest rates range from 3.150% - 6.550%).

I have a 700+ credit score and have had a steady stream of income for 5+ years, and I just got a promotion/raise which is why I'm looking into refinancing. If I stick with my current lender and its interest rates, I'm due to pay off my loans in just under 3 years. If I refinance with a good rate (say, 4.2% fixed), I would pick a payment term of 5 years, but end up saving thousands in lower monthly payments...right? Saving $60/mo x 60 months = $3,600. So a slightly longer payoff, but more savings over time and a lower monthly payment.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? My balance isn't astronomical, so I'm wondering if it's worth the effort.",finance

Edit: Alright guys, sorry for the misunderstanding. It seems I was missing some information. It was, in fact, not the federal IRS, but the Francise Tax board for vehicle registration collections. The numbers she got were all from her bank. They gave her a case number and gave her the number 888-355-6872, which is vehicle registration collections. Sorry for the confusion.

**The arguments below:**

&gt;Since the Nixon Shock in 71, our system embarked on a massive credit expansion. It collapsed in Aug 9th 2007 when the offshore USD funding markets seized up. The EuroDollar which is outside the control of the Fed. Since then the central banks have stepped to create bank reserves to replace the lack of credit creation by commercial banks. After 12 years it looks like the process will no longer prevent the debt deflation. Winter is coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;They will fight tooth and nail. Overt monetary transactions to fund the government, helicopter money for the citizens, and likely large scale asset purchases to prop up markets since the system is so leveraged.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Look at what the ECB has done. with Lagarde coming on board you know negative rates are on the menu. This will force the Fed to go below the zero bound to the ""lower effective bound"" as they call it now. You can't have the Euro rates at -3% and Tbills at zero. Too big a differential.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If they insist on price controls for stocks and bonds then the pressure will be released via the currency.

**On Boglehead investing:**

&gt;Bogleism works on the upcycle of a massive credit expansion. It'll be a disaster on the downside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bogle, Buffet, and other Bogletard heroes rode the upside of a secular multi-decade credit wave. Very easy to look smart during such financial asset inflation. Now the downside as the wave crests.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you don't see a problem with that? As passive overtakes active? Who will buy when Bogletards get spooked? There are no market makers left. It's all algos that will let the price drop to zero.

**On US bonds / Gold / Kondratieff cycle:**

&gt;Forget about US bonds. We are following your lead and going negative as well. There is only one asset class that can protect you from the Zombie Central Banker Apocalypse.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a shame Bogle philosophy has beaten the common wisdom out of investors that it is normal to have 10% of your liquid net worth in gold. Gold is the bridge to the new system when the old one gets debt saturated. happens every 40 to 80 years. The Kondratieff cycle. The last people who suffered a sovereign debt crisis are all dead. So the cycle repeats. Should have had a reset back in 2000 but the fed blew a housing bubble. Then when that imploded the problem was moved to a bigger balance sheet...that of sovereigns. Next crisis will take down currencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would have at least 20% in allocated physical. The more you understand the macro environment and where this is all headed then you can feel more comfortable with a bigger allocation. I don't plan dishoarding until I can go to a bank and get a CD offerring a rate at least 2% above inflation.

**On CBGA:**

&gt;Last Friday the central banks did not renew a 5 year CBGA. This means the top line asset on the balance sheets of central banks has flowed to where it needs to be to keep the important US creditors whole as the USD is devalued per a new Bretton Woods. Since the GFC the infrastructure has been built out for an alternate trade settlement system outside SWIFT. A neutral reserve asset will be used to settle net balance of payments between trading blocs. Also there will be a BRICS Pay System usable by individuals on smartphones. Somebody in China could buy goods from South Africa and not bother with the USD as a middleman. A crypto token based on the World Currency unit could be used. Gold and silver are part of the WCU. Or they could use another currency/metal index from the BRICS New Development Bank.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While the world turned off their brains and put investing on autopilot with these index funds, the C-Suite paid themselves with handsome option packages. They tapped the bond markets filled up with yield starved investors fleeing suppressed interest rates in the sovereign markets. Then they took this money and rather than invest in capex, they bought back their own stock and issued special dividends. buybacks are ok if done out of cashflow, but if you are borrowing solely for the purpose of financial engineering...well there will be hell to pay.

**On particular stocks:**

&gt;AAPL has cash hoard. International investors look at it as bond with equity upside. The big risk for Apple is deglobalization. No more arbing labor. Margin compression and the lack of innovation will eventually take its toll. Plus that cash probably is not hedged. If the Treasury announces a Plaza Accord to devalue the USD then APPLE will look stupid.  
&gt;  
&gt;MSFT I would check their debt maturity profile. It has really exploded the last few years. If rates rise this could be a structural headwind for the company. But the Fed will probably open a window for corporate debt like the ECB. everything will likely get rolled at negative yields. Socialism for the rich, BK for the poor.  
&gt;  
&gt;The big problem for the Vanguard ETFS is GOOG and AMZN. These stocks need to split. The liquidity won't be there for a lot( 100 shares) of AMZN when it's at 2000 dollar per share. The bid stack just won't be that deep.  
&gt;  
&gt;What could happen is that these ETFs typically use an equity swap to help track an index. It will be the counterparty for this swap that will fail leaving the ETF with a tracking error. Panic...more tracking error..repeat viscious cycle.

**Triffin's Dilemma:**

&gt;We are moving to a multipolar world in which no single country will have the burden of Triffin's Dilemma. They tried to fix this flaw at Bretton Woods in '44 with the bancor but saddled the US with burden of being responsible for global liquidity. Hence tha massive trade imbalances we have now.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are going back to settling trade imbalances with a neutral reserve asset as before the Nixon shock. It was no accident we had an oil crisis shortly after the gold window was closed. For petrodollar to be big enough to support the Treasury market the price of oil had go up bigly. Hence the legend of those evil OPECers. They were just doing what they were ordered to by Kissinger. recycle your oil proceeds into US Treasuries and you'll have US military protection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the PetroDollar money laundering scam is over. Oil producers have been selling oil to China for RMB. Even the Saudis. just hasn't been announced yet. Saudi Aramaco has been showing big RMB balances in its financials. Iran has been accepting RMB for its oil sales. Hence all the hysteria over Iran. Russia the same. In fact Russia used all its Treasuries as collateral to buy gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's coming. The new system. It will be devesating for US financial assets but great for flyover country. Be prepared. Own stakes in the one asset that will reconcile the mismatch between liabilities and assets on central bank balance sheets as they hit the reset button. For like oil was made big enough, gold will be made much bigger to serve as neutral reserve asset and extinguish all this sovereign debt.

Currently, I make $50K/yr. Major expenses are rent &amp; utilities ($1K/month, even with roommates), credit card debt ($5K), and supporting my family ($800/month). Prior to this non-profit job, I was freelancing as a Personal Assistant, but it was unstable &amp; I ended up eating from my savings acct &amp; credit cards. Since I got this nonprofit job last, I've managed to save up around $5-6K in emergency money. Admittedly, it's been hard to save money b/c the more stressed I feel, the more money I spend.

Sidenote: I'm not a US citizen or legal permanent resident. I mention this b/c I tried to open a high-yield savings acct @ Ally Bank &amp; credit unions (after reading this sub), and found that I was ineligible :/ Another question would be: where can I open a savings acct w/ a high interest rate?

I'm also starting to feel that being a salaried worker is not as cracked up as it used to be (job security feels like a myth these days), so I'm thinking about going back to freelancing or to school. I'd be open to reading/hearing tips about saving &amp; making money as a freelancer. School feels more daunting b/c of my immigration status, so I've been putting that off (would not qualify for federal/state tuition support or loans).

Any tips/guidance would be welcome, thank you for reading this.",finance

personalfinance,Home is in need of a full exterior remodel. Does a HEL or HELOC make more sense?,"Hello! My husband and I currently owe about $150k on our mortgage, and our house is worth somewhere between $260k-$275k. Our PITI payments are about $1215 per month and we‚Äôre at a 4% fixed rate. Not interested in doing a refinancing cash out because we front loaded our payments and were able to shave off 11 years of our note in the first 3 when we were overpaying on it to get PMI to drop off. 

We got storm damage last weekend, so we‚Äôre currently waiting to see if our insurance will (hopefully) be replacing our roof. However, we have a section of flat roof with a rubber membrane that is desperately in need of replacing and I know this won‚Äôt be covered by our insurance. Our siding, trim and windows are all original to the house (a 1986 build) so all of that needs to be replaced too and will also not be covered by insurance. These things are just old and falling apart, not storm damaged. Assuming worst case that our roof won‚Äôt be covered either (ugh) we‚Äôre mentally preparing ourselves to address all of this in one big swoop, probably next spring/summer. I‚Äôm thinking $50,000 should be plenty, especially because we‚Äôre thinking we could probably replace the majority of the windows ourselves. (Please tell me if you think I‚Äôm way off on that $50k estimate!)

We‚Äôre currently a little cash strapped on a monthly basis so we‚Äôd prefer to not have our monthly mortgage payments exceed $1500-$1600 at this point. I hate hate how much interest there is on a 20-30 year HEL, but I do like that it‚Äôs a fixed rate because I‚Äôm wary of a HELOC variable rate. I also like that we can store it in a high interest savings account, and if we don‚Äôt end up spending all of it we can reapply that to its principal. But that darn interest rate number is hard to stare at!

Situation is I use a ""payroll card"", which is just a prepaid debit card. This specific one is ""**Elite Paychek Plus**"" that I picked for my paychecks to go into when working for Safeway/Albertsons. Been using it for about a year and a half now 

Fast forward to present day, new job, still using for direct deposits, but one day my card declined. I called and the company, **Card Holder Services** told me they cancelled my card because I 'haven't completed the verification process' So to reactivate the card I have to fax my SSN, license and current utility bill. Otherwise care remains deactivated and cannot access my paycheck

When asked how can they forbid someone from their own money, they just reply with ""federal law requires this process and until it's completed you won't be able to use the account, and the funds within in"" When I ask what law they just say 'the patriot law!!' several times in a tone I think they think would sound super scary. 

So because they're basically holding my paycheck hostage, I have no money to eat, buy anything to drink, buy a rail pass, or pay for anything. Can they do that? How are they allowed to hold someones paychecks hostage? Which they're real adamant about saying they are. ""*no we're not holding your money hostage but unless you want it back you have to do what we say, how we say it and when we say*""

What can I do? I faxed it but then they claimed it wasn't eligible so now I have to wait until Monday. No food until Monday. Only tap water. Ane i don't even know how to get to work. So can someone please give me advice on what the hell can or should I do? I just want food and get to work.

personalfinance,"Trying to calculate retirement taking into account pension, social security, and roth/traditional IRA/401k","I'm 34. My wife is 34. She makes $95k. I make $91k. We have one kid and another due next month. We'll probably stop after that. I just got a promotion (actually doesn't take effect until September), and was considering trying to max my 401k. (technically it's a TSP, but I'll continue saying 401k for those that aren't familiar with TSP).

When thinking about retirement, I feel like my wife and I could comfortably live on ~100k per year, especially considering that right now we pay $1472 monthly in mortgage, and $1k in day care (soon to be $2k) and put a bit into savings. We live in a low COL area.

I'm a federal employee, so I have a pension. On the low end, it'll pay ~$40k in retirement, post tax. I also went through the scenario of 0 promotions and calculated what my social security would be at age 62 when I plan to retire. It's ~$32k. (That's if I work until 62 but don't take benefits until 67). My wife has been working longer and will likely continue to make more than me, so a conservative estimate assumes she'd make the same from ss. If we have a household ss of $64k plus my post tax pension at $40k, it almost seems like I don't need to save for retirement at all? I realize that sounds crazy and isn't my plan, but I want to know how far off I am.

Here's where I'm at: I have 40k in my 401k and currently contribute 10%. I have 12k in my roth IRA and plan to continue maxing that. My wife has ~100k in 401k and 18k in her roth IRA.

My question really started with trying to figure out how much I need when considering pre tax vs post tax. Every retirement calculator I've seen doesn't differentiate. Is there one that does? After thinking about that, I looked at ss benefits and realized with my pension, I'm close to what I think my retirement expenses would be. I'm about to increase from 77k to 91k and was considering maxing my 401k, but I feel like I may be going overboard. I'm pretty frugal and don't mind living cheap, but I don't wanna go overboard if it's not necessary.

Would I be unnecessarily limiting myself by throwing all my money at retirement when I have no intention of retiring early? I plan to work until 62 due to a pension bump at that age.

Currently, I pay them $400/month and if I settled with 0 interest and $15,000/72 months it would mean only $208/month payments for me which at this point I can afford but barely. 

I prefer this route than filing for bankruptcy. However, I‚Äôd like to known if this will be reported to the credit bureaus and show up on my report for the next 7 years.

personalfinance,Advice: Getting in Debt to Pay Back a Debt?,"I‚Äôm a 22 year old college student. Currently I attend community college but after this fall semester I‚Äôll be transferring to an in-state university.

I can‚Äôt yet transfer because when I was 18, I made the dumbest decision of my life and went to an out of state school for a year that cost $30k. My parents struggled to pay the balance each semester, I took out $7k in federal loans, and still left with an unpaid balance of $5,442. They are holding my transcript hostage until I pay it off.

This summer I did an internship that paid me $6k. I have managed to get the unpaid balance down to $4,442. I was planning on paying it all off with the stipend and using the rest to buy a car from a family friend. However, the stipend was taxed like crazy so I came out with a little more than $3k.

So here are the options (and part of me already knows what the better decision is): use all of the stipend on the bill and do not buy a car, or get a loan with a grace period that kicks in after I graduate to pay for the balance, and get the car.

I want the car bc right now I live with my parents, but I do not want to anymore. I share a car with my parents and if one of their others breaks down, I have to give mine to my dad since he has a real job and works peculiar hours. I started off driving to my internship but recently I‚Äôve been paying for Uber‚Äôs because his truck broke down. If I had my own car this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and I‚Äôd be able to move in with my bf [21].

I want to move out because I think I‚Äôd be more focused at university if I had my own space and my own time. Currently I spend a lot of time running errands for my parents or babysitting my disabled brother. It makes my schedule during school irregular. I also work part time and I don‚Äôt want to have to juggle all that while I‚Äôm at university because it is a very hard program. If I got the loan, I think I‚Äôd be able to pay it back bc I‚Äôm majoring in electrical engineering.",finance

personalfinance,Setting up auto pay for student loans,"I'm currently setting up my auto pay for my student loans through Great Lakes, and there are two options, and unsure what applies to my situation. Before I begin, I just graduated a few days ago and I got my defaulted loan back into standing status because I started making payments in February through the rehabilitation program. The U.S. Education of Department transferred my loan to Great Lakes a few days ago.  

So, back to the auto pay options....
Option one (Apply as Refund) says that ""This selection only affects accounts that aren't in repayment yet AND are within 120 days of you receiving loan funds."" Refund payments directly reduce the amount of money you originally borrowed (principal), recalculate any existing accrued interest based on reduced principal, and may reimburse a portion of the federal loan origination fees. 

Option two (Apply as Payment) says ""Your early payment will be applied first to any accrued interest, then to your principal balance. This helps you keep up with your accrued interest so it's not capitalized, but you won't benefit from the reduced principal that refunds provide.""

Any tips/advice would be much appreciated!

Edit: The reason I had to enter the rehabilitation program was due to dropping out for a couple of semesters and couldn‚Äôt afford to make payments on the loan when my grace period ended. So, I wanted to turn my loan back into standing status to obtain a loan to finish school. But I just ended up paying my tuition in full out of my own pocket because the program was taking longer than I hoped.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering if option one is still a option despite defaulting my loan.",finance

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
&gt; With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
&gt; The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed‚Äôs more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe real issue as to why there‚Äôs going to be a correction in our view is there‚Äôs a massive, massive vacuum here,‚Äù said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. ‚ÄúIn essence, it‚Äôs a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you‚Äôre almost not going to hear anything.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
&gt; After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&amp;P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&amp;P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the president, there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,‚Äù said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored‚Äîindustrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe could have a correction ... then we‚Äôll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,‚Ä≤ Knapp said. ‚ÄúThe risks are significant. I think we‚Äôll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we‚Äôll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a ‚Äúmidcycle adjustment,‚Äù not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúClearly from the Fed, you‚Äôre going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,‚Äù said Emanuel. ‚ÄúAll the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you‚Äôre going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. ‚ÄúIn all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it‚Äôs basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,‚Äù he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
&gt; Interest rates and currency wars
&gt; Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
&gt; As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNow everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no economics calendar for when those come out,‚Ä≤ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
&gt; Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a point of continued strength,‚Äù he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
&gt; Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
&gt; He said he is concerned currency volatility could ‚Äújust start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.‚Äù

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

&gt; Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

&gt; Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June‚Äôs level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board‚Äôs Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday‚Äôs Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.

&gt; Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

After this week's pullback, though, the S&amp;P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

&gt; For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&amp;P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

&gt; For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&amp;P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season D√©j√† Vu

&gt; Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&amp;P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President‚Äôs tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

&gt; If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that‚Äôs because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&amp;P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&amp;P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&amp;P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

&gt; The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve‚Äôs prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúObama had zero interest rates, we have ‚Äònormalized‚Äô rates. While the Fed hasn‚Äôt helped the President‚Äôs cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday‚Äôs tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

&gt; Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn‚Äôt much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

&gt; While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President‚Äôs policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

&gt; Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

&gt; This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

&gt; The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

&gt; Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

&gt; Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been encouraged by the labor market‚Äôs resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúA solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.‚Äù

&gt; Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June‚Äôs growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we‚Äôre hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts‚Äô rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%‚Äîwhich is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts‚Äô average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

Last month, net short positions in the cannabis space increased by 7.2 million shares, or $169.7 million, according to data from market tracker S3 Analytics.

‚ÄúIn 2019, we‚Äôve seen quite a shift in investor scrutiny over the sector,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven into Canada‚Äôs federal legalization last October most of the industry was predominantly trading around the idea of pro-forma ‚Äî what was the future promising, what were these next big catalysts unlocking growth? ... Now we‚Äôre beyond a lot of those initial catalysts, even though there‚Äôs still a lot of growth to go left in this industry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is to me a natural reaction with the big price run up at the beginning of the year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThrough this whole correction we‚Äôve seen more creation more shares coming into the fund, so generally speaking, investors seem to be looking at this as the market maturing, companies working through growing pains, execution pains, but they still have their eyes on the prize which is global expansion and the size that the global market will be in the next 10 to 15 years.‚Äù",finance
personalfinance,School wont let me make lower payments so taking out personal loan,"J started college at 20, earned my associates degree in 3 years and transferred to this college to be unnamed in Georgia.

I have 3 semesters left,  but it's really just 2 and I am paying out of pocket because I reached the maximum time frame for my degree.  However they're asking for 999 a month, which seems insane. I work full time and go to school and barely make 2000 a month not paying for my bills.

ethereum,Applying the Libra model to the SDR currency basket,"I just came across [this article](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-wont-be-a-global-reserve-currency-but-its-opening-the-box) on coindesk arguing that the SDR currency basket in its current configuration is 'subject to national priorities and vulnerabilities' and that by adding a 'non-sovereign token of exchange that is free from political manipulation' (ie. bitcoin etc.) into the mix would add a 'robust apolitical anchor and layer of trust.'

I would argue that this could be taken further still by applying the Facebook Libra model of governance / monetary policy to the SDR currency basket such that instead of a consortium of fortune 500 companies acting as nodes / decision makers, you have nations (ie. central banks?) acting as the SDR nodes deciding on the reserve currency mix / monetary policy of the global network / reserve currency - one bankster one vote.

personalfinance,Credit score dropped ~88 points after refinancing,"I recently refinanced my private student loans(around 68k total), I didn‚Äôt touch my federal loans. Today, Mint notified me that my credit score dropped from 759 to 671 due to closed accounts.

personalfinance,Looking for Advice on my Current Financial Situation,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted to see what everyone thought about my current financial situation. I am 37 years old and currently have a salary of 80K. I owe roughly 76K on my mortgage. I currently contribute 18% into my 403b and contribute $115 weekly into a Roth IRA. My 403b currently has about 260k in it and my Roth IRA is at $6,200 (just opened this up late last year). I have 22K saved up in an Ally saving account (2.15% interest rate) and I have roughly 10K invested in some index funds. I have about $500 in my checking account.

I feel that I am stretching myself thin with all the money that I am putting into my retirement. Monthly, I am putting almost $1,500 into it my 403B and Roth IRA combined.

Does anyone think I should cut back on my retirement savings? On top of my mortgage payment each month, I usually throw an extra 200-300 per month towards the principle.

I see myself having to buy a new car within the next year. I have been driving around a 2010 Corolla that just hit 150K miles.

stocks,My plan on an $AMZN 2wks-1 month swing [Discussion],"I think it's no news that the markets were down this week after president Trump announced another tariff on another $1bn Chinese goods. 

Amazon was down almost 2% yesterday to $1824/share, and 5% down for the week. It's at the lowest point it's been in a month. 

Based on the 3 month resistance trend line, I'm expecting it to fall more to about $1750. I believe this price point to be undervalued, as their logistics operation is unparalleled and their business continues to evolve. Their revenue is up 19% from last quarter, although their net profit margin is down 13%. I believe the latter is because of increasing operation costs due to  implementing increasing delivery services due to FedEx's termination of their contract. 

My plan will be to buy in after a successful break past the $1820 price point (a 3 month resistance area) and sell at a predicted uncertainty area around $2000.

personalfinance,Finicial Aid didn‚Äôt award my sister nearly enough and now needs to take out 50k + in private loans. Help!,"Hello All,

My younger sister got accepted into a Ultrasound program at Thomas Jefferson University for this Fall 2019. We‚Äôve been having non-stop issues getting her financial aid to go get to the right office because she was also accepted to the undergrad campus which held her info hostage for a little. 

Fast forward she gets her award and it is 6k for the school year. 

‚Ä¢ Tuition is 45k 
‚Ä¢ Awarded 6k in federal student loans 

Based on (2018) Parents tax return claimed 119k income 

We live in N.J. so she will technically be an out of state student and has gotten an apartment in the city since this is a full time program. Which she will also need some kind for. I just can‚Äôt believe this is all she is getting with my parents having only 1 income (my mom is unemployed as of Aug 2018 and currently applying for disability (amputee)). As well as my sister being the second individual in the house hold actively enrolled in college (I am in graduate school). She called financial aid to appeal this and they said she will not receive any more based on my parents income last year. Since last year my mom‚Äôs unemployment has run out and while they are not hurting for money because they planned for her not to return to work they can not financially support her either. This requires her to take out 50k+ in private loans for the next two years... In my undergrad (2014-2016) I was awarded half of the tuition (in federal loans) while both parents were working in an instate college. I can‚Äôt help but think we did something wrong or the school is wrong. Time is running out and she‚Äôs going to have to make a payment soon. Can anyone point us in the right direction?

Edit: I know the program is expensive. My concern is that she is given 15% of her tuition when (from my experience) student loans are usually about 40% tuition for a middle income family. 119k in N.J. is by no means a enough income for my parents support 2 kids in college.

I know that is a grossly simplified scenario, but I get the jist.

I also understand that the opposite is true with a savings account, in that I *receive* the interest according to the rate rather than owe it. 

But what does it mean when ""The Fed has lowered Interest Rates""?  

What does that mean, how does it impact me, debt accounts, future loans, or savings accounts?

personalfinance,Backpay from 2014 given to me in 2019. A weird law was introduced. Do I pay taxes on the backpay?,"I apologize in advance, because there's no way for me to fully explain this without it being a bit of jumbled. I tried this in r/taxes, but got one 'Yes' response, and two 'No' responses, not really enough to placate me. TL;DR is the last paragraph.

Brief backstory: IHSS was a bit of a mess back in 2014, so about a third of my wages never went through. Tried to fight it, ""Welcome to Los Angeles!"", nothing got resolved. Recently, however, IHSS switched to electronic timesheets, and when I logged on to the site a few weeks ago for the first time, my missing timesheets were all there. Filled them out. ???. Backpay profit.

/backstory.

In California, there is a state-run program called In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) where a ""Provider"" (me) provides services for a ""Recipient"" (my sister). Those services, depending on the need of the client, could include simple vacuuming and dishwashing, all the way down to helping them shower or help them get on and off the toilet (and cleaning up after them).

The difficulty and/or length of time taken for each task is added up by social worker in the form of ""Hours"", and the Provider fills out timesheets saying they did the tasks and it took XX hours. Every year or so the hours are reevaluated in case there are any changes.

When it comes to income, the wages earned have never had federal taxes withheld, so it was up to the provider to properly save or to file a W4 for tax season. Essentially, IHSS workers never get a tax refund, we always owed (which is fine, it's how things work).

That is until 2017, when the California courts, in cahoots with the IRS, passed a thing where the Provider's income does NOT count toward federal taxes, IF the Provider and the Recipient live in the same house. They basically made employment tax-free.

So after all that, my sister and myself live in the same house, and I'm her Provider, so I qualify for the tax-freeness of the court ruling.

TL;DR The law for gross income not counting towards federal taxes passed in 2017. It is now 2019, but the backpay I earned was income I should have earned in 2014, before the law passed. Am I going to get taxed for the backpay? My car is almost paid off, so that backpay money can really help me out.

Source to explain the court ruling:
http://www.udwa.org/2016/03/important-tax-update-for-ihss-providers-who-live-with-their-clients-irs-notice-2014-7/

Fairly damning source that says the ruling was effective since 3rd Jan 2014 (scroll to page eight):
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-07.pdf

CryptoCurrency,I have started crypto 2 years ago and today I decided to make a course and teach people in the company I work for about it. It's getting crazy with so many demands of participation! Help me to make it amazing !,"So 2 years ago, after seeing a Netflix documentary about bitcoin, my life has totally changed and I became a crypto addict.

I have made so many mistakes, I could have given up so many times, but still, I'm here, more convinced and enthusiastic about crypto than ever.

So actually yesterday I started a topic on the Facebook group where most of the people working in the same company as mine are. We are more than 4000 on this group and it's an airline.

I didn't expect so many answers of people interested to participate to my course ! And I didn't even finish to write it yet ! I'm not gonna take a random online course already made, I will be much more efficient teaching if I've made it myself. So far I have 50+ people interested. I will make small batches.

I told them that I will talk about basics but also some advanced stuff because I can handle it.

I want to tell you what I'm going to talk about, but I'd like you to help me if you think I forgot something really Important in the comment.

So here are the topics I will approach with my students : 

-What is bitcoin and crypto in general? I mean I have to start like that, some poeple really have no idea about what it is. 

-What is the blockchain ?

-How is it and will affect our lives? 

-Facts about bitcoin. Such as it's never been hacked, how many times it crashed and revived, feel free to give me ideas.

-How to buy and sell it? This part is easy, but I will set their mind to HODL, not to trade this market ad they will burn their wings and lose.

-How to secure it safely ? 

-Mistakes to avoid as a beginner, like leaving your crypto on an exchange, investing money you actually need to live, avoid scams (heyheyhey) I want them to be wise if their choice.

-Useful websites and YouTubers (datadash,Cryptolark) those are my 2 favourites. I unsubscribed from some many after being fed up by their BS. Let me know if you know any I can trust.

So I think that this course will take me a couple of hours to discuss, they will ask me questions, for sure other topics will be talked about. 

I am really excited about it and I feel like it's part of the adoption we need to educated people about crypto and blockchain. 

So guys, please tell me if I am forgetting very important things to teach to begginers about crypto!
I will talk about the mining also when I'll explain what bitcoin is, also the stock to flow, halving... it's gonna be a lot of informations.

CryptoCurrency,On Comparing Crypto to Tech Companies,"Let me preface this by saying I think there are use cases for some altcoins, but not most of them.

It seems like a lot of people in this sub want to compare Bitcoin to their coin like Bitcoin is to AOL as their coin is to Google.

If you are strictly talking about developing a medium of exchange, then yes that would have benefits, but I want to highlight that people are using Bitcoin today as a store of value.

Currencies AS A STORE OF VALUE should not have similar properties to technology products or companies. They should be unchanging and have a strict monetary policy that includes the inability for debasement.

This is why cowry shells and gold were once used as media of exchange, but today someone couldn't pay you to take their shells, and gold is at an ATH.

The problem with most altcoins is that they are trying to pass the store of value stage and move immediately into the medium of exchange stage. However, 99% of these projects have craeators/CEOs/ and the ability to debate and inflate.

If you're confused as to why Bitcoins market dominance keeps growing over your coin, and you really don't understand the monetary policy/distribution of your coin, I would implore you to try to learn more about it. Otherwise it might be a project that isn't worth investing in.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What is the best way to finance a large scale renovation on a new property?,"Hi all,

After having our first child, my husband and I are looking to make a change. Our current house does not match our needs and, while we absolutely love it, we've come to the conclusion that we need to move. On a wild stroke of luck, we found a person sitting on an amazing lot in our preferred neighborhood and he is looking to sell. The only hitch is, that house is no where near what we need and we would want to put in major renovations before it was ready for us to live in. It's not a tear down, but we would basically have to fix the foundation, gut it, and add on. Still, we think we might have a phenomenal opportunity within reach if we can get the timing and finances worked out. I just don't know how to go about it. Here are some details:

Current house:Owe - $275kWorth - $\~$525k

New house/lot:Asking price: $320kBallpark cost of renovations: $300k

If we can make it work, we'd end up with a beautiful house sitting on a double lot in our favorite part of the city.

What we have to work with is the equity in our current home, fantastic credit scores, and high income. (See edit below) We do not have a separate downpayment saved up. I don't know the best way to finance this. I don't think we can get a construction loan in time because my understanding is that a lender will require detailed plans of the build/renovations and we don't have those drawn up yet. We need to act relatively quickly, because the current owner wants to sell (obviously) and while he is holding off putting the place on the market just yet, we can't ask him to wait months while we work with an architect and builder to get everything drawn up.

How do we go about this?

We have been paying extra on the student loans; we have no other debt. We are maxing out my husband's 401k and I am contributing enough to my own to get my employer's matching. We also contribute to our kid's 529 plan and have about $30k in a HYS for an emergency fund. I am not willing to tap into the $30k for a downpayment. The reason we don't have a separate downpayment saved is because we weren't planning on moving for another couple of years, but this is an opportunity that doesn't come around too often and we want to take advantage of it.

2nd ETA: Guys, if I came here and told you that we had $200k in equity in our current home, a combined income of $300k, and wanted to buy a $650k house, I don't think any one of you would seriously try to tell me we couldn't afford it. The overall numbers are basically the same, it's just a different journey from point A to point B. We can afford it, I just want to learn more about possible vehicles or avenues.",finance

personalfinance,Under taxed Canadian Working in the US,"Greetings all,

This is a burner account to try and save a little of my dignity and self respect.  I'll try to keep this short.

TLDR:  I came to the US to work for a small consulting company, taxes were extremely under-deducted and now I owe the IRS $7,000 and CRA $7,000.  I have every intention of paying, but I'm really feeling rushed.  Not sure where to go or who to talk to.

So, I took a job with a boutique firm, and discovered that they had serious payroll issues.  While, I never missed a pay check, other people had some weird stuff going on.  When my accountants told me that I was facing a big tax problem with the IRS and CRA, I asked my employer if they could help, and the answer was 'No'.  So, I started looking for a new job in January, and saving all of money.  That meant accruing large credit card bills.

I'm sending half of my paycheck back to my family in Canada.  That money is used to pay for mortgages and operation expenses there.  I am desperately trying to sell my house, but its not getting much attention in a real-estate market that is dependant on oil prices.  So, I check pays for the house and family in Canada, 1 check pays for the American household and debt.

Beyond this, I did have some bad luck financially:  1) My car died and I had to spend my savings on that 2) Some of my long term investments were stolen and I am involved in a class action law suit to recover whatever can be recovered.

I have a new job now, and I am making enough money that I can save about $1000/month.  The new employer is taking 0 deductions and I think I'm on the right path. Beyond that, I'm downgrading my apartment and considering selling my car.  

Long term, I'm reasonably comfortable with my prospects.  The concern is I'm just really thin while I have mortgages to pay in Canada, rent and car payments in the US, and $7000 to pay the IRS and $7000 to pay the CRA.

My concern is that I'm running out of time and I'm going to be in trouble with the IRS and CRA.  I've talked to my accountants, and they really haven't been able to offer any advice except 'Pay as much as you can, as soon as you can'.  I have talked to my bank about lowering credit card interest rates or consolidation loans, and they are unwilling to do anything.

With no other options, I'm just trying to save the $7,000 for the IRS.  Once thats paid, I'll save the next $7,000 for CRA.  Once they are paid, I'll start paying down the credit cards.  If there is a better way to do this, I would really appreciate any advice I can get.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans have me panicking..am I making the right choices??,"I (25f) have my bachelors and masters degree and unfortunately that means I have lots of student loans as well.  I‚Äôm really panicking as I don‚Äôt want to be a prisoner with debt while I‚Äôm at the point in my life where in the next couple of years I‚Äôm going to get married and start a family.  

My masters is in healthcare management so job security is pretty good and a steady increase in salary is promising, but since I went straight through school and have minimal job experience, my salary is not starting out super high but it‚Äôs comfortable.  

I am very lucky to be in a situation where my fianc√© has a great paying job and we‚Äôve decided he will pay for the mortgage, electric, living expenses, etc., while I finished up school and am starting my career, so I only pay for my student loans, car payment, gas, and groceries.  I have no credit card debt or anything other debt besides my car.  My point being, I don‚Äôt have the financial burdens most people do.

So back to the title of the post, I am freaking out about the amount of student loans I have.  Between undergrad and graduate school, I accumulated a little less than $50,000 worth of student loans that I started paying in December of 2018.  The payment is just over $500 a month for 10 years, with about a 5-6% interest rate.  I pay $500 ever two weeks, and am down to about $43,000 left so far with the goal of paying them off in 5 years.  I have about $15,000 as an emergency fund for my fianc√© and I which will be more than enough for 6 months of expenses if anything happens with his job.  

Should I be doing someone different? I‚Äôm find myself constantly panicking everyday about the amount of loans I have and feel so much anxiety that I have this financial burden and it‚Äôs really stressing me out.  I don‚Äôt think I will feel relieved and feel like I can move forward with my life until these loans are paid off. 

Should I be paying $250 ever week instead of $500 every two weeks? Should I stop adding $250 every pay check to an additional savings account for unexpected expenses like car and house repairs and add this to the student loans? 

I think I came here looking for someone to reassure me that I‚Äôm on the right path, but I‚Äôd really like an honest opinion on what I should change, how I can pay off these loans faster, and what steps I need to take to make this happen.

Thank you in advance for the advice!!",finance

personalfinance,Any Advice for Crippling Debt,"Good Evening Everyone,

Well I don't know where to begin.  I guess the long and short, I lost my job and was unemployed for 6 months.  When I found a job, it was approximately $20,000 less a year.  Less than a month later, my wife had some medical issues and was out of work for 7 months, with only partial disability.  We owe about $70,000 between credit cards, personal loans, and vehicle loans ($25,000 credit cards, $20,000 personal loans, $25,000 vehicle loans).  Our credit scores are between 600-650, and currently have 80% credit utilization.  We are both working full time again, but the interest on credit cards and the loan are quickly burying us ($10,000 loan alone has been $900 in interest in 6 months).  It's just been overwhelmingly piling up.

We are in a Catch 22 as we have too much debt and too low of credit score to take out a debt consolidation loan without getting hit with exuberant interest rates.  I know this is our own faults, and I am by no means trying to pass the blame or the buck.  We just need advice on what to do.  For income sake, our take home is approximately $2500 every two weeks.  Rent and utilities (internet, electric, water/sewer, car insurance) is about $2000 a month.

personalfinance,College Student W/No Expenses and Has Income Needs,"TL;DR Virtually no expenses and significant income, need advice on what to do with my money

Hi, I'm college sophomore that essentially has a full ride scholarship to a school with a cooperative education program. Because tuition and housing is covered, all of the income from my co-op will go directly to me. I do not want to waste this rare opportunity, and I couldn't seem to find similar situations after a search. Because I've already started to earn some money this summer, I applied for a secured credit card with a low credit limit to start building credit, and I think I have a handle on that situation. However, I want to start saving and investing money in a smart way as well. After some advice from a friend, I'm looking to do two main things to start.

1. Start an emergencies only savings account
2. Invest a small amount of money to try and make small passive income

For saving, I've been looking at opening a new savings account separate from the one I already have so its a true emergencies only account. Because my credit card is with discover, I was thinking about opening a savings account with them since their interest rates are higher than my current credit union. Other than it being hard to access, are there any pit-falls to this that I'm missing? Also, if the cash back rewards are the exact same as or better than my current credit union, would it be worth switching to Discover as my main bank? The only downsides I can think of are that I couldn't transfer as easily between my savings and checking accounts, and that the checking account wouldn't earn the little interest my current account does.

For investing, I was told to look at low expense index funds, but I have no idea where to start. My current credit union doesn't offer any services to help me with it, so any advice would be welcome. I've been trying to learn a little on this subreddit, but I can't seem to find places to go to start. 

Because of how I grew up, I have next to no idea what to do once I start to make more money than I need for everyday expenses, so I welcome any advice, even if it isn't related to my two main questions. Thanks in advance!

Also, sorry if this post breaks the rules in any way. I read through them thoroughly and couldn't find anything that I'd be breaking, but I'm a little new to posting on reddit.",finance
personalfinance,Crippling debt after fire... Need advice,"It's been 7 years since we lost all of our belongings in a sudden apartment fire and we've been slowly sliding more into debt ever since. We had just gotten married and had little savings. Even after maxing out our renter's insurance, we still ended up having to put about $17k on credit cards to stay afloat the first year.

Fast forward to now. Even though we have never missed a payment, pay more than the minimums when we can and only use the cards when we HAVE to to stay afloat, the debt is now a staggering $49k and utilizes 98% of our available credit so our interest rates have been steadily increasing as well. We both had 700+ credit scores before but now I'm guessing low 600's, if that.

Savings: $2k. 

Husband's net income: $47k. 

My income: $200/mo selling crafts, currently looking for a 'real' job. 

Mortgage: $1500 (owe $165k, $210k appraisal) 
 
Cards: $920/mo minimum payments. 

Food/household goods: $320 ($80/wk, 3 people)
  
Gasoline: $200. 

Car Insurance: $125.

We bought the house 3 years ago to get our monthly expenses down. Our mortgage is cheaper than renting.

I know step 1 is for me to get a job. I have one lined up to start on the 15th but it's only $13/hr, 25 hrs per week. Still looking for something better. What else can we do? Is there a way to consolidate this debt?

investing,Thoughts on the state of the markets and stock watchlist for 8/5 - 8/12 trading week (LONG POST),"Hey y'all,

**APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG POST - If you're here just for the picks, scroll down and skip my scattered musings on the state of the markets for the week**

What a week for the stock market we just had! JPOW, earnings/guidance all over the place (I'm looking at you, $SQ, $ETSY), new tariffs on China. Unless we get significant news about a positive trade deal development we should expect the new week to be a great one for the bears - markets should lose (quite) a few points across the board, with the potential for a *significant drop* (we're talking SPY below 280 **very quickly,** if 285-287ish resistance doesn't hold) depending on the news that come ahead.

Even if the main indicators and most stonks come down, however, **we know that some will trend up**. There are promising potential venues for traders to make a profit across the aisle, and if you've followed my posts/watchlists for some time you know that I advocate for investing in individual stocks, and I think both bears and bulls can make a profit in these markets. With the trade war, we know that not all sectors will be affected equally, and if we learned anything from the previous round of tariffs in early May, we know that some sectors and some stocks are actually quite strong in times of trade war turmoil. Cybersecurity, software, health insurance, genetics, (some) medical devices, etc. proved pretty strong in the last round of cuts. And I personally expect cybersecurity, software, and much in the health care sector to climb up/correct in the weeks ahead.

With all this said, make sure you identify those strong stocks that are oversold and shouldn't be (so) affected by the new tariffs, and keep a close eye on those. If you think a strong company's stock has been unfairly hit by trade war news and no other significant news (ehem... CRWD, OKTA, ZS, NOW, MDB), then there's no reason why you should stop investing on that stock, especially if you're in for the long term.

If you're feeling overly bearish on the main indicators, keep in mind that a lot of the damage from the news we know (that the US will impose new tariffs on China, that the Chinese govt. is considering retaliation, etc.) will be priced in. By the time the markets open (expect a sharp drop in all main indicators then), we should see the gains of over two months totally wiped out... (in just a few days since FOMC+Tariff tweet, mind you). So if you're considering going all in on SPY puts (like a couple of you messaged me about!), reconsider. The optimal time to have done this was right after the tariff tweets or even holding puts over the weekend. Monday at market open might not be such a good idea - it'll all be contingent on what we hear from Trump/China on trade developments, and whatever way the news media spins that. Expect the coming week(s) to be all about China (just like early May was)... Though y'all already knew that.

Also keep in mind that we have (yet another) big round of earnings ahead of us (i.e. **$DIS**, **$ROKU**, **$TTD**, **$LYFT/UBER**, etc.), Xi's (hopefully lack of) retaliation, Trump's whimsical (to say the least) trade policy decisions/responses in the next week, and plenty of significant developments in the global economy to keep an eye out for (i.e. watch out for developments on Brexit and Boris Johnson \[my heart goes to my fellow Brits for such a joke of a PM\]; developments with Iran and in the Middle East as a whole; unrest in HK; currency wars, etc.). Plenty of news/potentials to turn the markets around. Also keep in mind that Buffett's Berkshire [is holding more cash than ever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-03/buffett-s-cash-pile-hits-record-as-berkshire-holds-122-billion) (would love to hear your thoughts about this/its implications below!)

Here's a list of stocks to keep a watch on for bulls and bears, along with a very brief explanation on each:

**BULLISH:**

* **$CRM** is quite oversold, and the markets haven't really priced in the positive news with the **$BABA** partnership. There's an encouraging amount of buying in the 8/23 $150C, and we (**$CRM** traders/investors) know the company's tremendous potential and solid fundamentals. If feeling bullish at all this week, this is one to consider.
* **$CRWD** and **$OKTA**. These have come down sharply on no good reason, they are in an essential sector that grew in the last round of tariffs. Both are incredibly strong companies (**$CRWD** well ahead of **$OKTA** imo, and with much more potential to soar in the short term). **$CRWD** dropped on Friday on no volume. Monster growth company with VERY few stocks available for trading in a sector well positioned to grow during the trade wars. If bullish, **$CRWD** should be HIGH on your watchlist, **$OKTA** closely following. **$ZS** is also a strong entry, especially if going long (and willing to cash in on strong upcoming earnings!)
* Software/cloud and other tech companies such as **$NOW, $MDB, $SPLK,** **$TWLO (all alarmingly oversold)**, **$ADBE** (strongish close above 290, *very oversold*), **$TEAM** (Oppenheimer Tech Conference 8/6-8/7) and even popular tech companies like **$FB** and **$PINS. None of these** should be terribly hurt by new tariffs, have much potential from a technical standpoint, and are much smarter investments than companies in other sectors such as retail, construction, finances, etc. These stand to lose the least (and win the most, if any!) in the middle of the trade frenzy.
* Do not underestimate the positive Barron's mentions that **$LULU** and **$NKE** received, and consider that the stocks have gotten significant analyst upgrades in the last month or two. Good to keep high on your watchlists if you're a bull or considering entry on a strong retail stock

**BEARISH:**

* Most things, really... I wouldn't consider starting positions on retail right now. For those of you who trade options and are bearish, a lot of the cheddar is to be made here. Shorting stocks like $DLTR and $BBY should print tendies, and I do think there's lots of potential for your $WM and $COST to keep dropping quite a bit.
* Bearish on **$CAT**, **$DE**, **$MMM**
* Bearish on oil companies/oil across the board for next week
* SPY will come down hard if no good news (from China, especially) on the horizon

**EARNINGS PLAYS (I will post an explanation for these in my personal wall to declutter this post):**

* *BULLISH:* **$DIS (holding some calls, will be picking up a few more** ***right before earnings***\*\*) , $TTD, $STMP, $CRON\*\*
* *BEARISH:* **$MELI, $ROKU, $WYNN** (considering buying puts *right before earnings*)

LETS GET THE CHEDDAR, MIS AMIGOS.

Have a bountiful trading week

**\*\*\*Note: I changed the format of this week's post a little and tried to include a little more information on why those are high on my watchlist. This is not investment advise, as you know. For the negative posters - The main purpose for this post, as in the past, is to start a conversation about individual stocks and to encourage sharing ideas about strong stocks/stocks with more easily discernable patterns.** I know that many have benefited in the past, and I will continue to work on these in spite of the shade. Again, these picks are for you to research and to know well, before jumping in.

personalfinance,I am a young professional seeking guidance on budget for housing,"Background: Me (M,22) and my SO (F,19) have started talking about getting an apartment, and establishing a budget for rent. This prompted me to make a full budget for 2020, and I would like a sanity check on it. In September of 2019 I will start my first full-time job in public accounting. I also officiate youth, high school, and college lacrosse as a side gig. My SO is doing her undergrad in nursing at the U of M (downtown Minneapolis, MN). I finished my undergrad in accounting in December 2018, and have loans. I currently live at my dad's house, and have no expenses outside of gas, car insurance, and putting the absolute max to my student loans (more on that below). Dad pays for my phone and will continue to do so into 2020. Here is my yearly estimated budget, assuming a January 2020 move in date:

|Yearly AGI: 59,552.63|Monthly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Taxes (using 2018 tax table): (8,960.08)||
|After Tax Income: 50,592.63| 4,219.05|
|Rent: (10,118.51)| (843.21)|
|Car Insurance: (800)| (66.67)|
|Renters Insurance: (180)| (15)|
|Groceries: (4,200)| (350)|
|Utilities: (1,728)| (144)|
|Car Gas: (2,600)| (216.67)|
|Income after living expenses 30,966.04| (2,580.50)|
|Student Loan payments (7,500)| (1,000)|
|401k (Max) (18,500)| (1541.67)|
|Left over 4,996.04|38.84|

My questions are the following: 

1.) I budgeted 20% of after-tax income for rent. Is this too conservative? SO is able to pay $700 a month, which means if I pay my budgeted monthly ($843.21), our rent budget is $1,543 per month, which puts us in the market for studios, but its tight. Should I increase this amount? Should I use a pre-tax percentage instead, and include utilities, renters insurance, and parking in this assumption? 

2.) Does this leave enough wiggle room? Is maxing the 401k necessary? 

3.) Am I overbudgeting groceries? My yearly number is about 350 per month for just me. 

** On the topic of my student loans: Being an accountant, I made a detailed amortization table to calculate how quickly I will pay my loans off. I started with about $23,500, am currently at $17,500, and plan on being at $7,500 by January 1 2020 (I am greatly oversimplifying for the purposes of understanding, the interest rate is super low). That $7,500 of payments will be $1,000 monthly until August, when I make my last payment of $500.

investing,The impossible trinity,"In light of the recent RMB devaluation, let's revisit one of my favourite topics concerning exchange rates.

The ""impossible trinity"" or the  ""trilemma"", which states that you can have only 2 of the following 3 options:

* Fixed exchange rate
* Independent monetary policy
* Free capital movement

To understand why, we can focus first on the first 2 options (the ""dilemma""). If a foreign country wants to peg its currency against the dollar they can do so by:

1) printing more of their own currency, if it appreciates
2) buying their own currency with their foreign currency reserves, it the currency depreciates.
In principle option 1) is easier to do since in theory the country can print unlimited amounts of money. Nevertheless, it has its limits (see CHF/EUR from 2011 to 2014). Option 2 can only be achieved while reserves last, but many countries manage to balance these forces appropriately for years.

The dilemma appears if the country (A) then decides that they want interest rates different than those in the country (B) they have pegged their currency against. If the country A decides that they want to offer higher interest rates than in B, then investors will want to invest in country A. This situation of course cannot hold. Demand for bonds in currency A will increase dramatically and drive down the price until it is equal to the price in country B. The opposite is also true, if country A wants to offer lower rates, then investors will take their money out of the country and invest it in B. The dilemma is therefore complete you have to chose between independent monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate.

But what happens if we add capital controls? Then investors cannot move their money freely from one country to another. Investors cannot easily move their capital around as interest rates diverge, and therefore the demand and supply pressures do not occur, seemingly allowing the government to have its cake and eat it too (see China, they have fixed ex. rate and their own monetary policy).

Unfortunately, free capital flows are often desirable. One of the key strengths of capitalism is that it allows investors to allocate capital to where its more productive. This strength is lost when capital flows are controlled.

personalfinance,Beat way to consolidate and pay off student loans,"I went to a division 1 college on a partial scholarship to play football and I, as any high school senior athlete would be, was astonished to say I had finally made something of myself. However, just after my freshman year, I got injured. That injury led me to have to quit the sport and just focus on school. It was devastating. What was even more devastating was losing that scholarship and the amount that school was going to cost me. With not much guidance, I went and finished school and pulled out a loan each semester. I now owe $50k in debt to Sallie Mae. However, the biggest problem is that they want me to pay anywhere from $90 to $300 each month on every loan I have out. They all add up to a sum of about $800 a month with around an 11% interest rate which is totally not feasible for me to pay at this point in my life and honestly the interest rate makes me want to throw up. 

My question for this sub is what is the best way to consolidate these 6 or 7  loans I have out right now and also what would be the best way to go about lowering my interest rate and paying these loans of ASAP?",finance

With this new salary, I‚Äôll be able to contribute more money to my savings and/or student loan payments.

personalfinance,Where do I place the money from sale of the house until we buy another?,"My wife took a career opportunity in another city.  I stayed to sell the house, which we now have. I am now looking at jobs in the new city and we are currently renting. Once I get my employment figured out and learn the lay of the land, we will start looking at buying a new house. I expect that to happen in 6 to 18 months. In the mean time, I have $200k from the house sale. I have looked at a number of options including CD's, High Yield Savings Accounts, and Vanguard Money Market Accounts.

Pros of a CD: Known interest rate. Easy to work with the our current bank that has rates within a tenth of a percent of the best we have found. Cons of a CD: how long of a term? 6 months and renew? Just pay the penalty when the right house comes up?

Pros of HYSA: Competitive rates to the CD, can pull whenever the time is right without penalty. Cons of HYSA: Requires working with a new bank and which one? Lots of fine print and concerns that there is a gotcha somewhere we haven't found? Is the rate a teaser rate?

Pros of Money Market: We have Vanguard accounts and have moved tens of thousands into and out of them with ease. Cons: No FDIC insurance. Rate is least predictable.

I would like feedback from this community on how to best handle this. Over such a short period, keeping risks low is the most important. But I would like to capture some rate of return instead of letting it sit in an account with a low interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,Buying vs Leasing vs Financing a car - a financial calculation,"Hi there!
I'm looking into buying an Audi Q5 Premium (~45k incl taxes and fees)
The dilemma I'm faced with currently is how should I pay
I can afford to pay all in cash, but that seems like a waste as I'll be losing whatever interest I could make on that money if I were to invest it.
So I thought about financing, but Audi does not offer any good low APY options (average at 4%)
So the last option is leasing
Based on my research, I can get that car with a residual value of 50% for 39 months (e.g. I'll pay 50% of the cost of the car over a period of 39 months) and the money factor will be around 0.0007 (which roughly translates to a 1.77% interest rate on the lease loan)
There's also some additional costs to consider: There's a bank fee of around $1000, the lease would require more costly insurance and there are probably other costs I'm not yet aware of.
Given this information, and given that I want to purchase a the car for 3 years and not more, I went ahead and checked the kelly blue book value of a 3 year old equivalent car to be able to compare and an excellent condition 2016 Q5p will cost between $21k to $23k - which is roughly 50% of the cost (similar to the car's RV)
I know there are various other things to consider when deciding to purchase vs lease (how much I'll use it, number of miles, etc) but from a purely financial standpoint, which option should I take?
Thanks!",finance

energy,FERC Independence questioned (Politico Morning Energy),"**Officials in and around FERC are concerned** the agency is at risk of becoming a political tool of the Trump administration.

Interviews with more than a dozen current and former FERC regulators, staff and industry officials reveal widespread worries about the direction of the independent agency under Chairman Neil Chatterjee.

**The concerns relate to the potential** for the agency to turn into a political tool of the Trump administration. It's become so politically charged that one Republican state regulator turned down a potential appointment to a vacant seat on the commission after being approached by an interlocutor for the White House, three sources told Gavin. ""The current state of discourse in Washington made me question whether I would be able to influence our national energy policy, or effect any change for that matter,"" the regulator said.

**Critics point to Chatterjee's** public Twitter battles and his ridicule of news articles critical of him at FERC open meetings. Chatterjee also recently lent support to the Trump administration's energy agenda. ""The tweets about the freedom gas, freedom molecules and all that crap ‚Äî that in my view is him \[saying\] 'I'm working for the administration here. This is what I care about,'"" said one former senior staffer.

**Other critics say the chairman** has instituted a top-down management style they say prioritizes feedback from political allies and appointees over the findings of career staffers at the agency. ""He is very good at being external. That's where he thrives,"" said another former staffer. ""But the flip side of that is I think it's harder to get his interest in the work unless it's one of his pet things.""

**Records from FERC and the Office of Personnel Management show** that overall employment at FERC dipped last year to its lowest level since the beginning of the Obama administration, when the agency staffed up to take on new responsibilities granted by Congress. Much of the agency's electricity market policymaking falls under three of its eight main offices ‚Äî Energy Policy and Innovation, Electric Reliability, and Energy Markets and Regulation ‚Äî which have seen their leaders depart since President Donald Trump was elected.

**Chatterjee called that criticism ""unfair,""** saying it ignores bipartisan achievements of his tenure, including new market rules for energy storage and the approval of five liquefied natural gas export facilities. ""I dispute the contention that our work is political and I will point to the over one thousand orders that we have put out, our bipartisan vote on storage, our bipartisan vote on five LNG orders, our bipartisan vote on a number of pipelines,"" and others, he said in an interview.",energy

personalfinance,Housing: Making the Right Choice by Bailing on This Deal?,"TLDR: Put offer on really nice house at really nice price in really nice neighborhood - but leery of ability to sell current house before ability to break contract is gone. 

**Longwind Version:**

My wife and I have been casually in the housing market for a few months. Just looking to see what's out there. 

Our current house (House A) has some major flaws we cannot change: Lots of beautiful hardwood steps (and a toddler), lots of junky neighbors (trash, barking dogs, literal junk), high-traffic area of neighborhood with lots of speeding loud cars. 

When we bought our house (**House A**) in 2016, there was very little on the market (it was November), and even less in our price range. Homes FLEW off the market. We're talking $300k homes that were selling 24 hours after listing. We had made 5 offers prior and all of them had been turned down in favor of all-cash or higher offers. House A stood like a shining beacon - relatively new (all the other 10 homes we had seen were much older), in good condition, and the house (structure) itself checked many boxes. I had some concerns about the parking and the neighborhood, but my wife was excited, so we made a $300k offer that we nearly expected to be turned down, and it was immediately excepted. We improved the parking, cleaned up the property, and its been a comfortable place to live...aside from hardwood stairs that broke my 31 year old wife's hip in a small fall. 

Our time at House A has been nice, but in the last year our neighborhood and neighbor across the street has really upped his level of hillbilly. He's acquired two puppies, who bark constantly. He's acquired a few extra vehicles, most of which sit around in his front yard. Another neighbor has been neglecting to clean up the trash around his property. Our neighborhood is in a period of transition, it used to be a cabin community. Those cabins and trailers are being torn down in favor of large $350,000-$400,000 homes. More residents are becoming full-time, traffic is becoming more constant and less considerate. More dogs. More noise. 

**House B** sat on the market for a two weeks before we made an offer. It's driveway is sloped, not radically, towards the house. No big deal - and I'm picky about driveways. It's backyard is bare. That's ok too. Inside it's flat (no stairs to climb aside from 6 on the back porch), spacious, and in good condition (if only slightly outdated). The neighborhood is great. Quiet. HOA that helps, not hinders. Good neighbors. So quiet. The type of neighborhood where kids can play in the street. It's a big cul-de-sac so low traffic. Homes range sales and values range between $350-$450, we made an offer of $370k. It was accepted. **IT WASNT CONTINGENT**. *Meaning, we gambled to see if we could get offers on house in the two week inspection period.*

Immediately after getting news that we were in contract, we listed House A for sale. Priced it less than homes of similar size and age. The first weekend we got 3 showings. By the second weekend we had had a single showing. No offers. All 5 showings had roughly the same feedback - **""didn't like the area and didn't like the steps.""** Great, the only two things I can do nothing about. 

Our local market is suddenly sluggish. There have been 6 homes in our neighborhood that have been on the market for 20 days or more. Lots of price cuts, no movement. 

We're now in the final days of our Inspection Period for House B, and I'm getting cold feet. House B is a good deal, and we can easily afford it by itself. Ironically enough because with our improved credit and lower interest rates our mortgage will be almost the same the house that cost $70k less. Thing is, I don't think we can afford two mortgages. That would be roughly $3000 a month plus taxes and insurance and utilities. 

**WE CANNOT WAIT.** This isn't a ""give it a few more weeks"" - if we give it a few more weeks House B will be gone and we'll need to hope for a similar house to be available if and when we get an offer on our house. **WE NEED TO MAKE THIS DECISIONS ASAP.**

Our debate:

**Should we get House B and price House A to sell at a loss: Say, price it at $300,000?**


**Should we rent House A (rent estimate between $1600-$1800 - current mortgage is $1450)?**


**Should we bail on House B, continue to list House A, and see what kind of offers we get and if there are other homes we like at that time?**",finance

Now we want to make it work for us.  We use Personal capital to track things and they've been giving us the hard sell on financial advice but my preference is to put it into a high yield account and let it accumulate some interest.

Since S1 had the money I was a W2 employee at S1, drawing salary, benefits, 401k, etc.

S2 recently got funded so now the plan is for me to be a W2 employee at both startups, each paying half of my salary (with a hefty bump), half my benefits, etc.  **Are there any tax ramifications to drawing 50% of my salary from each of two W2's as compared to 100% from one W2?.**  

* I may have to increase my withholdings since the W4 calculator may not account for the total income plus my wife's, I imagine.
* FICA/Medicare tax is a flat percent, so that shouldn't matter, right?
* Obviously my EOY tax bill is agnostic to the breakdown of the W2 income - only cares about the total.
* As ""HR,"" are there any adjustments I need to make for Fed/Stateun unemployment insurance taxes or the various other things they tack on?",finance

A sane person wouldn't even think of doing that -- or would they?

MachineLearning,[N] Flatland Challenge - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Transportation Systems,"Hi all


We launched the [Flatland Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-challenge), which is an official challenge of the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org/challenges.html). 



# Flatland: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Challenge

*The Flatland Challenge is a competition to foster progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning for real world applications. The [re-scheduling problem (RSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_rescheduling_problem), which has traditionally been approached by operations research, serves as an excellent challenge to investigate the possibilies of deep learning for planning in stochastic environments. Different rounds with increasing difficulty and the presence of stochasticity in the environment encourage participants to look beyond classical planning algorithms and come up with solutions for the transport management systems of the future.*

## The Challenge

The challenge requires your creativity and savviness. In 2 submission rounds with increasing difficulty, you can prove that you have what it takes. We invite you to enter the race with your unique solution and to win great prizes - at the same time solving one of the key challenges in the world of transportation!

In contrast to most reinforcement learning challenges the focus of this challenge is not solely on the submission of great algorithms as controllers. We encourage the participants to come up with novel **observation spaces** for this challenge and share them with the community (community prize awarded) to improve performance on this task.

## Real world applications

The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) operate the densest mixed railway traffic in the world. SBB maintain and operate the biggest railway infrastructure in Switzerland. Today, there are more than 10,000 trains running each day, being routed over 13,000 switches and controlled by more than 32,000 signals. Each day 1.2 million passengers and almost half of Switzerland‚Äôs volume of transported goods are transported on this railway network. Due to the growing demand for mobility, SBB needs to increase the transportation capacity of the network by approximately 30% in the future.

The increase in transport capacity can be achieved through different measures, such as [denser train schedules, investments in new infrastructure, and/or investments in new rolling stock](https://smartrail40.ch/index.asp?inc=&amp;lang=en). However, SBB currently lack suitable technologies and tools to quantitatively assess these different measures.

The SBB are therefore looking for novel approaches that can help revolutionize the transportation system of the future.

## Prizes

Your problem solutions mean something to us - hence prizes with a total value of 30k CHF (approx. 30k USD) are reserved for those with the best submissions. You can excel in two categories: The best solution category and the community prize category. Within both those categories your submission is individually ranked taking into account your performance in Round 1 and Round 2. Make sure to check the participation rules before you start. Only submissions conforming to our rules have a chance of winning the prizes.

**Best Solution Prize**: Won by the participants with the best performing submission on our test set. Both of your rankings from the Round 1 and Round 2 are taken into account. Check the leader board on this site regularly for the latest information on your ranking.      

The top three submissions in this category will be awarded the following cash prizes (in Swiss Francs):

**CHF 7‚Äô500.- (~USD 7‚Äô500) for first prize**

**CHF 5‚Äô000.- (~USD 5‚Äô000) for second prize**

**CHF 2‚Äô500.- (~USD 2‚Äô500) for third prize**


**Community Contributions Prize**: Awarded to the person/group who makes the biggest contribution to the community - done through generating new observations and sharing them with the community.

The top submission in this category will be awarded the following cash prize (in Swiss Francs): **CHF 5‚Äô000.- (~USD 5‚Äô000)**

In addition, we will hand-pick and award up to five (5) travel grants to the Applied Machine Learning Days 2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland. Participants with promising solutions may be invited to present their solutions at SBB in Bern, Switzerland.

&gt; **Note:** It is possible for a participant to win in both categories

personalfinance,Level of debt means we might never get ahead - bankruptcy an option?,"I will try to provide all the relevant info, but please ask if I am leaving something out or if something is not clear. My spouse and I carry a total debt load of about $106,000 - a combination of student loans, personal loans, back taxes, medical debt, and an auto loan. Our total payments are $2733/month.

One big loan - about $28k - will be gone in less than 3 years because of the payment structure. Same with the car loan ($12k) and another personal loan ($4k). My students loans are barely moving because of how little I pay toward them. They make up the bulk of the debt at $54k.

Other info - we currently have about $5k in savings that I want to earmark toward debt and monthly expenses of about $2800. I take home $4600/month net and my spouse brings in freelance income that is about $1500-2000/month PRE-tax. \[another EDIT: spouse was out of work for a while, trying to find something FT. This freelance income is a way to bring in some cash while they continue looking for a FT gig. 100% agree this should be a huge priority.\]

When I look at these figures I just feel like we are not in a place where we can ever dig ourselves out let alone get to the point where we are saving money, but I am not sure. I have reached out to a credit counselor who would like to put us on a consolidation plan. We could do that, but I am also wondering if we should consider bankruptcy. The problem is I don't think you can include student loan debt in bankruptcy so I am not sure if it is worth the damage to my/our credit.

Right now I am able to make payments on time, we reduce our expenses wherever possible, but I am trying to   understand if I am doing everything right with tackling/managing the debt or if I am missing something. I am super ignorant about money (obviously) so I am not sure what the best thing to do is.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my 1-year-old mortgage?,"I bought a house in summer 2018 for $300k with 10% down. I got a 30-year fixed mortgage at 4.75% yearly interest rate and with a PMI of about $40 a month.

Today, about a year later, I am seeing information of 30-year fixed interest rates dropping to as low as 3.50%, and I am considering whether refinancing makes sense. It is a significant drop in the interest rate, but obviously that saving must be balanced with the closing costs of a new mortgage loan.

Bought a house about 2 years ago for \~$420,000, put $110,000 down and got 4.0% on a 30 year fixed conventional loan. I've been paying it down with extra money here and there and currently owe \~$277,000. Our monthly payment is \~$1,500 plus bills, insurance and taxes. My wife and I have \~$60,000 in cash and \~$40,000 in other liquid assets (not retirement accounts). We both make decent salaries and have $3,000 or so extra each month without trying to save money while putting in a large chunk to 401k (16% and 15%). We keep the cash on hand so we have 1.5-2 years expenses paid at our current consumption rate and/or want to make a large purchase (like a car) or unexpected expense without having to think about it or take loans. With the mortgage rates dropping I can probably put the $60,000 into the mortgage and refinance to a 15 year loan to get a lower interest rate (closer to 3%) with about the same monthly payment. We'd be cash poor for a while but still have the $40,000 in easily liquidated assets in the case of an emergency. We'd save about $35,000 on the back end of the loan by shortening the loan period by 2 years plus the money saved on interest on the front end.

We're also taking the standard deduction on taxes now so we don't get any tax break paying the interest on the existing loan.",finance
personalfinance,How Best to Utilize a 3% Raise,"Hello!

I was recently informed that I would be seeing a 3% pay raise this month. It would be nice to just enjoy the raise each month, but I've been trying to work for the future and make better financial decisions. 

I've sort of narrowed down a couple paths, and I was hoping for some help deciding. 

I could add it to my retirement contributions. Currently, I am putting away 15%, and I'd like to begin raising that until I get to 20 or 25% (or within the legal contributions limits, whichever). If I'm reading the information correctly, my gains have been between 11 and 12% this year. 

I am also paying off a car ($17,000) with a 9% annual interest rate. I know that that is baaaaaaad, but my credit was/still sort of is very poor from some bad habits in my late teens/early 20's. 

My instinct would be to just put the raise towards the car until it's paid off, but am I missing any important factors to consider? What would you do? 

PS: Please forgive my misuse of any terminology. I'm still learning a lot about personal finance.",finance

Every day, I get things in the mail saying I can refinance with some VA loan refinance program. Today I got 3. They all say things like ‚ÄúNo out of pocket fees‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo appraisal‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo income verification‚Äù.

Ripple,"Dilip Rao, Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation at Ripple, just retweeted FedNow news",,cryptocurrency
economy,View: Few economic issues that need immediate attention,"Now that elections are over, no one in the ruling dispensation needs to pretend that the economy has not been in dire doldrums for quite some time. There are many severe problems the economy faces, some requiring immediate attention, others more structured long-term policy changes. Of the former, I‚Äôll pick two. 

First off, is the continuing scourge of demand deficiency (and the resultant low capacity utilisation) that discourages private investment. More than tinkering with tax concessions or interest rates, one needs pumppriming public investment on a large scale. The lack of investment is associated with lack of non-farm jobs and massive underemployment and unemployment, particularly among our restless youth (providing the foot soldiers of gangster-politicians and lynch-mobs). 

So, the public investment has to be job-creating ‚Äî in construction, roads, public housing, warehouses, cold storage, etc. In rural areas, demand has to be boosted through more such construction programmes and by expanding the scale of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) schemes. It‚Äôs not really ‚Äòemployment guarantee‚Äô, as evidence suggests that there is a large unmet demand for such jobs in many states. 

Evidence also suggests that leakages in the original programme have now diminished substantially. This rural programme now needs to be supplemented by an urban employment guarantee on public works and civic programmes improving our crumbling urban infrastructure. 

So, where will the money come from, at a time when fiscal deficit is rising? With relatively low inflation, we may afford to relax a bit on the fiscal deficit goals if money is productively spent on income-boosting construction and capital projects. Besides, India‚Äôs tax-GDP ratio has remained low and stagnant even after decades of high growth, while wealth inequality (as measured by National Sample Survey (NSS) data) has now mounted to almost South American levels. 

A large-scale reform of our current subsidies (much of which are enjoyed by the rich and middle-classes), and increase in direct taxes (with current under-taxation of property values and capital gains and zero-taxation of wealth, inheritance and agricultural incomes) can be carried out at a relatively short notice. 

The other looming problem we can‚Äôt look away from any more is the water crisis ‚Äî for both drinking water and irrigation in large parts of water-depleted and ecologically stressed India. Along with immediate and drastic reduction of power and water subsidies, mass mobilisation of decentralised water-user associations in water management and rainfall harvesting is imperative. 

Of the more long-run policy issues, let me flag only a few. Our whole secondary education system has to be largely restructured and channelled to a mass-scale vocational training programme, in partnership with private employers. 

Otherwise, many jobseekers will remain unemployable. In view of our dismal export performance ‚Äî at a time when Vietnam is picking up the sectors China is graduating from ‚Äî and the slump in our job-creating automobile and ancillary sectors, renewed efforts at a coordinated industrial policy, particularly in financing and supportive regulatory environment, are urgent. 

In agriculture, where there is a large potential for job-creation in high-valued produce like fruit, vegetables and livestock products, what is needed, apart from investment in rural infrastructure, is opening up all marketing channels, thus disabling the current cartelised markets, and facilitating the widespread formation of farm companies and cooperatives to stem the adverse effects of declining land size. 

The largely wasteful and iniquitous current minimum support price (MSP) policy should be oriented mainly toward millet crops and pulses. All this will require political courage. But that should not be beyond the capacity of our current muscular leadership. 

In a country with one of the world‚Äôs largest disease burdens, GoI is pushing Ayushman Bharat, an underfunded and hyped programme of insurance for hospital indoor expenditure for the poor. 

In general, India has yet to debate seriously at the political level why a subsidised private insurance model to cover only about 40% of the population ‚Äî and that too not for their more substantial expenses on drugs and outdoor visits ‚Äîis to be preferred to other models of universal healthcare with larger risk pools bringing down costs (as, say, in Thailand or Australia). 

A large number of Indians, even far above the poverty line, face all kinds of brutal weather, health or market-related risks in life. 

To provide some minimum economic security against such risks ‚Äî apart from boosting the autonomy of women in the family and the fallback option of all informal workers ‚Äî unconditional basic income supplement for everybody, far beyond PM-KISAN for farmers, should be implemented in phases. 

Finally, administratively, we are retreating from effective decentralisation needed for successful economic policy in a large diverse country. Power remains over-concentrated in the PMO, choking decision points, while Bills impinging on state powers are hurriedly passed in Parliament without consulting the states. All this is making a mockery of the oft-repeated rhetoric of ‚Äòcooperative federalism‚Äô. 

Political loyalty and seniority, rather than performance, dictate promotion of bureaucrats, and public sector enterprises and regulatory bodies for private sector operations remain ‚Äòindependent‚Äô only on paper.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans or car loan first?,"So this question is actually for my girlfriends debt. 

She has a car valued at about 20k and owes $10,200 left on it. Interest is 2.95%.

She has two student loans. One is 49k at 5.9% and the other is 41k at 5.8%. 

She has 12k in savings. 

I told her that the savings is not going to ever earn interest higher than any of those and that she should put it toward the debt now as it is only costing her interest every month until paid. She has been paying 275 per month on the car with about 3 years left. She has been paying $100 on each student loan as she is set up for income driven plan allowing for her to pay less than the interest. This is actually making the student loans grow as it started at 85k and is now at almost 91k.

So I‚Äôve suggested she pay off the car first. I know it‚Äôs got the lowest interest rate, but it will free up her monthly bills to let her put it toward the student debt. If she switched from income based to a 25 year plan that gradually increases (~20 more every two years) her new payments would be 493. Roughly the same as it is now. $18 more but that‚Äôs within her budget. 

She makes about 48k gross now and will be making more in the future for sure as she is currently a junior architect working on becoming a senior architect at her office. 

Am I right in this course of action? Also, is it better to stay on income driven plan and just pay the extra each month, or better to switch to a plan that forces her to pay the extra amount each month? I see both sides of that argument. Staying income sensitive will always give her the flex if an emergency happens. Structured will help keep her from deviating although I don‚Äôt think she ever would unless it was a medical emergency or something horrible.

personalfinance,Why am I paying so much tax on my intern salary?,"International student currently interning in CA this summer. My monthly salary is $6000/months, so for 12 weeks this works out to be roughly $16,600.

On my last two pay checks, I was deducted roughly **26%** \-- this is for federal and state taxes only, and does not include FICA.

I went through the tax brackets and calculated the amount of tax I should be paying and it doesn't seem right to me. Assuming I work for full year (so receiving a salary of $72,000):

&amp;#x200B;

Taxable income = 72,000 - 12,000 = **$60,000**

**Federal**

10% \* $0 - $9,525 = $952.5

12% \* $9,526 - $38,700 = $3,500.88

22% \* $38,701 - $60,000 = $4,685.78

total federal tax = $9,139.16

&amp;#x200B;

**State (California)**

1% \* $0 - $8,544 = $85.44

2% \* $8,545 - $20,255 = $234.2

4% \* $20,256 - $31,969 = $468.52

6% \* $31,970 - $44,377 = $744.42

8% \* $44,378 - $56,085 = $936.56

9.3% \* $56,086 - $60,000 = $364.0

total state tax = $2,833.14

&amp;#x200B;

Total Annual tax = $11,972.302 or **16.6%** of annual income.

This is far less than the 26% I'm getting deducted at the moment. Even if I don't deducted the standard allowance of $12,000, I've worked it out to be 21.8%.

personalfinance,"Identity stolen by family member, accounts opened, need advice","One of my brothers (we'll call him Brother 1), called to ask for my help budgeting his money. I'm kind of the financial guru in the family, and had previously set him up on YNAB. He does not have a ton of debt, but money stressed him out big time, and he wanted my help getting a handle on his budget. He was stressed about his credit card interest rate, so tried to get a personal loan to pay it off. He was denied due to his credit. I asked him for access to his CC account to see what was going on there and why his credit was in the toilet.  


While I was in his account, I saw that there was the option to look at credit score/report, so I took the opportunity to check things over. It showed 20 late payments. Brother 1 has assured me that he has never paid an account late (I believe him). I found one closed credit card (closed by creditor) with a balance of about $4,000. Two more accounts showed up under ""Derogatory Marks"", one with a balance of about $9,000, and one with a balance of about $1,000. Both closed by creditors. All three accounts were opened on the same day, and all three stopped being paid in February of this year.  


Brother 1 assured me that he knew nothing of these accounts. While we were chatting about it, he told me he had our younger brother (we will call him Brother 2) on the phone. Why? Brother 2 told him that he has resources at work who can help with this stuff. Turns out Brother 1 had ""weird calls"" from creditors in the past. Brother 2 always seemed to know when these ""weird calls"" took place. As we're talking about this, I happen to notice under personal information on the credit report that Brother 2 has two of HIS addresses (in another state) listed on Brother 1's credit report. It all clicks into place.  


Meanwhile, Brother 2 jumps on to chat with me now...wants me to send him Brother 1's credit report so work can take care of it. I told him I could not. Brother 2 told Brother 1 and me both not to have Brother 1 dispute the accounts because Brother 2 would have ""them"" at work take care of it and he would dispute it himself. I'm no idiot and of course see right through this as further confirmation that Brother 2 is, in fact, the culprit. I relay this information to Brother 1. Brother 1 is shocked, feels like a sucker, and also wonders if our dad helped Brother 2 accomplish this. I don't trust my dad with money, and I think that's a definite possibility but I can't prove it one way or another.  


Now the fun part: what do we do? Brother 1 makes a modest living. He doesn't deserve to be on the hook for this debt...but here's the rub: Brother 2 is married with a two-year-old, one-year-old twins, and baby #4 on the way in the winter. He's fucked, I know. It kills me that this will affect the kids. Somehow he needs to face the music. Reality is a bitch.  


I told Brother 1 I will help him get it off his report, but I am not sure exactly what we will need to do. I warned him this might involve police. The feeling I get is that he will do what is necessary, and I promised I will have his back. And I will.

I‚Äôve been doing some looking around lately and found out about high yield savings accounts, and decided I‚Äôll open a savings account with Discover which has a 2% interest rate.

personalfinance,"26, FT job ($25/hr) paycheck is completely taken over by bills","Not the most exciting thing in this thread, but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I've gotten myself into a pretty shitty financial mess and I'm looking for advice on how to make it less shitty.

I am a female working a FT job M-F making $25/hr ($52k/year). Back in May I decided to take on a roommate, and as of last month I started a second job doing some remote work from home. I pretty much got into this mess after breaking up with my verbally abusive ex-boyfriend, who moved out in October, which led me to some bad money decisions and pretty much on my own.

My monthly bills are as follows:

* **Kohl's credit card** $65
* **TD Bank credit card** $200
* **Discover credit card** $50
* **Internet** $66
* **Car loan** $450
* **Private student loan** $350
* **Renter's insurance** $19
* **Car insurance** $132
* **PetPlan insurance** $33
* **Phone** $87
* **Spotify** $10
* **Gas** $70
* **Groceries** $200
* **Deductions (health insurance, 401K)** $266
* **Fitbod (fitness app - my only sanity)** $10
* **Electric** $150
* **Gas** $75
* **Rent** $1,000

= **Total** $3,233

After taxes, I make about $3,000/mo... which is when I decided to take on a roommate (rent is $650) and to then to take on a second job (\~$600/mo). Regardless of the extras, I'd really like to get some of these bills down.

The main ones I'm aiming for are/ would like advice on are:

* TD Bank credit card - my balance on this became high after my breakup, due to not having enough money for bills. I know I need to get this balance lower. Would a credit transfer be a good idea? Or getting a loan to pay it off?
* Car loan - I just got the car within the last 6 months but I would like to refinance the loan eventually, as the interest rate is 6.37%. Anyone know the best time to do this?
* Phone - I'm on Verizon and have to stay on Verizon as I share my plan with my grandmother, who lives in the middle of nowhere and only gets Verizon service... anyone know anything about getting Verizon bills lower?
* Student loans - getting worried about the fact that I'm in school for my Master's and and currently in deferment but am graduating June 2020. The loan after that should be around $300/mo until I'm 53 years old...
* Rent - I'd kill to look into buying a small home/condo but I just feel like I can't afford it... right? Everyone always tell me my rent is high (I live in Western MA) but would it be irresponsible of me at this point to look into buying a home?

Any help is appreciated. I've recently figured out that I'm an idiot with money and that I really need to start living on Ramen.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE:\*\*

Everyone here has been amazing. One of the biggest things I've done since this breakdown a few days ago is look into Verizon Prepaid. I went into Verizon yesterday and paid off my phone in full ($376, my first step in the snowball method) and I am now going to be joining a Verizon prepaid plan with my grandmother, which saves me $65/month (and gives us both more data somehow?), $660/year in total.

My next step are my credit cards, then loans. When my credit score goes back up, I plan on refinancing the car - I know about 80% of commenters said to sell the car, but I just purchased it (BAD money decision) within 6 months and if I got rid of it, I'd be upside down over $10k. I'm more motivated than ever to pay it off now. To pay everything off.

I downloaded an app on my phone (Debt Payoff Planner), added all my debts, wrote in how much extra I could pay (I only put in $650 as my second job is grant-based and will be ending June 2020, though I do plan on getting another second job after that), and it has me debt-free by August 2023. Exactly four years from now. I never imagined I could do this that fast.

Thank you so much to everyone. This has been turned from an emotional crisis to the biggest motivator I could've asked for.",finance

personalfinance,My paycheck is smaller than I calculated it would be...,"This is only my second paycheck from this job. I make $11/hr, work about 25 hrs per week, and I'm paid bi-weekly. Location is Arizona.

I've been keeping close track of my hours with a notebook and online spreadsheet. By my calculations I've worked 57.93 hours this pay period so my gross paycheck should have been $637, but my pay stub claims I worked 53.25 hours so I received $585. From that, almost $120 was taken out for taxes and Social Security, leaving me with only $466.

First, how can I best bring up this discrepancy to my boss in a respectful manner? I'd like to get paid for those missing hours without getting on his bad side. He's an older semi-traditional Japanese man so there's a little bit of a cultural divide to consider.

Second, do those taxes sound high? They come out to almost 21% of my paycheck: about $60 for federal, $45 for SS, and the rest to the state. When I filled out my W-4 I was worried about owing money at tax time so I may have chosen higher percentages to be withheld than was necessary.

Edit: I have triple-checked my math and found a miscalculation in my spreadsheet. There's still some time I haven't been paid for, but it's less than half of what I originally thought. I do still need to compare my time logs to my boss's so we're on the same page regarding exactly when I'm to start/stop working.",finance

personalfinance,Optimize Loan Repayment Program,"Hello,

I am an engineer currently trying to figure out how to optimize my student loan repayment. The problem statement is as follows:

Given:

Three Loans, 1 medical, 1 FAFSA, 1 Parent Plus

Medical Loan Amount = 1,909.63

Minimum Payment = 95.53

Interest Rate = 0%

FAFSA Loan Amount = 56,231.00

Minimum Payment = 580.06

Interest Rate = 4.4%

Parent Plus Loan = 19,440.06

Minimum Payment 227.83

Interest Rate = 7.21%

Let us assume I have an extra $500/period to pay towards these loans.

Find: Optimal distribution of 500 extra dollars so that the total interest paid across all loans is minimized through the life of all of the loans.

Soln: This is where you guys come in.

Note: Do not comment and say ""Pay the highest interest loan first"" without mathematics to back up the fact that I would in total pay less interest doing it that way. Also, do not say ""Pay the loans off smallest to largest"" without work to show this is best. I believe both of these scenarios can be easily debunked, for example: The interest amount on the larger loan over 1 period is .044\*56,231= 2,474.16 whereas the interest on the high interest but a smaller loan is .0721\*19,440.06 = 1401.63. That is over a 1000 difference.

Extra Credit: How could I write a program that takes into account my extra money each month and tells me how much to put in each loan above the minimum payment. In this case, assume the extra payment is variable to account for off months, etc...

I will keep working on this myself and see what I come up with and share if I figure it out",finance

My wife and i withdrew $20k so that we could put down 20% on our house to avoid PMI.  I left the other 180 with AAFMAA where it earns a guaranteed 4%/year paid monthly.

personalfinance,Mom wants to pay a big chunk of my student loan debt. Not sure on direction?,"So...some background. I took out two sets of student loans, one federal subsidized and one private. These were co-signed by my parents, later my mother (my father died shortly after I started school). A little over 10 years ago, as I was initially struggling to get my footing after college, my mom and I came to an agreement: She would cover the private loans, while I covered the public loans. It took a very long time to do the latter because I struggled to find a decent job (which I only really got in the last year or so), but I'm starting to look at finally pushing to clean out the public loan within the next year.

This is how the numbers look:

**Public**

* Loan 1 $3065 4.16%
* Loan 2 $5602 6.3%
* Loan 3 $5602 6.3%

**Private**

* Loan 1 $8665 4%
* Loan 2 $12214 5%
* Loan 3 $13472 5%

(Note: All interest rates are variable.)

My personal short-term plan involved clearing out the public loan over the next 12 months, aggressively save another round of money, take over the private loans from my mom, take out the largest chunk, then refinance the remainder on possibly more favorable terms. I have about $5500 saved right now for explicitly this purpose, and my plan was to go into action in the fall.

Then I got a call last week from my mom, who retired last year. She said that she wanted to clear out a major portion of the student loans using her IRA, as much as possible. She was initially suggesting that she was clear out the the entire public loan first. Her main concern at the moment is tax issues, which she wanted to consult with her accountant about (who is on vacation...maybe?).

That said, I'm a little concerned for a couple reasons. Part of the reason I was able to get by over the last 10 years was because I was able to take advantage of the lenient policies surrounding federal loans while my mom provided cover on the private loans (which lacked such leniency and what caused us to make the agreement in first place). If she goes after the public loans first, and then leaves me to take care of the private loans, who knows what'll happen the next time I, say, get laid off or something (which has happened to me in the past). The other thing is...I do appreciate her being so willing to do this, but I also feel extremely guilty that she's taking money out of her own retirement funds to pay these off, especially since it was my struggle that brought this mess in the first place (Thanks, Great Recession!)

I'm not sure how to handle this in terms of adding this new element to the picture, both fiscally and mentally. Any direction on this?",finance

The other is a Panasonic/Enphase using N330 panels quoted for $2.93 per watt

I like that the Sunpower system provides a company backed full warranty for 25 years (minus the monitoring which is only 10yrs) so even if my installer goes out of business, Sunpower will still cover the warranty. I'm aware of Sunpower financials, and while company is not doing good, seems Total is still interested in investing in them, they have a good cash reserve for warranty repairs and seems they are doing well converting from a wholesale vendor to a residential/commercial vendor.

The Panasonic system is from a Panasonic authorized installer, they have been in operation since 2014, their workmanship warranty is only 10 years and they say the company has a savings account for warranty purposes if it's ever needed, they are little more diversified as they do other electrical services.

Since I have never done a refinance before - and our goal is to pay down our house ahead of time anyway - would it make sense to do this refinance? Or would it be better to just put everything towards paying down the current amount.  

In addition, I have an extra $100k that I was holding onto since we just had a medical situation and a baby, but we think we are past both now and are now trying to decide to pay down the loan with this and/or invest it somehow. If I did refinance, would it better to put this $100k to use before or after the refinance? (Not sure how that works).
The way I look at it right now, is if I put it into our current loan, that is saving more money at a higher interest rate, but maybe there is some way to negotiate better if I have it for the refinance?

I also have no clue how this affects things like insurance, etc.  Currently our mortgage pays for the taxes on the house as well.  I would prefer to just pay my own taxes honestly, but not sure if I will be required to on a refinance. 

Thank you for any insight.",finance
personalfinance,Just received paperwork offering me options for my retirement plan,"I started working at a company about a month ago. I recently received my paperwork for my retirement plan, and the options I have. I'm a little bit confused. I want to make sure I'm getting the most out of it, but there are many different plans, all that sound good to me, but I know there's one that that will probably best suit me. However, I am awful with investing, I don't know the language, and it just all around confuses me. Could anyone lead me to a few sources that might be helpful with understanding this better? I've been searching the thread, but none are really ""hey I'm a complete idiot with finances and understand absolutely none of it, and suddenly being offered financial opportunities.""

Seriously, all help will definitely be appreciated. I'm so terrified I'll be screwing my future self by choosing the wrong plan.

edit: I've been reading through the FAQ, but looking for a little bit of advice about what would be best for me, or what others have done and the different benefits. Sorry if this is obvious, this is the first time I've been offered something like this, and besides my own taxes I've never done something where interests is a thing. I've gone through my life paying cash for everything and never worrying about interest. Suddenly this is a real concern for me, and I have no idea what a good interest rate is.

I launched my first course just over three months ago and this is the current result of my efforts.

I actually achieved the first $50K without running any ads either! This was all done organically with a Facebook group.How? I added value in other groups and engaged with anyone that responded to my posts. If it felt suitable, I would invite them to my Facebook group. Pinned to the top of that group was a case study video and sales video rolled into one. They were hot leads, they joined the group, they saw the video and they purchased my course.Pretty easy!

Hands up who has a course? I'd love to hear how you have done in terms of marketing it.

I've since beefed up my efforts with paid ads, but that first $50K milestone with just an organic group is something I'm proud of and would be happy to share any helpful tips to you guys.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Question about overdrafting ACH BofA,"My rent was due yesterday and I was slightly short of the amount due so I transferred some money from a brokerage account to cover it which was scheduled to clear today (Tuesday). I scheduled the ACH rent payment on Sunday night to be paid on the 5th (monday) knowing that the actual ACH pull wouldn‚Äôt happen until Tuesday morning. I checked my account this morning and I‚Äôm in the positive where I should be (both rent pull and brokerage push are being reflected) but the brokerage push processing date is 8/5 (yesterday) and the ach rent pull processing date is 8/6 (today) so the rent is processed after the deposit.

I got an email this morning saying my account fell below 25 but I didn‚Äôt get any overdraft emails yet. What probably happened is that the actual ach flags set off in the order of pull push originally and then the bank reflected the push for earlier but at some point my account must have been overdrawn if the pull happened first so I wonder if my rent payment will go through. That‚Äôs all I really care about right now. 

When do banks determine the equivalent of HTTP 200 OK response codes when talking to the federal reserve? Is it instantly when an ach pull is made? Or is there a period of time before the bank sets their response code per transaction and if so was that period of time long enough for my push to hit and for them to generate the correct response code.",finance

personalfinance,Help deciding student loan debt repayment route,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôve been reading through r/PersonalFinance for a long time and have been helped immensely by it. Solid community here! 

My wife and I need some help figuring out what the best course of action is for paying back my student loans. We have a few options and I am just not sure what the best avenue would be when contemplating risk, time, etc. Any sage wisdom would be appreciated. 

Background: I just graduated in February from anesthesia school. I have loans from undergrad degrees and graduate school. I work full time at a great job with amazing benefits. My wife and I have 3 spawn (6 yrs, 4 yrs, 1.5 yrs).

Data: 

-	student loan debt ~$191,000 (avg interest rate ~6%)
-	salary (pre tax, mandatory retirement, healthcare) - $170,000

Currently many of my loans are in deferment but will enter repayment soon. My position and institution qualify me for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I have read about this at length (pitfalls, perils, and benefits). The unknowns of the program make me uneasy. Also the accumulation of massive amount of interest that will *hopefully* be discharged and the subsequent tax burden on said discharged remainder. 

Below is from studentaid.gov and shows a breakdown of my payments/total cost with tge standard repayment as well as with the income based repayment and PSLF. 

https://imgur.com/a/6RAlrUy/

Below is a screen cap of a consolidation/refinace quote from sofi. 

https://i.imgur.com/lzCRgGI.jpg

So, I just need some guidance on what the best course of action would be. I know the potential benefit from the PSLF is great, but the unknowns, the length of time, and the potential for still being on the hook for ~$100,000 of accrued interest makes me nervous. 

I‚Äôm positive I have left out valuable information so please accost me if more information/data would be helpful. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Starting grad school - should I take out a government loan and payoff consumer debt?,"So currently we have quite a bit of credit card debt due to a recent move and some poor financial choices in the past that we're still paying for. My question are these:

1. Should we take out some stafford loans offered to me and pay off credit cards? (CC interest rate is around 13% vs the max 6% for student loans)
2. Do these grad school loans also get forgiven under PSLF, which I'm currently 3 years into for my undergrad loans (I've verified they're all current)?

I'm using my VA educational benefits to help offset the costs of grad school, but only qualify for 90% since my time in service is only 3 years so far. The stafford loans would be to simply pay off credit cards.

Currently, I'm active duty and detailed to a civilian agency and on an Income Based Repayment program, which currently makes my monthly payments $0 (5 kids, and taxable/base pay is around $5,000). Just trying to figure out the best course of action.",finance
personalfinance,"Start saving some, or pay off CC debt?","In January I ended a long term relationship where I was pretty financially dependent and didn't graduate school and start working until May of this year, so I accumulated a bit of credit card debt to survive those few months. Then my new place had a massive water leak and I had to pay a $600 water bill that I'm STILL trying to get the owners to refund me for (it wasn't my fault the place had a leak, but the water bill is in my name--this is a whole another, frustrating issue.)

So moral of the story **I'm currently slightly under 4k in debt on a 22% interest Discover card.** I still have a decent credit score, around 730, if that matters at all.

\-I'm an entry level engineer and take home about **2.8k a month** after all is said and done (55k annual salary).

\-My parents are amazing and still pay my car insurance and phone bill but want me to start paying it all by the first of the year.

\-I start paying back student loans in December, and that'll be around $600 a month if I take the \~least interest accumulated\~ route. I think I can afford to. (I have federal loan debt around $45k, then my mom has about $30k in Parent Plus Loans that I agreed to pay back without her assistance. )

Monthly expenses:

Rent + (normal) Utilities: $600 (it was \~$1200, I just got a roommate and they'll start paying half in September.)

Internet: $45

Gas: $75

Groceries: $250

Pets: $100 (I have 2 dogs, and one's a puppy so he goes to the vet often)

That's really it. I go out to eat too often still, and usually spend about $75 per month on that.

I'm trying to cut back on recreational spending as well.

So my question is: **Should I throw all my extra cash flow onto that credit card bill, or start throwing money into savings to build an emergency fund?** I currently have $20 in savings, because I drained it all to survive January-May.

gaming,"Probably gonna get hanged for this, but RDR2 is slow and boring.","Now don't get me wrong, I loved the first Red Dead Redemption game when it came out. Admittedly not right away, and I wasn't used to the slow pacing of the story they used during the intro, as inwas expecting an exact spiritual sequel to Red Dead Revolver, one of my favorite PS2 classics of all time.

Once I stuck with it though. Persisted into the storyline a bit more and got into some exciting missions, i was hooked. I ended up living as John Marston, living the life of an ex-outlaw as I toured the west, looking to finally free myself from the shackles of the government's tight hold over me and settle down with my family at the farm.

The gameplay was exciting, the story was captivating, and the characters I either loved so much I wanted to see them given a happy ending, or hated enough that I wanted to see a bullet in their head.

Last Christmas, I recieved my own copy of Red Dead Redemption 2, and quite honestly, didn't know what to expect.

Should I expect the same slow paced intro as the last game? Or would things speed up this time around like on Red Dead Revolver.

Turns out; it was neither. Somehow, RDR2 managed to get even slower in every aspect of the game. From shooting your gun, to the pacing of the story, to even basic movement on and off your horse, this game seems to be intent on doing 2 things:

A. Making sure it makes you give to give up as much free time as you have, as just about everything takes about 30 minutes.

And B. Making sure that you barely have any control over what's going on in the game. Your horse rides itself, your guns aim themselves, half the game is cutscenes or just walking alongside someone while they and your character talk. (Something I was hoping we outlawed with Assassins Creed.)

And not only that, but you've got to juggle so much crap just to function in this game, it's a constant stress on your shoulders while you're just trying to have a good time. You have to keep your guns cleaned and in good condition, which means buying gun oil and paying for repairs just for using the damn things. You gotta keep your horse fed, happy, and clean or you ain't going nowhere on it.

You have to watch what you eat to keep your BODY WEIGHT in check or you can kiss sprinting goodbye. You have to share your damned loot with the whole camp, loot that YOU worked your ass off to obtain, which includes medical supplies, food, and your OWN MONEY. I'm sorry I thought I was a western outlaw... I'm not SHARING my hard earned money with people I don't care about. It'd be one thing if I was actually rewarded for my efforts, but you don't get squat for helping your camp out.

I get that RDR2 was going for a realistic vibe of what it was like in the old west, but there is a very finding where too much realism begins to cost you fun and gameplay, and that is a line you should never have to cross.

And let's talk about difficulty for a sec. Why is it that no matter who I'm up against, they seem to.have some sort of Luke Cage super steel skin where my bullets don't do a damn thing, but I take one shot to the arm and I'm dead as a doornail. Not to mention, you lose all.your loot every time you die, with no chance to recover it. At least in Dark Souls they give you a chance to retrieve your souls after you die. No such luxury in RDR2.

While.i don't think overall RDR2 is an entirely bad game, and i can see how some people might have enjoyed it, this title did NOT deserve a Game of the Year award in my opinion. Not by a long shot.",technology
personalfinance,"I can refinance my Mortgage for 2.6125%, and get a CD at 3.50%, should I take equity out of my Mortgage and put it in the CD?","Hi Everyone,

Currently, I have a mortgage at 3.125% and can refinance it down to 2.6125% and take $40,000 out. (The house is worth $180,000 and I owe $110,000). I can get a 5 year CD at 3.50%. Here are my two options....

Option 1: I can not take out the $40,000 and my interest rate drops even further to 2.3125%.

Option 2: I can take out the $40,000 in equity and put it straight into a cd earning 3.50% for 5 years. There is no penalty to the principle for withdrawing the money...only a penalty on the interest.

I am leaning towards option 2, because it will raise my mortgage and force me to pay more each month (I can definitely afford the raise), and my CD will earn more money than I am paying in interest in the 5 years. 

After the 5 years on the CD is up, I would likely just lump sum pay off the mortgage, or do the same thing if rates are still nice.

personalfinance,Old Debt and Buying A House,"So me and my wife were close to closing on a house last year when the bank denied us at the last minute due to old debt she'd accrued years ago. The debt was old enough that it had already fallen off her credit report and was unknown to me, (occurred years before we met). We're currently renting her brother's house and were considering buying but the timeline has sped up as the brother now wants to move next spring. 

So basically she has est. 4000 in credit card debt and a car note that was originally around 7-8k but had apparently nearly doubled due to an ongoing interest rate? So my question is what can we do and who should we see about this? I've been told debt consolidation businesses are basically high interest scams. Should we talk to a lawyer, financial advisor, etc? If we were able to offer the company that owns the car debt the original balance in cash, what is the likelihood that they would waive the interest now that it's fallen off the credit report and they can no longer legally pursue it? I anticipate that we can save around 6-8k towards the total debt by the time her brother decides to sell. If we were able to pay off one debt and then reestablish payments towards another would we still be turned down for the home loan because of the age and delinquency of the debt?",finance

The bank does, however, offer a rate discount of .75% if the loan is 20K or more. One of the cars that I am looking at, I would probably be financing around 15-18k depending on how much I get from the insurance company. Now, my question is, would it be smart to take the 20k loan to get the lower rate and put the extra amount from the insurance either towards the loan, my students loans (which carry a higher interest rate), or throw it into my HYSA?

personalfinance,"No state income tax, so I should put into Roth?","I live in Washington and there's no state income tax. I currently make more than I anticipate withdrawing when I retire, so generally I should be putting into a traditional IRA. But I don't think I'll be living in Washington when I retire, so I should be putting money into a Roth IRA instead of Traditional right? If I contribute to Roth IRA right now, I'll be paying more in Federal taxes but none in State taxes. And then if I move to a state like California, I will have saved money going Roth instead of Traditional. If I have gone traditional, and retire in California, I would be paying a lower federal tax rate, but also an additional state tax which ultimately would be more.

If I change my mind and decided to stay in Washington, I essentially would have lost money.

MachineLearning,[Research] What happens when CNN devised for 224x224x3 images is trained on high resolution imagery ?,"I'm training a CNN on high resolution satellite imagery. Because of hardware constraints, I'm using `EfficientNetB0` (`EB0`) to predict classes from 800x800x3 tiles. This can be done thanks to the 2D `GlobalAveragePooling` layer at the end of the model which compresses the 25x25x1280 feature map (7x7x1280 when working with the original 224x224 images) into a 1D 1280 vector to be fed to dense layers and such. It works surprisingly well. Even more, I get better performance with `EB0` used on 800x800x3 tiles than with `EB5` applied on 456x456x3 tiles (the resolution for which they were designed).

personalfinance,Ally Online Savings vs Citi Accelerate Savings,"Just saw the interest rate of Ally's online savings is going down from 2.1% down to 1.9%. Still a good rate

I keep getting offers for Citi Accelerate savings accounts with 2.36% interest rate. Does anyone know if this is going to stay this way or potentially go down  given that the fed just lowered interest rates? After a quick comparison check with a compound interest calculator based on my current savings rate, it looks like the difference between the interest earned is about $225 over one year. Obviously more over a longer time.

Seems like it would be worth it to change over my account to the higher Citi savings account, but not if they're going to lower their rate soon as well. I see ""\*rates subject to change"" all over their literature.",finance
personalfinance,How can I get a loan for a vehicle with no cosigner. I work full time.,"I was wondering how I can go about getting a loan for a vehicle. Honestly ive heard it all about getting a car with cash and im ok with that. The problem is that I have nothing saved up currently. Although I just started working for the federal government. I make around 3k a month and can afford any type of payment. My pay is being delayed because I started working in the middle of a pay period. I have no co signer available but I need a car VERY urgently to start commuting to my new job location. I get paid semi monthly so I am still waiting for my first paycheck but even that paycheck will not be enough to buy any type of car reliable enough for my 1 hour commute. What can I do? Ive been approved for one loan out of the huge amount I applied for. Although they need a 2500 down payment which I cannot provide at this time. I was thinking I could get a loan for 2500 and pay the down payment and get accepted. Then pay the car payments and pay back the down payment within a few short months. Or get an outright car loan, which seems like that second option will not work. Feel free to ask for any more information.

personalfinance,"Blew my budget on family vacation/summer expenses on credit card, how to deal?","So I put nearly all my bills and purchases on my credit card and pay it off every month. I have a much bigger than usual bill this month and next month is also more than usual due to a family road trip vacation and other summer expenses. It didn't help that my partner didn't get paid for the week we were gone plus the July 4-5 holiday so we lost about $700-800 in income that would have helped cover the costs.

I ended up having to pull money out of savings to cover this month's bill and I did the calculation of our income and next month's credit card bill plus rent (assuming we don't spend much before the 11th, which is the last day of the billing cycle), and it will be very close. 
I don't want to have to pull $ out of savings again but I really don't want to carry a balance either (the interest rate is 20.24%).

personalfinance,"I have $19,500 to work with. What should I do?","Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. 28M. Not married, no kids. Live with my partner. Work and live in Chicago on a $85K salary. I recently came into $19,500 and am hoping to find out what to do with it.

I have zero credit card debt (I paid all that off awhile ago) but still have \~$33,064 in student loan debt with MyGreatLakes. I have various loans at various interest rates with them.

The loans are as follows:

$10,333 @ 6.50%

$6,250 @ 5.35%

$6,218 @ 4.25%

$10,263 @ 3.15%

TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT: \~$33,064

I‚Äôm hoping to eliminate my student loan debt ASAP. When I graduated in 2013 I had \~$64,000 in student loan debt and I‚Äôm very proud of the progress I‚Äôve made to pay down as much as I‚Äôve been able to.

If I throw all $19,500 to my student loans then I will be down to \~$13,564 ($3,301 @ 4.25% and $10,263 at 3.15%) and plan to have all of that paid off by July 2020. I currently pay a total $1,300 a month (I pay $976 extra on top of my minimum to keep good momentum. My minimum is $324.)

Is this the best way to utilize this money? I know a big piece of advice on here is to save an emergency fund but I feel like holding off on that. My job is stable, my partner makes 60k, and I'm in great health. I currently live paycheck to paycheck and give nearly all of my money to my student loans/living expenses, which is pretty okay with me. My student loans have always felt suffocating so I've always put all of my effort into eliminating those.

Something I've been thinking about recently is potentially opening a Roth IRA with some of these funds if they‚Äôre better suited to go in that direction versus to the 4.25% student loans. Perhaps I eliminate the 6.50% and 5.35% loans and then use the remaining money for a Roth IRA?

I currently have $23,241.46 in my 401K and $20,214.63 is vested. I will have 100% vesting in December 2020. I pay 6% of my salary and my company matches. I also have $1,086.32 in my HSA. My credit score is 812. No credit card debt.

My future goals include: a wedding in 2021 and to save for a nice downpayment to hopefully buy a condo here in Chicago sometime in 2023 or sooner.

personalfinance,Credit card vs private loan for a graduate class,"So Monday morning woke up to a bit of an issue. I‚Äôm currently 25y/o working full-time while also working on a masters degree part-time. I took two classes in the fall and was able to get my fafsa so foot the bill on my Fedloan. It was a rough first semester taking 2 classes with a full-time gig so I thought I‚Äôd scale back for the summer while still moving forward and take just one 4-unit class. 

All was going good until this week I got an email that a hold was placed on my classes for the fall. Reason being that since I dipped under 6-units, the cutoff for being considered part-time, my fafsa and fedloan wasn‚Äôt applied to the summer class and rather than get added into my student loans.

Bottom line, I‚Äôm stuck with a 4K bill for the class I gotta take care of by the end of the month if I want to finish my degree in the fall.

It sucks but not an insurmountable amount, I have a 750+ credit score and making 70k per year atm (about 4K/month after taxes) figure I could either load it on a credit card without maxing out and pay it down as fast as I can over the coming months while living frugally. Or I could get a third-party loan or private lender to cover the cost for just this one student class.

What would be the better option? Are there any reputable supplemental loan providers that I could get to foot the bill without a high interest? Or would it be smarter to put it on a credit card to tackle it at my own pace? 

Fucking grad school better be worth it.

personalfinance,Student loans or down payment on a house,"Monthly income as a full time RN, $3400. Can make up to almost $6,000 if I kill myself with 2 overtime shifts a week.

Just turned 26 working so i'm working on health insurance at the moment. Total student loan debt of **32,428.61**. Of which next to none of the principle has been paid off since I started repaying about halfway into 2018. **Eight** loans with interest rates ranging from 3.5 to 4.4.

CryptoCurrency,What happens when BTC block rewards are not enough?,"As the price of btc rises, typically so to does hash rate to protect the network and be awarded the newly minted¬†coins. But there seems to be a massive problem, as the newly minted bitcoin rate drops to eventually zero, what things will happen to maintain the healthy hash rate to protect the network while maintaining a usable fee rate?
Even just going by today's rate of 12.5 btc block reward and average of 3500 tx per block leaves the average tx cost at 40-45usd with the reward removed.

In the future, I imagine if btc was to ever reach the fabled $1Million per coin, this relative fee to protect against network attacks would likely need¬†to be far greater than $40 to pay for the needed hashrate.

Enter ""lightning network"", the thing that will solve bitcoins problems... but does it actually?
Lets say bitcoins 21 million coins have been mined and they are worth 1 million each, and the average cost to transact on the chain is in the hundreds. People will almost certainly end up needing to stay permanently in the LN in systems not to different to what we already have today with banks. This is the go to solution for maximalists¬†wanting to palm wave away the issues.
But if everyone is using the LN, who is paying to secure the main chain hashrate?
Do you really think there is going to be corporates ect paying insane fees to have the privilege to transact on the mainchain? The cost of power alone to protect a 1 million dollar bitcoin would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year (currently 3-4¬†billion annually at only 10~14k per coin).

If there's one things corporates love, its cutting costs. We are entering a new era of cryptocurrencies where some projects are questioning whether we even need miners at all!
So given projects without miners start to prove themselves, I don't see a realistic long term¬†outcome for coins that need expensive and dictative miner networks, aka ""middlemen"".

So what real steps have been discussed that solves these economic concerns¬†in the bitcoin network?
I bring this up as I am worried that once/if bitcoin becomes this global reserve and countries put their economic weight into btc mining they will have the majority rule on the hashrate and start enforcing things that go against what bitcoin is supposed to be.

With no one willing to pay the hash rate costs, my main fear is that a couple decades down the road it might¬†suddenly start sounding like a ""good idea"" to uncap the bitcoin supply and let the block rewards flow into the pockets of these massive mining farms. At that point we might as well start calling them the fed.
Before you start hand waving this off as ""never gunna happen"", consider the¬†fact that this already has¬†happened before with gold.¬†¬†People in general are lazy and don't seem to have enough time outside of keeping up with the kardashians to be concerned with peering¬†behind¬†the wizards curtain to see what is really going on. %99 of people have no idea how the money system today works, that same %99 of people will likely never know how btc works either.¬†

personalfinance,Should I refinance a 15 year loan to 30 to lower payments?,"Long story short is that currently, and for the past two years, money has been so tight and we've depleted a lot of our savings. We do expect things to turn around in a year or two but at the same time, we keep getting hit with medical issues and other unforeseen expenses that is prohibiting us from saving. If we refinance our mortgage, our monthly payments would be cut in half allowing us to save and take some stress off us. I feel like most people would advise against this (thinking about Dave Ramsey which I followed for a while and was able to get out of debt using his methods at the time) but I read some interesting pros for 30 year loans that it is making me rethink our current situation.

My husband has been against this idea because we have a great interest rate (3%) and we only have 8 years left on the loan. He looks at the long term cost of the loan and has trouble thinking of paying more for the loan. But, we didn't buy our house thinking it would be our last. He wanted to sell a few years ago but I wasn't ready but am now. We do have about $10k to put into our house though before it's ready to sell and we don't have any extra to save to put towards that. We did take a heloc thinking we could use it to finish it up (long story but we started a renovation that we couldn't finish when our income was unexpectedly reduced, thankfully it didn't put us in debt but we haven't had extra money to finish it and can't sell our house until it's done) but we haven't taken any money out yet because I'm hesitant to add another expense. 

My thought is that since we're planning on selling eventually, we can refinance now, get a 30 year loan, take our extra money to save/invest and can finish our renovation so we can sell or rent our house (long term we'd like to have a few rental houses). And when our income increases we can put extra money toward mortgage after savings. I know that the long term cost of the loan is higher but again, I read some interesting pros on 30 year loans that didn't seem relevant to us when we bought our house (at that time, we were dinks and 15 year mortgage was same as our rent; now we're single income with a couple of kids with big expenses and it feels risky to me to have our money tied up in our house and not have extra cushion monthly; whereas it feels risky to my husband to let go of the 3% interest rate and paying more long term for the loan.

investing,How does one justify following a standard 60/40 portfolio and holding 40% bonds with yields where they are?,"I understand in the past how if rates were 5% and your bonds yielded 8% that if there was a recession and the fed drops rates to 0 that now you have incurred a massive capital gain on your bonds. Your stocks may have declined in a recession your bonds went way up in value, this reduces volatility and has other benefits.

 Now with rates as low as they are I find it come up with a reason to hold bonds. Are people hoping that during the next recession that the fed restarts QE and takes rates back to zero or even lower. Still the capital gains incurred from 2.5% to 0% won't be that substantial. 

Also the real yield on the US 10 year is .2%. I mean why can't I just keep money in a savings account and earn 2% or even better then what a bond, 10 yr yield, would pay me and I have no risk of capital loss. I'm just struggling with this and it seems the majority of people are just going on buying bonds as if we were in the same position as any other time in the last 50 years. 

Basically convince me that the potential for capital gains on bonds is greater than the chance of capital loss when I can get the same rate risk free in a savings account.",finance

solar,"PSA: If you want solar installed this year, get moving on it now.","I'm in residential sales (USA), and every year we have people coming to us at the very end of the year expecting that we can install their PV system immediately.  Please don't be that person.  

Yes, there are still almost five months left this year, and yes, most installations are completed in one or two days.  However, there are a lot of factors that can delay an installation, and the sooner you start the process, the less stressed you (and your installer) will be.

The end of the year is always busy because people generally want the shortest period of time between when they pay for their system and when they get their tax credits.  

The end of 2019 is going to be especially busy because people are worried about losing out on the federal tax credit.  (I know, it's only dropping from 30-26%, it might be extended, and I'll leave it to licensed tax professionals to debate things like safe harboring or what qualifies as complete for tax purposes).  

Here is a list of issues that can delay your installation.  Many of these won‚Äôt apply to all installations, and feel free to add more in the comments.

Financing:  If you are getting a loan for solar, it might take you time to get credit approved, track down your income documents, or get an appraisal for a home equity line of credit.

Electrical complications:  You might need to upgrade your electrical service in order to add PV panels.  This may involve extra permits, approvals, trenching, or tearing up concrete.

Utility applications:  If you are hooking up a PV system to the local grid, you're probably going to need to notify or obtain approval from the local utility.  This process can take some time.

Permits:  If you've never done any major projects on your property, you probably won't know if your permits require special approval (flood zone, historic designations, etc).  In my area, if you are in a condo/townhouse, the permitting can take several months.

Roof issues:  Your installer may get up there and find that the roof need repairs or a full re-roof.  You definitely don't want to pay to remove your panels in the next few years for roofing.

Neighborhood associations.  If you don't have one, great!  If you do, there's probably some level of approval needed, and often some pushback from the board.  Often, they will only review applications once a month.

Shipping delays:  Self explanatory

Weather:  It's not safe to work on steep wet roof, and fall/winter can mean a lot of rain or even snow.  

Property access/your schedule:  If you've got a gate, dogs, or the installer needs to get into the attic, they will probably need someone home during the installation.  Keep that in mind if you've got vacations scheduled.

Again, not all of these factors will apply to all installations, and I'm not saying you should sign with the first sales rep to give you a quote.  Do your research, get at a least a couple bids, and don't be afraid to say ""No"" to the high pressure approach.  

Just do it now, not three months from now.  You'll be happier you did, and you'll get much more flexibility and better customer service from your installer.",energy
personalfinance,Suggestions for dealing with 95k in Parent Plus loans,"Hey everyone, so I am having issues with how to best tackle some student loan debt. Specifically, student debt that my mother took out (which I agreed to pay for). When I graduated in December of 2017, I immediately found a job and began to build an emergency fund, most of which disappeared due to medical bills in 2018. As most of you know, about 6 months after graduation, these loan institutions start to demand their money. I began paying the few personal student loans which were legally mine to pay and totally forgot the parent loan altogether (mostly because I had a medical crisis). Apparently, so did my mother who did not remind me to begin paying that off... for 6 whole months. I was never given any login info to the loan servicer and had to dig through the mail just to find that stuff out. I log into XYZ loan servicer to find out the loan is $6300 past due. Since then, we had to put the loan in forbearance. My original plan was to make minimum payments on this loan until I paid off some personal student loans that have much higher interest rates but are lower in principle amount.

I understand that this type of loan can probably be consolidated and be eligible for ICR. Is that a good route to go? Will the 6300 dollars that are past due need to be paid before they will let her consolidate? I just need some breathing room with this situation.",finance

They were friendly and it definitely helped that my family is already planning on going to the same place and salesman in the spring to get my my mom a new vehicle also. 



So, this happened today. I (31 f) was preapproved by my lender and found a car at a dealership. Got all the info and called to confirm the car would be approved for the loan and in the budget. It is through a bank the dealership works with and gave them the information. They said they would send them the contract and went to sign everything and get the car tonight. The finance agent at the dealership played dumb about my pre approval despite having all the info (it was in the folder he had on his desk and I pointed it out to him). He said I had to have a newer car, higher rate and a higher credit score than what the bank had that I used. He also ran my credit without my consent. 

I stopped him when he tried pitching a different bank and higher rates and denied knowing how to contact the loan officer. When I pointed to the info on his desk he then said that he could only send it through the portal they use (he didn‚Äôt do that either). I was with my dad and we walked out. 

I‚Äôm calling my loan officer in the am and the salesman is going to his manager to send the contract to her anyway. The auto is a good deal and I want it but I am furious with how he acted like I didn‚Äôt give him all of the information. Is this normal? It‚Äôs my first time buying without a co-signer. 

Tl;dr I went in prepared and the financing agent acted like he had no idea I was pre-approved and all set. Ran my credit again, lied multiple times and we left without the car.

I bought a house a little over 1 year ago. My original loan was $382.5k at 4.5%. My current principal is $374k. My house is worth $480-535k. 

I decided to look into refinancing since interest rates are low. I plan on keeping this house for at least 3 more years AND ideally my plan is to not sell at all and rent it out enough to cover the mortgage (which in my market is doable). It is a nice 2 bed/1.5 bath house in a great location.  I grew up in the Bay Area and property has gone up so much in my lifetime. I am now in SEATTLE where things are growing like crazy- ideally I would not sell this place at any point, rent it out, and keep it indefinitely. 

I got quotes from 2 different companies, I have included all of the details on each quote below. 

My questions are: 
1. Should I refinance at all?
2. Which option is better? 

My thoughts are - yes refinance and Option B is better, but I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not making a stupid decision.

Also FWIW - I can very easily afford my mortgage at my current monthly payment and still save a significant amount of money. (Very lucky in my career/company... I try not to take it for granted!!!!). I also will have maxed out my 401k and ROTH IRA by the end of the year and have $27k in savings right now (Which I grew from $5k this time last year AND paid off a $72k loan in the last 1 year) ((again- SO LUCKY, I know I am extremely fortunate)).

personalfinance,"Old defaulted student loan, lump settlement, and credit cards","So.... a while back I defaulted on my federal student loan. I was irresponsible. Later, I worked with an agency that operates my loan and started a payment plan. At one point the feds kicked them out of the program and they are no longer allowed to service defaulted loans. They seem to no longer be around. 

Because of what I consider the incompetence of the feds, this makes my loan appear as if *I* stopped payment on it. A new agency has filed a request to garnish up to 15% of my wages.

I called them (kind of hard to get ahold of) and I finally capitulated to requesting a settlement with the DoE. Unfortunately, this means I have 90 days to pay the whole thing. I do not have this money. My credit is good after working on it for the last few years and I have a good paying job. I finally got a new credit card recently, which has a limit over the amount I would owe on this settlement.

Would it be advisable to pay all of this with my credit card? I realize this would then put me into some serious debt and reverse a lot of the work I've done to improve my credit. I feel like I could tighten my (and my family's) belt to get this paid down relatively quickly now, though. It would impact my lifestyle and what I've been trying to build up in savings and investments but that's not the end of the world.

Another option would be finding another loan but I'm unsure of whether or not I could even get one for the purpose of paying off this settlement.

What would be the risks or pitfalls in the above plans, besides what I've already stated? Is this even possible?",finance

Bitcoin,What happens when BTC block rewards are not enough? (crosspost from r/cryptocurrency),"Here is the post.

&gt; As the price of btc rises, typically so to does hash rate to protect the network and be awarded the newly minted¬†coins. But there seems to be a massive problem, as the newly minted bitcoin rate drops to eventually zero, what things will happen to maintain the healthy hash rate to protect the network while maintaining a usable fee rate? Even just going by today's rate of 12.5 btc block reward and average of 3500 tx per block leaves the average tx cost at 40-45usd with the reward removed.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the future, I imagine if btc was to ever reach the fabled $1Million per coin, this relative fee to protect against network attacks would likely need¬†to be far greater than $40 to pay for the needed hashrate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enter ""lightning network"", the thing that will solve bitcoins problems... but does it actually? Lets say bitcoins 21 million coins have been mined and they are worth 1 million each, and the average cost to transact on the chain is in the hundreds. People will almost certainly end up needing to stay permanently in the LN in systems not to different to what we already have today with banks. This is the go to solution for maximalists¬†wanting to palm wave away the issues. But if everyone is using the LN, who is paying to secure the main chain hashrate? Do you really think there is going to be corporates ect paying insane fees to have the privilege to transact on the mainchain? The cost of power alone to protect a 1 million dollar bitcoin would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year (currently 3-4¬†billion annually at only 10\~14k per coin).  
&gt;  
&gt;If there's one things corporates love, its cutting costs. We are entering a new era of cryptocurrencies where some projects are questioning whether we even need miners at all! So given projects without miners start to prove themselves, I don't see a realistic long term¬†outcome for coins that need expensive and dictative miner networks, aka ""middlemen"".  
&gt;  
&gt;So what real steps have been discussed that solves these economic concerns¬†in the bitcoin network? I bring this up as I am worried that once/if bitcoin becomes this global reserve and countries put their economic weight into btc mining they will have the majority rule on the hashrate and start enforcing things that go against what bitcoin is supposed to be.  
&gt;  
&gt;With no one willing to pay the hash rate costs, my main fear is that a couple decades down the road it might¬†suddenly start sounding like a ""good idea"" to uncap the bitcoin supply and let the block rewards flow into the pockets of these massive mining farms. At that point we might as well start calling them the fed. Before you start hand waving this off as ""never gunna happen"", consider the¬†fact that this already has¬†happened before with gold.¬†¬†People in general are lazy and don't seem to have enough time outside of keeping up with the kardashians to be concerned with peering¬†behind¬†the wizards curtain to see what is really going on. %99 of people have no idea how the money system today works, that same %99 of people will likely never know how btc works either.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Before you start going all tribal on me for questioning the larger logistics of how bitcoin is supposed to work long term. Please consider this discussion for the betterment of humanity than the betterment of what ever your favorite bags are.

investing,Economist article about how shrinkflation and non-financial employment perks impact inflation and wage growth calculations,"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/08/06/how-shrinkflation-is-playing-havoc-with-economists-models

&gt; TWO YEARS ago British chocoholics felt the pinch from the decision to leave the European Union. As sterling tumbled, global firms selling to the British market faced the same production costs as before, but got less money for each sweet sold. Rather than raise the price per chocolate, some chose to shrink the chocolate per price. The famous peaks on a bar of Toblerone grew conspicuously less numerous (though Mondelez, the bar‚Äôs maker, said Brexit was not the cause). Other products suffered the same ‚Äúshrinkflation‚Äù: toilet rolls and toothpaste tubes became smaller. The threat of Brexit made the phenomenon more visible, but it is surprisingly common. Statisticians and policymakers need to take note.

&gt; A forthcoming paper by Diego Aparicio and Roberto Rigobon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology helps make the point. Firms that sell thousands of different items do not offer them at thousands of different prices, but rather slot them into a dozen or two price points. Visit the website for H&amp;M, a fashion retailer, and you will find a staggering array of items for ¬£9.99: hats, scarves, jewellery, belts, bags, herringbone braces, satin neckties, patterned shirts for dogs and much more. Another vast collection of items cost ¬£6.99, and another, ¬£12.99. When sellers change an item‚Äôs price, they tend not to nudge it a little, but rather to re-slot it into one of the pre-existing price categories. The authors dub this phenomenon ‚Äúquantum pricing‚Äù (quantum mechanics grew from the observation that the properties of subatomic particles do not vary along a continuum, but rather fall into discrete states).

&gt; Just as surprising as the quantum way in which prices adjust is how rarely they move at all. Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon suggest, seem to design products to fit their preferred price points. **Given a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms often redesign a product to fit the price rather than tweak the price. They may make a production process less labour-intensive‚Äîor shave a bit off a chocolate bar.**

&gt; Central banks are starting to see the consequences. Inflation does not respond to economic conditions as much as it used to. (To take one example, deflation during the Great Recession was surprisingly mild and short-lived, and after nearly three years of unemployment below 5%, American inflation still trundles along below the Federal Reserve‚Äôs target rate of 2%.) **In its recently published annual report the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central banks, mused that quantum pricing and related phenomena help account for such trends.**

&gt; But firms‚Äô aversion to increasing prices may be as much a consequence of limp inflation as a contributor to it. When the price of everything rises a lot year after year, as in the 1970s and 1980s, firms can easily adjust the real, inflation-adjusted cost of their wares without putting off shoppers. A 5.5% jump in the cost of a pint after years of 5% increases does not send beer drinkers searching for other pubs in the way that a 0.5% hike after years of no change might. Thus falling inflation can make prices ‚Äústickier‚Äù. To compensate, firms instead find other ways to impose costs on buyers‚Äîsuch as making products smaller or lower-quality.

&gt; Labour markets are affected, too. Wages are notoriously sticky, especially downwards. In a world of low inflation, the ability to trim pay by raising wages less than inflation is lost to firms, with serious macroeconomic consequences. Economists blame sticky wages for causing unemployment during recessions. Facing reduced demand, firms that cannot cut pay to maintain margins while slashing prices instead reduce output‚Äîand sack workers.

&gt; But nimble firms have other options: the employment version of shaving a bit of chocolate from the bar. Some cut costs by boosting output per worker, often by driving workers harder. Tellingly, growth in output per worker now tends to fall in booms and rise during busts, precisely the opposite of the pattern 40 years ago, when inflation was high. Firms can respond to market pressures by reducing the benefits available to workers; Asda, a supermarket, recently announced plans to slash British workers‚Äô holiday allowances. Or they can offer workers more tortuous schedules. Research published in 2017 suggests that being able to vary workers‚Äô hours from week to week is worth at least 20% of their wages. On the flipside, during good times firms often opt to reward workers with office perks and one-off bonuses, rather than pay rises that cannot easily be clawed back during downturns.

&gt; If it happens on a sufficiently large scale, the practice of tweaking quality in lieu of price could play havoc with essential economic data. Statistical agencies do their best to account for changing product quality, but if adjustments are unexpectedly common or subtle then muted inflation figures could easily be concealing a more turbulent economic picture. Central banks watching for big swings in inflation or wage growth as a sign of trouble could be reacting to figures that bear far less relation to business conditions than they used to.

&gt; What‚Äôs more, the substitution of quality for price as firms‚Äô main way of responding to changing market conditions weakens the case for keeping inflation low and stable. Inflation makes relative prices less informative, economists reckon, making it harder to decide what to buy and how to spend. Rather than clarity, low inflation has brought a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars and lost holidays. 

TL;DR: How does one measure inflation when a jar of peanut butter decreases in size from 10oz to 8z, or when the ice cream has more ""substitute"" ingredients that were cheaper than using milk/cream/sugar?

1) Can they tell the difference? 

2) Is it really necessary to do the 'permanent' lift on the freeze?

I assume there are no issues with doing the full/permanent lift then refreezing afterward.

personalfinance,Avalanche Method Clarification,"Hey all, I'm working off 30k of student loans and the standard payment plan has all my excess going to principal with the highest interest RATE as opposed to the highest interest in terms of monthly interest accrued. They claim this is done because it cost less over time. 

But.. if I even remotely understand this correctly, I should be working down the principle on the loan with the highest accrued interest, not interest rate, as these are two separate loans in my case. 

[Here is the breakdown of my loans](https://imgur.com/a/TqRItwr)
The standard repayment plan has all excess going to Loan Token 226 with 6.55% interest, but would the avalanche method logic indicate all excess should be going to Loan Token 229, as even though it only has 4.41% interest, the large principle is generating the highest monthly accrued interest cost of all the loans?

In my head it makes sense, especially because my loan repayments are set so all accrued interest is paid off first, then the remaining of my payment goes to principal. Hence my goal should be, the implication of the avalanche method is that the loan with the highest accrued interest should be paid off first as opposed to the loan with the highest interest rate in multiple loan situations such as mine, correct?",finance

stocks,"The Wednesday Morning Watchlist: Ed-Tech Spec in Focus (INST, GAXY, BOXL)","Today‚Äôs piece takes a look at three of the most interesting names set to thrive in the ed-tech market space, all with strong revenue growth, millions in sales, and strong positioning to compete for dominance in the growing $27B interactive display market.

**Instructure Inc (NYSE:INST)** bills itself as a company that provides applications for learning, assessment, and performance management through a software-as-a-service business model worldwide.¬†

It develops Canvas, a learning management platform for K-12 and higher education; and Bridge, an employee development and engagement platform.¬†

The company‚Äôs applications enhance academic and corporate learning by providing a system of engagement for teachers and learners, enabling frequent and open interactions, a streamlined workflow, and the creation and sharing of content with anytime, anywhere access to information. Its platform also provides data analytics that enable real-time reaction to information and benchmarking in order to personalize curricula and goal setting; and enhance the efficacy of the learning, assessment, and performance management processes. The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The company‚Äôs latest earnings showed a positive long-term trend toward sustainable financial results. Shares of the stock are testing their 200-day SMA right now, potentially offering an interesting opportunity to new money looking for exposure in the space.

**Galaxy Next Generation Inc. (OTC:GAXY)** is a provider of interactive learning technology solutions that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment.¬†

Galaxy‚Äôs products include Galaxy‚Äôs own private-label interactive touch screen panel as well as numerous other national and international branded peripheral and communication devices. Galaxy‚Äôs distribution channel consists of 22+ resellers across the U.S. who primarily sell the Company‚Äôs products within the commercial and educational market.¬†

Galaxy does not control where resellers focus their resell efforts, although generally, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products ‚Äì comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy‚Äôs sales.

The company boasts a strong team, including its COO, who spent the majority of her young career at Mimio/Boxlight (NASDAQ:BOXL), a leader in the ed-tech and interactive display market. She performed many jobs at Mimio including, sales, federal programs director, and regional management.

The biggest recent news for the stock comes in the form of its announcement that, as a result of its recent participation as an exhibitor at GAMEIS, in Savannah, GA, it has signed AIOS Group LLC as a value-add reseller.

According to the release, AIOS Group LLC, of Canton GA, has already successfully onboarded and is now active as a Galaxy reseller. Gary LeCroy, Galaxys Chief Executive Officer, commented, ‚ÄúWe continue to expand our presence, especially in the K-12 classroom. Our new products were well received at GAMEIS and its always great to achieve immediate success from a tradeshow or conference by signing a new reseller. We look forward to having AIOS Group represent our products and expand our market share.‚Äù

With a tiny float of just 10.4 million shares, GAXY is always primed for big upside potential simply due to a scarcity function in the open market. That feature was on full display six weeks ago when the stock rallied over 75% in three days in a powerful squeeze. Technically, we believe the current pattern supports the potential for a similar move if the stars line up right. And right now, that recipe could be in place.

The stock is also testing key trend line support right now at a higher level than it tested in June and earlier this year, resulting in a nice upward trend going through a pullback. The MACD indicator is flashing a green light as the pullback ripens, so it might be just the time to give this stock a fresh look.

personalfinance,Should we sell our cars?,"I recently started listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast, and it made me reconsider how I approach our debt.

Our household basic takehome pay is 5k/month. I work 40hrs/week and my wife is a stay at home mom who works about 4-6 hours a week coaching figure skating. On top of this I have a side gig where I'm on track to gross an additional 30k this calendar year, up from 20k last year (I'd say 80% is profit after tax and overhead)

We live in a high cost of living area and currently our monthly obligations are around 3500, which includes car loans, student loan, mortgage, insurance, and utilities. On top of that we have 2500 budgeted for gas, groceries,  maintenance, health/personal care etc. 

We have a goal to knock out the 20k of student loans by the end of the year, and we have savings plus a few side jobs wrapping up before then to hopefully be able to do that. 

So the question is regarding the cars. My goal is to keep our monthly expenses under the 5k takehome pay, and use the supplementary income for future goals. I think the biggest drain in our budget is our car loans. We have 2 loans, one for 20k and one for 27k. 20k car is 2016 Jetta worth 16-20k in Vancouver. The other is the family car, a 2018 Passat worth about the same. Both of us do quite a bit of seperate driving, so one vehicle isn't an option. 

The loan payment for the Jetta is 410/mo + 250/mo insurance. Passat is 340/mo +230/mo insurance. Interest rates are 0% and 0.49% with 4 and 6 years remaining respectively. So it's not the interest that is the issue, it is the high payments. 

My options as I see them:
A) sell cars and be about 7-15k upside down + 8k for new cars, so replacing 47k debt with 23k.
B) grind through the next year and pay off as much debt as possible. If I keep up my side gig progression, I'd be on track to make up to 40k supplementary income which would nearly knock it out. But that is assuming we live under budget of 5k/mo so all that income can go to debt payments, which is a real stretch.

MachineLearning,[D] DeepMind Takes on Billion-Dollar Debt and Loses $572 Million,"DeepMind, the artificial-intelligence company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., saw its revenue almost double last year, but gains were dwarfed by losses that increased to hundreds of millions of dollars.

The London-based company also has more than a billion dollars of debt due for repayment this year, according to full-year accounts for the year ended Dec. 31 posted to U.K. business registry Companies House.

Losses for 2018 widened to 470.2 million pounds ($572 million) from 302.2 million pounds in 2017. Revenue rose to 102.8 million pounds, up from 54.4 million pounds. Staff costs also nearly doubled against the year-ago period to 398 million pounds in 2018.

A debt of 1.04 billion pounds due this year includes an 883 million-pound loan from its owner. DeepMind had written assurances it would be financially supported for at least another year.

‚ÄúOur DeepMind for Google team continues to make great strides bringing our expertise and knowledge to real-world challenges at Google scale, nearly doubling revenue in the past year,‚Äù a spokeswoman for the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe will continue to invest in fundamental research and our world-class, interdisciplinary team, and look forward to the breakthroughs that lie ahead.‚Äù

Alphabet Inc. bought DeepMind for 400 million pounds in 2014. The next year, the company began working on health-care research, eventually creating an entire division dedicated to the area.

The company works with the U.K. National Health Service hospitals, researching algorithms that can diagnose eye diseases and spot head and neck cancers from medical imagery, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on an algorithm that can predict which patients are at risk of sudden deterioration from acute kidney injury and other conditions.

I‚Äôm about three weeks away from moving in with my grandfather and leaving the only job I‚Äôve ever had. My mental health (depression/bipolar) is the main reason for this -a recent break up of my live-in partner, accumulation of debt, disconnection from caring about anything- but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt excuse the situation. 

I am roughly $23k in credit card debt. A combination of senseless partying - clubs, alcohol, drugs, travel expenses, concerts, clothes and furniture. I am past due on half of these cards, or more. In order to cope with the situation I stopped making payments and ignored all the calls and voicemails. I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôm in collections with several of the cards. (I am aware of how foolish this strategy is, trust me it keeps me up at night) 

I also have about $45k in student loans from three different sources- Private, Federal and from my university. 


 I‚Äôve consulted a bankruptcy attorney and my parents think that‚Äôs the best choice, I‚Äôve also spoken with a credit consolidation company. Neither decision is speaking out to me. I‚Äôve saved some money by not paying my bills (I see the irony). My credit has gone from ~700 to about 500 and is steadily falling. I also have some stock money from my company ~5k so I figure I could use that as a parachute as well. 


I‚Äôm about to move in with my grandfather. I don‚Äôt know for how long.

3. $1800 payment plus taxes and insurance which is $875 for me, $2675 in total out of pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

The Entertainment Software Association has said that Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft are working on new policies to require loot box odds disclosure on their systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Entertainment Software Association chief counsel of tech policy Michael Warnecke announced the news this morning at the Federal Trade Commission's Inside the Game workshop on the loot box issue. The comments came after Warnecke recapped the industry's previous attempts to address loot box concerns: an in-game purchases label on retail titles and platform-level spending controls on consoles and the EA Origin PC storefront.

&amp;#x200B;

""That said, we are doing more,"" Warnecke said. ""I'm pleased to announce this morning that Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony have indicated to ESA a commitment to new platform policies with respect to the use of paid loot boxes in games that are developed for their platform. Specifically, this would apply to new games and game updates that add loot box features. And it would require the disclosure of the relative rarity or probabilities of obtaining randomized virtual items in games that are available on their platforms.

""As well, many of the leading video game publishers of the Entertainment Software Association have decided that they are going to implement a similar approach at the publisher level to provide consumers this information and give them enhanced information to make purchase decisions.""

Okay, so I am dealing with the larger situation now (he was in charge of finances, now I am).  I am a public school teacher with a pension.  I could take out a pension loan for at least half of the debt ($10,000).    Here is the applicable information about pension loans:

""Interest is charged on a loan at a commercially reasonable rate set annually by the New Jersey State Treasurer.

* For eligible borrowers, the interest rate for loan applications received in **2019** is **7.75%** per annum on the declining balance of the loan.

An administrative processing fee also applies to all pension loans.

* The administrative processing fee is **$15.00** per loan.

The interest rate for **2019** is determined using the Prime Rate (5.25%) **plus** 2.5%. The administrative processing fee is set annually and is based on the actual costs associated with administering the pension loan program.

The loan interest rate is fixed annually, so if you borrow in 2019 you will have the same interest rate for the life of your loan unless you borrow again after the 2019 calendar year has ended.""

All pension loans must be paid back within 5 years (though I would want a shorter window)

I am looking for advice on what to do about paying off one debt before adding a new debt. My husband is going to need a new car in the next one to two years (over 160,000 miles on his 2009 Toyota Corolla). We know we want to buy a used car for about $15K, at the most. 

My question now comes to my other debt: my student loans. I have $6K left in student loans with an interest rate of 3.4%. My required monthly payment is $101, but I pay $250 per month. We have over $70K in savings, so we could easily pay off my student loans; however, we are also trying to save for a house. 

Would it be wise to pay off my student loans before we purchase a new (technically used) car? I kind of think it would be smart to pay off my student loans and basically replace that monthly payment with a car payment, but my student loan interest rate may be smaller than the car loan rate we would get (aren't car interest rates usually around 4%?). Would it be smarter to keep that $6K in our bank as a down payment on the car and then just have two payments at the same time (student loans + car payment)?

In the past couple of years I haven't been as financially responsible as I would like to be or as I had been in the past. I've accrued around $6,000 in credit card debt. On top of that I have roughly $40,000 in two separate student loans (one interest rate is a variable 3.9%, and the other I believe is a fixed 6% or so).

So, not great.¬†


I have two questions.¬†


First, would it be in my best interest to consolidate my two student loans? I realize that I would be paying on it/them for longer, but I'm assuming that it would free up some very much needed month-to-month capital and possibly give me an overall lower fixed interest rate. 


Second, I've been hearing a lot about these low interest loans and things like ""Best Egg"" and ""Lending Club"" and the like. Would it be a good idea to use one of these to pay off all of my credit debt now? I would guess that it would be a lower interest rate than a credit card (though again I realize that I would be paying for longer with this as well).¬†I've also heard that it can temporarily lower your credit score, but I'm not sure on that. 


My biggest concern is having more available money now, and being able to save more month to month.

I am currently in the process of consolidating my federal loans through MOHELA, but unfortunately having only ""foreign"" income has made it really hard for me to find a way to refinance my private loans for some reason. Does anyone have any advice on how I might go about doing this, or which lenders I would be able to use?

personalfinance,Options for Eliminating Large Debt (~155k),"I really need help.

I'm currently in massive debt after lying about my finances and living outside my means over the past few years. I revealed this to my wife last night and she (very very thankfully) hasn't left but I need to get a handle on all of this or else I really fear she might.

Basically I can barely afford to pay all of my monthly bills at the moment and will now have to depend on my wife to cover some of our living expenses so that I can actually start eliminating the debt. I have both student loan debt and debt from CC/Personal Loans that are both hitting me hard.

&amp;#x200B;

CC1: \~$11.7k @ 30.74%

CC:2 \~$12k @ 19.24%

Car: \~$1.8k @ 3.34%

Loan1: \~$7k @ 10.99%

Loan2: \~$17k @ 13.12%

&amp;#x200B;

I need to very immediately take care of CC1 and then CC2, the rate is fixed on both personal loans so once I'm able to pay more on them I will but I do not believe the minimum is hurting me more here like it is with the CCs. What I wonder about is paying off my car immediately if I am somehow able to as this will free up a lot of cash monthly to go elsewhere but I only have about 3k in savings right now. I've made mistakes in the past with taking personal loans but I really wonder if one would help here (If I could qualify for one, would probably need wife to co-sign because my cred is so-so hers is through the roof), but I was also lying about my finances with my SO (a whole other story, am piece of shit confirmed) so I continued making poor decisions here with the loans and finances, but now that she knows if I have an actual plan I can actually stick to something. Would it be worth consolidating some/all of this if I/we can with a fixed rate personal loan. Don't really know how this works and I can update with more specific (or generic) monthly payment info.

Then I have Student Loans... On the Federal Side I have \~75k in Income Based Repayment atm, this is spread across 20 different subsidized and un-subsidized loans with rates ranging from 3.4%-6.8%. Then there are four personal student loans across three lenders like:

&amp;#x200B;

Lender 1-1: \~$13k @ 5%

Lender 1-2: \~$12k @9.25%

Lender 2: \~$3k @ 6.75%

Lender 3: \~$6k @ 6.5%

&amp;#x200B;

I believe there is the ability to request a forbearance or reduced payment from the private lenders, but that interest also accrues during this time and it can only be requested for a year. After that the monthly payment will be higher but I'm having a really hard time determining if/when I should do this so that I can focus on loans on the other side. For the federal loans I'm pretty sure I need to hope that they are actually forgiven after 25 years on IBR and not missing a payment, hopefully that is actually a thing also.

Also regarding the student loans, I don't think it would ever be worth it to consolidate the federal loans  but what about the private loans? What about consolidating the private student loans with the CC or loans above?

Any assistance or guidance that can be provided would be amazing. I've never been good with finances and looking at all my loan stuff gives me the worst anxiety and depression that I shut it out for so long pretending the problem would go away. I have an amazing wife and I'm a complete piece of shit for doing this, but I'm hopeful that with an actual plan that won't happen.",finance

Should I eliminate the 6.50% and 5.35% loans and then use the remaining money for a Roth IRA? What is the smartest way for me to utilize this $19,500? I know a big piece of advice on here is to save an emergency fund but I will be holding off on that. My job is stable, my partner makes 60k, and I'm in great health. I currently live paycheck to paycheck and give nearly all of my money to my student loans/living expenses, which is pretty okay with me.

personalfinance,"Help with understanding kiddie tax, FAFSA, and overall tax situation","Hello, I have some questions about my taxes which unfortunately I could not find any answers to browsing forums or reading IRS documentation. I have already read through the IRS publication 970 covering tax provisions for students paying for their education, but I still feel really ignorant on the whole thing.

I'm currently a 20 year old student entering into his third year of undergrad, parents divorced in 2015 so my FAFSA application reflects only my mother's information. For the 2019-20 FAFSA, we are required to use tax information from 2017 which is actually the first year I filed a tax return because I was working a lot. Since starting college, I have been receiving a refund from the excess scholarship/grant awards because I commute to a relatively cheap state school and FAFSA/TAP (I am in NY) covers the rest of my costs after my academic scholarship. So here's where it gets a bit tricky, and all this I found out just now due to my own digging:

In 2017, I received a 1098-T form detailing the amount I was charged for tuition and fees and the amount of awards I got. When I was filing my tax return for that year, I must have used the actual refund amount I got rather than the difference on the 1098-T when I was determining my total income. The amount I put down was $1423, which is what got directly refunded to me by the school, but I realize now that it probably should've been $2563, which was the difference. Unfortunately I wish I knew how my school determined its tuition+fees cost because it doesn't reflect my actual bill, even after taking off meal plan or books. I had a net return of $314 after federal and state.

In 2018, I filled out another tax return but this time I used the 1098-T for my income. My school refund ($2164) was again less than the difference on the 1098-T ($3582). I'm not actually sure why I used my 1098-T this time around, I think at the time I thought I did the same thing for the prior year but I realize now I did not. Either way, I think this excess grant money passed a threshold for unearned income tax of some sort, and I got hit with the kiddie tax which was quite a large percentage I remember. In the end, I got a federal tax refund and I owed the state taxes, presumably because of the kiddie tax, so I got a net return of $11.

Question time:

1.) For the 2019-20 FAFSA, I used my 2017 IRS information and there is a line asking for what amount of the AGI is excess scholarship/grant money, so I put down 1423 to be consistent with that year's tax information. I'm a bit worried about this biting me later on though, I definitely don't want to misrepresent my taxes or financial aid needs, but at the same time I don't see what impact this will have on EFC calculations.

2.) What is the kiddie tax, why is it so high, and how come people say excess scholarship money is EARNED income for tax purposes yet I was hit with an unearned income tax?

3.) How do I minimize my taxes? It seems that the 1098-T difference is always larger than my actual refund. I understand that taxable grant money includes anything not used for paying tuition+fees, but taking out my books, meal plan, and lab course fees there's still a discrepancy in the amounts.

4.) What is this American opportunity tax credit I hear so often about? My mom is foreign and just pays someone to do her taxes so when I asked her about this I don't think she knows whether or not she's using it. From what I read, I can't claim it unless I was not claimed as a dependent by someone else, which I am, yet I also read on forums that people use it to reduce their child's tax burden for their excess scholarship money?

I would really appreciate any help I can get, I apologize for it being so long. Just trying to organize my thoughts",finance

personalfinance,"Sold a house that my husband inherited, we are not sure how to proceed with the funds.","Throwaway (of course). Sold a house husband inherited, after all is said and done will get about $300k. Brief overview of our current financial status:

* Joint income approx $110k

* Have mortgage on home, about 50% paid off, interest approx 4%, payment is $1050

* Finance on 1 car, $290 monthly, 1 or 2 years left, interest approx 3%

* Lease on 1 car, $415 monthly, 1 or 2 years left then we are considering financing the remainder. Probably our poorest financial decision, but given our situation we can easily swing it, and I like my car.

* My Student Loan approx $25K, approx 2% interest, payments are about $100 a month (UK student loan)

* Currently we both max out our 401k match (him 4k, me 5k) and have about $50k, have another $50k in roth IRAs but do not currently contribute. So $100k saved for retirement. Not enough but we started late and are playing catch-up.

* $30k in emergency fund (LMCU 3%, 15k each) and $20k in easy to access savings (AMEX, 2%)

This will leave us with approx $350k cash. and we are wondering how best to proceed with the money. We know it doesn't make financial sense to pay off our debts since they are a low interest rate. We dont want to tie everything up in 401k and IRAs as we would like to retire before we can withdraw from these without penalty.

* Wanting to keep some for practical home improvements (both indoor and outdoor) - husband also really wants a Tesla power wall (maybe $50k total) 

* Going to contribute the max to Roth IRAs from our income in 2019 and 2020 and ""pay ourselves back"" so another $25k.

* Keep the $30k in LMCU and $20k in Amex short term (for now, we've both been caught short before and don't want to be there again)

* Expecting first child, so thinking $25k into some sort of fund for them, not necessarily college (they may choose an alternate route), so not sure where to put this. 

* This leaves us with around $200k to put towards our future.

So we can either :

* A) just throw it into index funds and be done with it. Definitely the less stressful route.

* B) max out 401k, HSA and FSA Dependent care accounts and use the funds to reimburse ourselves.

* C) some combination of A and B, not sure what this would look like. 

With B, I calculated (roughly) this will mean reimbursing ourselves $27k per year, but will get $34k in tax advantaged accounts, reducing tax burden by approx $7k, guaranteed return of 25% on the $27k. However we aren't sure how we would manage the logistics (its making my head hurt trying to think about it), put $200k into some sort of savings and set it to pay out $1050 every 2 weeks? 

I estimate if the $200k is getting 10% returns, we would be down to 100k in about $10 years, but we would have put approx $340k more into our tax advantaged accounts than we would do at the current rate, and paid approx $70k less in taxes.

personalfinance,How much of my income should I spend on a car?,"Hello all. I don't usually like coming to this sub for vehicle questions because as cars are a huge waste of money, the good frugal people generally don't recommend spending much on your car. And that's totally fine for the vast majority of people. But being somewhat of a car enthusiast, and driving quite a lot, I love having a car that I love. It makes the smallest things in life more exciting just because you get so much joy out of driving your car. Have to do some errands? Oh well, at least I'll get to row through some gears. With that being said, I'm willing to shell out a little more than the average person. 

Anyway, my lease (the horror!) is coming to end of term very soon and I'm looking into my options to replace it. My current financial situation is this: I am currently living at home, paying not rent. I'm earning about 75k per year before taxes. I got a hefty raise earlier this year so I'm finally enjoying seeing my bank account steadily increase. No rent certainly helps massively. I spend most of my money on frivolities like vacations and going out with my friends. Yes, irresponsible I know. But I'm recently single and since I'm paying no rent I think it's doing good for me to enjoy the summer to the max. I do have a bit of debt that I'm paying back to my saintly parents that saved me from loan and credit interest. I'm going to be paying them $500 a month until it's paid. I think it almost $10k altogether.  I'm planning on staying in my parents house until the Spring. They are away all winter for the most part, and my pets need taking care of. It makes the most sense to stay and save the money. 

I started out looking purchasing a used car in the $18-$22k range. As my eyes got bigger than my stomach, my searches started to include more expensive cars in the $25-$30k range. There are a lot of cars in that range that I would absolutely love. Although many of them are cars that are not exactly maintenance friendly. BMWs and Audis tend to be pretty expensive to fix, but the reason I'm looking in the higher price range is for low mileage options. 

I believe I could afford a car in the higher price range, but adding maintenance costs on, and it's scaring me a little. Also, I'd like to move out of my house and not be a jerk with a nice car living in his parents basement (I don't live in the basement). So I don't want to get myself in trouble and be scared to move out. I applied for a loan, and with my currently mediocre credit, I got a rate of 8.5% for a 60 month term and 9.5% for 72. Pretty hefty rate in my mind.

With this information, and taking into account that I don't mind spending extra on a great car, what would be your price ceiling in my situation? The high interest rate and uncertainty about where I'm moving, and potentially thinking of changing jobs is making me think a short term lease may be less of a commitment than a 5-6 year loan, in case anything in my life changes drastically. 

I'm not sure if this information is applicable but I pay about $176 monthly in insurance and $160 in gas. Just to add in all my transportation costs. 

I also live in the suburbs of NYC, so that will give you an idea of the high cost of living in the area. 

As I'm typing this, I'm realizing that a $25k loan will cost me about $515 monthly. Adding in gas, insurance, and maintenance, I'm close to $1000 a month to drive. That's about 20-25% of my take home income. I'm assuming that 25% is a bit over the recommended percentage to spend on transportation.",finance

personalfinance,Split your savings across multiple Ally no-penalties CDs if you have more than 25k to invest,"Here is a tip: Split your savings across multiple Ally no-penalties CDs if you have more than 25k to invest. 25k and more gives you 2.3% yield for 11 months. But once you need that money, and you cash-in earlier than 11 months, the 2.3% deal may be gone.

Let's assume you have 40k in ONE no-penalty CD and need 25k for an emergency, then you will need to break the CD and will have 15k left you may not be able to put back into a no-penalty CD at 2.3% (because the 2.3% may get lowered in the near future based on FED rate-cuts).

Instead, open two no-penalty CDs, one for 25k and another one for the remaining 15k. If you need 25k before maturity date, you simply break your 1st CD while your 2nd CD stays intact. If you have 75k to invest, you simply open three no-penalty CD for each 25k. I am not sure what the limit is for the number of no-penalty CDs at Ally, but you can definitely open more than one.

Additionally, based on the fact that the 2.3% may be lowered in the future, if you currently have a no-penalty CD at Ally, you may want to cancel, cash-out (to your Ally checkings account) and re-start the same CD (all in the same day). In that way, you reset the 11 months and can enjoy this rate for much longer. The only risk you run is that Ally suddenly lowers the 2.3% right after your cancel your existing CD, but if you cancel and re-open within the same day, this risk should be limited.",finance

My wife was getting Premium Tax Credits/ACA up until we got married and she became eligible for my employer-sponsored coverage. The letter asked for her 1095-A and the 8962 (PTC reconciliation form). It didn't occur to us to file one because we didn't get a 1095-A in the mail (we moved) and weren't really aware of the consequences of combining incomes in this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

So we tracked down the 1095-A and oops: though she went on my insurance in March, her insurance plan didn't get canceled until July so there were 6 months of PTC credits instead of the 2-3 we were expecting. I recall we waited a bit to cancel the old insurance because we were waiting on some kind of written confirmation that she was in fact on my employer-sponsored insurance before canceling the old one. Honestly I can't remember the timeline of events there, but it's clear we screwed up and kept the old insurance longer than we should have, or the insurance company took their sweet time in closing the account. I plugged all this into H&amp;R Block and boom: our $3800 tax refund dropped to $800. That sucked, but we accepted it. The letter specifically stated not to send in a revised tax return and only asked for those two documents, so we mailed the forms to the IRS in late March along with a copy of the 12C letter.

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't hear anything for over a month, so I called the IRS sometime in May. They told me that the forms had been received but were not input into the system until April 19th, so I should wait 6-8 weeks before calling again. We received no notice and the online status never changed, so I called again two weeks ago to ask what was going on. Was told that there had been a data entry error or something like that on their end, and the person on the phone said she was sending some kind of letter or notification to the responsible department to get it moving again. She said ""Call again if you haven't received a notice in 8 weeks"". I got my refund via direct deposit 3 business days later (July 31st), but it was the full $3800. It sure seems like I'm holding on to $3000 that's not mine, and I'm not sure what to do next other than park it in my savings account and wait on the IRS to send some kind of follow-up letter. Is there a proactive move I can make here? I'd rather not be dealing with this next tax season.",finance
investing,Are Series EE bonds the best risk-adjusted investment?,"Completely serious question here.

[Series EE bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued052005andafer.htm) are federal bonds you buy at half of face value, and then redeem for face value after twenty years. This twenty-year doubling implies a nominal return of about 3.53% annually. All of the return is collected at redemption time, giving strong tax deferral benefits.

Today‚Äôs twenty-year Treasury bonds sold for 2.01%. That‚Äôs target inflation. EE bonds are paying 1.52% above Treasuries, and yet they come with the same Treasury guarantee.

Historically, stock indices have delivered returns far above 3.5% nominal. In fact, the S&amp;P500 with dividends reinvested has averaged about doubling every ten years _after_ inflation, not before!

But there‚Äôs no evidence the same will be true going forward. The dividend yield on SPY is below 2% now, driven down by competition with the bond market. Valuations are very high (the reciprocal of the previous statement) and future price increases aren‚Äôt necessarily more likely than price _decreases_. 

After all, if elevated interest rates ever do return, it‚Äôs possible we could see a drop to historically normal valuations, wiping several years of gains from stocks. I‚Äôm not predicting that to happen. But it‚Äôs at least as plausible as another huge run-up from where we are now.

Is the best risk-adjusted investment in today‚Äôs low-rate environment the EE bond? Should we all be buying the max every year?",finance

My mom is a teacher in Florida making about $2,200 a month. She‚Äôs currently trying to figure out how to handle her mounting CC debt. The bank is offering her a line of credit against our house with a lower interest rate (5% from 9%) which I advised against for now but don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a decent move in her position. This is her breakdown:

Car payment - $236
Bills, groceries, insurance, subscriptions, etc. - $1,500
CC debt - $21,000

Taking into account interest, I did a rough calculation of her having to pay ~$700 to pay it off in 3 years. Obviously assuming she adds nothing to that debt (which she undoubtedly will). Is there any tips / guides to how she can handle her debt or is it as simple as buckling down and making the largest payments she can. 

Is it worth taking a line of credit against the house for lower interest? Im of the understanding that putting up the house isn‚Äôt something we want to do.

personalfinance,Pursue PSLF &amp; financial goals? Or aggressive repayment &amp; delay financial goals?,"Hello personalfinance family,

Thanks for all the advice you have given me as I have lurked for some time. I've learned so much and have managed my finances rather well thanks to this subreddit. However one topic has given me an insane amount of anxiety recently so I'm seeking some wisdom here - what to do about my student loans and financial planning. I've tried to format and explain as best I can. Anyone who makes it through and can offer some advice, please know how much I appreciate it. 

INCOME: Worked non-profit previously, just landed good government job. Current salary \~42k with a 3% tax deferred retirement contribution. Union contract has scheduled annual raises that will put me at \~62k in 2022. If no contract is implemented and all things stay the same, I'd be at \~68k from 2024-2029 (I say 2029 because this is when I'd complete PSLF). As my salary increases, my mandatory retirement contribution does too but only to about 5% max if I remember correctly. Doing the math, and not adding the 2.5% raises that come annually to each pay increment (under current contract) from 2023-2029, my average salary over the 10 years would be \~61k. In reality, it could be different depending on if/when a new contract is negotiated and if the 2.5% annual increases continue.

STUDENT LOANS: $37,312 @ 4.9% (average), currently on REPAYE \~142/month right now, have maybe 10 months of PSLF time under my belt. 

I put my info into the repayment calculator on the federal student aid website. If I were going to make 42k indefinitely, I'd come out great with PSLF - I'd pay 31,965 over the 10 years versus 47,257 on standard repayment. However, when I input my ten year averaged salary of 61k, those numbers turn into me paying off my loans on REPAYE, in full, and paying 46,781 versus 47,257 on standard repayment over 120 months. My method may be flawed. 

I want to buy a home within the next 5 years, preferably sooner. Do I stay on an income based plan and pursue PSLF and use a tax deferred account, a traditional IRA or 457b, or other methods to reduce my AGI in higher earning years? Striving to keep my average AGI at \~50k opposed to 61k. IF I can do this, my REPAYE total would be 42k, or PAYE 41k. I like this because it's an opportunity to really save up for retirement. I don't like this because I'll have to drastically cut into my salary, missing out on that disposable income from about age 28-35, when I'd love to be traveling, living life, maybe buying real estate.

Or do I put off my home buying hopes, stop contributing to my Roth IRA, and pay down on my loans as much and as quickly as I can, which would be about $500/month right now and would increase each year with each increment I move up at work? Paying down this aggressively would leave me with no contributions to an emergency fund, retirement (besides my mandatory pension contribution). If I managed $500/month nerdwallet's calculator puts me at 44500 total in 7.5 years  (less than the IBR at 61k, more than IBR at 50k presuming I put the difference in tax deferred accounts). $600/month gets me down to 43200 in 6 years, 700/month 42k in 5 years. I definitely couldn't commit to 6/700 right now, so those numbers would be higher cause even if I averaged that payment, the interest would be a bit greater.

Last ""option"", I flirt with the idea (maybe fantasy is a better word?) of the government forgiving/cancelling my loans within the next ten years so tell myself I should just go with the lowest payment for the time being. One can dream.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing this out and putting it all together, maybe things would be better if I could get on PAYE? But I have a LTR and am considering marriage, not to mention my partner will likely be making 6 figures and have 6 figures of student debt by next year. I'm imagining this just throws a wrench into everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to plan the best way to pay off or have my loans forgiven, while also planning for life, has completely sucked the life out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make this simple yet as comprehensive as necessary. I hope it makes sense. I feel like I have all this info at my fingertips but can't get it organized into concrete options/plans - I suppose because no one can plan for the future perfectly.

personalfinance,College junior in a pickle...::help,"PLEASE I NEED ADVICE. Disclaimer: not asking for any handouts, opinions on my fathers actions or any sort of freebie or relationship advice. Just asking what I can do to get myself through college. 
Alright, this is my first post on reddit because I am truly besides myself. I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point and I‚Äôm desperately searching for some light of hope in this grim situation. I apologize in advanced for the messy writing. 
 
A little backstory, I am a college junior at a state university and have been living with my parents + commuting for 2 years now. My tuition wasn‚Äôt too expensive and I was able to co-sign with my dad about 33k worth of debt total in private loans to stay afloat. I‚Äôm about to move to the large ‚Äúmain‚Äù campus where everything is significantly more expensive. Now all of it is crashing down. 

My father was my only option for a co-signer as my mother has her own debt, and I have little to no extended family. 
At this point in the summer I have already signed a 12 month lease for my apartment and transferred jobs up to this college. Stupidly, I saved applying for loans as the last step. 
I went to reapply and I was immediately denied, confused and thinking this has to be a mistake I tried again 
And again
And again 
Denied. 
Huh. Not sure what the issue was. 
Until my mother checked my fathers credit karma; he had taken out two of his OWN private loans this year for himself, in addition to about 6 maxed out credit cards. 
I attempted to confront him but to no avail, even threatening to emancipate myself if he doesn‚Äôt at least admit he took them out (I‚Äôm 20yrs old. Not sure if emancipate is the correct term but you know). My mother is devastated, as she already has her own 120k worth of debt and not enough built up credit to constitute her being a worthy co-signer. Believe me, I‚Äôve tried. 
I need somebody to give me a glimmer of hope that there‚Äôs a way to fix this. I need 30,000 for my total fall and spring tuition. And that‚Äôs the bare minimum. Is declaring myself completely independent and risking my health insurance worth it?
For reference, I have already maxed out my federal loans and have attempted to apply for a private in every way imaginable. I already have the 33k with a private company and dad as co-signer and I pay my monthly bill on time every single month. I also own my vehicle and have never missed a credit card payment. These are the only assets in my name. I‚Äôve talked to so many people on the phone including my college financial office only to have no solution, and the poor phone operators having to listen to a crying college kid. I could attempt to do a parent plus with my mom but I highly doubt it will work. 
Please help, I am halfway through my degree and am sick at the thought of having to withdrawal this late in the game with no full time income, 33k worth of debt and no credentials. 
I‚Äôm willing to do ANYTHING, even take out the most shady loan possible to make this happen for me. I have a part time job aligned but it only pays around 10k a year with managing school and work. I have the whole fall semesters worth of rent saved up, and I guess I can accept the fall late tuition fees before it starts to get ugly. Please help. 

Summary: 3rd year college junior. Two private loans out already. my father (co-signer for these previous two loans) took out two personal loans this year without telling me that is causing this year‚Äôs application for private loans to be denied.

Economics,Negative nominal interest rates and the bank lending channel,,finance
investing,A comprehensive analysis on Facebook ($FB),"With all the recent controversy surrounding Facebook, today we are going to analyze Facebook's business fundamentals, growth potential, risks, valuation, and ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the social media giant. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.

###The social media market

With over 2.41 billion monthly active users across Facebook and Messenger platforms, and over 2.7 billion monthly active users across all Facebook-owned platforms (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Facebook is a major player in the social media market, to say the least. Facebook is often accused of being a monopoly, but they do face fierce competition on many of their products and features. Messenger and WhatsApp compete head-to-head with Apple's iMessage and FaceTime in the messaging and private communication space. In the video space, Facebook Watch and Instagram's IGTV both pale in comparison to Youtube. However, Facebook's network effect does provide an enormous competitive advantage in the social media space, largely owing to their extraordinarily enormous user base. Firstly, it increases the ""stickiness"" of users. If you live in a developed country, chances are that you and many your friends rely on a Facebook-owned platform as a primary channel of communication, making it very inconvenient for anyone to leave the network. Once hailed as an archetypal Silicon Valley success story, Facebook has taken severe blows to their reputation after a series of privacy scandals. However, users are not leaving the platform. In fact, monthly active users have continued to grow steadily following the Cambridge Analytica scandal that first began reshaping public opinion around the social media giant. Users stick to the platform, perhaps because there is no other feasible place to go. Secondly, an enormous user base gives Facebook a huge advantage over other social platforms. For example, when Instagram decided to implement ""Stories"", a feature that had existed on Snapchat for over five years at the time, Snapchat was quickly out-competed. In less than one year, Instagram Stories had overtaken Snapchat Stories in active users. After two years, Instagram Stories had over twice as many users as Snapchat Stories, and Snapchat began to see a decline in users. This example demonstrates that when Facebook decides to enter a new space, they bring along an enormous existing user base, which gives them a competitive edge over smaller platforms.

###The digital advertising market

Facebook in its current form is a social media platform, but it is in the business of digital advertising. It competes with the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Verizon in the digital advertising space, as well as everyone in the traditional advertising space, since money spent on traditional advertising is money not spent advertising on Facebook. Fortunately for Facebook, digital ad spend as a proportion of total ad spend in the United States is trending upwards. In fact, it is expected that digital advertising will account for over half of all ad spend in 2019, making it the first year that advertisers spend more on digital media than traditional media. It is not difficult to see why advertisers are moving from traditional media to digital media. Digital advertising often provides higher conversion rates and more impressions at lower costs, ultimately producing a higher return on ad spend for marketers. Facebook can provide more effective advertising because their ad targeting is laser-focused. Where traditional media can make their best guess that your ad will be shown to 18-24 year old females in New York who are interested in beauty products, Facebook can be relatively certain of it, based on information that users provide them directly, as well as data that is collected through users' activity both on and off the platform. They can also offer lower rates to advertisers due to the vast amount of ad inventory provided by their enormous user base. Additionally, digital media platforms typically provide better tools for ad campaign monitoring and analytics, which is important for marketers. With digital media, marketers can collect data in real-time and make changes and optimizations to their ad campaigns within minutes. This gives digital media an edge over traditional media, and Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable shift from traditional to digital. Facebook currently sits at around 19% of total digital ad spend in the United States.

###Competitive advantage

Facebook's competitive advantage lies primarily in three areas: user base, data, and business success. As mentioned before, their vast user base creates a network effect that makes it extremely difficult to leave and tempts new users to join. Facebook has to spend relatively little to acquire new users in their established markets (which is most of the developed world), making them very difficult to compete against for new startups that have relatively high customer acquisition costs. Additionally, Facebook's data advantage allows them to create highly accurate and detailed profiles on their users, giving them a huge competitive edge over traditional media platforms and even other digital media platforms. Finally, despite being caught in political crosshairs, Facebook's vast profitability allows them to be relatively resilient in a hostile regulatory environment. Unlike Snapchat and many other tech startups that are not yet profitable and require constant capital injections from investors to sustain their operations, Facebook is a cash-generating machine. New legislation regarding privacy and security will likely be introduced in the near-future, and compliance often requires an increase in headcount as well as infrastructure modifications, which can cost significant amounts of capital. Therefore, smaller and less profitable institutions would be disproportionately affected by new regulations, assuming that the regulations are broad-reaching and do not single-out Facebook as the target.

###Facebook's financials

Facebook's financial statements are the kind that Wall Street dreams about. Their balance sheet is pristine, with almost $50 billion in cash and only $13 billion in current liabilities, resulting in a cash-ratio of 3.75. Less than 25% of their assets are funded by debt, so they should face relatively less pressure during an economic downturn. Over the past five years, their earnings have grown over 600%, and they are continuing to grow, albeit at a slower rate. In the past twelve months, average revenue per user has grown by 18%, while total users have grown by 8%, leading to a revenue growth of 28% year over year. However, expenses are also ramping up as Facebook faces regulatory pressure to make improvements to their privacy and security infrastructure. As a result, operating margins have fallen from 44% in the second quarter of 2018 to 39% in 2019, leading to a modest operating income growth of 13% after adjusting for the recent fine from the Federal Trade Commission. One would hope that Facebook can eventually reduce the costs required to improve their infrastructure, as well as overcome the regulatory obstacles as to avoid excessive fines and settlements in the near future. Ideally, they would be able to do this while maintaining strong revenue growth, which does not seem to be a problem at the moment. This is particularly astounding considering the already-gargantuan size of Facebook.

###Growth potential

Despite having over one-third of the world in its network, Facebook's user count continues to grow at high single digits, although most of this growth comes from regions where Facebook does not monetize quite as well, such as Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of World"". In these regions, the average revenue per user is less than one-tenth of that in the United States and Canada. However, this presents a macroeconomic growth opportunity for Facebook ‚Äì as these countries grow their economies, consumers will spend more and advertisers will spend more to attract these consumers. Therefore, in addition to a steadily growing user count in these markets, with time, the value of each user in these markets should grow too.

More macroeconomic growth potential lies in the year over year expansion of the global advertising market. Total advertising spend worldwide grows around 5% each year, and as mentioned before, digital advertising is taking a larger and larger portion of that spend. As a market leader in the digital advertising space, Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from these two macroeconomic trends.

Aside from macroeconomic tailwinds, there are still many adjustments that Facebook can make to its platforms to improve their top-line. In fact, much of Facebook's growth limitations are self-imposed. Facebook is very conscious about the user experience and is aware of how it can be impacted by advertisements. Therefore, when rolling out new ad products such as Facebook Stories ads, they will likely take their time and exercise caution, often testing out the feature in small markets and expanding slowly until they are confident that it will not impede too much on the user experience. Surprisingly, there are still no ads on Instagram's Explore Feed. Additionally, Messenger and WhatsApp are barely monetized. Each of these present opportunities to increase ad inventory, but we can expect Facebook to be patient and to roll out new ad products on these platforms slowly over time.

Facebook is constantly releasing new products such as Libra, Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Dating, Facebook Watch and Instagram Checkout. If successful, such new products may meaningfully contribute to their top-line. Like Google, Facebook is also willing to make a few moonshot bets on new technology such as virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses. Only time will tell whether or not these investments will pay off.

###Risks

Currently, Facebook's biggest and most obvious risk lies in the current hostile political environment in which it operates, both in the United States and worldwide. The European Union has been constantly hammering on the tech giants for their privacy issues and anticompetitive behavior, implementing policies like GDPR and aggressively attacking them with fines, which, if continued, may have a materially negative impact on Facebook's profitability. Additionally, the United States government has also begun to take legal action against the tech giants, with bipartisan support. Facebook recently received a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission and is currently pending investigation from both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for potential anticompetitive behavior. The results of these investigations are to be seen, but any antitrust actions taken against Facebook could materially impact its operations.

Additionally, although the recent series of privacy and antitrust scandals have not seemed to meaningfully impact user count, it has seemed to negatively affect employee morale at Facebook. Surveys completed by employees at Facebook have not been as positive as in the past, and the company has seen ten of its top executives leave in 2018. If this trend continues, Facebook may find it difficult to attract and retain top talent and lose some of its competitive edge.

###Valuation

The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Facebook's earnings will grow at 15% year over year for five years starting January 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 16 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Facebook's present value is $422 billion. It's current market capitalization is $550 billion, meaning that the stock is currently overvalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Facebook at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.

###Conclusion

Facebook is a remarkable business that has grown its revenue and earnings at an extraordinary rate over the last few years. There is still plenty of room to grow, but whether or not the growth materializes will depend on macroeconomic factors, regulatory outcomes and Facebook's ability to effectively execute on their vision. Facebook's fundamentals are strong, but with an adjusted price/earnings ratio of 24, and a price/book value of 6, it seems that this strength is already somewhat reflected in the market value of the stock.

personalfinance,"Taking out a ton of loans for an aviation degree, good debt or bad idea?","I plan on attending an out of state school to study aviation science with classes beginning in 3 weeks. It's been my dream since I was a little kid to be a pilot. I finally got my first license today and am 100% committed in continuing my training. But the issue is, money. 

I am looking at around $60k for college tuition alone. This includes living at home where I won't need to pay rent, food, utilities, etc. On top of that, I'll need an extra $70k for flight training. 

Here is my plan: I do intend on working my butt off throughout the year to get as many scholarships as possible to lower the cost (for some reason, aviation majors tend to have more scholarships for currently enrolled students). I intend to work one or two jobs, whatever necessary and throw all of it towards the loans. No spending money. I don't plan on going out. I plan on living frugally and throwing everything I can towards the loans. By my junior/senior year, I should be a flight instructor earning $20-30/hr so that'll give me more added money + a secondary job. Regional airlines also offer sign on bonuses of higher than $20k-50k (depending on many factors) that can be thrown 100% onto my loans. 

Here's my loan plan: $27k federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized). I plan on attempting for Parent PLUS. Anything else, Sallie Mae or something. 

My main issue right now is figuring out if this is the right choice. I am following my dreams. There is HIGH demand for pilots right now (regional airlines literally holding consistent career fairs at my university). There are cheaper ways to fly, but I feel like this will allow me to remain 100% focused on my aspirations and not worry about some other major in college that I might not use. From looking at the flying subreddit, it seems that people make the case that this can be good debt. I mean, very few people can get to the airlines with out of pocket money. It takes a ton of loans. But I want to make sure I won't regret it later. Yes, starting salary is $40-50k a year. Yes, that is half of what loans I'll have. But salaries increase exponentially over time. Aviation is a field of seniority and I am trying to get in as soon as possible with the best training.

btc,Shadow banned on the ‚Äúuncensored‚Äù sub,"On the https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/cnfyx3/coinbase_has_to_litigate_suit_over_bch_listing_in/ post I commented pointing out the article neglects to talk about the fraud aspect of the lawsuit being dropped.

I thought this was supposed to be the uncensored sub? Is this turning into the next r Bitcoin sub? 

Or does anyone want to explain what I did wrong for calling out journalism that ignores facts to push their narrative?

&gt; The motion to dismiss the fraud claims is granted. The plaintiffs have not particularly pleaded their reliance on Coinbase‚Äôs allegedly fraudulent statements. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Moreover, while the factual allegations paint a compelling picture of an incompetent launch by Coinbase, the complaint does not outline a coherent account of fraud by Coinbase, Armstrong, and Farmer. For instance, the plaintiffs tell us that Armstrong (the founder of Coinbase) trumpeted the virtues of Bitcoin Cash and sought to increase its popularity, all the while harboring a nefarious plan to let insiders sabotage his exchange‚Äôs launch of trading in Bitcoin Cash.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the original article since I thought it was two different lawsuits not the same one at first. Last I checked though the purpose of an uncensored sub was to inform people of their mistakes and lack of knowledge not to shadow ban their comments leaving them in the dark like the rest of the r Bitcoin visitors trying to actually inform themselves instead of being a paid shill.",cryptocurrency

&gt; The Trump administration is rushing to finalize a list of $300 billion in Chinese imports it plans to hit with tariffs in a few weeks‚Äô time, as U.S. companies make a last-ditch appeal to be spared from the latest round of duties.

&gt; President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement last week on adding a 10% tariff as of Sept. 1 to virtually every Chinese import that‚Äôs not yet subject to punitive duties took U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer by surprise, people familiar with the discussions said. Lighthizer and his staff are now under pressure to revise an initial list targeting more than 3,800 Chinese product lines based on issues raised during a public comment period and hearings.

&gt; The USTR is planning to publish the final list this week or early next, the people said. In that meantime, companies are making a last-ditch attempt at convincing the Trump administration not to impose duties or to drop items they import from the tariff list.

&gt; In a meeting shortly before the president announced the new duties, Lighthizer argued against the new tariffs. He instead urged patience to allow more time for a tariff increase in June to 25% from 10% on an earlier batch of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to inflict pain on the Chinese economy, the people said.

&gt; A USTR spokesman disputed that account, and said the agency was following the same legal process as it had in previous tariff rounds. Trump decides when the tariffs will go into effect and USTR will publish the final list before the effective date, the spokesman said.

&gt; ‚ÄúCompanies don‚Äôt plan by tweet,‚Äù Jon Gold, of the National Retail Federation, said. ‚ÄúThese are all contracts that are already executed and cargo is on the water.‚Äù

&gt; After Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed on yet another tariff truce in late June, businesses didn‚Äôt expect another escalation this soon and felt like they had more time to plan, Gold added. Companies and trade associations are still trying to weigh in with the administration to make their case and potentially get their products taken off the list.

&gt; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow this week signaled the tariffs could be called off before Sept. 1 if Beijing shows goodwill on buying American agriculture goods and getting back to the negotiating table.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe president and our team is planning for a Chinese visit in September,‚Äù Kudlow said Tuesday on CNBC. ‚ÄúMovement toward a good deal would be very positive and might change the tariff situation. But then again, it might not.‚Äù

&gt; It‚Äôs not clear if businesses are able to submit requests for product exclusions once the duties are imposed. For previous lists, such an option was only available once the tariff rate was bumped up to 25%. It‚Äôs also not clear whether the Sept. 1 date applies to the date when the item arrives in the U.S. or when it leaves China -- a critical question for importers because of the amount of product that is already on the water traveling to America.

&gt; Of the almost 13,750 exclusion requests submitted for the initial tariffs imposed last year on $50 billion in goods, only 23% have been approved as of Aug. 2. About 60% were rejected and the rest are still being revised, government data show. Companies can file for exclusions in the last round of tariffs on $200 billion of products until Sept. 30.",finance

personalfinance,So what does this mean? Aspiration Bank,"I received an email that‚Äôs not giving me the info I need. If anyone knows the answer, much thanks. According to this, if I don‚Äôt deposit $1000/mo, I don‚Äôt get 2.00 APY. BUT, if I have 10k as a balance, I will get 1.50. What if I don‚Äôt have either? I make deposits of over $600ish. I don‚Äôt maintain a 10k balance. That‚Äôs not answered in this piece from their email. 


‚ÄúInterest Rates
As you may have seen in the news, last week the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in 11 years. That means a cut to how much we earn on customers‚Äô deposits. However, while other financial institutions are cutting interest rates for everyone or giving a higher rate to those that have the most money, we decided to do something in keeping with our values. We are keeping our 2.00% APY on Save balances for the customers who are putting Aspiration at the core of their financial life and depositing $1,000 or more a month. (It‚Äôs simple to set up direct deposits here, or a regular recurring deposit here, so you won‚Äôt need to worry about qualifying.) If you don‚Äôt meet the $1,000 a month deposit requirement, you can earn 1.50% APY by maintaining a balance of over $10,000. With these new rates, our cash management account continues to dwarf traditional savings account rates, offering an APY that is up to 200 times higher than the savings account APY of Wells Fargo*.‚Äù",finance
personalfinance,FERS + TSP Contribution Amounts,"Hey r/pf, 

I see a lot of talk about saving 15% of your gross for retirement, but I can't seem to find anything in the prime directive that talks about how FERS contributions play into that 15%. 

If I am putting 5% in my TSP, which earns me a 5% TSP match, and then I am required to put 4.4% into FERS, would that be considered as me saving 14.4% for retirement? Or just 10% if FERS doesn't count? 

I will be jumping up the ladder for each of the next 2 years until GS-12 and plan to increase my TSP contribution 1% each year. In 2021, I will be contributing 8% to TSP, the 5% match, and the 4.4% to FERS which would put me at saving 17.4% of my gross salary. Or 13% if you don't count FERS. 

I plan on working for about another 30 years, give or take a couple depending on how life plays out. I am pretty set on being a federal employee for life so I'm not thinking about leaving and plan to have my entire retirement in the TSP. If I do 30 more years I'll be retiring before 60 so even if I had to go a few years more I'd still be retiring at a decent age in my early 60's. 

How does this plan sound? Am I on the right track? I'll be saving 17%+ of my gross for about 25 years of 6 figure salary. The 4-5 years before I hit 6 figures I'll still be pulling in 70k+ and saving 15% of that. It seems good to me, but having more opinions can't hurt.",finance

personalfinance,"Buying a second home, keeping and renting the first home?","Hello, 

My wife and I are thinking of moving out of the city and into the burbs. We bought our current (and first) home around 7 years ago. We want to move into a bigger place, with a yard and a garage and all of that. Both of our jobs are quite secure and recession proof, which is very fortunate. 

We anticipate it will be in the 500-600k range, and we will have 20% down + estimated closing costs available in a month or two (135K). This leaves us with a 6 month emergency fund. We both have 800 credit scores and no debt (besides a car payment). We will be able to make the payments on the new place while still putting 25% each of our salaries into 401k's, and another 20%-25% each in savings. Given the choice, I'd want to put less down and deal with PMI for a few years - taking money out of the company is expensive, and I'd like to have more available for moving expenses, furniture, etc. 

The first house has a VA loan, 175K owed, the place is worth around 375K. Mortgage bill is a little under 1200, and we think we can rent it for 2K. For figuring out the after-move finances, I am using a rent figure of 1900 and 90% occupancy. The house is impeccably maintained and everything works great. I will be getting appropriate certifications from the city and appropriate insurance to rent the place.

We think the monthly payment for the second house will be no more than 3300, figuring in taxes and insurance, but would like to stay sub 3K. Since rates are so low, I would like to put less than 20% down and keep the cash on hand. Would there be any issues with putting less than 20% down in our situation?

With the 4% earnings tax in our city, by leaving and renting our current home we will actually end up about even in our monthly outlay, or close to even (meaning after the huge down payment hit, our monthly finances will net out close to what they are). This is taking into account no longer needing a dog walker, saving on city wage taxes, daycare (which is apparently cheaper in the burbs, we're looking into it), utilities which will be higher, less gas due to a shorter commute, cheaper car insurance, and higher property taxes. 

\---

So, how does one do this? I'm not in a rush to get involved with lenders yet, but I do want to so some financial hygiene over the next few months to make sure everything looks good for a lender. Maybe the way to learn about the whole thing would be to actually get pre-approved? 

I am going to get the majority of the down payment as an owner draw on a company that I partly own. I can run this through the payroll company, or take it as a check and pay the tax later, or any other legal way to take equity and/ or a bonus out of a company. I want to do this now-ish to give the maximum time between the large lump-sum coming into my account and when a lender starts going through our stuff. What would be the best way to take this payment? Payroll I assume is the most conservative answer and would look the most 'normal\[. I have taken large lump-sums like this in the past and have records of it.

I forget whether or not they needed our current tax returns when we got pre-approved for our current home. We filed extensions this April for our 2018 returns (I modestly overpaid when we extended). I am assuming that they would like if I finalized our filing beforehand, right?

We'd like to be in the new house by New Years, but we can wait if needed. I would like to get into a position that if we see something that looks like an outstanding fit that we can pounce. 

Is there a such thing as a bad time of year to buy a house?

Since the first house is a VA loan, does that have any effect?

We would be borrowing under 480K so I think it is a conforming loan? I gather that above this amount the interest rates may be higher and a larger down payment would be required.

Do I have to do anything with our current mortgage lender if we are no longer using the first house as a primary residence? Anything we need to prove or demonstrate for the second house to prove that it will be our primary residence and not a vacation home or anything else that might throw a wrench in the works? Any lenders that may be amenable to taking the future rental income into account? . 

Are there any lenders to avoid? Any lenders that might be a good bet? Any that might take into account potential rental income from the first home (even though we are figuring on being able to carry both places with no renters, as a safety cushion)? Our first house is financed through Navy Federal. Should we give them first crack, or avoid them altogether?

Lastly, what might I be overlooking? 

Thanks! Even if nobody generously takes the time to read or respond it was helpful to write it all down. 

Just a note: I realize that we are very fortunate to be making these kinds of decisions, and we feel grateful every day. We do give a good amount to charity and I pay my workers quite well - We try to adhere to the concept that we can't afford to make other's lives better, than we can't afford to make ours even more comfortable.",finance
personalfinance,"22 years old, about to start a PhD program &amp; seeking advice","As the title says, I'm 22 and about to start a PhD program. My program is in bioengineering, so I have a full fellowship and will be paid a decent stipend for the duration of my program. I'm looking for advice on personal finance moves I can make while in grad school.

Some specifics:
I'll be making about $31.5K annually, with a take home income of approximately $2,200 monthly. I'm in Texas, so cost of living is pretty cheap and based on some initial budgeting I'll be able to pay my expenses every month with about $1000 left over, maybe more.
I have ~$6000 in a savings account, which can be used as an emergency fund &amp; for deposit on a future apartment, etc. if need be.
I have a combo of private &amp; federal loans from undergrad: about $130K total (quick breakdown: $48K in two private loans at 6.75%, $42K in two private loans at 4.25%, 4 Federal Direct Subsidized loans (max 5500 with 5.05%); 4 Federal Direct Unsubsidized loans (max $2K with 5.05%); and a Federal Perkins loan at $3K with 5%).
All of my loans are deferred while in school, and my parents are generous enough to make interest payments on all of them while I'm in school.

As far as my plans, based on my initial reading:
I believe the best choice is to open a Roth IRA (I currently have very low income but expect to have a large increase in income once I enter the workforce, and currently work in a state with low income taxes (TX)), since I should be able to make the maximum contribution every month comfortably with my expenses.
I think it would also be good to pay off the federal loans (esp unsubsidized) while in school (my reasoning: the deferment period only lasts 4 years, but I'll likely be in school for 5 years, and paying off some of the debt can improve my cash flow situation for that remaining year. I may also need to relocate at the end of the 5 years)
These are basically the two prongs of my initial finance strategy, but I'm open to feedback and advice from those who know more than me. For example: is it a better idea to pay off part of my private loans while in school? Should I start with the highest interest rate? Further, what are my options for consolidating while in school?

TL;DR:
I'll be entering grad school and would like to set up a Roth IRA/pay down undergrad debt to position myself well for the future. Open to any kind of advice. Happy to provide more information if need be. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Does opening a credit card account plummet or help your credit score?,"I've always had pretty good credit score but I was told that if I opened a credit card account and so long as I was sensible and paying things off pretty much instantly it would help increase my credit score.

I have 3 credit cards:

* Aqua card which I have only ever used once and is a balance of 0 (Thinking of cancelling this?)
* Amazon credit card which I have only had for maybe 2 and half months (Which I'm also thinking of cancelling)
* My banks own credit card which I've used a fair bit but the current balance is only about ¬£12

I dont really see my credit score increasing for this, infact it went up one month and I think when I opened the Amazon one it plummeted. Would cancelling these better my credit score or do nothing at all if they sit there essentially unused? But I have never paid interest on any of these cards and only ever made purchases within the 0% interest rate you have when you first open the account and I always pay more then the minimum required each month if there is a fair bit on the balance.",finance
personalfinance,How do you live with tough financial choices?,"I'm in debt. Like a lot of it. $79k in student loans ($52k at 3.75% and 17k at 0%). I also have about $35k in unsecured consumer debt ($7200 at 21%, $900 at 20% and $9200 at 0% for another 2 months). Before you all jump on me, yes, I now have a budget that I stick to and I've learned my lesson about living within my means, but I still have to deal with the debt. I have about $2500 in savings/RRSP/TFSA accounts, which I don't contribute to right now. I have not been able to get a consolidation loan because of the debt load that I already have.

I recently applied for a consumer proposal at $800/month for 60 months. It would wipe out the larger of the student loans (which is listed as a personal loan, essentially the bank lent me the money to pay off my government student loan at a lower interest rate), and the consumer debt. The 0% student loan would stay however. The bank countered with $1225/month for $60 months, which is basically what my minimum payments would be for all of it anyway. I offered $900/month, but was still rejected. I'm currently in a period where I can either withdraw the proposal entirely, or go with it, I'm waiting to find out how long the proposal stays on my credit report if I withdraw it.

More to the point: Regardless, I have a $400 shortfall each month. I pick up extra shifts were I can, and have trimmed my budget back as far as I can without impacting my boyfriend's quality of life as well (yes, he knows about the debt). The issue I'm struggling with is that I own a horse. I've been with her since she was 3, and have owned her for the past 3 years; she's 17 now and she's my whole world. My dream came true when I bought her from my riding coach. Her board is about the cheapest you can find around here, but she has medications and tack needs and shoes and vet care, and when I average out the numbers, it's about $700/month. I know I need to give her up and I have a potential home for her who will let me lease her from them so I can continue to be in her life, but this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Even when it's the only option, how did you find the strength to make the really deep cuts? I just feel so guilty about having to give up the horse who's given so much to me over the years.

TLDR: Very financially broke, but about to be heart broke as well as I come to the painful realization that the only way out of debt is to give up the most important ""person"" in my life.

For the past few years I have been working as a teacher in Texas. The pay was fine and I was able to keep up with all my payments and even pay off cards pretty well. In the past year my daughter was born and my wife insisted that we move to her hometown so that she could be close to family. I ended up taking a teaching position that was pretty comparable to what I had before except now I needed to pay for insurance for my whole family as opposed to just me. This ended up being 400 dollars more a month. On top of that I accumulated more debt during the move and the one month that I didn't get paid (teachers get paid monthly here). 

I currently have about $8,500 in debt and I feel like I am drowning in it.

personalfinance,Is dental school worth 500k in loans?,"I was accepted into a priced dental school that charges around 450k-500k after considering living costs and interest rates. No that's not an exaggeration and it's quickly becoming the norm at these dental schools in the northeast especially. I'm getting charged this disgusting amount because I'm an OOS student. 

They do offer in-state tuition after jumping through some ridiculous hoops and requirements but even so, the debt would be about 450k. Without the in-state tuition my costs max out at 530k. Is dentistry worth it at this point. I despise these deans with perpetual cheek-to-cheek grins and bad tans that act like they're helping keep their schools in the avant-garde of dentistry by jacking up tuition the way they do.

Dentistry has not changed anywhere near enough to warrant this absurd level of tuition. My question is thus, and sorry for the rant, is dentistry worth sacrificing my 20s (I'm  24 now) and 30s to pay off an outlandish loan. Would I be better off going into accounting? I have a backup masters  in accounting program that has accepted me and the school has good placement statistics as well (around 90% secure full time positions upon graduation). I like dentistry but not enough to ruin 2 decades of my life in its best years. I could probably service the loan but I'd be living on a salary of around 20-30k per year (after considering taxes, an associate dentist has around 80-85k post tax income, of which I'd put 60k towards the loan). And no I have no desire to own my own practice either, at all. The headaches of malpractice insurance and business ownership is something I will never deal with on top of my loans.

personalfinance,Car buying advice,"I am a 21 y/o new grad and I am looking to buy my first car. I am posting on this sub to get a perspective on my car budget. I take home 6.5k per month after taxes.

investing,Can the yield curve invert when the economy expands too fast?,"When the fed lowers or maintains low interest rates, lending is cheap, so there is a credit rush.  

But when this happens, wouldn't this apply upward pressure on market (natural) interest rates, particularly in the short-term to fuel short term (and potentially big ticket) pet projects?

If that's the case, then would it make sense to say that an inverted yield curve is the cause of an abnormally fast expansion?

Edit: Rothbard, ""Man, Economy and the State, Vol. I"", pg. 858: Credit expansion may well lead to the [opposite] effect: the gainers may have higher time preferences, in which case the free-market interest rate will be higher than before.

So what he's saying is that it's a matter of companys' high vs low time preferences (high = impatient, low = patient), and I think he would argue that free money, provided NOW, all of the sudden, would incentivize companies to expend it on things that would provide the most immediate benefit now.  And this could explain the current interest rate situation.

I put them back and found them again. Im now 22, so the oldest are the same age. Theyre 30 year bonds, i thought they were 20, and could cash most of them, but alas. According to the National Treasury's bond calculator on their website, theyre all over their face value by a couple dollars. I have some questions about them.

1. Should i really bother waiting 8 years to cash these things if theyre already over their face value? I dont necessarily want to cash them now, but could I wait a few years and cash them then? I could probably use them towards a security deposit an apartment or something. 

2. How do you even cash them to begin with?

Edit: more info: Okay so i looked into the link u/m300300 posted. They have variable interest rates, so the original interest rates were close to 6%, but is now in the 2-3% range.

personalfinance,SEP IRA contribution if...I might be forced to leanfire next year?,"Hello,

Have been a lurker/longer than poster so not sure if its legit to post twice.

This already appeared in r/leanfire ... and a comment was made to try r/taxes... but it is closed for season.

The context is an unplanned/unwanted LeanFire retirement.

I applied for an extension on 2018 taxes. I have until Oct to contribute to SEP IRA for 2018. But need advice because not clear at all whether I'll find work next year. 

I'm self employed. I've lost major clients. This year so far I've only made $20K this year, I'm pitching for new work/while cutting costs/and living off my cash savings.

My accountant is not really helpful because he can't quite believe I am coming down so low financially. Here's what he said;

""Currently I am showing a refund of $1,895 for federal and refund of $1,514 for CA. You are in a 22% federal tax bracket and a 9.3% for CA. You can contribute up to $13,782 to your SEP for 2018; if you contributed the maximum amount, your federal refund would be $4,275 and the state refund would be $2,741 for a total increase of $3,607 or a 26.17% tax savings. The reason why the savings is not 31% is caused by the 20% QBI deduction that you get for your business income; the SEP reduces the Qualified Business Income deduction calculation.""

I'll be 59.5 next year. So if I've got no work next year, I can take that money out -- but I'll have lost part of my QBI deduction forever. 

On other hand, if I do find work, that money can stay and grow a year or two until I need it to make up my living expenses or my MAGI. 

My guess is 70/30 I am without work next year. So its a gamble. Take a deduction now?

I've mapped out my leanfire plan to age 67, aiming for $48 after tax, and calculating mix of  (a) annuity (b) tax differed withdrawals (c) cash to get there.

Combination of income/cash  will ensure that I'll have MAGI that is low enough/high enough to be eligible for minor subsidy if ACA continues ... and maybe stay in lowest fed tax bracket (&lt;$38K)  

My gut is....I just keep the$13K in cash.  Until I read everything over and my gut says...take the deduction.

Advice very much appreciated !!",finance

personalfinance,Need some advice on whether I should pull the trigger on taking out a personal loan to consolidate my credit card debt...,"Hello, (32 M) since the beginning of 2019 I made the decision to finally eliminate my credit card as well as other miscellaneous debts (loans from friends, parking tickets, business loans, backed up utility bills, etc) once and for all. In total it was 16k as i write this today I've gotten it down to $5,000. The remainder of my debt is now with 4 credit cards and a loan from PayPal. I am eager to pay these last remaining debts off as well as boost up my credit score.

I must admit I've been blindly just putting as much money as i can towards my credit cards with out taking a hard look at the interest being charged I finally looked over the numbers and i noticed that on the 4 credit cards including the paypal loan the interest ranges from 26% - 36% (Killer i know). So thats when the thought of consolidating my debt came to mind, after doing some research and inquiring on some offers I qualify for a $10,000 Personal Loan from ""BEST EGG"".

The details goes as follows for a $10,000 loan they will charge me a $500 origination fee so the loan comes out to $9,500 the interest month to month is 18.75% (Considerably lower then what i'm paying now) The loan is good for 3 years but i can pay it in advance with no penalties.

Now as a newbie trying to build my credit as well as clear up my debts I would like some advice on whether i should go down this path. I've been extremely responsible with paying down my debt and i truly feel i can have all the cards paid in full by end of September latest October of this year. I'm not sure if its fear thats making me question if i should do it or not.

Some questions i have is .... Does it make sense to borrow that $10,000 for the $500 origination fee? Would I ultimately be saving money by taking this personal loan and reducing my interest rate? Is this is a good idea to help boost my credit score by not only paying off my cards but as well as this personal loan in a short amount of time?

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

personalfinance,Looking to change to an IDR student loan plan and need some advice.,"Hi everyone, 

I feel like I‚Äôm in a different spot than a lot of people in that I make 6 figures, but my debt is larger than my yearly salary. I‚Äôm trying to make the most of my situation and have some questions for all of you. I work in healthcare and so my salary likely won‚Äôt increase a lot from where it currently is. Here is my predicament with my student loans:

Total Student Loans: $225k
Gross Salary: $149k
AGI: $147,010
Current monthly payment: $1487 (25 year fixed)
Estimated IDR (PAYE) payment: $1070
Currently made 21 months of payments
Some loans (grad-plus) have interest rates at and around 8%
My rent is $1300/month as I live in a city. I know in theory I should bring this down, but it‚Äôs not a plausible idea a the moment. 
Other than rent and utilities, I have no other outstanding debt. No car payment. No credit card debt. 

Currently single but will be married soon. 
My goal is to buy a house as soon as possible. Sure I could be paying my student loans off faster, absolutely, but that would leave me with a minimal chance of saving for a house. I already have $30k saved up, but in my area I need about $100k for a 20% down payment. 

Many people around me laugh because they can‚Äôt understand how at my salary I don‚Äôt already have a 5 bedroom home, but they don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs nearly impossible in the current market and with my incredibly high loans. 

I don‚Äôt spend a lot of money, I‚Äôm much more likely to save. I don‚Äôt drive around in a fancy car, I‚Äôm still driving my same old hoopty from when I was in school. 

The way I see it, if I switch to the PAYE plan, I‚Äôm saving almost an extra $5k a year (straight towards my house savings) the other benefit is that if I switch to an IDR, my loans will be forgiven at the 20 year mark, as opposed paid off at the 25 year mark. 


My questions,


1. In your opinion, should I switch to PAYE?


2. Do my previous 21 months of payments count 
towards to 240 needed for forgiveness?


3. What happens if one year I happen to forget to recertify?


4. At the 20 year mark, do I have to pay taxes on what is forgiven?



With the way things are going I can only dream about Bernie becoming president and forgiving my student loans.  Thanks in advance for reading and for all your responses!!


Edit: I of my $225k in loans, 50k is grad plus taken out after July 2014, which is just learned means it‚Äôs 25 years for forgiveness on those. 

5. Would be loans taken out before 2014 be forgiven at 20 years, and then my loans after 2014 be forgiven at 25?",finance

investing,"Reuters: Share buyback juggernaut to roll on, oiled by bond yield collapse","This article was published about 5 days ago:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stocks-buybacks/share-buyback-juggernaut-to-roll-on-oiled-by-bond-yield-collapse-idUSKCN1UV0V9

&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - Relentlessly falling borrowing costs worldwide may be setting the stage for a further squeeze in global equity supply, with signs that more companies, especially in Japan and Europe, will exploit the cheap money wave to buy back shares. 

&gt; Rock-bottom borrowing costs in the decade after the global financial crisis have already played a role in draining the world of investable equity through share buybacks, mergers and acquisitions and de-listings.

&gt; With not enough shares issued to offset those withdrawn from circulation, equity supply has shrunk steadily, one reason for record share gains in recent years - especially in the United States, where 80% of firms are estimated to conduct buybacks. 

&gt; The buyback boom is one side-effect of rock-bottom interest rates. And with central banks again in rate-cutting mode, the trend could get a fresh lease of life.

&gt; U.S. buybacks have lost some momentum, perhaps as the impact of massive tax cuts fades. New stock buybacks averaged just $2.8 billion daily in the last three weeks, according to Trim Tabs Research, the second-lowest volume in the past eight earnings seasons. The number of announcements stood at 3.1, the lowest in the past eight earnings seasons.

&gt; Instead, it‚Äôs Europe that‚Äôs ripe for a buyback wave, analysts say. 

&gt; With German benchmark bond yields, the main reference rate for euro debt - crumbling more than 70 basis points this year to around minus 0.5% - corporate borrowing costs have collapsed by two-thirds .IBBEU003D, offering companies a unique opportunity to embrace the buyback culture.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt is attractive for European companies to issue debt or take out bank loans for buybacks and they could have been doing it for years. It‚Äôs similar in Japan, they have been enjoying zero interest rates for even longer,‚Äù Panigirtzoglou said.

&gt; In fact, net European buybacks amounted to $100 billion in the past year, Morgan Stanley calculates, a record high run-rate, even if dwarfed by last year‚Äôs roughly $800 billion U.S. tally.

&gt; Morgan Stanley advised European firms to cut dividends and conduct buybacks instead.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe much lower level of corporate bond yields should provide for a decent ‚Äòrefinancing bonus‚Äô as companies swap out their old debt and re-issue new bonds at today‚Äôs very low yield levels,‚Äù it said.

&gt; There are also signs that Japanese firms, notoriously stingy with buybacks, are joining the party: Buybacks hit a record 6.5 trillion yen-plus ($59.8 billion) in the fiscal year to April 1 2019 and Goldman Sachs predicts a further 20 percent increase in the year to April 2020.

&gt; The reason buybacks have been historically less popular in Europe and Japan is that shareholders have tended to prefer dividend income. Despite last year‚Äôs buyback surge in Europe shareholders earned 80% of their cash returns from dividends, according to Morgan Stanley. 

I would recommend checking out the graphs in the article itself to show the buyback trends in Europe and Japan",finance
personalfinance,What are my current options towards investing for retirement?,"Canadian here looking for some advice/guidance. I bring home $50 000 a year working full time at a stable job. I live with my mum. She owns a condo and owes $250 000 (underwater mortgage) on it. I've been helping her to become debt free except for the condo. She still has $21 000 (plus the continuous interest rates adding onto the total) that we're working on eliminating.

I'm wondering what the best route would be for me after her debt is gone. I need to plan for retirement and either start paying off the condo or start renting somewhere. I can't afford a down payment on my own house currently. No clue how we would ever pay off the condo... the mum is working 2 jobs with sort of conflicting hours so it ends up being maybe 5 hours at one job and 7 hours at another job per day. We did a budget and are able to contribute $1350 each month to debt after all monthly costs (condo, utilities, food, insurance etc) with a combined average income of $5600 per month. 

It will take us 15.5 months to pay off her debt - more with the interest that gets added on so maybe up to 18 months.

It will take us 15.4 years to pay off the condo - much longer with the interest each month.

With the projections above, that leaves neither of us any room to contribute to any investments which obviously isn't realistic. Emergencies and extra costs such as vehicle and house repairs would obviously extend these time-frames.

 I do contribute to a pension plan at work but it doesn't sound like it pays out much at all at age 65. I'm 32 right now. I also have an RSP account through work. I have $55 000 to my name in investments including a diversified e-series index portfolio (TD Bank), a tax free savings account (liquid funds for emergencies) and a locked in stepper account that matures next year, at which point I'll add those funds to my index portfolio.

I just feel trapped without any wiggle room and I've been really worried about my retirement plan and my future. I'm debt free myself, no vehicle payments or credit card debts.

By direct observation of selling or buying in the indexes, and volume of shares traded, one can very accurately ascertain market direction."" In other words, it's a lot of bull.


If you feel like you can pull it off, you do you. But most people don't have the time, energy, or background to pull it off. TSP doesn't even allow instant trading so one can't take full advantage of trends. It's all about time in the market, not timing the market.


To prove my point, I've pulled all of the Fed Trader's adjustments from his site (available from Nov 2012 forward), pulled fund prices from TSP, and calculated a couple scenarios from Nov 2012 to now. They are as follows:

2) Starting with $10,000, you following the Fed Trader's recommendations.


3) Starting with $10,000, you spread it between the C (60%), S (20%), and I (20%) funds and let it sit.


You can see part of my calculations [here](https://imgur.com/a/KW74hb8). But to summarize:


L2050 ended with $19,518.91, a gain of 95%.


Fed Trader ended with $13,465.19, a gain of 35%


Investing in multiple funds ended with $22,321.03, a gain of 123%


The Fed Trader spent most of his time in the G fund trying to avoid losses when they already started. Then he would jump onto gains too late. Rinse and repeat and you have subpar gains over a 6 year period. Buy and hold, time in the market, whatever you want to call it, it works. Simple. Even the L funds have better returns.


Again, if you feel like you can pull off trend chasing, you do you. Otherwise, take the more solid approach to retirement.",finance

She advised me against that and told me it would be better to decrease my PLUS loan amount; she did not give me a reason and her explanation was lacking.

personalfinance,Quickly paying off student Loans with 0% intro APR Credit Cards,"I'm pretty sure my plan should work, but looking for additional feedback before starting card applications, to mitigate some of the risk. Originally posted something similar in a r/churning thread, but figured I may get some great advice here so I'm re-formatting to focus less on credit card details. 

Recent college grad with ~ $70k in student loan debt. About $40k of those loans are private loans, at a stupid high interest rate, around 8.5%. I saw the debt coming and worked hard, lining up a job before I graduated. I start in Sept. making $76k a year gross, ~$56k net after tax/health insurance/401k match. Living at home with very minimal expenses, so I have a high amount of disposable income to be able to pay off 100% of the garbage loans + their interest within the first 12 months of starting work. I haven't finalized my budget, but I'm planning on paying off ~$3,333 per month on my garbage loans with minimum payment on the gov't ones at 4-5%. 

**Here's my plan**: utilize Plastiq (/maybe gift of college?) to make loan payments in order to accomplish two things:

1) Get some decent credit card signup rewards to increase non-loan disposable income that I don't feel guilty about spending.  

2) Utilize 0% intro APR credit cards to essentially ""hold"" the last $X,XXX of my loans in place without them accruing interest until I'm ready to pay them. 


**Factors I'm aware of:**

* Avoiding high velocity in applying for credit cards. 

* Avoiding full utilization of my credit limit before applying for my last card, Amex BBP, otherwise probably denied. 

* This will probably trash my credit due to maxing my credit utilization, but I do not see any financing in my near future (buying a used car outright with cash, not buying a home any time soon), for at least 5 years until I go back to grad school.

* Should I lose my job for some reason I could be potentially screwed, so there is some risk involved, but w/ my major + resume, bar any medical or personal emergency I should be able to find employment again quickly. 
 
**Factors/Questions I'm unaware of:**

* Does this sound feasible from a payment perspective? Will I get screwed trying to do this? Is there any reason I shouldn't do this?

* Are there factors related to 0% intro APR that will make this a negative investment?

* Is there an upper limit for this? I care very little about my credit score right now since after 3 years my loans will be paid off in full and I should be very financially secure.

personalfinance,First time home buyer and not sure which mortgage option to pick.,"Hi All,

I'm about to lock in a rate for mortgage. House price is 620K

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1:**
I could put 20% down $(124,000) and my interest rate will be 3.85%

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2:**
Or I can put down 21.879% $(135,650) and my interest rate will be 3.5%

&amp;nbsp;

The difference in mortgage payment between Option 1 and Option 2 is that Option 2 will cost $105.12 cheaper per month. (Will take ~9 years before I break even) Also not sure how long it will be that I will live in the house because the schools, while they aren't terrible, aren't great either. (No kids yet either)

&amp;nbsp;

If I go with Option 1, I will have an extra $11,650 cash on hand to invest in the market.

I'm not strapped for cash but I'm not swimming in it either.

Not sure what to pick.

personalfinance,Next Steps? First post - I'd love your feedback!,"Hi PF! 

This is my first ever Reddit post. I've been lurking here for 3+ years. I appreciate this sub, you contributors, and the additional resources you have pointed me to. I'm learning all this PF stuff on my own as I don't have any positive financial role models or mentors in my life. I'll explain where I'm at so far and hopefully you can advise me on things I'm missing or should factor in.

I'm 31 years old living in a moderately HCOL area (Portland, OR).

I've been self employed the past 5 years ever since I quit my full time job and became a freelance contractor. I love what I get to do. Each year I have grown my business with a consistently booked schedule, billing more for my labor, and more equipment purchases that I am able to rent. 

2016: Total Income $70K, AGI $60K, Taxable Income $48K.

2017: Total Income $80K, AGI $68K, Taxable Income $56K.

2018: Total Income $110K, AGI $88K, Taxable Income $63K.

For 2019 I became a single member LLC electing S-Corp taxation instead of a Sole Proprietor. I am on track for my total income to be around $130K+ for 2019, and expect my taxable income to be lower % than previous years. My business pays myself a salary of $50K, and the rest of the business income I take as distributions. I pay myself $2K post tax twice a month. I pay federal and states taxes by the 15th of each month. I don't intend to have additional employees in the future (unless there are advantages for my soon to be wife). 90% of my income is 1099, the other 10% is as a W-2 employee for other businesses. I hope in the next 4 years to be able to purchase/finance $100K in equipment that would be a significant investment in future rental revenue. I currently own $40K in equipment that I rent and insure ($2K annual business policy, includes general liability). I understand that my line of work is also tied to the economy, and would expect my income to decline with a recession.

I'm about to marry my long time partner (30F). We plan to file jointly for 2019, unless our CPA advises us not to when we meet later this year. She makes $60K as a freelancer in the same industry (video editor), 50/50 1099 &amp; W-2 income. We want to have a child in the next 4-5 years.

We currently rent in a convenient location that's 10 min from downtown for $1660/month. I'm able to legitimately write off $2K as a home office. We split home expenses 50/50. My partner and I really like our rental and are comfortable living here for now but in the next 4-5 years we want to buy a house or ideally buy 1-2 acres and build a 3br 2ba home. I'm estimating roughly $500K to buy but figure we need to save even more if we want to build. I want to have 20% down payment saved with additional $50K banked in E-Fund. We are willing to deal with the commute and live up to an hour from the city if we can build. My work is never in the same location and has me driving to a different location for each project anyways. Is waiting that long to buy/build a house a mistake? Should we try to do it sooner even if we don't have the 20%?

Local Credit Union Business Checking: $4K

Local Credit Union Business Savings: $2K

Local Credit Union Personal Checking: $2K

Local Credit Union Personal Savings: $2K

2% CapitalOne HYSA: $25K (This is my Emergency Fund. 4 months of expenses, more if I stopped retirement contributions. Hope to get this up to 12 months one day).

Vanguard Traditional IRA: $12K (target retirement 2055 funds. I started this account 3 years ago when I started taking retirement seriously).

Vanguard SEP IRA: $22K (target retirement 2055 funds. I started this account last year and contributed to it instead of the traditional so I could contribute more each year. I've put in $10K so far this year. I'll either add $2.5K more for max contribution limit or instead start a Solo 401K so I can contribute even more for 2019 and beyond. I don't know much about Solo 401K options yet, would love tips or resources.)

I have both a personal and business credit card that I pay off every two weeks and never carry a balance. My credit score is 800, partner's is 820.

No debt except $2K remaining on a used car loan (2.3% interest, 6 months of payments left). Car is in great shape and has another 6+ years, $80K miles . I use it for my business and write off mileage. Eventually I want my business to buy a small commercial van, hopefully in 5+ years there will be an electric option.

We just started saving for our honeymoon in late 2020. We'll take a month off to travel to NZ. We have $2.5K saved so far for this trip. We want to save at least $10K.

My Grandmother#1 recently passed and I will be inheriting $50K in 3-6 months. If inheritance doesn't arrive by end of year I will borrow from my E-Fund and contribute before end of year. I want to open an Oregon First Time Home Buyers Savings Account that let's my partner and I contribute up to $10K jointly each year and write off from our state taxes, as long as funds are used for a home purchase/build within 10 years. I want to put $10K into that account for 2019. I want to contribute roughly $10K to max out what I'm able to contribute to solo401K for 2019. Once I receive the inheritance I want to take the remainder $30K and start a Vanguard Three Fund portfolio (roughly 60/30/10). Not sure if these should be ETF or mutual funds. Is this a mistake before an economic slowdown?

My partner has 20K in Vanguard Roth IRA and 50K in mutual funds (inheritance from Grandparent).

I have an Education Trust Fund with SunTrust that my other Grandmother#2 setup when I was born. I didn't go to college so never touched these funds. It is now at $260K. I don't have control of the trust until I'm 35 (4 years) but I hope to be in a position where I don't feel I need to touch it and can continue to let it compound. When Grandmother#2 passes I will receive \~$250K in inheritance, possibly gifted distributions before then.

After we get married later this month we have a meeting with an insurance broker to help consolidate. We both get our health insurance through the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace (crappy high deductible plans for emergency coverage), which is a write off for self employed. Should we consider a High Deductible Health Savings Account plan instead so we can contribute \~$7K jointly per year? I also want to consider short term disability insurance since both of us are self employed, no sick days. Once we have a child I want to get (term?) life insurance, should I consider doing this beforehand?

I'd appreciate any tips or things to look out for. Am I missing anything I could be doing better? I'm still fuzzy on goals for the future, timelines, or how it's all going to come together, but I've been trying to get myself pointed in the right direction and make good choices today.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Strategy for shifting debt to lower APR card?,"Seeking opinions on this:

I'm not suggesting this as a strategy, but I was thinking about this tonight.

Let's say I have accumulated a bunch of debt on several cards of varying interest rates. I'm ready to start paying them down and would like to pay the least amount of interest possible.

The debt is disproportionately allocated to the higher interest rate card and I am unlikely to be approved for a 0% balance transfer card.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

investing,Hedging against higher mortgage rates,"Hi everyone!
My wife and I are living in Switzerland and are considering buying an apartment. Real estate is crazy expensive because the system is designed in such a way that you never pay back more than 34% of your mortgage (I mean, you can but you don't have to and it doesn't make sense for fiscal reasons). 

Mortgage rates are very very low at the moment: we are talking less than 1% a year for a fix 10 years mortgage. The ""interest only"" system is therefore very attractive: if your mortgage is 1.2 million, with 1% interest, then you are only paying 1000 a month.

My issue is: what happens after 10 years, at the end of the mortgage contract? Let's assume that rates go back to a more normal level, let's say 3%. Since the mortgage is not amortized, the monthly payments increase by a factor 3, which would make refinancing difficult. In addition if we take a longer mortgage, let's say 25 years at 1.5%, I don't really trust the bank to uphold the contract if 10 years from now, rates are at 3-4%: they will use every opportunity in the contract to call back the mortgage. So I want to be ready for higher interest rates, as if the mortgage was with variable interest rates. Which leads to my question:

**What is the best way to hedge against potential higher mortgage rates in the future?**

I am willing to lose a little money every year for ""insurance"" if in the case of a high increase in interest rate, I win big (big enough to compensate the much higher mortgage payments). Should I simply buy puts on a swiss bonds ETF? Is there a better option (no pun intended)?

Thanks for your feedback!",finance

The company just the signing of a letter of intent to acquire a west coast based audio company focused on creating innovative products that provide fundamental tools used for building notification systems.

According to the release, the proposed acquisition is for a combination of cash and stock. The target company generated approximately $4 million in revenue through the twelve month period ending June 30, 2019. The targets products and services allow institutions access to intercom, scheduling and notification systems they use every day with improved ease of use. It provides an open architecture solution which allows its products to be used in many existing and new environments. Intercom, PA, Bell and control solutions are easily added and integrated with its first to market open architecture design and current software model. Its products combine elements not normally found together over a common IP network, which minimizes infrastructure requirements and reduces costs by combining systems. This strategy also places it at the forefront of school safety and communication.

Gary LeCroy, Galaxys Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are excited to add innovative audio technology to our product suite, as it is something that our end customers, especially in the K-12 market segment have been demanding. This is evident by their strong revenue growth in the first half of 2019. We believe this is the first company to provide an open architecture solution that allows existing components to be used and to look beyond the space of intercom to extend capabilities of the system for other applications. The proposed acquisition also has 4 patents pending and expands our geographical footprint to the west coast. We are looking forward to advancing this transaction to the definitive stage and expect to close by the end of September.

Galaxy does not control where resellers focus their resell efforts, although generally, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products ‚Äì comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy‚Äôs sales.

The company boasts a strong team, including its COO, who spent the majority of her young career at Mimio/Boxlight (NASDAQ:BOXL), a leader in the ed-tech and interactive display market. She performed many jobs at Mimio including, sales, federal programs director, and regional management.

With a tiny float of just 1.5 million shares, GAXY is sitting in a strong pattern with a recent hold of a key trendline and a number of clear support levels. That may demonstrate strong accumulation present under the surface of the tape.¬†

Due to a wedding and honeymoon from last year we were put into a considerable amount of debt on our credit cards. It's gotten to the point where we feel like we've hit a wall and are looking at our options.

What I feel is hurting us is the interest on the cards. I've been Thinking of pulling out a loan and consolidating the debt with a lower interest rate. Currently we still make more then we owe, but not by much. We've started to budget, and cut out unnecessary spending so that helps. I'm also free to pick up as much overtime as I want so that's also a plus.

Anyway. We currently owe $25k.
We make a combined income of $84k
The interest on both cards add up to 35.98%

Would it be a good idea to open a loan to consolidate the debt? Are there any other options that would be better for us? Thank you in advanced for the help!",finance

investing,"Why BND/Total Bond Funds aren't as ""safe"" as r/Investing may suggest","My gloomy market outlook has me in a large allocation of bond funds/cash which I feel many investors fail to see the complexity of.

BND/VBTLX, Vanguard's total bond market fund, is highly recommended and I see it in many portfolios. This is in place of what I believe to be superior Intermediate or Long term Treasury funds. I don't think this is a wise choice in our current market and future markets. Factors are the historically low gap between investment and junk bond yields, extremely high overall levels of corporate debt, the usage of said debt in share buyback vs. investment, and the dovish Fed and international banks driving negative yields. Also I think the ratings agencies and industry are making similar mistakes as in 2008 but that's more of a ""hot take"".

I have my doubts about the value of the 36% Corporate bond allocation in BND. Specifically due to the 17.5% allocation to Baa/BBB which is the minimum rating before being labeled non-investment aka Junk bonds. I'd advise you research yourself, but a good start is [this January opinion piece](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/60798C96-1297-11E9-BDC3-ED774D018C33). A key takeaway is: ""... according to Morgan Stanley, the U.S. has been flooded with BBB-rated bonds. In the past 10 years, the triple-B bond market has exploded from $686 billion to $2.5 trillion, an all-time high. In other words, 50% of the investment-grade bond market now sits on the lowest rung of the investment-grade ladder.""

This is a story we've heard too often. Bond issuers choose who gets to rate their bonds and pay them for the service. There is incredible incentive to keep new issues at or above Baa/BBB because they qualify for investment grade bond funds and indexes. In addition we label lesser ratings as ""Junk"" so a company losing rating literally ""goes to Junk"" as a news headline. Any future issues are ""Company issues 50MM in Junk"". If you have faith in the credit rating agencies you still have to look at your return for choosing these near-junk bonds vs. US treasuries.

* VBTLX aka BND (6yr avg duration) yielded a 3mo average 2.84% with 2.77% last month. 
* VFITX (5.3yr avg duration treasuries only) yielded a 3mo average 2.59% with 2.28% last month. 
* VUSTX (17.4yr avg duration treasuries only) yielded a 3mo average 2.75% with 2.58% last month.

A direct comparison between intermediate funds shows an increasing gap currently at .49%. For the risk of adding 36% corporate bonds (half are almost junk) this premium seems way too low. [A 2008 law showed Baa/BBB defaulting in average between 4.5% by Moody's and 10% by S&amp;P](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating#Investment_grade). Actual default rates fluctuate with economic cycles. But you're taking a lot of default and credit risk for that extra .49% (~$5/yr per $1,000) when corporate debt is at all time highs due to basement level rates.

If you do choose to remove the corporate bonds your principal is now subject to full exposure to treasury interest rate changes. In the current environment of dropping rates, a dovish Fed, negative international rates, and a looming downturn I see this as a benefit for capital appreciation. 

Bond values move opposite 1% per year of duration for every 1% move in rates. Specific example: if the rate dropped from 1.75% to 1% on a 30yr treasury. Existing bonds with 10yrs to mature would appreciate by 10x.75 or 7.5%. If your bond had 20 years you'd appreciate 15%. If that rate then rises .25% you would depreciate 2.5% vs 5%. In plain talk the long term vanguard funds is three times as vulnerable to rate changes vs the intermediate fund. 

It's up to you to decide if you want to concentrate instead of diversify your bond holdings. For the conservative outlook, buy and hold investor I'd suggest moving into a medium term treasury fund until corporate debt crashes or starts to pay a higher premium. If you want to keep that defensive equities exposure then take some of the 17%-34% that was in corporate bonds and invest into value/dividend focused funds like VIG/NOBL. 

Personally I'm headed to a 50/50 split of my bond portfolio between medium and long term treasuries. #beargang üêªüêªüêª",finance
personalfinance,Should I use my Federal Loan Disbursement to pay off my Private Loans?,"Hello, 

I recently began a Graduate Certificate program from a local university after I had graduated from my undergrad. This Fall semester, I have had about $8200 in Federal Loans Disbursed (6% interest rate), of which I will only use about $3300 for the semester's expenses. I called up my Financial Aid Office to ask about what would happen with the excess, and they had replied that it was mine to keep as it had been disbursed. I had asked them if I was allowed to use that excess money to pay off my existing undergraduate loans and they said I was able too.

I have about $18000 total in four Private Loans currently ranging from 8.625% to 10.5% interest, with additional Federal Loans of $16000 at about 5% interest rate. It seems like a no-brainer to use the excess at a 6% interest rate to pay off my high interest rate Private Loans, but I can't help but feel there is some sort of catch somewhere. Is there some downsides I'm not seeing here?

Additionally, I had read in r/investing that as Federal Interest rates go down, it would be a good idea to consider refinancing loans. Is this another avenue I should look into?

For reference: Currently live at home, make $14000 per year, of which $8200 goes towards paying off my loans. FICO score of 752, $6200 in personal savings, no other debits",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay down my loans during graduate school or start investing?,"I did some searching and couldn't find this question in the past, so I figured I'd ask.

I'm lucky enough to be a graduate student in a funded PhD program at a well known university with an extremely high conversion rate into well-paid careers (the MS level of my degree averages an income of $90K-$120K upon completion of the two year program). The stipend is relatively low, considering it's in an extremely high cost-of-living metropolitan area, but we're encouraged to pursue internships during the summers, which can be financially lucrative.

I have about $44K in undergraduate loans, split between subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. I have no outstanding private loans. Over the course of my internship I'll have around $10K in savings that I'm trying to decide what to do with. In general, I can live frugally off of the living stipend provided by the university, and slowly accumulate savings, but it's nowhere near the level of income I'm making at this internship.

My gut instinct is to save enough for a 2-month emergency fund, and dump the rest into loans, but I wasn't sure if that makes sense considering after graduating in 4 years, I'll be able to invest a significantly larger amount of money into my loans at a much smaller proportion of my income.

I'm considering investing into quality-of-life improvements (bike pedals and rain pants since I'm a bike commuter, a better ergonomic office chair and monitor, since almost all of my work is done on a computer), but I know lifestyle inflation at a higher income level is something to be wary of.

One thing I wanted to look into, as well, was investing, and calculating if my annual ROI would be comparable to my annual interest on my loans.

I applied for a personal loan through USAA to see what the interest rate would be, and they approved me for enough to pay off all the cards at a 16% interest rate, which would save me a decent chunk of money off what I'm paying now.

I am going to be getting married this October, so I‚Äôm currently researching buying a house. The fianc√© and I have agreed we will likely get a 6-12 month rental lease first, so we have time. I‚Äôm just the type that wants to start the research now. This is going to be a bit scatterbrained. Still trying to map out my thinking‚Ä¶ Sorry in advance.
Just found out my fiances credit score is shitball. A hair over 600. 34k in student loan debt she hasn‚Äôt paid anything on since, based on her current income, she doesn‚Äôt need to. So the interest keeps growing and that‚Äôs another mountain to climb later‚Ä¶


My main thing now is how to proceed with that information. My credit score is a bit over 750, so I don‚Äôt foresee problems with getting a loan when that time comes. By myself I imagine I could get a better APR, but a smaller maximum. With her on the paperwork I imagine the maximum would increase but so would the APR. Please correct or validate my understanding here. How else might that her low credit score negatively impact the process of buying a house?


We have already talked about getting her credit score back up. Got her credit limit doubled, advised to make at least 2 payments a month, minimize credit utilization, advised to contact student loan folks and see if she can pay like 10 bucks a month just so there is a payment, and am planning to add her as an authorized user to my credit card (but not give her a card until we are married). 


She thinks she is also a party to a credit card her brother has but isn‚Äôt sure. If so, evidently that was done a while back to help her credit. I‚Äôm obviously not comfortable with that arrangement, so I told her to find out for sure and get her name removed if she is on it. That‚Äôs the right move, right? Sounds like he might‚Äôve done for her what I am trying to do now‚Ä¶help her credit score with my responsible spending habits and not give her a cc to even use. She can have one when we are married though lol. I just don‚Äôt know the dude very well and if he messes up, that‚Äôd negatively impact her too.


So about those student loans‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to get the terms of the loan from her. I know they are federal loans and are currently sitting at about 34k. She makes ~13/hr and has ~1500 in savings, so she‚Äôs in a shitty enough position that she doesn‚Äôt have to pay on them right now. Since I left my corporate job last year, I only make slightly more than her but have no debt and roughly 20k spread between checking account, taxable investment account, and my roth IRA. How might our legal union affect those loans? I know I'm not legally responsible for her student debt incurred before marriage, but I suspect if we file jointly, there could be issues since household income would more than double.


I haven‚Äôt researched ch 7 or 13 bankruptcy much, but I am wondering if that might not be a viable option as long as it‚Äôs done prior to the marriage. I know it‚Äôd shit on her credit score, but she could definitely make the hardship argument to have a chance of getting out of the 34k debt. My understanding is that the student loan debt is the only debt she has. Credit card is paid off monthly. I doubt bankruptcy is the answer, but frankly debt scares me. Just exploring options. Based on what I‚Äôve detailed so far, what‚Äôre your thoughts on declaring bankruptcy? Worth looking into or no?


 I don't like the idea of bankruptcy and doubt it's a good option if the goal is just to escape student loans. I'm thinking the best solution is to contact loan people and start paying something, anything. What should I look into? Next steps?

I just learned all of this yesterday. I am not happy about it at all. I don‚Äôt think she was trying to hide it from me‚Äîshe‚Äôs just financially illiterate and doesn‚Äôt think about the problems much because they‚Äôre overwhelming.

Ripple,Putting a few things together XRP,"Recently president Trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin both said they are not fans of Libra, Bitcoin and other cryptos. 
This makes sense in regards to anything that threatens the U.S.$ but there is one cryptocurrency - that many in the cryptosphere have droned on about not being an actual cryptocurrency for years - XRP.

From almost the beginning there's been virtually non stop FUD directed at XRP for this reason. Mostly the claim is XRP is not decentralized, or its the bankers coin, premined and so on. 
Maybe these claims are true, or maybe not but looking at the entire cryptomarket in terms of which one or combination of a few will enhance the U.S.$ on the world stage? 
The answer is clear XRP and Ripple tech. If anyone thinks the U.S. is behind in terms of finding the best solution(s) to remain the #1 world reserve currency and isnt already aware of the advantages the blockchain provides im not sure what to tell ya. 

Ofcourse there are other arguments such as what will the replacement for the U.S.$ look like when it does come, but we are probably a decade(s) or more away from that so in the meantime my bet is on the crypto that is already moving U.S.$ FAR more efficiently than other options. Need proof? Xrapid-Moneygram and other financial institutions that are signed.
Also interesting that during mr. Mnuchins conference on the matter he was more or less anti-Libra/Btc and out of all the companies he could have mentioned in a positive light he mentioned Moneygram. A company that a number of days before signed with Ripple. Considering there are competitors of Moneygram that are more visable / profitable and he still chose to mention Moneygram is in my opinion a little hint....
Everyone here is aware Ripple is already connected to Fed faster payments and the vast number of other connections - matter of time until something much bigger comes to light.

personalfinance,Refinance? No closing cost refinance options. Month,"Advice, please?

Found a solid opportunity to refinance our mortgage. It'll cost nothing out of pocket, save us between .5-.875% (pending 15 or 20-year term), and shave either 8-13 years on our current 30-year).

We are not sure how long we will be here and when the time comes for us to move if we will sell or keep it as a rental. If we do the 20-year our payments basically stay the same, except we eliminate PMI and shave a few years off. If we do the 15-year, our interest rate is lower but we have to pay a couple hundred more per month.

I am debating between the financial flexibility of the 20-year and the earlier pay and reduced interest rate of the 15-year. Either option is good but if we end up renting it in the future it'd be nice to have the increased ability to cash flow. Is there a downside to a 15-year opposed to a 20-year when it comes to selling down the road?

I really would like to pay the house off sooner rather than later but we are still doing a lot of investing into renovations so the additional money from refinancing into another 30/year at a lower rate would be really nice and allow us to invest some of those funds into home renovations; however, if I get the 30-year at the lower rate I would go hard on principal payments to ideally have it paid off in no more than 15-20 years.

This will be our first time doing any kind of refinancing. Anyone have any light to shed on the matter? Things that perhaps I should consider that I am not?

**Option One:** (*Stay the same - I don't see any benefit to this*)

30/yr @ 4.375% | Monthly P&amp;I = $943.65 | Total P&amp;I = $339,714

**Option Two:** *Lowered payment now for home renovations; maybe reinvest the $1,800/annually into an IRA? Possibly pay off in 15-20 years)*

30yr @ 3.875% | Monthly P&amp;I = $789 | Total Interest/Principal = $284,040

**Option Three:** *(roughly the same monthly with shorter term &amp; lower interest rate)*

20yr @ 3.875% |Monthly P&amp;I = $1,005 | Total P&amp;I = $241,200

**Option Four:** *(less financial flexibility month-to-month but pay off much faster and less overall interest)*

15yr @ 3.5% | Montly P&amp;I = $1,199 | Total P&amp;I = $215,820

personalfinance,OK to make estimated quarterly Fed. income tax payment to IRS in Q3 only?,"Just used IRS's W-4 calculator and saw that I'll owe like $11K in taxes. My W-4 for the entire year has had allowance set to 0, so not sure why I'll owe so much. Maybe because I'm in high income tax bracket and bonuses are withheld at a rate lower than my income tax bracket.

I want to only owe about $6K in taxes, because that way I'd meet the safe harbor rule so no tax penalty. Is it okay if I make a $5K estimated quarterly payment today (Q3), and not pay any quarterly estimated tax in Q4? I didn't pay quarterly estimated tax in Q1 or Q2 this year.

I've never paid quarterly estimated taxes before, so I'm not sure if IRS will be suspicious if I only make 1 quarterly payment during the entire year. Almost all my income is from W-2. I will only have about $2K income as a sole proprietor this year. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Do student loans or credit card debt take precedence?,"I tried looking for a similar post that had been answered with no luck, please link if there is one.

I graduated with my bachelor's in December with ~$26K loans (federal, both sub and unsub). I am currently taking graduate classes for free through my workplace which still lets me defer my payment. I know that I should have been/ should be paying unsub but I didn't have the money. 

I also had a hard time in 2018, not working at my off-campus job, working an unpaid internship half an hour from home 4 days a week, and my work study paying off my tuition. This led to $3500 in credit card debt, which I have brought down to about $2800. However, the card closed due to late payments. (I have also gotten my credit score up significantly).

I hope to buy a home in a few years but would like to diminish my current debt. I have a gross income of $50k starting May of this year. 

Is credit card debt more important, or student loans? Or should I equally contribute to all 3?

Note: I know I made a mistake with my cc, please don't lecture me about that.

personalfinance,Made horrible financial decisions in my early 20's and now I need some serious help.,"So, I've gotten to the point that I really don't know the best course of action to take with regard to my finances. I made some horrible decisions money wise in the past couple of years and now I'm paying for it. I have since learned my lesson the hard way and am asking for genuine advice from the lovely people of Reddit.

A bit about my situation:

I'm a 26 year old who is finishing up her last class for her Bachelors in Math. I had a lot of problems with my health throughout the years so my student loan debt is pretty high (\~$95,000) considering I was taking classes when I probably shouldn't have. On top of that, I have accrued about \~$15,000 in credit card debt from irresponsible use. I'm currently on a DMP (debt management plan) because last fall, I severely fell behind on payments and I had no other option but to lower my interest rates and consolidate my payments. However, because of this, my credit score is at a solid 600. I don't qualify for any refinancing because my credit history is abysmal and I calculated that I'll be paying about $1,100 a month just on student loans. However, there is one shred of good news, which is on September 16th, I'll be starting a new job with a starting salary of $71,000 (plus half-time rate for any hours worked over the standard 40). So here are some goals I want to achieve with that new income.

Goals:

1. Move out within a year (somehow)
2. Raise my credit score to at least 650
3. Pay off as much credit card debt as possible
4. Lower my monthly student loan payments
5. Save money, if possible

I'll be honest, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle. I feel so foolish for not learning the value of good finances earlier, but I was naive. If anyone has any advice whatsoever on the best course of action to relieve some of this financial stress, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Medical Discharge From NUPOC. So many financial questions.,"I'm in New York if that matters.

Up until recently, I was in NUPOC. It is a program not too different from ROTC in what the mid-long term outcomes are but pretty different in how it functions through college. Once accepted into the program you swear in and enlist and receive pay as E-6. After you graduate college you go to OCS and then commission as an ensign.

My OCS date got moved back first because the May class was overfilled. Then I began having symptoms of what I thought was hemorrhoids so my ship date got moved back again. I eventually got in with a gastroenterologist and he recommends a colonoscopy. I had a colonoscopy on Wednesday 7/17. After which I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. 7/26 I get the call I am going to be medically discharged from the navy. Today (Friday) or Monday my DD-214 is being submitted to Great Lakes and it is backdated 7/30. I am no longer receiving pay but I've been told it could take a couple of months for papers to finalize properly.

I have

\-Two degrees one in mechanical engineering with a math minor as well as a degree in physics both are Bachelors of Science.

\-$1700 in the bank

\-A paid for 2007 Volvo with the insurance paid out till December. I think it is about $670/ 6 months

\-About $100 in monthly subscriptions I'm canceling this weekend.

\-$11,000 private loan for college.  $141.38 per month payment.

\-$28,759  in federal loans with the grace period ending in November

\-  An \~$18000 Parent Plus loan that I will need to pay, also with the grace period ending in November.

\- A $15000 bonus that I've been informed the Navy will be asking me to repay at some point (probably start a payment plan soon).

\- \~$100 for ulcerative colitis medication per month

To summarize about 73,000 dollars in debt and I'm living with my parents.

\-Question 1 is am I eligible for unemployment and if so will showing my leave and earnings statement going empty in August as well as the submitted DD-214 be sufficient to get it.

\-Question 2 I'm about to describe my current plan and would appreciate any advice.

Step 1 Update Resume, Prep for FE and GRE (Both general and physics subject)

Step 2 Apply to local engineering jobs

Step 3 Apply to Ph.D. Plasma Physics programs, Ph.D. Aeronautical Engineering Programs with a focus on computational fluid mechanics and apply to any fully funded Aeronautical Engineering Programs of the same type.

Step 4 Work at a local engineering job until next summer to cover costs and make payments on debt and really dig into stuff that won't go back into deferment if I enroll in grad school.

Step 5a) Go to grad school if accepted.

Step 5b) Begin looking for a long term engineering job if I don't like my grad school prospects.

personalfinance,School bills coming up on the horizon: Do I refinance my home and withdraw some equity? Or do I just pay for school out of pocket?,"I (31/m) and my wife (31/f) bought a house for $320,000 in December 2016. At the time, we thought that there was no way we would want to stay in this starter home past seven years, so we got a 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) at a fairly good rate and negative closing costs (I think we got paid $5000 with a 4% interest rate which is good for the first seven years before it adjusts upwards). We have no children and are not interested in having them in the future.

Recently, we‚Äôve been talking about how we might not want to live here past seven years, but if we held onto this home, we could use it as a rental property and earn some income from it, as it‚Äôs in a decent location in our city (Portland, OR). 

Aside from our car payment ($400/mo), the mortgage is our only other debt. We pay all CC‚Äôs off every month and live under our means. We don‚Äôt have a ton of savings but we do have a 3-month emergency fund. We use You Need A Budget and our money‚Äôs age is about 100 days.

I am about to begin a 5-year part-time doctoral program to become a nurse practitioner. It will cost about $75,000 total over those five years. We are saving about $950/month in order to be able to fully pay for the nursing program out of pocket without taking on more debt. I plan to work full-time throughout the part-time nursing school. While we are able to manage this, it does cut down on how much traveling and extracurriculars we are able to do, as a large chunk of our income goes to paying for school. We currently have about $20,000 saved in my education fund. 

Our home loan was made out for $256,000 when we bought the house. Currently, our outstanding balance is $247,633. Therefore, we have $72,367 in equity in our house. 

**My questions:**

Should I refinance my home loan and withdraw some money from it (maybe $50,000?) in order to allow my wife and I to not have to spend almost $1000 per month on my schooling? We could stick that money in a high-yield savings account and allow it to earn more money than it currently is when it‚Äôs just sitting in equity in our house‚Ä¶ Even just in a Wealthfront savings account, I could be earning about $1600 annually from the 2.32% APY on $70K. But this is where I get confused. Is it already working for me as equity? Is it helpful to have equity in one's home for any reason, for my situation specifically?

My second question is... Even if I decide not to take out any of my equity, would it still make sense to refinance to a 30-year or 25-year fixed rate while interest rates are pretty low? That would help me later on if we decide to use this property as rental income after moving elsewhere without worrying about my rate increasing. I hear it's about $4000 to refinance with closing costs, but if I could get a lower monthly payment and a lower rate, I could potentially save money in the long-term by refinancing, right?

Thanks! I'm happy to answer further questions about my situation.",finance

personalfinance,"""What flat-rate card should I get?""","I initially posted this over in /r/creditcards, but I figured that it may be able to help some people here as well.

Whether someone only wants to use a single credit card or multiple cards in order to maximize returns on their spending, it's almost universally a good idea to have a card that receives a flat rate in cash back. Therefore, I've put together a list of what's currently on the market in order to help people make decisions about which one to get. Keep in mind that there are *a lot* of financial institutions, so it may not be possible for this list to be *truly* complete.


**TOP TIER**

If you have good or excellent credit, these cards are for you. That being said, it is *sometimes* possible for people with lower scores to be approved for these, but it is less likely; YMMV.

CARD | CASH BACK % | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
Alliant Visa Signature | 2.5% (3% first year) | $99.00/year fee after first year. No foreign transaction fee. Must join credit union.
Ollo Optimum MasterCard | 2.5% | Can only apply via invitation. Invitations all seem to offer 0% APR period for fifteen months on purchases and balance transfers. *Rewards can only be redeemed as a statement credit.*
Alliant Platinum Rewards Visa | 2% (as points) | 12 month introductory APR period on purchases and balance transfers (percentage varies based on your creditworthiness). $50.00 bonus (as points) after spending $500.00 within three months. Must join credit union. *This card appears to be much easier to obtain with lower credit scores than other top-tier cards.*
Citi Double Cash MasterCard | 2% (1% when purchasing, 1% when paying off) | 0% APR on balance transfers for eighteen months.
Fidelity Rewards Visa | 2% (as points) | Points must be redeemed into a Fidelity account. *There is occasionally, but not always, a SUB.*
PayPal Cashback MasterCard | 2% | No foreign transaction fee. Must have a PayPal account to apply. *Rewards can be redeemed in any amount.*
State Department Federal Credit Union Premium Cash Back + Visa | 2% | $200.00 bonus after spending $3,000.00 in ninety days. No foreign transaction fee. $250.00 in cell phone protection. Must join credit union.
Bank of America Premium Rewards MasterCard | 1.5% (as points) (2% as points on travel and dining purchases) | $95.00/year fee. $500.00 (as points) bonus after spending $3,000.00 in ninety days. $100.00 in statement credits per year to cover incidental airline fees. Up to $100.00 in statement credits every four years for Global Entry/TSA Precheck application fee. No foreign transaction fee. *Points (not counting travel and dining, although they increase by the same proportion) are worth 1.88% with Gold [Preferred Rewards](https://www.bankofamerica.com/preferred-rewards/) status, 2.25% with Platinum Preferred Rewards Status, and 2.63% with Platinum Honors Preferred Rewards Status.*
Chase Freedom Unlimited Visa | 1.5% (as points) (3% first year on up to $20,000.00 in spending) | 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. *Points are worth 2.25% when transferred to the Chase Sapphire Reserved. No minimum to redeem rewards.*
UnionBank Cash Back Rewards Visa | 1.5% | 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for twelve months. $100.00 bonus after spending $1,000.00 in three months. *Worth 2.25% if redeeming towards a UnionBank mortgage. This card is also easier to get than the others, but is not worth it unless redeeming for 2.25%.*

Unless you have *insanely* high spending (at least $19,800.00 on the card per year), I wouldn't recommend the Alliant Visa Signature after the first year; I would downgrade to the Alliant Platinum Rewards. As noted in the table, the Alliant Platinum Rewards actually seems to be available to people with much lower credit scores than other cards in this section.

The Ollo Optimum MasterCard is only a few months old, *and* [it requires an invitation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/ca0f21/ollo_optimum_mastercard_invitation/?st=jz4w30um&amp;sh=1f4af732), so finding accounts and reviews of it are pretty tough. Ollo is known as a subprime lender, and the card is issued by Bank of Missouri. That being said, on paper at least, it seems pretty decent.

The Fidelity Rewards Visa is issued through Elan, which is generally considered a terrible issuer. However, the card itself is pretty solid, especially if you can get a SUB. Even if you don't want to use Fidelity for investing, they have a cash management account you could use in order to get the rewards where you want. 

The PayPal card is issued by Synchrony, which a lot of people strongly dislike. In my opinion, it's nowhere as bad as Elan, and as far as issuers like those two, Comenity, etc go, it's the best.

The Bank of America card is only worth consideration *as a flat-rate card* if one has Platinum Honors status and enough spending to justify the annual fee over one of the other cards (*not* factoring in the travel and dining rewards, how you value the various statement credits and travel perks, etc).

The Chase Freedom Unlimited comes out ahead of the 2% cards if transferring points to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. If you transfer to the Chase Sapphire Preferred, however, the 2% cards come out ahead. If you *aren't* going to transfer, this probably isn't worth it, unless you're just trying to build a relationship with Chase--hopefully while hoarding the points--before getting the CSR or something.

Do not get the UnionBank card unless you have a UnionBank mortgage and want to redeem your rewards towards it.

All of this being said, the PayPal CashBack MasterCard and the SDFCU are *probably* the best options as far as the 2% cards go, especially since the Citi Double Cash had a lot of its benefits removed. If you have a decent credit score, don't have and don't want the CSR, and you can't get or it doesn't make sense to get one of the 2.5% cards, these and *maybe* the Fidelity are likely the best.

**SECOND TIER**

Not everyone can get the cards in the top tier. However, there are still options for those who fall a bit short in the credit score department.

CARD | CASH BACK % | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
American Express Cash Magnet | 1.5% | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $1,000.00 in three months. 
BBVA Rewards Visa | 1.5% (2% with $1,000.00+/month in deposits to a BBVA checking, savings, or money market account) | 0% APR period on balance transfers for thirteen months. $100.00 bonus after spending $1,500.00 in ninety days
Capital One Quicksilver MasterCard | 1.5% | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $500.00 in three months. No foreign transaction fee.
HSBC Cash Rewards MasterCard | 1.5% (3% first year on up to $10,000.00 in spending) | 10% anniversary bonus on all points earned each year. 0% APR period for twelve months on purchases and balance transfers.  No foreign transaction fee.
Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa | 1.5% (1.8% on certain mobile wallets for the first year) | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $500.00 in three months. $600.00 in cell phone insurance. *Rewards can be redeemed at Wells Fargo ATMs.*

The BBVA Rewards Visa is only worthwhile if you're able to meet the qualifications to get the 2%. 

The average score for approval on the Quicksilver appears to skew a little bit higher than other cards in this section. That being said, Capital One *seemingly* is more likely to approve you if you're carrying a balance, so if you have a 0% APR period on another card that you could use for that purpose, it may help.

The HSBC card is pretty interesting, although HSBC has been known to be a difficult lender to deal with. In addition, the scores that people get approved with for this card appear to be *right* on the bubble for the point at which one could get something better.

If you want the $600.00 in cell phone insurance and don't have or want the Uber Visa or the Wells Fargo Propel American Express or something like that, the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa may be worth getting even if you *don't* want it as your flat-rate card.

Overall, these aren't *bad* cards, but the cards on the previous list are generally preferable in most scenarios. That being said, a lot of these have pretty easy SUBs, so they may be worth considering if you're looking for one.


**THE REST**

I won't even bother with a table for these, since there are *very* few situations in which these would be your best option for a card.

The first of these are cards that *could* be considered for the second tier, but, with the credit scores, hoops to jump through, etc required to get them (or to get a higher rate), they're just not worth it in most situations. This includes the Citizens Bank Cash Back Plus World MasterCard (1.8%), the M&amp;T Visa Signature (1.5%), the KeyBank Key Cashback MasterCard (1.5%, 2% with $1,000.00+/month in deposits into a KeyBank checking account *and* a minimum of $1,000.00 in a KeyBank savings or investment account), the PenFed Power Cash Rewards Visa Signature (1%, 2% for PenFed Honors Advantage members), and the Schwab Investor American Express (1.5%).

Beyond these, there are *tons* of other 1.5% cards out there. Overall, these aren't as good as the other 1.5% cards listed, due to smaller or no SUBs, short or no 0% APR periods, etc. These should only really be considered if one has no better options and either wants or needs a flat-rate card: Cadence Maximum Rewards Visa, Capital One QuicksilverOne MasterCard (has a $39.00/year fee, which is the main difference between it and the Quicksilver), NASA Federal Credit Union Platinum Cash Rewards Visa, and U.S. Bank Cash 365 American Express.

Beyond *these*, Elan has a white label credit card suite that includes a 1.5% cash back Visa card that several smaller financial institutions use. Off the top of my head, Ameris Bank, Bryant Bank, Flagstar, Incredible Bank, Renasant, and Valley National all use them. They are labeled as *Financial Institution* Real Rewards Visa. These should also only really be considered if one has no better options and either wants or needs a flat-rate card.

Truthfully, the Discover It Miles functions essentially like a 1.5% cash back card (3% in the first year), and is *probably* a better choice than anything in this section.


**CONCLUSIONS**

As you can see, there are a lot of options out there, which can be extremely confusing to many people. Hopefully, this makes things a bit more clear for at least a handful of people.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is a clandestine operation spearheaded by the NSA,"20 days ago I posted about Bitcoin being brought back from the future, see here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cfodub/bitcoin_likely_wasnt_supposed_to_come_out_until/

Because of what happened in 2008 with the creditors being bailed out, it was apparent that as George Bush was leaving office, the bankers were going to go full rogue during Obama's tenure. Creditors have never been bailed out. If anything a debt jubilee happens, and debts are forgiven.

One single rogue NSA agent (""Satoshi Nakamoto"") took it upon themselves to create a new financial paradigm. Bitcoin was likely finished in October the moment the whitepaper went out. But he had to wait until the right time to launch. Bitcoin was launched two weeks before Obama was to take office. George Bush was briefed, but it being his last two weeks, the administration (aka shadow government cabal) was too busy ""transitioning"" to Obama's cabinet, to pay it any meaningful heed. In theory the Bitcoin halvings would coincide with every new American presidential cycle. In practice and application, the early coins were mined faster, and shaved some time off of this collision. At present the halvings happen about six months before elections.

Satoshi Nakamoto probably witnessed all kinds of shenanigans (cough... cough... 9/11) during their George Bush era tenure, and went to great lengths to remain anonymous, after donning the Satoshi Nakamoto alias.

There really weren't that many people interested in Bitcoin early on, and because Peter Todd had helped him fix critical vulnerabilities, Satoshi left the project in his hands. Peter fucked up going to the CIA, he then double fucked up saying Craig Wright is Satoshi. That's why he can't sit with us.

But anyways the last alleged communication from Satoshi, was during the Dorian Nakamoto incident. It's my belief, that ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is most definitely still alive, still working for the NSA, has a good heart, and is actually one of these decent human beings looking out for the masses. We need more Satoshi Nakamoto's working for intelligence agencies, because I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of being on the wrong side of poverty.

Bitcoin is a financial tool that can liberate our species from centuries of aristocratic rule. Prior to the Declaration of Independence, the world was run by Kings, Queens, and nobles. The Bitcoin whitepaper is the modern day equivalent. It's the divorce from central banking hegemony.

Guys we're so close to hyperbitcoinization. It's the black pill central bankers can't swallow, but the sweet digital nectar you and I can. We're going to build this thing out, ON OUR OWN. Bankers be damned.

By the time they do come around, they're going to come around in a big way. Think military-industrial-complex rogue funds budget, funneling into Bitcoin. It's SO important that you have strong hands. Instead of ""selling"", spend 1/10 of your Bitcoin every 10x, and continue stacking Satoshi until the next 10x, in this way you preserve your wealth, and return as little as possible to the supply. Supply is running out... Snag a decent stack before Mnuchin, or Abe, or Lagarde wise up, and print fiat for the exclusive purpose of buying up Bitcoin. Remember... these bankers are still rogue... They're capable of anything... They convinced the government to rob from your future... That's why Satoshi did what he had to do. HOPE is not a strategy. You have to apply yourself and recognize that Bitcoin is a once in a generation opportunity. With that knowledge you have to start planning for not only YOUR future, but the future of the one's that are coming after you die. WE are going to change the world, not with HOPE, but with direct application of the Bitcoin protocol. Preach the gospel of Bitcoin. Personal financial sovereignty is here, NOW!",cryptocurrency

Her credit score isn't the best but it isn't the worst either, she has 9 cards, 6 of them with fees if you don't pay a minimum amount every month, which isn't enough to cover the interest rates. Her entire balance comes out to $6,500\~ across these 9 cards. To pay each card off in a years time she would need to pay close to $700 a month, which is about $500 outside her monthly take home. Realistically she can't afford it no matter how I weave it unless she puts in 20 hours overtime at work every week for the foreseeable future.

I'm wondering if anybody with more experience here would be able to know if banks would be willing to help here. Even if it were at 20% interest she'd be able to afford the payments on it that way. As far as I can see she can only pay the minimum required on the cards which doesn't help her pay off those credit cards very much and would cost her more in the long run. Granted if she did get a bank loan I'd need to take her cards away and stop her from opening new ones.",finance
personalfinance,Should I try to find a new part time job to help pay off my new car loan?,"I just recently bought a new used car for $500 down and $220 a month for 75 months (total of $12.5k). I am a delivery driver, so I depend on my car for work, and without buying a new car (My last one was totaled.), I was most likely to lose my job. However, I make only bare minimum wage for my state ($7.25/hr) and have to work 30 hours a week or more to make a decent paycheck. The tips I make from delivering are decent, but lower than people might anticipate. 

I also do not have major payments like rent because I live with my family and a lot of my current needs are taken care of by my parents. As a full-time college undergrad, I fear that I may not be able to work 30 hours every week on top of my school work. On top of that, I will graduate soon and will have to start paying off around $20k worth of federal student loans.

personalfinance,First time homebuyer,"HI guys 

me and my wife are purchasing a home that won't be built till December 2019.  My question is we are currently going through a mortage lender that preapproved us for 4.25 interest rate as of right now.  It is not locked in and we won't be locked in a rate close till NOvember or December when the house goes through escrow. Should i shop around with more lenders when the house is almost complete? Am i even able to do that right before the house is built? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get the best interest rate for the house my wifes credit is 740ish and mine is 790.  I live in Bakersfield California so if anyone has good lenders or know of any online lenders that have good rates?  I am thinking of going to Chase bank and seeing their lender.

personalfinance,"My brother ruined my credit score, what can I do to repair it?","When I was 18, I needed to get a auto loan to purchase a car. No banks would accept me because I was 18 and had no credit on my name. This is mostly because I dont like payment plans and tend to buy things in full. 
I spoke to my family for help and they told me that I'd could apply for a car loan as a cosign for someone else. This person ended up being my oldest brother. A bank eventually accepted us and we got everything in order. My brother may have been the main person on the loan but I'm the one paying it off. 

I had no issue with this and the payments on those are going well to where I have $1300 left.

So the car sale was a private sell and the car wasnt is the greatest of shape so we put a little extra on the loan on top of what the sellers wanted so we can repair it (i ended up not seeing the extra money because my brother took it for his detailing business at the time and i had to pay for repairs out of pocket). So we had a cashier's check/money order (not 100% sure which one) for the seller for what he wanted. The remaining went onto a credit card that my brother had opened at that time. 
 
Well, recently the car that I used that loan on me broke down hard to where Im wanting to get a new car. Knowing this i went to see if i can get approved for a new loan. Its been two years since the first loan and ive been making every payment on time (not going over 10 days of due date). And ive had a very reliable job during those two years. I knew that the only thing that would hurt my credit was a $500 doctor bill that Im nit too worried about. 

So, I got a voicemail from the bank saying. They denied me of the loan because of a outstanding 60 day payment on a credit card and the doctor bill. I knew that the doctor bill should have hurt me much but i wasnt aware of having a credit card or anything. Well, i found out that my brother had me as a cosigner on that credit card that he opened and where the remaining loan money went onto. 

I was not aware of being attached to this credit card. I called my brother asking if he knew about this and he said he didnt. He though he was the only name on the card. I called the bank back to get more information on the card and why they denied me. Turns out that because i was a cosigner on the credit card ($1000 balance in it) and my brother has been paying it off for 60 days, my credit score got absolutely tanked. The bank had told be that my credit score got all the way down in the 400s.

I was livid in finding this out because i was not aware of even being associated to the card and the bank refusing to take me off till the payments are up to date. I dont even know what the payments are on this card. And the bank said even if i get taken off the card, it'll take 6 months to a year to recover. And even then they said if i want to take out another loan when that time comes, id have to have a cosigner with really good credit. 

So im wondering how could this get taken care of? Im really going to have to get a new car and i dont want to get stuck with a 10%-16% interest rates because id be getting stuck with sub-prime loans due to my credit score. I plan on visiting the bank where the credit cards from and ask to give me a copy of the contract.",finance

personalfinance,"0% Balance Transfer Expiring, Transfer to Another Card?","I made a post about a month ago, where I had 19k in CC debt, and I'm down to about 15k now so I'm making headway and that makes me happy.

However, the biggest single CC balance I have, ~8500 is at 0% but the promotion expires in October. Interest rate is 26.49apr once it expires, which if I'm mathing correctly is a 2.2% monthly interest charge.

I have two cards that can split the balance, one will be 0% until 10/2020 and the other 0% for 18 months whenever I initiate the transfer, w/ 4% and 3% transfer fees respectively.

I have other 0% rates that expire in ~6 months, and I'm wanting to hammer those in that timeframe so I don't have to go through this again. 

If I don't transfer the aforementioned balance, I'm looking at about $185 a month in interest, I think (I'm pretty sure that's accurate)

I think that this is the best way to handle this? But I'd like some advice in case I'm missing any other options.

investing,Building a model forecasting gold prices,"Hello, I've been trying to build a model (linear regression) to forecast short-term gold price movements.

Basically, the variables used are US Dollar Index, Money supply (1/3 US, 1/3 Europe in USD, 1/3 Japan in USD), real interest rate (trailing 12 month CPI - FED 6m rate).  I used the 6m rate because the 1yr rate didn't have enough data (don't worry the 6m is annualized).  Finally, I used the Economic Uncertainty Index as a variable and the spread between long-term treasuries and junk bonds (representing financial uncertainty).  I also added momentum variables.

personalfinance,Job Promotion w/ Travel,"Greetings 

I made the decision to lease a car a little over a year ago. I believe I received a good deal because I was more focused on getting a good buyout price. Regardless, I learned after lurking here that leases rarely end up smart moves. 

My commute to work is about 20 miles round trip so at the time it made sense to get a 30k/39 month lease. I was recently promoted in which I get to travel to our various locations within 12 states. Best part is I get use my own credit card and get reimbursed. 

Total comp will include a $23k raise, $700 a month per tax auto allowance, and a gas card/ez pass. Most of the locations are within the NE corridor. When it makes sense I‚Äôll take the amtrack. But some places I‚Äôll have to drive. 

I have 18 months left on my lease and already at 22k miles with a $0.25 penalty. Right after I agreed to the lease a family member became ill so I helped out on the weekends so i ended up racking up a lot of miles. Well worth it in my opinion.  

My car payment and insurance is around $500 a month. My thought was to put the $700 in a HYSA each month for 18 months. With a 1.9% APY figure it‚Äôll be about $12,780. I estimate I‚Äôll be over mileage by about 10k - 15k so between $2,500 to $3,750 in penalties. So at worse case foreseeable scenario I‚Äôll end up with $9,030 left over. 

I do have a full emergency fund and enough cash to buy a car. I‚Äôm thinking of doing the following: 

1. Buy the car at the end of the lease in cash to save the penalty
2. Turn it in and buy a used car for cash. Something newish because I‚Äôll be driving a lot. 

Not really interested in making car payments anymore where I am financially. I have the liquid cash and interest rates aren‚Äôt getting any better. 

Any input or suggestions welcomed. Maybe there‚Äôs something I missed. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,What should I pay off first?,"I have a capital one card with about $1,600 of debt, interest rate is 25.5%

Amazon card with about $850 of debt, 24.49% (edit:this card is solely on my partners name with no other debt on his part)

Car loan, $1200 ~13%. Current payment is $120/month and easy to handle/budget

My question is should I pay off the higher interest higher debt CC off first and dump most of this check into the higher CC, or split it among the CC debt and whittle those down completely, or pay off the vehicle loan and be done with that part?  I believe it should go to the higher CC, but I‚Äôd like opinions if you have them!

personalfinance,Vehicle Opportunity Cost Question/Thoughts,"Howdy fine folks of /r/personalfinance! I have a vehicle question about payments, opportunity costs, and how it relates to the situation I'm in. 

I have a car that I purchased in April. **It was not a wise choice**, though still within our financial bounds, but I want to get out of it. Life is changing a bit for my family and I where I'll be working from home vs currently commuting 350+ miles a week.

A friend of mine is of the standpoint that getting out of payments to get out of payments doesn't make sense. I follow the logic, but want to take a hard look at the math, but I'm not quite sure how to put it all together.

Here's the details of the numbers I'm working with:

* 2015 Lexus RC 350 F Sport
* $40,000 loan (Roughly $6,000 of the loan was from my previous vehicle, and that amount includes tax/tag/title/fees, etc)
* 12.54% APR
* 75 month term, 73 months left
* $780 monthly payment
* Roughly $225 spent per month on gas
* $201 monthly insurance premium 
* Roughly 50,000 miles currently
* Maintenance costs are currently unknown, as it has a 2 year unlimited mileage warranty as well as 2 years of service included. It is a Lexus so reliability long term will be high
* I estimate that just on the loan itself and the interest rate, this car would cost ~$58,000 over the life of the loan to pay off

&amp;nbsp;

**This car is costing me $1,200 a month. Holy @#$%.**

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm trying to figure out is does it benefit me more to sell the car, eat the cost of the difference of what I could sell it for and what I owe (freeing up that much cash would do wonders to put us closer to our financial goals) **OR** do I eat the car and just suck it up for now because at some point in the next few years I'll end up needing to get another vehicle and know there will be costs associated with it, too. 

Again, I know this wasn't a wise choice but I'm trying to make the best next decision. My thinking is sell it and eat the lesson up front then by a cash car in the future for say around $10,000.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 12th, 2019.

# **Week ahead could bring more volatility as worries over trade and the economy linger  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/week-ahead-could-bring-more-volatility-as-worries-over-trade-and-the-economy-linger.html)**
*****
&gt; After a whipsawing week, stocks could face more volatile swings as investors assess new information on trade and the strength of the economy.
*****
&gt; There are just a few earnings in the week ahead with Walmart, Cisco Systems,Nvidia and Deere reporting as the second-quarter earnings season winds down.
*****
&gt; Some pretty important economic reports are coming, however, spread across the week, with CPI inflation data Tuesday, and a load of key reports Thursday, including retail sales, PCE inflation data, industrial production and regional Fed surveys.
*****
&gt; But it is the behavior of the stock markets investors will be watching. It will be important to see how stocks react to variables like the level of Treasury yields and Chinese currency, which could be a bellwether for trade talks should the Chinese central bank allow the yuan to lose much more value.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching to see what signal the stock market sends after outsized moves in both directions this week.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said he believes the worst is over and stocks could trade at their highs again by the end of the month.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think what we went through was a retest of the May pullback and it ended up being successful,‚Äù he said. Stovall said he has been watching the sub industries of the S&amp;P 1500, and as of July 12, 91% were above their 50-day moving average, an unusually high number.
*****
&gt; But as of Monday, when stocks were cratering, just 10% were above their 50-day moving average.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThat to me was an indication of a washout,‚Äù Stovall said. He added that it was also a rapid move to the 5% decline level from the peak, indicating the market could make a quick comeback.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe are probably coming out of this pullback, and we‚Äôll probably get there quickly. History says we‚Äôll get there by the end of the month, meaning by the end of the month we‚Äôll probably close with a new all-time high,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Despite additional losses on Friday, stocks regained most of the steep losses from earlier in the week. The Dow ended the week down 0.75%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished the week down 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. After Monday‚Äôs close, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 had plunged around 3% while the Nasdaq had lost 3.5%.
*****
&gt; But in the bond market, investors may continue to see the lowest yields in years. In the past week, Treasury yields moved lower in a dramatic global slideamid concerns about global growth and as the world‚Äôs central banks have been cutting interest rates.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúTrade tensions have unambiguously caused global growth to slow down, U.S. growth to slow and caused inflation to decelerate. That‚Äôs quite clear. That‚Äôs all the White House,‚Äù said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields went on a wild ride in the past week, with the 10-year dipping as low as 1.59% from as high as 2.08% the week earlier.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the crazy time of the summer ... when volumes are thin, moves tend to be exaggerated. That‚Äôs probably what we should expect,‚Äù McCarthy said.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the move in yields and to a drop in the Chinese yuan below a former red line level of 7 per dollar. Bond yields, in terms of basis points, last moved this fast right after President Donald Trump was elected.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAs this things accelerate, the [bond] market has been dealing with known unknowns, and now you‚Äôre starting to see people worrying about unknown unknowns. We‚Äôre in dangerous territory,‚Äù said McCarthy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äô s a widespread perception that there‚Äôs a race to the bottom going on here in yields, and it‚Äôs not necessarily the U.S. that‚Äôs driving this. It‚Äôs the fact we‚Äôre the high yielding market.‚Äù
*****
&gt; As rates also fall on foreign sovereign debt, U.S. Treasurys, with a higher yield, look more attractive and lure buyers. Rates move opposite price, so yields move lower when prices turn higher.
*****
&gt; As for the Chinese currency, the market was surprised when China failed to defend it, allowing it to sink below 7 to the dollar. The move was seen as a reaction to the latest round of tariffs Trump threatened to impose on China, effective Sept. 1.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to make any kind of definitive material decision about what‚Äôs going on in China because there‚Äôs no verifiable data to work with,‚Äù said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúIf the Chinese really have the capability to keep this from blowing up, they‚Äôre not going to let this blow up.‚Äù
*****
&gt; As for economic data, McCarthy said the CPI and retail sales data will be particularly important. ‚ÄúI think retail sales will be solid. Everything we see on the household side is good. CPI headline could be feisty. Gasoline prices will boost it by more than a tenth,‚Äù he said.

&gt; To throw some levity into the mix, the intraday chart of the S&amp;P 500 over the last week has amazingly formed a perfect ‚Äúshrug‚Äù pattern from the famous emoji that you‚Äôve likely seen before in texts or on social media (especially if you have teenage kids)! A picture is certainly worth 1,000 words. Talk about the perfect description of this market!

# Another Summer Storm

&gt; U.S. stocks have hit another trade-induced summer storm.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3% on Monday, its worst day since December 2018. The index is now about 6% from record highs in U.S. stocks‚Äô worst bout of volatility since May.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Storms Happen Often in U.S. Stocks, stock volatility this year has been relatively subdued compared to history. The S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 14% from peak to trough since 1990, and even in positive years, the index has dropped an average of 11% during the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gWgqf6z.png))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThough the volatility has been uncomfortable, it‚Äôs normal for U.S. stocks to endure periodic pullbacks,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúThese experiences typically provide opportunities for suitable investors to rebalance, diversify portfolios toward targeted allocations, or to add to equity positions based on what we see as a generally favorable macroeconomic environment.‚Äù

&gt; Stocks‚Äô recent sell-off has been especially brisk. Just 10 days ago on July 26, the S&amp;P 500 reached a new all-time high, bolstered by Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut hopes, improving economic data, and cooling trade tensions. Since then, the Fed‚Äôs rate cut and messaging wasn‚Äôt met with investor enthusiasm, the United States threatened tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods, and China pulled prior commitments to purchase U.S. agriculture goods. In addition, China‚Äôs central bank let its currency (the yuan) fall below the key 7 per dollar level that some view as a line in the sand relative to currency manipulation.

&gt; The fundamental picture for stocks hasn‚Äôt really changed, though. Economic growth has exceeded expectations, inflation and interest rates are low, and second quarter earnings have been better than expected. Trade uncertainty continues to weigh on global markets, but tariffs haven‚Äôt significantly affected the domestic economy and the Fed has indicated willingness to loosen policy as needed. While there are still geopolitical risks, including trade, a review of all of the above fundamentals suggests to us that the odds of an imminent recession are quite low.

&gt; We‚Äôll continue to watch the trade and front monetary policy, along with their impacts to the U.S. dollar, economic output and corporate profit growth. For now, though, we see few reasons that suggest this market pullback will result in anything more than a typical correction, and we maintain our belief that the S&amp;P 500 is fairly valued in the range of 3,000 by year-end.

# Sticking to the Game Plan

&gt; Okay, so the market has been volatile the past two weeks reacting to the Fed rate cut and more so the U.S.-China trade dispute. But in reality this is precisely the typical summer, especially early-August, seasonal weakness we have been warning about, so we are not panicking, but that does not mean the market is out of the woods yet. There is still some technical work to be done.

&gt; At the risk of being repetitive, we remind you that the market continues to track the seasonal patterns closely, which suggests to us that it is likely to continue to do so. The chart below of the Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns clearly illustrates that despite somewhat greater amplitude DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have been following the seasonal trend this year. The late-July/early-August drop we just experienced came right on cue, which puts us on an upward trajectory through mid-September before another reversal into late-October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08814bbc57f7fec02cea55d894aa0a47/44b1ab85c9708a41-64/s500x750/02cf4e5d162fae7663b1489043f7274f64042c91.jpg))**

&gt; But things will need to continue to get constructive technically soon or else further declines become a higher probability. In the next chart we have updated the technical support and resistance levels for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; The Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) broke through initial support at S&amp;P 2875 near the old January 2018 highs, but we held the next level of support at 2815 where the S&amp;P failed intraday back on November 7, 2018, before the December selloff, which was rather constructive. Today‚Äôs rally was further improvement, but we have yet to reclaim the level before this past DF/DM. The sooner we clear this new overhead resistance around 2955 near the May 1 intraday high and the close of Thursday August 1 just prior to this latest DF/DM, the better the technical picture will be.

&gt; If we cannot take out 2955 soon and then breach the next level of support the situation begins to look like the beginning of the selloff last October. Support at 2775 runs through several gaps and consolidations, but the next level of support around 2725 where we held in early June is important. 2650 is minor support below there, but critical support sits at the old February/April 2018 lows 2580.

&gt; If we can retake 2955 in short order then we would expect the market to drift higher into mid-September, perhaps logging minor new highs.

# August Summer Market Storms Are Common

&gt; Mild summer market storms like we are experiencing so far this August have been a common occurrence over the years. After the banner rally we have been having this type of selloff should not be surprising. However, from our analysis of Down Augusts, it can get dicey for the rest of the year if August losses deepen and if September is down as well. You can see in the tables below that the market has usually weathered these typical mild August market declines in stride. It‚Äôs mostly the larger losses at the top of the list accompanied by losses in September that have nasty market years. Years like 2019 with big gains year-to-date at the end of July that had August market storms fared better.

personalfinance,Any Experience with Credible For Loan Consolidation?,I have a friend who's considering using Credible to consolidate high-interest credit-card debt into a lower interest personal loan.  She's got middling-to-lower income (maybe $25-30k a year? it fluctuates) but an excellent credit rating.  We know debt is bad. The goal here is to get the lowest interest rate possible so she can pay off the debt faster.  Does anyone have experience with Credible? Any tricky fees or fine print we should be aware of?,finance
personalfinance,Existential Risks of using a Brokerage Account and Holding Securities in Street Name,"Does anyone understand the existential risks related to having securities in a brokerage account.  Generally these securities are held in street name -- which mean you don't actually own them.  There are a bunch of questions I have about this.

* To what extent are these securities loaned (like for margin use) or used for other things, and to what extent are they just being inventoried?
* Are these securities considered part of the companies general assets of the brokerage company that creditors can attach?

I asked the teller how the interest rate is calculated but it took him a good 25 minutes and asking other people to figure it out and I still barely understand it.

personalfinance,Is it a Good Idea to take out Personal Loans to payoff high interest Student Debt?,"I recently received an offer from Discover for a Personal Loan with a fixed 6.99% APR, and it hit me that this rate is lower than one of the Direct Student Plus loans I'm currently paying off (7.65%). After a bit of research, it looks like I might even be able to get other Personal Loans at a fixed APR of 6% (I have very good credit), meaning even my 6.55% Student Loans (of which I have a few) might be more expensive than those.

So, my question is: Is it a good idea to take out Personal Loans with lower interest rates than my Student Loans, pay off the Student Loans in full, and benefit from the reduced interest every month? If not, why? If so, are there any caveats I need to watch out for? Any recommendations of reputable non-predatory places to look for them? It's worth mentioning that ALL of my Student Debt is from government loans (some Sub, some Unsub, some Stafford, some Student Plus).

I'm Just trying to get my head around this idea and make sure I'm not screwing myself by jumping into something before fully understanding it, so I appreciate any and all advice =)

personalfinance,Home loan repayment strategies,"Hi all,
I am originally from India and currently in the US for my work since last few years. I have a home loan in India for about $150,000 at a floating interest rate of 9.65% - loan of 20 years. (Loan started in 2016)
In the last three years, with my savings, I was able to bring down the principal on the loan to $120,000. But I have already paid heavily for the interest- approximately $40,000.
The only effective way I know to tackle this situation is to save and pay as much principal as much as I can on top of the monthly payments. (almost $1250)
It‚Äôs really a frustrating journey so far as I only realized the importance of paying off principal in the beginning 3-5 years as you pay the interest the most that time.
But nevertheless, I am staying positive and trying to find new strategies to repay the principal as fast as possible.
Does anyone know if I can get a personal loan in US of about $35,000 to $50,000 at an interest rate of around 6-8%? I have a good credit score of about 750+. I have a history of paying off a car loan of $24K. If I do have an option then it will make a lot of difference to pay off the loan in India. If the loan rate is about the same or maybe even higher rate then not sure if I should take another loan in US. Maybe I am overthinking but hopefully there are some strategies people out here can suggest to tackle this situation?
Lastly, my current job pays enough that I can pay rent in US, the monthly payments in India and my monthly expenses in the US. I am able to save only about $300-$400 in US account and approximately $600-$700 in India account. (I send about $2000 to my India account)
If I can take a loan in the US, I was thinking I can then send less money to my account in India (enough for the monthly payments there) so as to pay the loan here in the US. I‚Äôll have two loans at that point so not sure overall how will this strategy work or if I should even explore this option further.

CryptoCurrency,The disconnect between market cap and utility,"When looking at stocks, there are models that gives a valuation. This valuation depends on the current and future expectation of the company. It is the dividends that gives this connection. Companies that don't use dividends use buy-backs of stocks instead, which is effectively the same thing. 

Cryptocurrencies don't have dividends. Because of that, the connection between the success of the underlying blockchain and the coin valuation is much weaker. It isn't just weak, there are no good models. 

What most people fail to understand is that the value of a blockchain is disconnected from the value of the coins. Sometimes, there is a reference to the ""intrinsic value"", which is vague. I prefer to use the ""utility"". Most blockchains have utilities, even if is hard to compute what the actual value of these are.

As the connection is weak, and there isn't any monetary policy that controls the value, it is up to other market forces. I think the market frequently is controlled by people looking for maximal profits as well as pure manipulation, not concerned with the actual utilities of the blockchain.",cryptocurrency

gaming,Unpopular gaming opinion: Rockstar games hasn't been good for about a decade now,"Now, by not good I don't necessarily mean bad, just mediocre compared to their usual standards. I respect anyone's opinion on their games after 2010 but I really think they've gone to shit since around 2010. GTA IV was their last major release that genuinely star struck me and showcased to me what the next generation of gaming looked and felt like (At the time). It was an incredibly atmospheric beautifully crafted game that to this day I still boot up and play (Hell, I'm on my 20th playthrough of the story as we speak). However, after Red Dead Redemption they kinda went to shit. LA Noire wasn't BAD but it was really boring to me and even after multiple playthroughs I found very little enjoyment in actually booting that game up, it felt like a chore. Max Payne 3 was OKAY (Mainly for it's awesome bullet impact physics/gore) but got tiresome very quickly and is a game I will never revisit. GTA V was MASSIVELY overrated in my opinion and felt like a giant step down from IV considering the nerfed physics engine and shortcuts they took to make the game work and not to mention the 3 protagonists bit got ***really*** old really quick (And it's story was rushed as hell).

RDR 2 was a beautiful looking game but it really seemed to focus a lot more on it's brawn then it's brains. They put so much detail into rotting corpses they forget to make the game actually enjoyable to play. And it's exposition/prologue is UNBELIEVABLY painful to get through. The game felt more like an HBO drama then a fun game. As far as a Rockstar Game's production goes I'd rate it a 7/10. I'm not really looking forward to the next GTA/Bully games that are coming in the next few years because I know they probably will be a LOT like RDR 2 considering RDR 2 is most likely the framework for every game Rockstar makes the next 7 or so years and Rockstar seems to be really focused on impressing people lately with awe value rather than a fun time.

The golden years of Rockstar games IMO has to be 2002-2008, they didn't really give a shit about beautiful graphics and instead crafted some amazingly memorable and fun experiences that anyone could hop into immediately and have fun with (Hell I remember being in school at this time and most kids who had GTA SA didn't even have a memory card they just booted it from scratch every day). My favorite Rockstar games have to be Manhunt 1 and 2, GTA SA and VC, and GTA IV (Maybe GTA CTW on the DS because that was such a unique experience).

I will probably not be buying any expensive AAA Rockstar releases for at least 10 years down the line unless they make something that really catches my attention (Which considering I only enjoyed maybe 4 or so of the almost 120 hours I put into RDR 2 desperately trying to make my money worth it, I sincerely doubt). Oh yeah and lastly? You may think this is a nitpick but with how abusive Rockstar games has been reported to be with their development cycles I really can't find myself fully enjoying all the absurd amounts of detail in each game without getting slightly disturbed at how many hours of labor people put into the game away from their families. This didn't used to be the case and the games they made were focused on brains not brawn, amazing gameplay that was fun and addictive, smooth controls and a great story was all that was important.

When people say GTA V is the BEST AAA game of the last decade I can't help but disagree, MGS V, BOTW and even fucking RE7 were far more enjoyable experiences in every facet.",technology

Interest rate of: prime -0.25%

No annual, monthly, or service fees.

No payments on principle until a year after I've graduated. 

But interest payments on the principal start immediately while I'm a student, on whatever I've borrowed.

I've asked them all ""Is there anything that affects the rate?"" ""Does the rate go up after I graduate?"" ""Can I pay back LOC with my student loan with no penalties?""

It's all a bit too simple, which makes me nervous. I was expecting to have to weigh some very different LOC terms.

One bank in particular is offering that after I graduate I can roll my student LOC into a ""unsecured personal line of credit"" which will allow me to keep my prime -0.25% rate forever, provided I apply for it within two years. This sounds too good to be true.

I've been applying to about 7 or so a week, and that will ramp up shortly as I've been taking a summer class that just ended. 

As for my finances now, I've paid and worked my way through college with what I feel is minimum debt. I have about $17,000 owed in federal student loans, and I have an auto loan I still owe about $2,000 on (monthly automatic payments, to be finished up Aug 2020). I work currently with a Co-op job, bringing home about 1,100 (on average across the year) twice a month, co-op meaning that as soon as I graduate I can no longer have that position. I have no savings. 

My monthly expenses are: $380 for my part of the rent and utilities (live with roommates), $195 on auto insurance (I think this is ridiculous because my record is spotless, and technically it is under my mother's name who's record is also stopless I assume it's like this because we live in MI), $156 auto loan payment, and my other expenses including gas, groceries, pet food, and going out for dinner total up to about $1400 a month (average over the last 6 months). And those with a calculator see that I'm living paycheck to paycheck basically, the amount that I save every pay period goes to paying for my classes when the next semester starts. 

Here is my dilemma, December is graduation and at the same time that my current lease is up. My roommates are also graduating and will not be here to split up the cost of living so I'm looking for housing, because I cannot count on anyone taking the load with me anymore. In the area where I live and am looking for a job, dog friendly apartments and houses in a reasonably safe area are approximately $700-750 a month. Estimating my bills from the house I currently live in, I should be expecting: $50 dollars for internet, $200 dollars for electricity/ natural gas, and $45 dollars a month for water paid quarterly. 

The idea got into my head to look at buying a house; I'm considering it as I can find a house I am comfortable with between $45k-70k. If I went that route, I would need a mortgage to cover the whole thing, what I'm betting what is considered financial suicide, a credit score of 650. I'm looking for advice, resources, or ideas for housing. I'm okay with doing my own maintenance, but please let me know what the general consensus is about what the best plan of action is for someone in my situation.",finance

Based on comparable properties in our area, these improvements would add \~$25k in value to the home.

Here are the options we're currently considering for financing:

1) Cash-out refinance - since we purchased, interest rates have dropped over 1% and our value has gone up $50k, but we're concerned about closing fees and how our limited equity would impact this

2) 0% interest credit card - we can qualify for this and commit to paying off the $15k in 18 months before interest kicks in

3) Seeking a home improvement loan - we haven't encountered any options with rates below 8%, so we're not too keen to do this

We are not sure which of these options to go with, or if there are any others we have not considered/are unaware of. Thanks for your thoughts and advice as we consider our next move!",finance
personalfinance,Pay off house with HELOC -,"I had a friend tell me that he was planning on doing what he called an Australian mortgage (I think because there is a suggestion that it's upside down??  No offense my Aussie brothers and sisters).

Basically - he already has 50% or more equity in his house.  He is planning on taking out a HELOC on that 50% and paying off the remaining mortgage.  As he says, since the payment of the HELOC will come down each month, if he continues to pay the same amount a month as he does with his regular mortgage then more will go towards principle.  He says it is going to shave off a few years (mortgage was a 15 yr) and save a ton of interest.  I didn't get the interest rates of either loan, but for sake of discussion let's say they are both the same.

Is this wise or foolish?  I'm getting close to 50% myself and think it would be a pretty cool idea if it pans out.",finance

I recently bought out my lease with a car loan from Bank of America with an interest rate of 5.54% (since I don't have much of a credit history). My credit score was hovering around 790 before the car loan and now went down to around 730. 

I want to refinance this loan to get a better rate than 5.54%; however, since this requires hard inquiries I'm not feeling too good about that. Additionally, I have some travelling coming up and I would like to put some of those expenses on a credit card like CSR to get some benefits out of it but that also requires hard inquiries. 

Question is do I refinance the auto loan right now, which will lower my credit score even more, and wait for it to go back up and then apply for a credit card OR do I apply for the credit card right now, and wait to refinance the loan. What do you guys think?",finance
stocks,Shorting Walmart,"I‚Äôm thinking about Shorting Walmart Stock but I wanted to get some second opinions from some people in this reddit. 

First time posting here so hopefully this is okay. 

My basis for shorting Walmart is both political and because of the nature of their business. 

Their highest grossing section is groceries if I recall. They‚Äôre facing stiff competition there from aldis publix, Krogers, Giant and a host of other grocery stores. 

Walmart to my understanding is a business that survives off of low margin profit. As in most items they sell give them small margins which do add up. 

However, it‚Äôs those small margins I believe which are going to bite them. Walmart relies on Federal subsidies for profits as in most of their employees do not make enough money and thus need food Stamps, housing assistance, or some other kind of aid to survive. 

This takes us to politics. Normally a company like Walmart does very well with Republican administrations exhibit A would be the corporate tax cuts, however Trump is determined to keep increasing tariffs on China. These tariffs do impact different company‚Äôs bottom lines and Walmart imports a lot from China. Anyone who shops there can attest to this. 

Now, on the other side of the political spectrum are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who in my opinion are the respective 2nd and 3rd place runners in the run up for the democratic nomination. Both of them along with any New Democrats elected to Congress would push for a minimum wage increase directly hitting Walmart‚Äôs bottom line at least short term. I think that many of those losses could be made up through increased sales, but it wouldn‚Äôt translate over the course of one or two quarters. Workers who get paid more tend to spend more. 

Even if Joe Biden wins which is not unlikely many democratic states are looking to pass minimum wage laws while Trump is increasing tariffs in the short term putting a double source of potential losses on Walmart. 

Also if Joe Biden wins, things like food standards will at the very least be raised back to what they were pre-Trump. (I consider Biden as somewhat economically conservative more so than Obama)

This in turn would raise the price of food in the U.S again hitting Walmart‚Äôs margins. 

I‚Äôm hoping to put a small position on 3-6 month puts for a couple hundred dollars. So far I‚Äôve been reasonably successful with my stock investments but am definitely looking to learn more. 

I would greatly appreciate any feedback or criticisms. I follow nasdaq companies and politics very closely but I don‚Äôt look too closely at retail.",finance
economy,"The ultimate fate of the world, lower interest rates and Fiat currencies ?","Ive always wondered where the world is headed to ever since the gold standard was removed in the 70s. After the 70s, There was nothing backing the USD and the state was free to borrow money and spend it in the present and put the debt in the future. Eventually, the debt grows more and more and in order to service the debt (pay the interest on the accumulating debt) interest rates are lowered. 

Right now interest rate for the euro is 0% , japan and switzerland have negative interest rates and the USA interest rate is approaching zero (evident by a trend that can be seen on the historic interest rates of America). 

What is the ultimate fate of fiat currency when USA interest rates are zero and the feds can no longer bring interest rates down to stimulate the economy ? 

Will fiat currency become hyper inflated ? Will a war start ? Can the bank eliminate cash, make interest rates go negative and force peoples to put their money at a loss in a bank to pay the debt? Historically has any thing similar to do this happened before? 

I would like to know just how bad (or not bad) this situation is and what we can do to protect ourselves from a potential economic catastrophe. All Answers are welcome and some sources would be really well appreciated too",finance

investing,Depression comparison,"I was posting on twitter about the looming arrival, or already landed, recession in the United States.  I was looking at the gold prices rising, bond yields dropping and rising stock market volatility.  I posted that it's the same statistical movements as the 2008 recession just without the housing bubble and somebody replied, that's worse, meaning that it would be a worse recession without the housing bubble.

I've been reading through Ben Bernanke's book and he basically outlined that because the recession looked like a housing bubble crash in the beginning the fed was hesitant to make market movements because strategies for the housing industry would have negative effects on the otherwise strong economy.  I would then be led to believe that the recession would be less damaging without a housing bubble.

personalfinance,Do I pay off this loan,"I‚Äôm currently 24 years old and living at home. I just started a job as a teacher and will be making around $40,000 a year. I worked like crazy this summer and was able to pay off 1 of my 3 student loans in full (the loan was $6,000). I now have 2 loans left.

Loan #1: $15,800 at a 5.5% interest rate.

Loan #2: $6,000 at a 5.5% interest rate.

I have 11,000 dollars in the bank right now. I pay $400 a month for my car/insurance/groceries. I pay $350 a month for both of those above loans.

My parents think I should pay off my other $6,000 dollar loan completely. With my current income, is this something responsible I should be doing? It feels irresponsible to only have about ~5,000 in the bank if I were to do that (especially because I want to move out) But, I have the luxury of not paying rent right now.

personalfinance,Starting my finance journey with a plan. Need advice.,"Hello all,

After being in a bit of a sinking hole in terms of not knowing what I was doing with my life, I have finally found a plan I am more confident in, and now simply need advice going forward into the future.

Here are the basics: 19 year old male making about $400 a month at a part time job while getting my bachelor's degree in biology. My initial plan was to attend medical school but given how competitive that field is, I have very nervous about my future plans if not accepted into medical school. My parents have taught me nothing about finances, and everything I know now I have taught myself. I deposit $100 into a 2% interest savings account at the beginning of each month, to start to build up some savings for myself. I have student loans in my name that by the time I am done with undergrad will amount to roughly $40,000 dollars.

Here is what I have determined. I am interested in investing in real estate if medical schools falls through. However, the key step there is to get a good loan, which I need credit for. I currently have a 632 credit score according to Credit Karma, but that's very baseline and I have very little credit activity, but that number means nothing to me other than I know I need to raise it to a 740+ to get the best interest rates on loans in the future. While researching for credit cards, I found that a Discover It secured credit card is likely my best option to start to raise my credit. This is where my first question comes in. To begin, I must make a security deposit to open a line of credit. I plan on using this credit card for groceries which I am budgeting about $200 a month for. What should my credit limit be? I have seen a constant number that you should only utilize 30% of your total credit, however I plan on paying it off in full. To me, the credit card will essentially be a debit card that I only use to spend money I would spend otherwise and pay it off in full instantly. I am not understanding why I should only use 30%, especially because I do not have a large sum of money to deposit to make my credit limit $600. I would rather do a limit of $300-400, but if this negatively impacts my score, I will have to just supplement with a debit card and utilize 30%.

My second question, which may seem like a basic one but as a novice, I need all the help I can get. Where do I even pay off my credit card? Should I pay it off instantly? Like should I spend $50 at the grocery and then pay it off immediately? I do not want to pay a single cent in interest. This is a basic one but one I need explained a little further.

Before I ask any more questions, I'll explain my future plans in more detail. I plan on graduating with a bachelors of science degree in two years for biology. If medical school doesn't work out, I want to get a job that pays &lt;$35,000 a year (hopefully &lt;$50,000) and work full time for two years. I want to save almost all the money I make during this time, while living and eating for free. I will save money until I have enough to put a down payment on my first property. This is the basic plans in a gist. I also want to begin to invest in a Roth IRA or a 401k, invest in an index fund, as well as continue to have a high interest savings account. I will continue saving money and living below my means, while working a full time job, until I am able to support myself with my investments, so I can then transition into investing full time. I would like to retire by 40 and enjoy life.

More questions time. What is a reasonable salary for someone with a bachelors degree? Are my goals realistic? How soon should I start paying off my student loans? I plan on purchasing a duplex as my first property, and rent out the other space to begin positive cash flow, so my living expenses would basically be free.

As someone who hasn't been taught anything about the world of finance, I have tried my best to educate myself on it, but there's always more you can learn. If you have any tips, or see any errors in my plans, or have any advice for a young kid just starting out, please share them. I feel like I am finally taking control of my life, and I want to be financially secure so I can start a family while I am still young.

I look forward to reading your responses, and I'll do my best to respond to all the comments I get, especially if you need clarification on anything listed above.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Final Payoff Amount was off by $0.03,"So after I scheduled my final payment, using the loan servicer's payoff calculator to get the correct ""final payment"" amount, I cancelled my no longer needed auto-pay...which was apparently giving me a minor interest rate reduction.

Therefore, awkwardly, my loan has literally 3 cents left on it. When I called the company after first noticing this was going to happen, the lady I talked to said the loan would still be discharged, it just might take a little bit longer for the account to be closed out.

Bitcoin,Top 3 Reasons for Bitcoin to Become a Global Safe-haven Asset,"&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin has risen for three reasons, and investors are increasingly considering seeking hedging in Bitcoin.](https://i.redd.it/fxh062a2fzf31.png)

1. Legal currency depreciation

&amp;#x200B;

The economist Raoul Pal said that as the US and other countries tried to boost economic growth by cutting interest rates, investors began pouring in gold, cash, government bonds and bitcoin as hedging instruments.

&amp;#x200B;

Pal warned that he is currently at the most important moment in his foreign exchange market for his 30-year career. The dollar seems to face an uncontrolled risk of appreciation.

&amp;#x200B;

Pal pointed out that the Fed's generalized trade-weighted US dollar index is close to 130 and is on the verge of breaking through a huge cup-shaped pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, the ADXY (Asian Dollar) index is about to fall below the key trend line.

&amp;#x200B;

JPMorgan‚Äôs emerging market currency index is also underperforming and is about to fall to a new low.

&amp;#x200B;

Pal pointed out that at least seven other legal tender currencies are also depreciating, and the conclusion is that a stronger US dollar is triggering a massive wave of global deflation, which could lead to a financial crisis. However, the optimistic side is that this may be very beneficial for bitcoin prices.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Bitcoin is increasingly irrelevant to traditional markets

&amp;#x200B;

As central banks show that they will continue to loosen monetary policy, investors are becoming more and more nervous. Later, the Fed announced a rate cut of 25 basis points.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the latest data from SFOX, Bitcoin has the lowest correlation with traditional markets.

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently, the Bank of Thailand cut interest rates by 25 basis points, the first time since 2015. The New Zealand central bank also cut 50 basis points, which surprised many investors.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the Bank of India also cut interest rates by 35 basis points.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth noting that John M. A chart published by Spallanzani shows that in the past few years, the interest rate of the Bank of India seems to be inversely related to the price of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, in the past few years, the rate hike seems to coincide with the bottom of the bitcoin price, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

3, Bitcoin can provide asymmetric returns

&amp;#x200B;

Other analysts also believe that bitcoin is increasingly appearing in the attention of investors looking for alternative safe-haven assets. Wx:CY-52520

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in an interview earlier this week, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano discussed how Bitcoin will respond to current global monetary easing trends.

&amp;#x200B;

Pompliano believes that more and more organizations are starting to focus on Bitcoin because it ""has been proven to be irrelevant and provides asymmetrical returns compared to traditional assets.""

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, Fundstrat's research director Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin has been decoupled from the strong dollar, and the strong dollar is the reason for the sharp fall in bitcoin prices in 2018. Bitcoin is ""negatively associated with the stock market.""

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, bitcoin is increasingly associated with gold, and its performance in 2019 is significantly better than precious metals, traditional stocks and almost all assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Lee said that this trend may accelerate as investors seek safe haven for traditional stocks. The Fed‚Äôs recent interest rate cuts will have a positive impact on bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a macro hedging tool for investors to guard against possible problems. Liquidity is driving capital into all of these risky assets and hedging, which helps bitcoin rise. At this rate, Bitcoin can easily break through its historical highs.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My mother was in control of finances and now I‚Äôm 80k in debt,"My mother has been in charge of my finances since I was 16 years old. I recently discovered how much student debt has accrued in my name.

Back story: my mom went on disability when I was 15 for PTSD. She continuously told me we could not afford rent or bills with her social security check. I felt guilty and got a full time job when I turned 16. At this point, I was giving her my entire checks to help out. Eventually she over drafted this account and opened up a new one in my name. This was eventually over drafted, too. 

I began going to college in 2011. I noticed I was receiving large rebate checks from the university, but was under the impression the bulk of it came from grants and scholarships. I was still working full time and allowing my mother to be in charge of the finances. She told me since I was working so hard I didn‚Äôt need to stress over getting the bills paid and that she was taking care of it. Between these rebate checks, she would complain about not having enough money. 

I noticed she was taking out credit cards in my name. We had argued over it, and eventually she told me they were all paid off. A couple of years ago, my checks began being garnished for a debt that she said she didn‚Äôt know about. At this point, I should have looked further into everything but continued to trust her. She said it was the only credit card. 

She has stopped receiving help for her PTSD long ago. There was an issue with her doctor who was giving her terrible advice and drugs that didn‚Äôt seem to mix well. This doctor no longer has their license and my mother has never made an effort to seek new help or get back into a career. She blames it on trust issues. 

While only bringing in her social security check, she was making extravagant purchases, like a SUV off the lot for 50k. In retrospect, she must have been using money from my federal student loans. She would have never been able to afford this. 

We have been arguing non stop the last year over unrelated things. In May, I decided to really dig into my own finances. I discovered my student debt is currently at 75k, that I have 3.5k in credit card debt, and 4K in credit card debt that‚Äôs in collections. I told her she owes me back a minimum of 50k for the SUV she bought, since I don‚Äôt even have a license and never drive the vehicle. I explained that I would pursue legal action if I had to. 

I made the decision to move out by the end of this month. It seems like the only way to fully cut ties and begin to figure out how to handle this situation. I finish my masters degree next fall, in which I will have to start paying back my student loans after 6 months. For the time being, I am staying in my graduate office to save up for a little bit while working two service jobs. 

She has tried to convince me to stay for the remainder of her lease (I am not on it) and to co-sign for a cheaper car. The engine blew on the previously mentioned SUV and I have been paying for her current car that I was guilted into co-signing for. I have told her no to both staying with her and co-signing. Last week she was hired at a company that I think she could do well in, but she is claiming she is going to get evicted and the car repossessed if I do not stay. She said that there is no way to pay me back if that is the case. 

This is a very layered, complicated situation. I know I should have looked into things much earlier. It was stupid to let someone else control my finances. Prior to looking into my debt myself, I estimated being 20k in and was willing to pay that. I was way off. 

Does anyone have advice? Should I try to pursue legal action if she does not begin to help paying me back? Due to other situations that have not been mentioned here, I am not worried about saving our relationship.

Edit: To be clear, the credit cards were taken out without my approval.",finance

We both make similar money and have credit scores over 800. Our plan was each of us would apply individually for a personal loan to keep the interest rate down and to delay taking out the second loan until closer to the project start date (we should be able to save more cash decreasing the amount we need). My question is concerning how the debt to income ratio is calculated when we apply for individual loans concerning debts we share jointly.

personalfinance,About to pay off wife's $260k student loans - are we doing the right thing?,"A last minute gut check before we pull the trigger...

My wife graduated from law school in 2012 with about $175k in student loan debt. Since then she has qualified for the Pay As You Earn program which caps her payments at 10% of 'discretionary income'. Her salary is about $90k but because the amount owed is so high, and because we file our taxes separately, she has managed to stay under the earnings threshold to remain on the program for the past seven years. Her monthly payments are about $600 and the debt has risen to about $260k in that time at a fixed rate of 7%.

In the meantime, we have been maxing out our 401ks, IRAs, and then investing in index funds. We currently have about $400k in our taxable accounts.

The rationale behind this approach was that the PAYE program also offers debt forgiveness for any remaining balance after 20 years, providing you qualify for the program for the full duration. After 20 years, the balance that will be forgiven on this debt will be about $440k.

For a couple of years we have not been sure whether or not we should use our savings to pay off her student debt. In favor of this:

* There will be a large tax bill due when the debt is forgiven, likely in the region of $175k (though in 2032 dollars, during which time our $260k would be invested).
* Peace of mind. No-one has been in the PAYE program long enough to see it through to forgiveness, so who knows what gotchas might be waiting. Some horror stories have circulated from those in federal jobs (who qulaify after 10 years), but those could be teething problems.

In favor of keeping the money in the market:

* Debt forgiveness, of course. The tax due of $175k in 2032 dollars is still less than $260k in 2019 dollars.
* There is some talk of legislating to make student loan debt forgiveness not taxable in the future, but I don't consider it likely.
* My wife is extremely unlikely to earn enough to price herself out of the PAYE program, but if she did she would potentially need to turn down salary increases or promotions if it ever came to that.

Recently I have been coming down on the side of paying simply for the peace of mind, and I am making preparations to do so. Does anyone think we are making a mistake?

EDIT: some additional info requested - I am 39 and my wife is 35. My income is 140k plus another 20k-50k depending on how many side projects I take on.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage?,"I recently received a letter in the mail with some information on refinancing and was curious if it made financial sense to do so.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Since I'm sure it will be asked: this is not a form letter; it was from my existing lender (Wells Fargo) and has specific information regarding the current mortgage.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Mortgage info:  

* Closed March 2018  
* Standard mortgage (no FHA, VA, etc.)  
* 4.5% interest rate  
* No PMI (&gt;20% LTV)  
* Being offered 4.125% in this letter
* Estimated reduction in payments of about $750 a year
* I would consider it near certain that I will stay in this house 10 years or longer.
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Obviously the cost of the refinance itself is a big deal here. It's going to take some amount of time to break even based on this cost and the yearly savings. If it takes more years to break even than I am planning on staying in the house then it is a net loss. If it takes less time to break even than I am planning on staying then it's a net gain.  
&amp;nbsp;  

So, my questions are the following:  

* What's the likely cost of the refinance? There appears to be a lot of conflicting information regarding this. Some sources say since it's it is through my existing lender (and that it is a large lender) I can expect a minimal closing cost. Some sources say that, since 2008, I should expect to pay a standard percentage based closing cost.
* Rates appear to have a pretty solid trend of going down. If I were to decide to refinance, does it make sense to potentially hold on a bit for a better rate?
* What is the likely process with the refinance? Again, there seems to be some conflicting information online about refinancing with the current owner of the loan. For example: ""it's the same amount of paperwork"" vs ""it's much less paperwork since they already have most of what is needed"", ""you'll need another appraisal"" vs ""no appraisal"", and so on.",finance

Fed Considers New Tool for a Downturn
The countercyclical capital buffer would require banks to hold more capital should the economy show signs of overheating

WASHINGTON‚ÄîFederal Reserve officials are weighing whether to use a tool that could reduce the risk of a credit crunch in a downturn.
The tool is known as the countercyclical capital buffer. It allows the Fed to require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital should the economy show signs of overheating, or to keep less of it during bad economic times. The buffer applies generally to banks with more than $250 billion in assets, including firms such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.

The Fed‚Äôs board of governors so far hasn‚Äôt used the tool, approved in 2016. Its rule on the buffer says it should turn it up when economic risks are ‚Äúmeaningfully above normal‚Äù and reduced when they ‚Äúabate or lessen.‚Äù

Now, some Fed officials are debating whether it is time to use the tool, which could provide banks with additional lending firepower in a subsequent downturn. It isn‚Äôt clear when they might make a decision.

‚ÄúThe idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that‚Äôs something some other jurisdictions have done, and it‚Äôs worth considering,‚Äù Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a late July press conference.

Deciding whether to use the buffer is somewhat fraught, though. Banks are reluctant to hold even more capital than they do today as this could hamper their profitability. That is already under strain due to low interest rates.

Plus, it isn‚Äôt clear how markets would interpret such a move by the Fed, especially since this would be a first. Investors could find the buffer reassuring, believing the Fed is giving itself additional room to fight a downturn. Or they could be unsettled by it, fearing the Fed believed a slowdown is imminent.

Fed officials have been debating about whether to use the tool since last year. Now, they are raising another question: how it should be used.
Some officials have suggested turning it on without increasing capital levels‚Äîsignaling the Fed is prepared to use the tool, even if not right away. Others think higher capital requirements should be applied now.

Either move would give the central bank the option of lowering the requirement during a downturn.

Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, an Obama appointee, favors turning on the buffer now and raising capital requirements for big banks. She dissented from a March Fed vote to leave the buffer dormant.

‚ÄúTurning on the [buffer] would build an extra layer of resilience and signal restraint, helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system,‚Äù she said in a May speech.

Others say capital levels are already high enough, and that the tool could be used instead as a release valve for bad times.

‚ÄúWe rely on through-the-cycle, always on, high capital and liquidity requirements,‚Äù Mr. Powell said. ‚ÄúI view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right.‚Äù

Randal Quarles, the Fed‚Äôs vice chairman for bank supervision, at a July Fed conference in Boston said, ‚ÄúThe overall risk to financial stability is swamped by the extremely low leverage in the financial sector. ‚Äù

Messrs. Quarles and Powell have cited the Bank of England‚Äôs approach as a possible model for the U.S. In the U.K., the countercyclical capital buffer is set at 1% of risk-weighted assets when risks are ‚Äúneither subdued nor elevated,‚Äù allowing the central bank to dial it down if the economy is thrown a curveball.

Banks have argued the buffer shouldn‚Äôt be turned on now because they are already subject to regulations, including other capital requirements, that ensure they are prepared for bad times. One example is the Fed‚Äôs annual stress tests that banks must pass to prove they would continue lending in a recession.

At the same time, they have encouraged the Fed to reduce other capital requirements. The central bank would likely have to do that if it activated the countercyclical capital buffer while maintaining the same amount of capital in the banking system, as suggested by Messrs. Powell and Quarles.

The countercyclical capital buffer was created in 2010 by international regulators through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It is being used in other parts of the world, including Sweden and Hong Kong.",finance
personalfinance,Unearthed an unknown debt that may or may not be ours. Now what? (A financial saga with the in-laws in 4 acts),"Alright, so please excuse in advance all the text. But I feel overwhelmed by the amount of moving parts here, so I will do my best to describe the scenario in such a way that gives the most comprehensive understanding.

**ACT 1: OUR SITUATION:** My wife and I have been following a Dave Ramsey-esque plan. We wanted to put ourselves in a position to cash flow our wedding, honeymoon, down payment on our first home, furnish the new home, and also pay cash for tuition in my grad program. We make decent salaries between the two of us but weren't really sure how all the numbers would play out in reality, so we stopped retirement contributions for about the last year and a half while we stockpiled cash and went on overdrive to pay down our debts. We now feel comfortable that our expenses have normalized and we can use the money we've kept in liquid saving to pull the trigger on our last debt: my wife's 7K in student loans. As my wife and I were discussing this final step, I asked if there were any other debts that maybe she shared with her parents or something.

**ACT 2:** **THE IN-LAWS:** Previously, my wife had mentioned that her parents took over payments on one of her earliest student loans and left her with the other student loan that was more manageable (the one that we were planning on killing as our last debt). She had know idea what the amount was because she was always kind of financially aloof prior to our union. Regardless, she never thought much of it because her parents never gave her the impression that she needed to. My wife had always said that her parents had always said something along the lines of ""you just worry about the loan you have."" OK, cool, right? Well, upon preparing to engage the final blow to my wife's student loan, she reached out to her mom and asked if the loan they took over was still active. Her mom said that they have been making payments on it, but there's still about 40K left on it. When asked if she expects my wife to pay it, she responded with a very vague ""sure, we'd appreciate help."" FUUUUUUUUUCK.

**ACT 3: MUDDY WATERS:** So what is this mystery loan? Apparently when my wife was about 23 or so, she had a student loan for about 54K. At the time, my wife was not earning a lot and making minimum payments on this loan. However, the interest was so high that apparently the minimum payments were less than the interest that was accruing on it and the total amount owed was actually increasing in spite of her payments. Her parents (rightly) recognized this was a shitty situation, so they stepped in and took out a home equity loan for about 100K that had a significantly lower interest rate to pay my wife's student loan, pay for something related to their business, and I think also pay the tuition for my wife's sibling. When that happened, and for years thereafter, in the very seldom moments that it was ever mentioned, they said something along the lines of ""you just worry about that loan"" (the one that is now around 7K). Apparently, my wife's interpretation of that was that it was now being taken care of by her parents. For some context, her parents are extremely giving especially when it comes to expenses to provide for their children and so it's not completely unreasonable to interpret the situation as such.

**ACT 4: NOW WHAT?** So upon hearing that there is some 40K that may or may not have an expectation of our name on it, I went in to panic mode. We have worked our ass off to get our debt in our cross hairs and now all of a sudden we may be going back in the hole 50 or 40K. I spoke directly with my wife's mom and she provided the context for the home equity loan and she estimated that after her payments over the last 6 or 7 years, that the student loan portion may be around 40K - But really there's no way to tell without doing the math because it all got thrown into a single pot. So the question is - What do we do? We have been so energized at the idea of getting rid of monthly payments, that we dread the idea that we'd have to go back into that cycle - Especially if the recipient are her parents. How weird would that be? Also, we recognize that we may have a moral obligation to these debts. There's a part of me that would like to just say, we'll give a lump sum of what we have in saving right now just so we can move forward as newlyweds without any debt. Would that be an offensive offer to make? Again, the idea of being a slave to a lender on a monthly basis - especially her parents - is almost completely out of the question if it could be avoided. We are also worried that if we take on this debt and go back in to debt-crushing mode that we will have to delay our retirement investing much further that we had anticipated.¬†When we made the decision to pause retirement savings, obviously we anticipated how long it would be based on the debts we actually knew about.

I think what I'd like to do would be to kill the 7K debt right now, go back into heavy investing mode to make up for the lost time that we held off over the last couple years while we eliminated debt and saved for the major expenses mentioned above. With the cash that we have left over, make a lump sum offer of maybe 20K and see if they would take that. If it turns out that they would like more, then we just pile up some cash on the side over the course of another year or so and make other lump sump payments as needed. What do you think? How would you handle this situation? What seems the most fair?

**TL;DR:** Just found out about an non-specific amount of student loan debt that my in-laws have been taking care of. Now that my wife and I are getting close to being debt free we don't know what we should do about it.",finance

I received a collections notice of a medical bill that is extremely high that I had no idea was there as I thought it was covered under my parents insurance over 6 years ago.

personalfinance,Should I use PLUS student loans to pay off credit card debt?,"I owe a total of $7k in credit card debt across 3 different credit cards with APR ranging from 22-23.4%. I can potentially take out $7k in PLUS loans through my parents on top of what I'm already taking out in PLUS loans this school year and use that to pay off all my credit card debt immediately. This would be advantageous because the interest rate on PLUS loans is 7.08% versus the 22-23.4% interest rate on the credit cards. For the last year or so my parents have been kind enough to help pay minimum payments on my credit cards so that I can focus entirely on school without having to work. If I use the loan to pay the credit card debt, my parents would use the money that they were using to pay off my credit card debt to pay interest on my PLUS loan. I see this as a more impactful contribution in lowering overall debt because minimum payments on cards with &gt;20% APR has a far lower impact. Lastly, I've read a bunch of threads in this subreddit regarding similar topics and many advise against what I am suggesting because I would be trading somewhat erasable debt (credit) for loans I will take with me to the grave. This doesn't bother me because I'm majoring in computer science at University of Maryland, College Park which is a pretty good program ensuring job security and a good starting salary. I think I'll be able to pay off my loans relatively quickly after college. Do you think this is a good idea?

I have said it three times in a row because it is true!

Many of my friends at the investment club I belong to have been saying ""this time is different"" during the latest stock market correction.

Most of us are in our 50s and 60s and have been following the stock market since the 1970s and been seen it all.  But they are saying this feels so very different. They had never seen a President like Trump, a Congress, and Federal Bureaucracy so obedient to a President.  They have never seen a trade war that has so much potential to cause major damage.  They are scared and are thinking about going to cash (CD's) until this all settles out.

I ask them how we will know when to go back into the stock market.  They really don't have an answer.

Many are a few years from retirement and have a minimum investment value before that can feel they are financially independent.  If they lose 30% or more in their balanced portfolio, all bets are off regarding retirement until they get their money back, which may take over ten years. At least a CD interest rate of 3% will stabilize their assets until things settle down.  Then when the time is right we can go back into the stock market.

personalfinance,"Parent Plus Loan was discharged was supposedly discharged in bankruptcy, but four years later I am getting collection calls?","Hello all,

I have an unusual issue that I would be so grateful to get his sub's perspective on. About ten years ago when I was in undergrad, my parents offered to help pay for my education (which I gratefully accepted) so they took out approximately $50,000 in Parent Plus private federal loans to do so. I was putting myself through school at the time and was about to have to go part time to be able to work more and be able to afford my education, but they wanted me to remain full time, and so I thankfully accepted their generous gift.

A few years after graduation, my parent's finances took a very negative turn and they ended up having to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015. Their bankruptcy included the parent plus loans, and was finalized about 4.5 years ago. Since that time, the loans completely fell of both my and their credit reports, and our understanding was it was finished.

Fast forward to a few  weeks ago, and my mom notifies me that the loan companies are now trying to collect on those same loans. My parents bankruptcy recently concluded, and the loan companies are now claiming they owe the full amount plus significant interest.  I checked my credit report and was shocked to see the loans now appearing on my credit report again! My parents are attempting to get in contact with the lawyer who handled their bankruptcy filing, but so far have been unsuccessful in reaching her.

I started getting calls last week from the loan companies, but they have yet to leave any messages. Apparently the loan companies also sent bills addressed to me at my parents home as well, but I just found out about them late last week.

What should I do to proceed? These loans were forgiven and I cannot afford to pay them now. I don't want to pay on an old debt that is beyond the SOL in California, but I am very confused on what to do. I would be so appreciative of any help!!! Thank you so much in advance.",finance

personalfinance,"Contacted about ""new"" student loan that isn't on my credit report","I could use some clarity on why/how this happened.

Background: I got my bachelors between 2010 and 2014 and took out a few small federal loans for 2010-2013. I then immediately went into grad school full time and am still in school until Spring 2020. All of my student loans from undergrad are in deferment because of this. After¬†graduating undergrad Nelnet contacted me almost immediately about servicing my loans. I set up an account and paid off my one unsubsidized loan in the following year. Currently, on Nelnet (and the Equifax credit report I pulled today) the remaining subsidized loans are deferred until Dec 2022 due to my student status (I have no idea how they got that date though).

Last week, I received an email from University Accounting Services saying I had a new statement available. I was pretty confused because as far as I knew Nelnet was servicing all of my loans. I set up a UAS account and I have a small federal Perkins loan that I had completely forgotten about and hadn't heard anything about since taking it out. It had a due date for my first payment set for Sept 1 and had already accrued some interest over the last month.

I pulled my Equifax credit report this morning and it wasn't on there nor was it on the Transunion report I pulled two months ago or the Experian report I pulled a year ago. I called the help line today for UAS and they said that it was transferred from the lender to them in 2018. But there is absolutely no information on the history of the loan or any transactions. All it says is the university, starting balance, current balance, and payment amount.

They also said that since I told them I was a student they would send my status from the National Student Clearinghouse to their deferment auditors and if I was actually a student then they would defer my loans for a single semester and I would have to make the same call the next semester to get my loan put into deferment again (something I've never had to do with Nelnet).

I think I understand most of what is going on. I know that the loan is mine - it is for the correct university and I do vaguely remember qualifying for a bunch of different aid like the Perkins loan in my sophomore year (2011). **I just don't understand why it was ""hidden"" from me for \~8 years and why it has never shown up on my credit report. Is this something that happens frequently? Is there any way I can see the ""history"" of this loan to better understand where it's been between when I took it and now?**

I'm aware I would still get all the benefits at the federal level, but I suppose my question is... how much of a hassle is it to report interest, dividends, and other taxable events? Does Fidelity send out a tax form for this or do I have to go into each statement and manually pull everything?

personalfinance,$4300 worth of medical debt forwarded to collections.,"I'll make this TL:DR style for the sake of time.

I hit a rough patch health wise last year. The billing was very confusing, and I had gotten multiple bills for multiple amounts with no co payment taken out and returned  them back to insurance.

7 months later, I get a call from collections that they have all been forwarded to them.

First thing I said was can i pay it down..  I mean its 4300 and i'm no millionaire. I'm able to just take care of what I need and that's about it. The woman tells me "" You can make payments, but we need 20 percent outright.."" I thought that was ridiculous and scoffed.. I told her "" you want me to pay something that will sit there indefinitely if I don't pay it, and you won't accept a payment without a overly generous ""down payment""""

personalfinance,[Debt] Help me figure out what's a better student loan repayment plan?,"Ok, so...I'm gonna try to break this down.

I have two loan groups:

Subsidized: $16,412 balance with a 4.5% locked interest rate.

Unsubsidized: Outstanding balance of $6,653 with a 4.5% locked interest rate. Currently has $197 (100% rate) in interest.

My two loan groups are currently in deferment because I'm in grad school and they automatically got set to deferment when I enrolled. 

I was in REPAYE before going back to school. In REPAYE, 100% of subsidized interest and 50% of unsubsidized interest is covered for 3 years. After 3 years, it's 50% covered for both. I have one year left of the REPAYE where it's 100% and 50% covered, subsidized and unsubsidized respectively. In deferment, 100% of the subsidized interest is covered and 100% of the unsubsidized interest ACCRUES.

I have 2 more years of my MA program. So, I can either use up the REPAYE year with the 100%/50% interest covered now and then have 1 year of deferment (100%/0% covered) after that, OR I can use the next two years to defer and then have the one year of 100%/50% interest covered left.

personalfinance,To Refinance or Not to Refinance - Reduce Interest Rates,"Hi Everyone,

I bought my first house a year ago with a $255,000 mortgage at 4.5% interest rate.  My monthly payment is $1,525 and I've been regularly paying an additional $100 a month on top of that.  I pay about $80 a month in PMI as I only put down about 8% on a down payment.

Recently, with the lowered national interest rate, I inquired with a lender about possibly refinancing my mortgage and the lender I talked to came back with a few options for me and I wanted to run it by you guys as I'm not really sure what the best course is.  

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1

Refi to new 30 year loan of $253k at 3.625 interest rate.  This drops my monthly to $1,353 all in and cuts the PMI in half to $40 a month.  I would have to pay $2,284 for this new loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

Refi to a new 30 year loan of $253k at 3.875% interest rate.  This drops my monthly to $1,389 all in and still cuts the PMI n half.  Because of the higher interest rate, I only have to pay $412 for the refinance.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3  is to remain at my current loan and keep paying it down.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondered if I could get some advice as it seems like a smart move to at the very least go with option 2, or suck it up and pay the closing costs for the lowest possible interest rate.  I'm slightly hesitant to refi this early in my mortgage, but with those lowered interest rates, it seems like I should be doing it.  Would love to some opinions and advice.  Let me know if you guys need any additional info.

investing,A comprehensive analysis on Spirit Airlines ($SAVE),"In 2017, a Reuters poll showed that U.S flyers preferred cheap tickets over perks and comfort when traveling. Spirit Airlines is a small, but steadily growing ultra-low-cost airline that capitalized early on this trend by introducing ""bare fares"" and ""no frill"" flights, offering relatively cheap base rates for tickets, but charging extra for almost everything else, from choosing seats to bottles of water, essentially unbundling the services that a traditional airline would have included in the price of a normal ticket. Today, we are going to analyze the airline industry, as well as Spirit's operating efficiency, growth, risks, and valuation to ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the underdog airline. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.

###The airline industry

Until recently, airlines were notoriously unprofitable businesses. Fierce competition led to aggressive price cutting, with many airlines losing money on each flight, resulting in massive losses industry-wide. Between 1977 to 2009, the sector suffered combined losses of over $52 billion. However, recent bankruptcies and mergers consolidated the industry, leading to increases in capacity, operating efficiency and overall profitability. In fact, Warren Buffett, who had once called airlines ""a death trap for investors"", now owns a stake in all of the big four U.S airlines: American, United, Delta and Southwest. The big four currently dominate the U.S domestic airline industry, with almost 70% combined market share.

In spite of its history, 2018 marked the 10th consecutive year of profitability for U.S airline industry. Capacity has grown at an average rate of 2.5% each year since 2009, and major U.S airlines carry over 17% more passengers than they did 10 years ago. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the U.S Federal Aviation Administration forecasting a 1.9% average annual growth in passengers over the next two decades.

Operating efficiency is key in the airline business. Airlines run at relatively low margins, so modest increases in unit revenues or decreases in unit costs can tremendously affect overall profitability. For example, the expenses of scheduled flights do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried. Whether a flight is at full capacity or half capacity, the airline will incur similar labor, fuel and other costs. Therefore, on the revenue side, a slight increase in load factor (the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight) may significantly improve the overall profitability of a flight. Similarly, on the cost side, a slight percentage increase in fuel costs could have a materially negative effect on an airline's operating profits.

Labor and fuel costs disproportionately represent overall airline expenses. In 2018, labor and fuel represented approximately 24% and 32% of Spirit's operating expenses respectively. Therefore, an airline's operating efficiency depends highly on its ability to bargain effectively with its labor unions, as well as the pricing and availability of aircraft fuel. Some airlines manage fuel price volatility risk through derivative contracts. Others choose to pay market rates over long periods of time as a form of natural hedging, letting the occasional high price average out the occasional low price.

###Operating Efficiency

As one would expect, Spirit has relatively low unit revenues, given their cheap ticket prices. However, Spirit also has the lowest unit costs in the United States, and therefore has the advantage of being able to maintain profitability at low prices where its competitors cannot.

Spirit maintains another competitive advantage by operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States operated by common flight crews. By operating a single aircraft type, Spirit is able to avoid the costs of training crews across multiple types while also making flight crews interchangeable across all aircraft. Additionally, the average age of an aircraft in Spirit's fleet is only 5.4 years, allowing for comparatively low maintenance costs. However, it is expected that these costs will increase as the fleet ages.

In terms of performance, Spirit has been steadily improving. In 2015, Spirit ranked last among all U.S airlines in on-time arrivals. However, following a management change the following year, Spirit climbed its way to first place in on-time performance in 2018, while continuing to maintain its low costs. Additionally, Spirit's cancellation rate improved from 6% in May 2017 to only 0.56% in the same month the following year.

###Growth

Although Spirit has been around since the 1960s, it only transitioned into its current business model of ultra-low-cost-carrier in 2007. As a pioneer in the ultra-low-cost-carrier space, Spirit's brand reputation has taken a beating over the years for being perceived as excessively stingy (customers were surprised about having to pay for a bottle of water), as well as their poor on-time performance and cancellation rates. However, Spirit's brand has seen steady improvement over recent years as customers became more understanding of their business model, and as late/cancellation rates declined due to operating efficiency improvements. As a result, Spirit has more than doubled its share of the U.S domestic market to 4% in the past six years. It has grown its revenues by 72% over the past five years, and plans to continue growing its capacity in the mid-teens over the next several years. Spirit's ability to grow its earnings will depend mostly on whether or not it can execute on its capacity growth plans and minimize cancellations, while continuing to manage and reduce costs. Over the next few decades, they may see gains from macroeconomic tailwinds, as the air travel market is expected to grow steadily. Additionally, low-cost-carriers have been consistently growing their share of the total air travel market, and if this trend continues, Spirit would be well-positioned to benefit.

###Risks

Spirit is susceptible to many of the same risks as other airlines, including disruptions or cancellations from unexpected weather problems and other factors beyond Spirit's control, rising oil prices and other variable costs, as well as other macroeconomic issues such as economic downturns. However, most of these issues are short-term in nature, and don't pose existential threats to the business. The greatest threat to Spirit's business is increased competition from traditional carriers. Beginning 2015, domestic carriers with far more resources than Spirit began to match lower cost airline pricing in order to compete with Spirit and other low-cost airlines. So far, Spirit has been able to hold its ground, continuing to grow its revenues and market share. However, it is uncertain whether or not Spirit can maintain its rate of growth in such a competitive environment.

Additionally, Spirit's assets are almost 70% funded by debt, due to the large upfront costs of purchasing aircrafts. This could put Spirit in a bad position in the event of an economic downturn. However, this is somewhat offset by Spirit's strong cash position of $1.22 billion compared to its current liabilities of $1.21 billion, resulting in a cash-ratio of 1.01, which is relatively high compared to other airlines. Over the past several years, Spirit has continued to maintain a strong cash position relative to short-term debt, demonstrating their intention to be prepared in the event of an economic downturn.

###Valuation

The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Spirit's earnings will grow at 5% year over year for five years starting July 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 11 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Spirit's present value is approximately $3 billion. Its current market capitalization is about $2.8 billion, meaning that the stock is currently undervalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Spirit at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.

###Conclusion

Despite being an underdog in the U.S domestic airline market, Spirit is a company with relatively strong fundamentals and solid growth potential. However, Wall Street does not seem to agree with this sentiment. Spirit's price/earnings ratio of 8 and price/book value of 1.36 seems to imply very low expectations of growth, despite a history of consistent, moderate growth. If Spirit is able to effectively execute on its growth plans, it may prove to be a very profitable investment at today's prices.",finance

personalfinance,Can save $60k on custom home at age 23. Is it too good to be true?,"Basically, fiancee (24f) and I (23m) graduated college last spring, and we're now living and working in the South bringing home around $83k per year (even split) in our first real jobs. She's a salaried fashion photographer and I'm in marketing for a local home builder. 

I've been working there for about 8 months, and I absolutely love it so far. I've gotten great performance reviews, my boss is amazing, and the company's leadership actually surprised me with a sizeable bonus ($3k) for a big project that I helped lead.

Recently, the company CEO informed me about an employee program that allows us to purchase a house at cost+5%. Essentially, I think it comes to about a 22% discount on a brand-new home in one of the best places to live in the state (growing pretty quickly, and there are a bunch of new jobs being added every year). Super generous, right? 

Neither of us have any student debt (mix of scholarships, strong academics and a graduation gift from my amazing parents), and we both have paid-off cars in decent shape.

We aren't big spenders, aren't planning on having kids, and we have roughly $61k in savings from work dating back to high school. We're getting married next month (her fam is paying for it, thankfully), though, and we're spending about $6k on the honeymoon out of pocket.

We've found a floor plan we love in a brand-new community about 15 minutes outside of the city (great schools, but rural area, tiny yard, and no community amenities) for about $217k (with discount) with all the upgrades we'd like. Base price for us would be $190k. 

Company would normally sell the home (with upgrades) for around $265-280k, I think? The cheapest plan in the community (no discount) starts at $238k, and most will go for about $20k over that, I think. Location-wise, this is probably the only community we can handle, as it's halfway between her work (30 min. out of town) and the city itself.

On its face, it seems like a sweet deal that I'm super blessed to have on the table. I never thought I'd be considering buying a house at my age, especially one as nice as the ones we're looking at.

That said, we're also young and inexperienced, so here's our strategy: We get a 30-year mortgage (hopefully with interest rates around where they are now) but we pay it off like a 15. We put down around $40k as down payment/closing costs. The rest (~$14k post-honeymoon) is our emergency fund/savings. Right now, we pay $1,400 per month in rent, and we still have been saving a good bit monthly.

If you stuck around this long reading, I'd really appreciate any advice you can give.

Here are my concerns:

1. As the real estate market goes, so (probably) will my job. We're doing great right now (already met our sales goals for the year), but who knows how long that'll last. I think my portfolio is strong enough to get another position, and I've freelanced a bit in college, but there's still a little uncertainty there. Parents aren't super wealthy, but we're blessed with a strong support system if the worst happened. Is this too risky, even with the discount?

2. My fiance is a photographer (and pretty necessary at her company, but not irreplaceable. She's super talented, but photography doesn't have great long-term career prospects (that said, she had a 3.97 GPA in undergrad, so grad school is on the table). Is $217k out of our price range?

3. Are we missing something? We've considered an FHA loan, but I think the house might be a little too expensive for that? And we want to go ahead and put down a strong down payment.

4. Because I'm getting such a good deal, I don't think I'm supposed to get a realtor. But since I haven't done this before, I'm concerned with doing this without getting an external expert opinion. Any suggestions for resources? Are there realtors out there that charge the buyer, not the seller? Or that consult?

TL;DR Got a 22% discount on my dream home at 23. Wasn't expecting it, but we're in decent financial shape. Should we go for it?",finance

32 years old. $61,000 salary. 

~$39k in student loans, the majority of which have a 6.8% interest rate.

Current monthly payment - $296

Looking over my payments throughout the last couple of years i've notice that roughly 65%-80% of my payments go straight to paying off interest alone, which leaves me with roughly a $75 payment towards the principal per month. Given my current and long term outlook I don't see the possibility of upping that monthly payment much at all. This is the most aggressive I can get with my payments right now.

If i'm paying only ~$75 towards my principal every month, that means my loans won't be paid off for roughly **43 years.** 

Here's the question - can someone please explain to me why I shouldn't just lower my monthly payment to the bare minimum and enjoy the next 30 or so years of my career with that extra $100+ or so going to a 401k or something else? By the time i'm able to pay off my loans in full wouldn't there have been enough time passed already for them to be forgiven anyways?",finance

personalfinance,"I have enough money to comfortably pay off the rest of my mortgage in full, do I do it?","I took out a $300k mortgage at 4.375% interest a little over 2 years ago (about $10k of principal paid off at this point) to buy a condo. It is the only debt I have as I don't drive and was lucky enough to have my college paid for by parents.  I was also fortunate enough to get a job at Big Tech‚Ñ¢ where I've been working for the past couple years.

I have $180k in savings and $220k in vested shares all for the company I work at, which I feel like I should sell or at least diversify. I already max out my 401(k) each year, but haven't yet put in the effort to set up an IRA.  It seems like I could pay off the rest of my mortgage right now and still have a comfortable amount left over.  

The advice I seem to be getting from a quick check is to pay off debt only if the interest rate is larger than the rate of return of a different investment portfolio.  Since the interest rate is lower compared to the rate of most investments, then it seems to imply I should continue making minimum payments on the mortgage and put the money I would otherwise use to pay off the mortgage into this portfolio, but that feels weird.  Should I take a half-measure and set up much larger monthly payments?

I understand I'll be pretty well off regardless of how I go about paying it off, but I've reached a point where I realize it's not good to have so much money in an undiversified investment, but I don't think it would be much better off sitting in a savings account either.

I don't really have any financial goals or anything I'm saving for.  I generally don't like dealing with or spending money other than on groceries or the occasional book, video game, or meal out. I'm not particularly attached to where I live but also can't imagine a city I would rather be (at least, not within the same country), so a move is unlikely.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

investing,WSJ: Falling Bond Yields Make Equities Hard to Ignore,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/falling-bond-yields-make-equities-hard-to-ignore-11565688603?mod=mhp

&gt; Nearly 60% of S&amp;P 500 stocks offer dividend yield of at least 1.7%, beating 10-year U.S. Treasurys.

A plunge in bond yields has left investors with few alternatives to stocks.

The latest flare-up in trade tensions has quickened investors‚Äô flight to haven assets, pushing bond yields down to their lowest levels in years. Wall Street analysts say the pullback in yields, along with a new phase of monetary loosening by central banks around the world, should give investors a new rallying cry for the second half of the year: ‚ÄúThere is no alternative‚Äù to stocks, known as the Tina effect.

Nearly 60% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 offer a dividend yield of at least 1.7%, according to FactSet, better than the 1.640% yield where 10-year U.S. Treasurys settled Monday. AT&amp;T Inc., T -0.17% cereal maker General Mills Inc. GIS 0.65% and memory chip company Western Digital Corp. WDC -0.17% are among the highest-yielding‚Äîand best performing‚Äîstocks in the index this year. Each has dividend yields of at least 3.6%, while yields across the broad index average about 2%.

The percentage of outperformers is among the highest of the more-than-a-decade-old bull market, says Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services. He added that, on average, about 17% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have carried dividend yields exceeding those of 10-year Treasurys since 1990.

The allure of steady, income-generating stocks is expected to be a stabilizing force for major indexes in the months to come.

‚ÄúThis is a hard period for most investors to navigate through,‚Äù says Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ‚ÄúBut stocks are supported by low bond yields as long as we don‚Äôt have a recession.‚Äù

A mix of trade tensions and fears that growth is slowing around the world have dented the stock market‚Äôs rally. The S&amp;P 500 has stumbled 3.3% so far this month, knocking its year-to-date gain to 15%. Investors, meanwhile, have stepped up their flight to haven assets, pushing bond yields down.

During the pullback, analysts at UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo Investment Institute, among other firms, have been urging investors to buy dividend-generating stocks, especially those that are less susceptible to trade tensions.

Dividends pad stock returns and offer investors a steady stream of income. Taking dividends into account, an S&amp;P 500 index that measures total return is down just 2% this month and remains up nearly 18% for the year.

Dividend-paying stocks can help insulate investors from the worst of a pullback. When the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.6% in May following renewed trade anxieties, a UBS portfolio including Home Depot Inc., HD -1.43% McDonald‚Äôs Corp. MCD -1.80% , JPMorgan Chase JPM -1.88% &amp; Co. and other dividend-paying stocks with below-average exposure to China fell a more modest 3.7%.

Investors, however, need to consider more than just a company‚Äôs share payout, according to analysts. Some of the highest-dividend-yielding stocks are among the market‚Äôs worst performers this year. In some cases, yields are higher because stock prices have fallen. Too high of a yield can be a sign of distress. The dividend yield of the telecom company CenturyLink Inc. CTL 3.90% stands at 9.3%, but shares have slid 26% in the midst of broader turmoil for telecoms.

S&amp;P 500 energy stocks carry a yield of 3.8%, the highest of the broad index‚Äôs 11 major sectors. But worries of a supply glut have hurt shares of energy stocks this year. The sector has slid 8.9% since the end of June, cutting its year-to-date gain to 1.3%.

The disconnect between dividend yields and bond yields can be a factor of tepid economic growth, and it can spill over into the stock market. Take Japan, for example. The Nikkei 225 has had a higher dividend yield than what is offered by 10-year Japanese government bonds for more than a decade, but modest economic growth has weighed on returns. The S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 700% over the past 30 years, compared with a 40% contraction in the Nikkei.

‚ÄúMarkets have to be very confident about the future, as well as the stability of a dividend going forward,‚Äù says John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.

Investors should seek companies that have solid growth trajectories and pay healthy dividends, rather than those that offer the biggest payouts, says Mr. Vail. Utilities and consumer-staples companies, for example, pay some of the highest dividends, but those companies have been fighting pricing pressures and tend to grow more slowly than those in the technology and communications sectors.

Technology companies in the S&amp;P 500 sport a dividend yield of 1.4% and have risen 25% this year, as investors concentrate on companies with the potential to expand sales and profits.

Apple Inc. AAPL -0.25% carries a 1.4% dividend yield, matching the broader sector‚Äôs average, and is up 27% for the year (nearly 29% on a total-return basis). Several companies that pay richer dividends are doing just as well, if not better. Semiconductor company Lam Research Corp. LRCX 0.51% has a 2.3% yield and is up 44% this year, while International Business Machines Corp. ‚Äôs 4.6% yield juices the computing giant‚Äôs total return to 22%, compared with 18% on the basis of price change.

At the same time, stock valuations have improved as major indexes pull back from their July records‚Äîan enticing factor for price-conscious investors who thought shares of many companies were getting expensive.

The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 16.3 times its earnings over the next 12 months, down from more than 17 times in July, according to FactSet. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and other firms say the broad index could comfortably reach a valuation of 18 times by year-end, as long as interest rates fall or remain stagnant.

‚ÄúDividend yields are going to come into play for people looking to nibble at opportunities in the stock market,‚Äù says Mr. Lerner. ‚ÄúEven if you‚Äôre more bearish, then equities that pay dividends are going to help buffer portfolios during periods of uncertainty.‚Äù",finance
personalfinance,"Thoughts on refinancing while rates are ""low""?","Curious what you all think about pros/cons of refinancing, given rates were supposed to rise earlier this year but didn't.

I just purchased my first home last September.

It's a 30yr fixed at 5% interest rate ‚Äî¬†we took seller cash credit upfront to help with down payment ‚Äî¬†but rates at time were \~4.75%.

Loan was originally for $266,000 and down to \~$260,700 principal balance.

Got a ways to go before PMI drops, but I set up auto pay to do 1/12th extra payments every month to try and whittle it down faster. The extra goes straight to principal, no pre-payment penalty.

Seems relative to me, and I don't want to try and time the market ‚Äî but depending on trade war and election stuff etc etc, seems like rates could go even lower.

personalfinance,I can save $8500 (23%) on a new car if I buy it with my Dad - but I'm concerned he'll steal it and leave me with the payments,"I recently changed jobs. My commute went from \~35 miles to 7 miles, my car is terrible on mileage ($60+ per month), and my new work offers free electric car charging. So, I'm in the market for an electric car sometime before the end of the year.

My Dad has an ancient car that recently broke down, and isn't worth fixing. He needs \~3 months for some consulting work to pay off before he can replace his car.

He lives in Colorado, and I don't. His state currently has $8500 more in state &amp; local purchase credits than I can get. This is in addition to the $7500 federal tax credit **he** would get if we bought it under his name &amp; Colorado address.

I'd like to have **both** our names on the title and we'll **both** be financing it with **me as a co-signer** at 0% for 3 years, because I'm 99% sure his credit is a wreck and I'd rather use the 0% for 3 years instead of paying for the car in cash. I intend to instead put the $$ in Vanguard and draw on it for 36 months. (suggestions on what to put it in? \~$17K, and I'll get another $10K in bonuses at the end of the year I've set aside for this purchase)

Here's the catch - **my Dad has been exactly the kind of parent we warn people about every day in this sub**. He already financially ruined my sibling by ""borrowing"" their credit in a business they ""jointly owned"". He seems to have realized he doesn't want to be alienated any more and has changed his ways, but I want to protect myself.

If I do go forward, are there any hiccups you can think of in this plan? He's agreed not to overcharge me any $$ for helping me with this, he just wants to borrow the car for a maximum of 3 months and sell it to me for the purchase price - $7500. He'll likely also get the benefit on his credit report, which I haven't mentioned, because the payments will not be an issue on my end.

Numbers:

1. After Colorado tax credit, energy company incentive, discount with the dealer I've negotiated off MSRP and dealer handling fees, all of which are applied at purchase according to the dealer, the cost is $24,695 + Colorado sales tax = $26,794.
2. I understand $7500 federal tax credit will go to my Dad, and he thinks he has $7500 federal tax liability but isn't sure.
3. That leaves a ""final cost"" of $19,294 for a new EV. The best I can do on a 3-year-old EV that fits my family is about $18-19K, so I'd rather buy new for 3+ extra years of warranty. (The new car has better warranty terms as well)
4. I want my Dad to sign a bill of sale for this car **before** we finance it, dated 3 months from now, where I'm buying the car from him for $19,294 - so I'm sure I legally will own the car and can drop him from the title.
5. I'll pay for the insurance. It's a small price to pay for 3 months when I'm saving $8500 by buying it from him.
6. **edit: I own my current car and it'll sell for \~$17K, so this is a \~$3000 expenditure for me.**

Concerns:

* I don't want to get stuck with $26,794 at 0% over 36 months and end up with no car.
* He might like the car and take it for himself if he gets paid / pays off the loan / just keeps it - with me on the title.
* I'm 90% sure this works out financially but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything - I want to make sure I end up with the loan **and** the car...but nothing else.
* I'm not sure if I'll have to pay my state's sales tax when I buy him out of the car since I technically would be on the title and the loan?",finance

My house is currently worth $340k. My current mortgage balance is $265k@3.875%. Unison will give me $40k for 32% stake in the future change in equity of my house.

Assuming my house goes up in value over 10 years by $100k, I would have to pay them $72k at the time of sale ($40k+$32k). 

This means they net a profit of $32k in 10 years on their $40k investment, with the above assumption. 

Can someone help me calculate what this would be expressed as an interest rate? In other words, if I took out a loan of $40k instead, what is the interest rate that would be equivalent over 10 years to result in a $32k loss to interest?

Also, I have $13k@6.0% in student loans  and a car loan of $8.9k @0.9% (will be paid off in September of next year). I wanted to use part of the $40k to get rid of these two monthly payments and free up $1000 a month for me, which I would want to put into a mutual fund to start saving.

Then I would want to use the other $18.1k for home improvements to add value to my house (kitchen and floors). 

Part of me is wondering if this would be financially irresponsible, which is why I want to try to figure out the interest rate equivalent for that type of ""loan.""

personalfinance,Restructure Debt with Home Equity from Gifted House?,"Hello--

My parents recently gifted my wife and I a house worth approximately $85,000 to $90,000. We live in this house. We are considering using the home equity to restructure our consumer debt and focus on student loans. I was wondering what your opinion on that is. 

Here's a little bit about us. We have two children under three years old. We have a combined income of about $120,000 gross. I work full time, and my wife works part-time. We have a monthly budget and we try to be intentional with our spending and saving. Over the last few years we have paid off about $30,000 of debt, had two children, and completed several major renovations on our house (with mostly me doing the work). We currently try to allocate $2,200 per month to pay down debt. We would like to move in approximately two-three years before our oldest starts school.

Here's information about our debt. We have a total of $123,000 in debt. $42,000 of that is a federal student loan that is on  an income-based repayment plan (meaning the payments don't cover the interest). Another $18,000 is a private student loan. The remaining debt is consumer debt--car loan ($27,000), credit card ($19,000), and a home improvement loan ($16,000) we used to fund some of the house improvements. 

Here's the plan. I'd like to get a fixed-rate home equity loan to pay off everything except the federal student loan. This would total approximately $78,000 and the interest rate at my credit union is 5.8%. I used [Undebt.it](https://Undebt.it) to plot out both payoff plans (paying it straight vs using the home equity loan)--at $2,200 per month, the pay off timeline is approximately the same. 

If I use the home equity loan, the debt would be restructured so that I only have the house payment and the federal loan payment. I could pay the house payment and then use the remainder to focus on the federal loan. If I can kill off the federal loan in 24 months, that only leaves the house payment. Then, when we sell the house, I would have approximately $23,000 in equity that I could use towards a down payment on a new home. It wouldn't be enough to get me to 20% down, but it would be a good start. Then, I could drop PMI once I hit 20% (my credit union allows you to drop PMI once you hit 20%).

Is this a good idea? What am I missing?",finance
investing,"Reuters: Past-due student loans, credit card debt could weigh on U.S. growth","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-debt/past-due-student-loans-credit-card-debt-could-weigh-on-u-s-growth-idUSKCN1V31HA

&gt; While total student loan balances decreased slightly, from $1.49 trillion to $1.48 trillion in the quarter, the share of those loans being left unpaid for several months increased.

&gt; Payments on some 9.9% of student loan balances started being at least 90 days late during the three months that ended in June, compared with 9.4% in the January-March period. 

&gt; A comparable measure shows credit card users, too, are falling behind. Payments on about 5.2% of those balances were 90 days overdue in the latest quarter, up from 5.0% in the first quarter. The figure has been on the rise since 2017. Similar delinquency rates declined for auto loans, home equity lines of credit, mortgages and other debt categories. 

&gt; But fears the U.S.-China trade war and other issues could cloud that economic picture led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 late last month. That could ease pressures for some borrowers and cause consumers to load up on more debt to make purchases, a short-term stimulus for the economy.

It wasn't the paper form with the numbered lines. 

I did not claim exemption to federal or state income tax, and I claimed one personal exemption because I didn't think I had any reason to claim more than one exemption (single, no dependents). However, I was just reading over the tax part of the wiki here and it mentioned claiming 2 exemptions would be appropriate. Why is this, and should fill out a new W-4 before I start? I'm not sure exactly when I'll get my first paycheck, but I had a small summer job I think I also claimed one exemption for. My program also gives tuition waivers, and I'm not sure if I need to figure that in to this somehow.

Also, now that I'm thinking more about it, I think I did check yes for exemption from state and federal income tax on the W-4 for my summer job. I didn't make very much from that job, but with my stipend for the fall it might put my total income for this year slightly over $12,000. Am I going to get in trouble with the IRS for this? Even though that job ended do I need to fill out some form to fix that?

Lastly, the number of exemptions to claim doesn't change even if your income does, right? Apparently graduate students don't always find out about how much they'll be paid for the semester or if they're going to be able to get paid during the summer until pretty soon before that semester starts, so estimating income can be kind of tricky. If I will need to change my W-4 based on changes in income I want to keep that in the back of my mind so I can make sure I do it if necessary.

stocks,Opinion on ROKU,"ROKU has been on fire lately. A lot of analysts compare it to Netflix (NFLX). I don't see why since they don't have the same business model. Plus I find their business model not solving the cable cutter problem and they do not innovate on the smart TV. Why should I buy their product if my tv does exactly the same thing? Am I missing something here or ROKU is clearly in a bubble fed by the recent gain?  
What's your opinion?

personalfinance,"I've been paying college expenses with my credit card until my student loans come in but my payment is due right before the loan refunds will be disbursed, how do I avoid accruing credit card interest until my money comes in?","I moved into an apartment to be closer to school and I've been paying most of those expenses with my credit card. I'm at about $3k of my $10k limit and the payment is due in 5 days. My student loan refunds will be disbursed in the next 5-10 days so it's very likely that I'm going to end up gaining interest on the $3k credit card debt. When the loan refund comes in I'm going to pay the card off in full. 

I'd really like to avoid interest, if possible, because any interest I get negates the points I've earned. I tried calling the card company and asking if they could give me one or two months interest free (because I've heard of that working with other people), but they told me that because interest rate is in the contract they can't change it, even short term.

Is it possible to avoid paying the interest on that $3k by maybe using different keywords or asking for something different when I call? Thank you.

personalfinance,Should I start repaying my student loans early?,"I have about $25,000 in student loans that I took out from 2014-2018. These were Federal Perkins and Stafford Subsidized Loans, so they don't accrue interest until the repayment period begins. Immediately after 2018, I enrolled in a Master's program and my loans were deferred automatically until 2019 when I graduated.

I'm now beginning a Ph.D. program. The loans are in the grace period, but I believe I can defer them again after completing the Graduate Fellowship Deferment Request. My question is whether I should submit this form and delay my payments until after I finish my Ph.D, or if I should start making my monthly payments after this grace period ends.

My current line of thinking is that since the loans do not collect interest until the repayment period, my monthly payment would be the same. However, that amount would be worth less 4-5 years from now. I will most likely have a higher salary after graduating, so the monthly payment would also be a smaller percentage of my net income. However, if I choose this route, this means I will have that debt on my record longer, which I am not sure is a good thing

On the other hand, if I begin paying now, I can't stop making payments. This isn't the worst thing because with my current salary and budget, I can afford the monthly payments for at least the next 4-5 years. However, I think that having a higher salary after graduating, thus making the loan payment a smaller percentage of my budget, might be a better way to plan my finances.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm just unsure which is the right decision",finance
personalfinance,Trying to understand my savings,"I am a 23 year old charter pilot working out of NY and living in CT. I‚Äôm making $60k salary with lots of soft money pushing me into the ~$70k ballpark pre-tax. No debt except for ~$1k in a credit card which I pay off every month. I‚Äôll be at $100k base pay in 3.5 years and realized recently I don‚Äôt understand my savings as well as I think, my father helped me set up a lot of it and he is not good at explaining the theory. I want my money to go as far as it can and I understand a savings account isn‚Äôt the place to do it, and I want to know what I can do now so as my annual raises come through I can be smart with my savings.

My savings theory at the moment is to leave all my paychecks in my credit union checking account throughout the month, then on the first day of a new month I pay the entirety of my bills, rent, credit card, utilities, etc. I move the leftovers (less $500 in case my credit card is denied at some point) from checking to savings. The savings account has a pitiful .1% interest rate so I consider it an emergency fund. Right now it‚Äôs sitting at $5.5k. As the money goes from checking to savings, at every $500 interval ($5k, $5.5k, $6k, etc) whatever odd number remains goes into a Vanguard brokerage account, where it is invested in VTSAX. The brokerage account is sitting at about $7.6k, $500 of which is the Federal Money Market Fund, the rest is VTSAX. I also have a SEP IRA account sitting at ~$10.3k with ~$7k in VMFXX and $3.3k in VTSAX. I have not contributed to the SEP IRA since I started working with my current employer, that money came from working for my father in high school, he directed it to me once I was out of college. I have a 401k that I‚Äôve maxed out my company match at 4% with me putting in 5%. 401k is sitting at ~$4k since it opened in Nov ‚Äò18.

Basically I know my savings account is depreciating over time, so I invest with the long term hope of returns exceeding .1% (should be possible over decades?) but obviously that carries risk, considering the volatility of the market. I haven‚Äôt bothered with anything but VTSAX because I like that it‚Äôs diversified as a fund. I want the ability to buy and sell should I need those funds (hence the brokerage account) and my understanding is that contributing to my IRA will show returns but the funds are unavailable until I‚Äôm near retirement age, same as 401k.

Basically, what could I be doing differently to ensure decent savings growth, and is my understanding of my savings situation accurate?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why MRPH is so strong,"&amp;#x200B;

**1.** The coin has a very low supply, low market cap and has not been discovered.. Yet it is getting huge pilots with notable hundred billion+ companies (L'Oreal) and the US Govt (multiple CBP Pilots).

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** MRPH is solving real problems in supply chain ‚Äî with all of it's capabilities and integrations, companies will want to use MRPH simply because it will save them money.

&amp;#x200B;

* Seamless integration between all blockchains, other DLT's &amp; DHT's, existing ERP systems like SAP &amp; Salesforce, AI &amp; ML protocols, existing logistics platforms like DHL &amp; FedEx, global payment systems like Swift &amp; IBM World Wire, etc., in a simple, unified interface that's as easy to use as ""clicking and dragging"" the integrations in the correct order to set up an automated supply chain workflow.
* GPS tracking + QR codes + Compliance documentation = goods wont be lost or delayed at the border.
* Cold chain triggers (IoT temperature sensors) = perishable foods and medicines guaranteed upon delivery.
* IPFS document generation allows automated trustless document creation &amp; storage.
* Swift integration allows preferred currency conversion rates as well as access to thousands of banks worldwide.
* Congruence / reconciliation of the three major pillars of a supply chain: flow of physical goods, flow of documents and flow of payments.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** Customization of documents. Digitalization leads to less handling ‚Äî 34,000 companies still use bills of lading they print without automation of work flow. Huge room for error and loss of data. A study was done by IBM that there are 40 points of handling for an item being shipped - no central management system. Morpheus Network harmonizes the flow of documents with it's digital fingerprints that, by default, reconciles an entire supply chain worth of documents that originate from disparate, independent systems. Revolutionary!

&amp;#x200B;

**4.** International payment relief for enterprises. Right now there are bottlenecks and high fees when trying to move funds across borders and especially currencies. MRPH will allow company to deal directly peer to peer and thus eliminate the middleman &amp; for a much lower fee (1%).

All in all, MRPH just saves businesses money in every avenue and process that they must leverage to sell their products and make a profit. Companies do not need to own a single MRPH to use the platform. Therefore there are no barriers to entry, be it regulatory restrictions or logistical headaches to acquire tokens. And yet the token powers the platform at the same time -- as it must be transacted on the backend of every event that occurs along the automated workflows. The MRPH token is absolutely vital for every process -- and yet the enterprise won't even know what a MRPH is if they are uninterested.

But all this revolutionary tech and ease of adoption is not necessarily what is most exciting about the project for me as a crypto investor. A project behind a token can have the best technology and make $100s of millions in revenue and yet the token could still be worthless.

The most exciting thing about Morpheus Network is future masternode revenue share. Token holders who have enough MRPH and operate a node will be given a share of annual platform revenue directly from the company. Every other masternode I know of, save a few sketchy IEOs, pays Masternodes nothing but block rewards. I have come to understand that this is a non-value adding mechanism that plays a key role in maintaining a decentralized ecosystem. But it does not make the tokens you earn via mining more valuable. Imagine if you ran a masternode and got a share of revenue that the project earned that quarter rather than measley block rewards. Instead of hoping the tokens you mine gain in market price someday - the amount of tokens you are paid actually drives the price of the token!

Imagine revenue in the hundreds of millions, and a node earning 5x the value of the node itself. This is simple math -- the ROI would be insane, savvy investors will buy the token up to a price where ROI is more like 5%... Driving the price of the token to 100x current value and beyond. This masternode model is the best in crypto. Revenue projections will fuel speculation. The rare occurrence of the success of a crypto company directly correlating to the value of the token.

gaming,"Yet another nostalgia check, Utopia","Does anyone remember Utopia? It was a web browser / text based MMO game where you build your own kingdom and interact with other players kingdoms. You'd choose a race of people, all with certain attributes both positive and negative (ex. undead race doesn't need food but they are weaker or something idr) and when you've sufficiently built up your citizens, armies, resources, and empire -and also waited long enough- the game would take off the training wheels / magic kingdom bubble and throw you to the wolves of a massive multiplayer world complete with allies enemies and many people who know and have a lot more than you.

For those who do remember, is this game still around? I've tried doing a little searching but no results so far, I figure it's probably gone by now but the concept was always interesting to me. Sort of like a programmers take on Age of Empires.

personalfinance,Is a CD my best option?,"Hi all! 

I‚Äôm working overseas making extra $6k every month. This ends in two months when I will go back to my regular engineer job. I am married and plan on having children as well as buying a house sometime between the next 2 to 6 years.  It is likely that I will never make as much money as I am making right now. 

This money is not allocated to anything in my budget. I just paid off my student loans and built my emergency fund up to $15k which is at an online savings account with a competitive interest rate. My only debt is my car, which I love (reliable  Toyota bought new). I still owe $8k but the APR is 0%. I contribute 10% to my retirement with a 5% match. 

I estimate an additional $12 to 15k in my account by the end of this work rotation. I would like to use this for buying a house when my spouse is done with grad school and we find ourselves in a more stable position. 

I do not want to invest and risk this money in the stock market. It also seems to be too much to pile it with the emergency fund. I have never bought a CD, but from the bits I‚Äôve heard and read it seems to be a good option for my situation. Do you think a CD is my best option? If not, please make a recommendation.

personalfinance,How much would I need to save/invest to buy home above my means (salary),"Hi I‚Äôm 22 in college still and will be for another 2 years. I‚Äôm not really going to have an idea of what I‚Äôm going to be making but I‚Äôm trying to get an idea of what my plan to buy a large home will look like when I‚Äôm roughly 45 years old. 

Right now it‚Äôs a very soft goal as I don‚Äôt know what to expect for earning but Ik a home is the one thing I‚Äôd really like to splurge on and live above my means. To do that I‚Äôm planning on investing/saving to do so. My basic thought process is by living below my means early and investing more and with the added benefit of 0 debt I‚Äôll be able to afford more than the standard 30%? of income because I have a large sum to put towards payments as well as the income. 

So my question is how much would I need set aside to buy a $1M home at various incomes like 50k, 75k, 100k etc. Also how would I go about choosing the down payment amount. Considering I‚Äôd plan to live in the home for a long time and interest is about 4% I think my investments will gain more that over time so I should put the standard 20% for optimal interest rate and still have stock market exposure. However the market is volatile so how would that work out if it‚Äôs really far down and I still have a mortgage to pay? Thanks for the help.

Edit lots of responses and lots of help so I‚Äôd like to rephrase with what I have learned. 

So if I made 100k a year I could normally afford about  a 250k home. So to afford the 1M home I would need to put down the difference or 750k?",finance

financialindependence,Increase probability of NOT outliving savings with margin,"A SWR during a market correction has obvious long term risks since you're selling stocks at ""1/2 price"". Many on this forum have discussed (a) larger bond allocations post FIRE (b) bond tents to shelter the early/fragile years (c) adjusting lifestyle (i.e. frugality or side hustle)

I have not read any discussion on margin.  So I'm throwing my idea into the hat

Interactive Brokers has margin rates as low as 2.9% with their tiered pricing.  cheaper than 30 year mortgage rates.   ref:   [https://investorjunkie.com/12389/best-margin-rates/](https://investorjunkie.com/12389/best-margin-rates/) 

During a market correction of over 15% from the peak, I plan to draw my 3.25% SWR on margin for up to three years.  I'll pay back the margin when the market is back to within 5% of the peak. 

random thoughts:

1. It serves as a negative bond from a portfolio management perspective. very cheap capital.  
2. Margin call is not a material risk imo.  If you are drawing &lt;4% for three years, you'll accumulate a total of 12% initial margin.  Never in world history has a market dropped enough to even get close to a margin call at this low leverage ratio. Not to mention that I'm borrowing on margin AFTER the correction started
3. interest rate risk - the material risk here is interest rate risk since margin rates are floating.  However, i'll be borrowing on recessionary periods when the fed cuts rates for an expansionary monetary policy
4. A monte carlo simulation would really help us vet this if we pull all S&amp;P500 history and Fed Funds rate history.  I haven't done the simulation, but I speculate this will reduce longevity risk at SWR above 3.5% relative to other strategies (e.g. bond tents, allocation strategies).  I speculate it will also increase expected value at death

If this is covered in the Wiki and I missed it sorry...

I graduated College in June and am now working full time. Throughout college I took out loans to stay afloat. (total of about $60,000). The loans I took out are a mixed bag of federal subsidized, un-subsidized, and private. (no parent plus). The interest rates on all of these are all over the place, but the largest and oldest of the loans has an interest rate (variable) of 9.6%.

I'm a little lost on what the best financial steps I can/should take are right now. I am making $80,000/yr with a $10,000/yr bonus (coming in January). The company offers a simple IRA and matches up to 3% base salary. I've already decided to max this out. ($13,000/yr).

I also have a car loan of about $20,000

My question essentially is what should my financial priorities be? Should I set up an emergency fund first, or start paying off the 9.6% loan? When I get the $10,000 bonus should I put $6000 of it into a Roth IRA, or put it towards the car, or towards student loans? 

I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the finances that come with real life. Being so young with such a well paying job I'd like to set myself up for financial success if I can.

personalfinance,Most efficient way to get rid of credit card debt with a lump sum.,"Hello PF, please help. 

Situation - My wife passed away a few months ago and I'm just getting to grips with the mountain of credit card debt she left behind, in both our names. She was the higher earner so there's no way I could even keep up with the minimum payments. She did have a small amount of life insurance, but not enough to pay everything off. I want to see if I can stretch it to do just that.

My Question - is there any way to negotiate a settlement with the credit card companies to pay them off in full for less than the balance owed? Kind of like, if they went to collection the CC companies would get pennies on the dollar - can I make that same deal? As it stands, if they didn't make a deal, I would have to let them go to collection anyway so I could prioritize rent.

Details - There are 5 maxed out cards totaling $25K at an average interest rate of 19.5%. There's also a car loan of ~$14K at 4.2% interest, and the car is barely worth $4K.

Bonus question - is there any way I can get out of the car loan for less than the $10K delta between the amount owed and the current value?

I don't care about destroying my credit - it's already low 600's and it's not like I can afford to apply for new credit any time soon anyway. I just need to hold on.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Lender Encouraging Refinance After 6 Months,"My SO and I are first time homeowners who purchased our home in December at an interest rate of 5.25%. Our lender recently reached out with an opportunity to refinance and receive a rate in the mid-3‚Äôs. When we inquired about the cost to refinance our lender let us know they were offering us a credit that would keep our cost to refinance under $1,000. According to lender - this refinance would save us a few hundred dollars a month.

Are there questions we should be asking? This seems too good to be true - anything we should be cautious about? 

We don‚Äôt plan to stay in our current home more than 6-7 years.

personalfinance,Clueless on taxes,"Hi, so first off I am 18 years old and I am honestly pretty clueless on whether my parents are giving me 100% accurate information because everything I read online had different answers. So, I have been making money since I was about 16 I worked a part time job for about a year and made a few grand from that and at the still didn't hear anything about me being involved with taxes and wasn't too sure how any of that worked. After a bit I started hearing some friends talk about getting tax returns and I really had no idea what they were talking about so I asked my parents and they said I was under their name as a dependent so I wouldn't get my own tax return. This made sense to me and I went along with it but at the moment I am ""self-employed"" technically and make all my money at home. I have made a few thousand dollars working at home over the past year or so and I was just curious if that money is ever going to have to be taxed... My parents have never asked me how much I have made they have never said they need tax information or anything related to my income and I am just a bit confused how I am making this money but I don't hear anything about taxes for my name... Anyways, pretty much what they have told me is to not worry about it as I am a ""dependent"" and don't get taxed??? Could someone possibly clear this up for me haha I am really confused and don't want any of this to bite me in the back in the future after finding out I wasn't fed 100% correct information.",finance

I am currently in a position where I need a vehicle. I have poor credit(570) and bring home about $1700-1800  a month. My last vehicle was a beater that became a money pit and was not very reliable. I realize that I'll be subject to unfavorable interest rates with an auto loan if I go the CarMax route, but I'm wondering if its better to pay more but have a reliable vehicle instead of buying another beater. I also plan to begin attending University next year. So PF, does it make more sense to buy a vehicle from CarMax and take on more debt for the sake of reliability, or buy a beater and keep it my costs low? My monthly bills are usually under $500 if that helps. I look forward to your responses.",finance

personalfinance,14 day window during a credit hard pull.,"Question: as I understand it The credit-scoring model recognizes that many consumers shop around for the best interest rates before purchasing a car or home, and that their searching may cause multiple lenders to request their credit report. To compensate for this, multiple auto or mortgage inquiries in any 14-day period are counted as just one inquiry.

Is this the same for credit cards. Because I‚Äôm applying for a mortgage later this year and I want to know if I can use that 14 day window to request credit limit increases on my existing credit cards, as well as apply for new credit cards. The goal is to get my utilization ratio down.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice with company vehicle reimbursement,"I work in the railroad industry and just recently received an offer for a new position in another state starting next month.

I only owe a couple of grand on my existing truck, and it‚Äôs worth around $13k still.  I am still about $20k away from paying off my student loans and total about $35k away from being debt free.  My credit is recovering from a nasty divorce so if I ended up purchasing a newer vehicle within the month I would be paying a pretty high interest rate.  My questions is- do I use the reimbursement for my current truck which would be sometimes insufficient for the companies needs, but would quickly pay down debt.  Or, do I sell it and pay the higher IR, but have something that would cover the company needs?",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card Consolidation Loan For the Gig-Employed,"The number one rule of credit cards is to never use them to pay for things that you don't have the money to cover. I had to break this rule because of a series of family emergencies. I know I was wrong (please direct your rotten tomatoes at me) but now I need to put a plan together to get things back under control before it ruins my life.

I have a few large credit card bills that I need to go away ASAP, because the interest rate there is murder. It'll metastasize there if not removed.

So, I thought, I could take out a personal loan from Sun Trust's Lightstream. Except they want specific employment information. I am an Uber and Lyft driver full time. Even the loan form doesn't make this easy: I currently work for two companies as a contractor, but they want to know when I began working at my employer and how much I make before tips.

So, here are my questions, as best I can articulate them:

1. Is the type of work I'm doing compatible with a credit card consolidation loan like Lightstream's?
2. Do I need to incorporate a pass-thru business for my Uber and Lyft income? I can bring this question to /r/Entrepreneur if more suited, but I wouldn't exactly call myself an entrepreneur

personalfinance,Car buying assistance requested!,"Hello all, first time posting and I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry if anything is weird!

I am a 24 year old female from Oklahoma buying a car by myself for the first time. I don‚Äôt have anyone who can assist me in this so I‚Äôm doing what I can with what I have. 

I‚Äôm looking at a new Honda Insight and the trims I‚Äôm interested in are the EX and Touring models. I‚Äôve gotten some relatively good offers with my best one being $24,000 out the door for a Touring. I took this to a different dealership that had my preferred color and he gave me an offer of $26,700 and wouldn‚Äôt budge. His reasoning was that Honda doesn‚Äôt give very good incentives and he said that someone giving me a price of $24,000 out the door was probably because the vehicle is damaged by hail or something similar. He also told me that he couldn‚Äôt remove any of the added features which I‚Äôve heard is a lie. Someone who used to work as a Honda salesman also told me this was true though. 

From what I‚Äôve read online, the invoice price of a Touring is $26,173, but that doesn‚Äôt include incentives and rebates. My intuition tells me that this guy was lying about the incentives and just wanted me to pay more than I wanted. Can anyone verify or refute his claims? Should I avoid this dealership? 

My general car buying info: I‚Äôm buying new because I like the Insight and the first model year is 2019 other than the discontinued style from 2014. I‚Äôll be putting $8,000-10,000 down and ensuring I get a loan with no prepayment penalties so I can pay the car off by the end of the year if everything goes as planned. I‚Äôve been prequalified for some loans at 4.9% at the lowest. I‚Äôve been thinking about applying at a credit union, but they have to run my credit before they‚Äôll give me a percentage. Is this worth the hard inquiry? Also, should I let the dealership compete for a better interest rate? What would multiple hard inquiries do to my credit score? 

Any other car buying advice would be appreciated as well!

Edit: I applied to the credit union and was approved for 3.6%",finance

Thanks to the effort, Bitcoin showed off its¬† influence from some point on, even the existing financial institutions could not ignored anymore.

¬† But in the process, those who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto began to appear, and at one point such persons began to be murdered without any trace. Joseph, who was a big fan of blockchain and cryptocurrency, was personally and professionally interested, and he sensed that he could do something big as a reporter. It was a really good touch, and became a reality in the end.

¬† (Doorbell ringing)

¬† ""Joseph, are you home?""

¬† Yesterday, Henry, who is Joseph's younger friends from school, rang the doorbell and yelled.

¬† ""Jo, are you in there? Did something happen to you?

¬† (Knocking on the door strongly)

¬† Henry began knocking at the door with frustration.

¬† ""Stop it. I'm coming!""

¬† Joseph opened the door calmly, as if it wasn't the first time this had happened.

¬† ""Hey, what are you doing without answering your phone?""

¬† ""What do you think I did?""

¬† ""Have you been sleeping? Oh my,,, I thought something was wrong.""

¬† Henry was concerned about Joseph and often visits him because Joseph became depressed seriously. But Henry is not always welcomed when visiting and taking care of him .

¬† As going inside the house, Henry saw the article about the scandal on the floor.

¬† ""I think we should go out for some fresh air and to eat. I don't want to see you depressed so pitifully at home""

¬† ""...""

¬† ""Come on, Jo""

¬† When Henry tried to pull him out of the house, Joseph took his hat pretending to not to be able to resist.

¬† It was a normal day as usual, but the world was changing day after day. Especially in the economic field, the whole world is experiencing an era of transformation into a new economic and financial system.

¬† The advent of Bitcoin in early 2009 had a significant impact on the existing status of the US dollar, yen and other currencies, and governments, central banks, and even major companies in developed countries began to seek strategies to take the lead in the new financial era by benchmarking it while keeping an eye on the growth of Bitcoin. When they were ready enough, they calmly waited for the biggest bubble in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, even intervened to make it happened.

¬† However, the moment big bubble broke, major countries have revealed their hidden claws, and the maximum bubble began to burst, Bitcoin slowly descends into glory for several reasons. Meanwhile, China was the first country to seized the opportunity to get token hegemony.

¬† Joseph and Henry, who decided to have brunch, settled down in the corner of their favorite restaurant.

¬† ""I think China was very clever""

¬† Henry spat out as waiting for the menu he had ordered.

¬† ""What are you talking about?""

¬† Joseph replied, looking out the window as if he was not interested.

¬† ""Look. China, which was cracking down on cryptocurrencies at the national level, issued national token based on Proof of Work. It was a big surprising. In some way, they would have preferred the most intuitive and straightforward method of proof as a one-party state, and they were probably confident that they wouldn't lose the computing power initiative based on the abundance of energy resources. What's interesting is that the token name is ONE. I think it was derived from the national slogan 'One China', but it's ironic that network on Proof of Work could bifurcate at any time""

¬† ""That's reasonable explanation""

¬† Joseph said bluntly as getting the ordered meal as if he were slightly interested in talking.

¬† ""Another interesting thing is that China issued 1.5 billion tokens. They seem to have set the volume to fit its population, meaning one token for one person, and it revealed China's socialist characteristics in that way""

¬† ""Maybe it's true. China's socialism, highlighted by Deng Xiaoping in the past, highlighted everyone becoming wealthy under the Communist Party's leadership. And based one the socialism, it outwardly appealed to the people that each person can have one token, while inwardly controlling hash power to roll in money just like the way the vested interests did in the past. This is it. They pretended not to be interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies but spent a lot of money in researching behind the scene""

¬† Joseph finally gave his opinion as showing off his knowledge.

¬† ""Wow, you are awesome, Jo. Anyway, I think it's a bit scary how China has been through because they are still trying to emerge as a global hegemonic power over the U.S., even after they experienced trade dispute were with the U.S. and then wept away by civil war""

¬† ""In that sense, the U.S. accepted the token economy in their way and turned it into a token economy democracy.""

¬† ""I know what and why they did. As we know, there are 50 states in the U.S., and they have the same numer of validators. In particular, I think it was Hail Mary that they issued national token based on Delegated Proof of Stake(DPoS). That way, they can measure how much the value of local brand is through competition in good faith while maintaining communities' uniqueness. More surprisingly, they could keep U.S.' unique electoral voting system based on DPoS in every election including the presidential election""

¬† ""Maybe it was good to get election campaign fund at first. Actually, it was easier to pay cryptocurrency than fiat money, and at that time, it was a lot better to get cryptocurrencies because their price showed a constant boost. The politicians who knew much about cryptocurrencies won their elections, and even the president who was friendly toward cryptocurrencies, sympathized with pro-cryptocurrency Congress, and they altogether made the new thing called 'the tokenized economic system'. Even the Federal Reserve colluded with the administration and Congress on the condition that it maintained its existing mandate and power. Only ordinary people worshipped the innovation and then had nothing left in the end""

¬† ""Well, this is another story but ordinary people like the basic income system though. As artificial intelligence became common, our jobs were threatened first. In the old industrial revolution, we expected that new technology would create new jobs. But this time it's totally off the mark. In that mood, there was a consensus on the introduction of the basic income system. We've solved the problems of the basic income system in the past: lack of tax revenue and distribution of the revenue. But the problems were solved by issuing token. It also reduced the cash in the underground economy. I feel like a new world has influenced in many ways""

¬† ""That's because we've now got a mature society where people could be satisfied with their basic income and happily do what they really wanted to do. Fortunately, we've established a lot of places to use the token income rapidly. The bottom line is that both basic income and token focus on utilization, not possession. So far, it's been successful""

¬† ""There you go, Jo! As you said, the token system was a timely technology and policy.""

¬† Joseph finished the meal with a slight frown shrugging off compliments.

¬† ""Satoshi Scandal...""

¬† Joseph exhaled as small as a sigh.

¬† The scandal began with a well-known Australian developer who was one of victims in a series of murders where those who claimed they were real Satoshi were killed one by one. The way of killing was cruel and the scenes of the killing were as dispersed: the US, China, Europe, Asia and so on. While cryptocurrency supporters got widly excited about that, the national investigative agencies just looked incompetenct in the serial killings for slow investigations. Soon after, they began tracking it in a worldwide collaboration. At the same time, Joseph was inspired by his animal instinct and persistent research finally pointed Satoshi out as the serial killer, and this scandal was his biggest scoop.

https://i.redd.it/o6kj8wy3vbg31.jpg

¬† As a result, Joseph became a star journalist, and registered his personal token, then his personal token exchange rate skyrocketed. He even established a one-man media company with his name, making himself a famous journalist.

¬† However, when the world's most collaborative investigative agencies fell into the sidekick of the scandal, the governments and authorities of those countries involved in the investigation have rather sacked Joseph through media brainwashing and have accused him of being a serial killer. When Joseph was in the midst of popularity and persecution, the joint investigation authorities were closing in on a suspect of serial killing.

¬† Eventually, the suspect committed suicide, leaving behind a suicide note with a private key in Satoshi wallet containing one million bitcoin. So the scandal of the century came to an end, and Joseph remained an issuemaker for a while at the same time as the charges were cleared. Meanwhile, Bitcoin marked the last rally for the highest market ever since the scandal.¬†

¬† ""Since then, Bitcoin used its last strength...""

¬† ""What? What did you just say, Jo?""

¬† ""No, it's not a big deal. Let's get out of here""

¬† Joseph went outside with Henry in a hurry.

¬† Some days later, Joseph stopped by his favorite bar and sat on the place where he always sit. He just sat staring for some minutes, listening to bar songs. But soon, all kinds of thoughts came across his mind. He didn't want to admit it, but he'd rather die than being treated like a has-been because of his damn pride. What's more annoying is the reality of Joseph's personal token exchange rate, which has been on the decline.

¬† It has not been long since there has been the individual token system, but it has become a global trend with demand exploding, mainly for influential people. With the introduction of the token economy system in full swing by country, financial authorities were able to make personal tokens that is linked to the national token through screening by the financial authorities, and these individual tokens were valued according to the national token in real time. The national token is based on the median wage of employees in the country, so higher than 1 means more than the middle class, and lower than 1 means there is no economic leeway. If you comply with the regulations of the authorities, you'll be able to build many business models based on individual tokens such as staking, loans, dividends and so on. Indeed, new era has come when individuals have become small economic players, and big individuals and corporations with influence are second only to a single bank or financial system.

¬† '0.65382139'

¬† Joseph's personal token exchange rate blinked on his smartwatch screen. Since he made him famous with the scandal then, his token rate was ten times more than the current rate but the reality is harsh now. Nevertheless, the reason for living his life is that there are people who support me like Henry with the faint hope that one day he will be able to hit another jackpot.

¬† Henry, his younger alumni, has been working as an influencer in a decentralized autonomous organization(DAO) created by a well-known businessman. While one had a single identity as a nation's citizen, they now has another strong identity in the token community where each belongs. Feeling the same sense of homogeneity in the same community, participants are engaged in social activities aside from one's nationality and religion, and are also engaged in token-based consumption activities.

¬† Joseph suddenly wanted to see Henry, but decided to have his own time this time.

He took a laptop out of his bag to write a column, trying to ignore his crumbling pride. Maybe it was because of the slight drunkenness, he wanted to write an article about a serious topic.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

*„ÄåReturn to Sash caused by aliases and anonymity, coincident or inevitable?„Äç*

*Bitcoin, which was released in early 2009, paved the way for cryptocurrency transactions that can be traced through distributed ledger technology thanks to 'aliases', although it can't certain who the transaction participants are. However, 'aliases' evolved to 'anonymity' as it met the desire to protect personal information that was close to human instincts over time, and eventually combined with advanced electronic cryptology and a huge token economy. Indeed, swiss bank accounts that anyone wanted to have went into their digital asset wallets. But no matter how anonymous it is, the moment a technical defect occurs or is transferred to a non-anonymous coin, its anonymity disappears and the transaction details may be exposed. Meanwhile, the government believed that they had secured a master key to open the token world by establishing a perfect token tracking system that would be possible to trace any transactions. But unlike that judgment, when the token economy permeates the daily lives of the whole generation, the token system with anonymity technology spread to the world without any problem. And then developed countries that have studied and monitored token system for a long time finally concluded that leaving uncontrollable anonymity and token economy would be such a handicap to gain vested interests in the future. This life-and-death check created unexpected repercussions: conflicts between the old and new generation.*

https://i.redd.it/qzr8h698vbg31.jpg

  *The old generation, who was still accustomed to cash, began to return to cash in protest against the government and the young generation, who recognized tokens as daily currency from their birth, ridiculed the old generation and used them even more as the government kept them in check. By then, however, a fatal flaw in the anonymity protocol occurred and there was a great confusion when the biggest bubble in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin fell at a similar time. In conclusion, there was a rift in trust and support for decentralized tokens due to their aliases and anonymity which were considered safe, transparent and able to protect personal information. Also, major crypocurrencies, which had high brand value, just survived and became a means of preserving anarchists' assets. At the same time, some developed countries have been eager to promote national tokens, claiming that the only reliable assets including even anonymous tokens can be developed well only by nation. Is it just a coincidence or is it inevitable that all the suspicious events took place in this process?*

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

¬† Joseph suddenly lost his concentration wondering whether it was hard to write or it was because of a drunkenness. And he decided to edit it later and got out of the bar. There were many people on the streets friday night, and he strode home past the crowd. No one in the crowd recognized him unlike the past, but he still remembered himself and people back then. After the Satoshi scandal, many expected more provocative and conspiratorial articles from Joseph but he hated it. However, he instinctively began to pour out attention-grabbing articles to keep his fans from being forgotten. Was that a wrong judgment? He had had his day after the cryptocurrency bubble burst. Like so many tokens, he also lost his own value because he failed to show sustainable talent. But tonight he wrote for a long time and felt like he's back in the old days. As if he wants someone to know his feeling of pride, he is lost in his thoughts again sitting on a roadside bench and watch people passing by.

¬† Although current Bitcoin's symbolism and impact has been considerably ruined compared to that of its former, he thought it was 'falling of glory' that would one day happen anyway. Because Bitcoin has shown enough value and possibility, other token projects have experienced less trial and error and are able to settle at a faster rate, and Mass adoption of the token has built up a big industry and brought forth a new paradigm for real economy.

¬† The point here is why it fell from glory. It is widely believed that the reason was not one, but exploded at a certain time with a variety of reasons.

¬† First of all, the scandal turned Satoshi¬†out to be a brutal figure, who had had apparently existed but not at the same time. Some even raised the conspiracy that Satoshi's suicide note with the private key on his wallet was fabricated by the government or authorities, and that the real killer was definitely a puppet of the authority. Whether it's true or not, what's clear is that Satoshi is recognized as a cruel being in most people's brains.

¬† Another reason is the ambivalence of the token. Although the Internet, for example, has shown immediate news and innovation that has given birth to big data in the past, many events and accidents that might have been ignored quietly, have spread rapidly throughout the world through the Internet. Eventually, the Internet platform turned into a political propaganda tool that the world is violent and so must¬†be able to calm the turmoil only with force. The blockchain, which is more than Internet-wide and highly leveraged, has also had a special economic mechanism called 'token', although it has built a huge distributed network and instant digital community like Internet. But when this trait combined with human greed and crowd psychology, a 'New Totalitarianism' has been triggered. This was possible because the extreme supporters of Bitcoin and the anarchists built up spiritual solidarity, feeling homogeneity with each other, and tokens including Bitcoin became their economic basis. New totalitarian community that transcended nationality was inspired by the cunning incitement of shadow governance, causing bloodshed and terrorism in many parts of the world. And in doing so, such events drew the limits of Satoshi's spirit on its own. Then, Satoshi became a negative perception among people asid from the image that he was just a murderer.

¬† However, there is a certain reason for its fall of glory: its bubble is over. As Satoshi was finally found to be a serial killer who committed suicide, Bitcoin recorded the highest-ever rally, and presented the biggest bubble ever in history. But soon the marketcap of cryptocurrency shrank due to the lack of network security affected by the endless political squabbling of ASIC mining groups or other big groups and the intervention of the market by powerful institutions that looked at Bitcoin as an eyesore.

¬† Joseph suddenly became confused as thinking about the rise and fall of bitcoin he had covered in the past. He just wanted to go home for a rest. Looking back on bitcoin's history, which once raised expectations that it would replace u.s. dollar as well as gold, he felt some similarity with it because it was over-rapped with his history.

¬† When he arrived at the front of the house and opened the front door, he saw something through a gap under the door. He found a briefcase stuck in a gap under the door and began to figure out what it was. He reached out and carefully pulled the corner of the envelope, wondering who stabbed a newspaper or something that he didn't subscribe to. And he found four letters written just below it, along with the words 'supreme confidentiality'.

After doing some initial calculations I saw that even at an interest rate of 3.5 my monthly payment is still the same.

I was born at The Ohio State University Hospital and spent the first nine months of my life in a foster home before being adopted and raised on the east side of Columbus by a Columbus Public Schools teacher. My mother, an immigrant from Trinidad, supported me and my brother while facing constant financial stress throughout our childhood. However, I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Despite my mother's hard work, and my own, I know that I would not be where I am today without significant support from the Columbus community and programs such as the Ron Brown Scholar Program, which enabled me to attend and earn a BA from Tufts, an MA from Princeton, and a JD from Stanford. 

I cut my teeth at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) protecting consumers against predatory lenders and more recently at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), which invests in systematically under-resourced communities. 

I am running to represent the working people of Columbus, because 36 years ago, Central Ohio gave me‚Äîa newborn with an uncertain future‚Äîa chance to succeed. 

My platform (in no particular order) includes: 

- Universal Child Care and Early Learning 
- A Federal Jobs Guarantee 
- Tuition-Free Public College 
- Universal Income 
- A Federal Minimum Living Wage 
- Medicare for All 
- Systemic reparations

personalfinance,Should I be making traditional or roth contributions to my 401(k) with a large sum of student debt?,"I have been making Roth contributions to my 401(k) since I started at my job about 14 months ago; as at the time I understood that the taxes would be taken out now; and I would be able to withdraw tax free when that time ultimately comes.

However in doing a bit more research, I am wondering if traditional contributions are what I should be doing. It is my understanding that I would reduce my current tax liability and would also have more cash on hand, which I know to be effective if you **invest** that leftover cash.

The thing is, I have a shade under $80k in student loan debt that I am currently paying off. Year 2 of a 10 year plan. My minimums are about $900 and I usually auto-debit $1200/month and throw anything I don't spend in a month's time at the loan.

Being that traditional 401(k) contributions would leave me with extra cash on hand, could I technically leverage this money to pay my student debt down faster? Or would this not necessarily be seen as an investment?

FWIW-- I make $77k pre-tax; not too well-versed in tax-brackets and if I am nearing the next level up.

Edit: My average interest rate on all of my debt is about 5.5% -- my employer matches $0.50 on the dollar up to 4%, I contribute 4%",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage situation do I need more discipline? Should I worry?,"Ok so we bought a $330k house with a 5% down payment landing a 3.5% interest rate 30 years.

Monthly payment (mortgage, PMI, escrow) is 1800.  We came from a $850 month mortgage in a small house and wish i could‚Äôve stayed there forever but the neighborhood and other factors... i shoulda save for the 20% down !!!

Anyhow my take home is $4462 a month.
My wife is $1710 a month.  6172 total so mortgage is about 34% of our take home.

Things were ok then we had a baby!  Lol... love her so much but daycare is $800 a month!

So we are at 3572 just about still plenty of money..  $450 student loan ($350 by end of year).  $3122 left.

$300 to savings
$250 electric worse case
$150 water bill worse case
Netflix/amazon $25
Cable $50
Phone $100
Car insurance $150
Gym $100
Yearly expenses $100 (termite , car tax)

3122- 1225  = 1897 left for gas/food/shopping

Shouldn‚Äôt that be plenty for a month?  I think I have a spending problem and I guess I need some encouragement.  It should get easier as daycare goes away and student loans but we‚Äôll need new cars soon.  

My credit card is about $5k ... I just have to chip away and stay away from Costco etc.

Started eating at home, making lunches, stopped shopping.  I‚Äôm not sure the mortgage is what‚Äôs getting me or our bad spending habits.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance to a variable rate HELOC?,"10 years ago I took out a home equity loan. Due to poor financial decisions on my part, my credit score at the time was horrible and my interest rate for the loan is 9.85%. I have a little over 5 years left on the loan (November 2024 pay off date). My bank called me after the prime rate was lowered to see about refinancing my loan. I went in to get everything started and found out that it is for a variable rate HELOC. I have never had this type of loan before and I am a little leery of it considering everything I have heard about variable rates, balloon payments, possible early repayment penalties, etc.  I realize that the interest rate will be lower initially, I am just worried about it going up. They are showing me a variable rate of 7.43%. If I have the payment auto debited from my account with them then they will also grant me a rate discount of 1%. 
Currently the principle amount owed on my home equity loan is $15,480.04
Min. amount due is $319.21
I have also considered taking out a loan from my 401k to pay this off, the interest rate for repayment of that is a fixed 6.5%.

personalfinance,Need advice about debt reduction (Canada),"Hey, thanks in advance for your help and any advice you can provide.
I currently have a large amount owing on a credit card (10 000) and another large loc (student loan) that's at 17000
The interest on cc is 25, on loc 19
I work for a nonprofit and make 26/hr Ft, been there for 5 years.
I own a house and have had it for two years and three months. The loan amount for the mortgage was 258 560 when purchased. Monthly payments including property taxes is 1560 a month. The house is co-owned (I bought with someone, so we are both on mortgage title, but not common law/partners), we each pay half of everything and it comes out to be about 1100 per person for all house bills and mortgage. 
Car payment and insurance are 600. 
I have reached out to every debt consolidator, and bank I can think of. All have denied the loan due to the mortgage being under my name. Even though we both pay, they say if he were to stop paying or die I'd be responsible. Which makes sense. But I'm at the point where I'm not making headway due to high interest rates, that's why I tried to consolidate. I have been unsuccessful so far, and turned away from most banks (except my own but the interest rate was very high). 
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to properly and effectively work towards paying this debt? Getting a second job is not possible as I am on call 24/7 with the job I currently have and often will have to drop whatever I'm doing and head in. With consolidation seeming impossible, is there some trick to paying This off? Right now I'm barely able to cover the interest payments let alone make headway. 
Thanks in advance and please, no lectures about my high debt... My reasons are valid and due to family issues but noone wants to hear a tiny violin playing in the background, so I'll spare the details.",finance

personalfinance,My dad has Alzheimer's and is no longer able to participate in my parents' financial planning. I am trying to step up to help my mom with her finances and I need help.,"I‚Äôm seeking feedback and advice on a weird and complex set of interrelated circumstances involving my mom‚Äôs retirement planning, Medicaid annuities, and market volatility. 

Some background: A few years ago, I dropped out of undergrad to move back home and help my mom take care of my dad, who has Alzheimer‚Äôs. I‚Äôm in my late twenties, my dad is 69, and my mom is 57. Up until recently, I wasn‚Äôt very much aware of my parents‚Äô financial situation. My dad used to do basically all of their finances, but today he‚Äôs totally unable. For perspective, I help him to shower, shave, dress, etc. daily. He no longer knows the value of a dollar. So, recently, I‚Äôve tried to take a very active role in strategizing finances with my mom and her financial advisor and our Medicaid lawyer. We have a Medicaid lawyer because, sooner than later, my dad will have to move into long term care (my mom and I estimate in the most optimistic scenario, seven-ish years. Realistically, we both think it‚Äôs closer to two). Long term care costs about $10,000/mo. Yikes.

I am not highly financially literate, so this has all been a bit overwhelming (but also fascinating, and kind of fun). 

A quick summary of parents‚Äô finances:

* My mom has a job with good job security, and an annual salary of $85,000
* My mom has an investment account worth $185,000:
   * 403b worth $40,000 (four investments)
   * IRA rollover $144,000 (11 investments, mostly bonds)
* My mom has a 401k with her job, the total value of which is $413,000
   * 21% guaranteed
   * 43.4% equities
   * 8.85% real estate
   * 19.5% fixed income
   * 0.02% multi-asset
* My dad‚Äôs social security check is $1700/mo
* My dad‚Äôs pension is $1100/mo
* My dad also has about $60,000 in preferred stock (in distribution mode, so an income stream that goes towards my dad‚Äôs short term care and we‚Äôre also considering using some of this to pay off the house. We would really like to be spending this down before he goes into a long term care facility, but we don‚Äôt want to cash in the whole thing because my parents are in the 22% tax bracket and obviously don‚Äôt want to just add 60k to their income).
* My mom‚Äôs monthly take home: $3600 ($3200 goes to dental insurance, health savings account, long term disability, medical premium, investment accounts, federal tax, FICA, state income tax, etc.)

So. The problem: my mom would like to retire when she‚Äôs 70, at the very earliest. She loves her work and wants to continue working for as long as possible, and my dad at some point will need to go into long term care.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: in order to qualify for a Medicaid annuity, Medicaid says: you can keep your house, you can keep one car (we have two), you can keep $119k cash, and you can keep your retirement 401k, but everything else has to be liquidated to pay for the first 60ish% of long term care (meaning my mom would pay 6k/mo out of pocket and Medicaid foots the rest. Once her eligible assets have been liquidated to pay for my dad‚Äôs care, Medicaid pays for all of it). 

My mom has an investment account managed by an investment/insurance firm and it consists of a 403b ($40,000, four bonds) and an IRA rollover ($144,000, 11 bonds. These all used to be equities, but my mom, concerned about recession about a year ago moved the equities into bonds and with dumb luck accidentally timed the market to realize 10% growth). This account, which totals about $184,000, is my mom‚Äôs most liquid asset. If my dad went into long term care tomorrow, Medicaid would take $65,000 from this account, as well as a car (we have two), and let us keep our house (valued at about $450,000‚Äîwe have $300,000 paid off). 

She also has $413,000 in her 401k with her employer, and in an ideal world would like to enjoy market growth until she‚Äôs about 70 so she can comfortably retire with closer to a million (we‚Äôll get into this in a sec, because the markets are obviously a big question mark in this whole equation). 

This last year, she took a sabbatical (college professor) for half her salary in order to work on publishing writing projects. Last year was obviously tight, and she has almost no liquid cash in savings / under the mattress / anywhere. The most of her liquidity is in the $185,000 rollover IRA and 403b. The financial advisor who manages that account knows about my mom‚Äôs and my market uneasiness, and we met with him a few days ago to see about making her assets even safer. He suggested a product from Brighthouse Financial called a Shield Annuity. On its face, this looked like a great idea (he told us he himself has $100,000 in the same product and recommends we do the same). The idea behind the Shield Annuity is that it‚Äôs an equity-indexed annuity that has different ‚Äúshield‚Äù levels that protect the contract holder from negative market swings. There are three levels, Shield 10, Shield 15, and Shield 25. Shield 10 is a 1 year contract that, in the event that the market loses more than 10% of its value, the insurer (Brighthouse) would eat the first 10% in losses. E.G., if market drops 15% in the next year we only realize 5% in losses. Our advisor recommended we put $100,000 of the $184,000 he manages in this Shield Annuity (30% in a 1 year contract with 10% shield; 30% in a 3 year contract with 15% shield; and 40% in a 6 year contract with 25% shield). On face, sounds great. But, there‚Äôs caps on growth. The 1 year is 10% and the 3 year is 32%, etc. Also it‚Äôs super illiquid. You can cash out 10% before the contract expires at no cost, but anything more than that and it‚Äôs a 7% fee. This seems like a bad idea to me because what if have an emergency or need liquidity for whatever reason? It seems like whatever you trade for hedging against market losses you pay for in high illiquidity, fees, and growth caps. Given our circumstances, is this something it sounds like we want to pursue? Or run for the hills?

I guess my final, and most global question is: does it make more sense to protect my mom‚Äôs basically illiquid nest egg from the market and move her investments into safer vehicles that might miss out on growth? In a worst case scenario of global meltdown, Brighthouse is insolvent anyway. It‚Äôs my opinion that she should move everything into the safest vehicles possible (bonds?). I would so much rather see her with just ~700k in ten years, having missed out 300k in potential market growth than the scenario of a market recession or collapse and she‚Äôs left with 200k or nothing. Obviously we can always sell the house in an emergency, but would prefer to avoid entirely if at all possible. It‚Äôs probably our most stable asset, and we expect it to keep appreciating.

Sorry if this is scattered, there‚Äôs just a million things going on here and it‚Äôs all new and confusing to me and any perspective at all is appreciated. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: if my dad goes into long term care before my mom turns 65, she gets to protect her retirement 401k from Medicaid. If he goes into care after she turns 65, Medicaid can eviscerate that 401k, which is basically my mom‚Äôs whole retirement nest egg. My mom ideally wants to grow her total investments (~$600,000, not including house) into ~$1,000,000 over the next decade, but that‚Äôs going to be hard to do in bonds. She‚Äôs in bonds because she‚Äôs cautious about being too long on equities with the prospects of market volatility, recession, even depression. It would be ruinous for her if the market took a nosedive. I personally think she is way, way too exposed. Should we try to get her investments into even safer vehicles at the expense of missing out on growth and perhaps even look to invest a bit in some short hedge, like gold? HALP",finance
personalfinance,Don‚Äôt Refinance for Six Months?,"TLDR - can‚Äôt find a prepayment penalty clause in my loan docs. Am I ok to refinance even though the dealer told me to wait?

I recently purchased a new car and financed at the dealership. Usually I bring my own check, but this time I didn‚Äôt. 

Anyway, the interest rate was a bit on the high side and I mentioned to the finance person that I would just refi with my credit union. She said not to do that for 6 months, then a little later I brought it up again and she said 12. She also mentioned that it was difficult to get me financed because I didn‚Äôt have an open installment loan which I‚Äôm pretty sure was bs because I have excellent credit and a mortgage. That said, I didn‚Äôt go into it much as I was ready to be home with the new car so I agreed, signed the docs, and went on my way. 

It‚Äôs been 3 months and I‚Äôm thinking about the refi so I grabbed my sale documents to find the time period and there‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôve read it through a few times and don‚Äôt see a financing discount or a clause about early payment penalties. I contacted the bank where the loan is from and asked for a copy of the loan disclosures and they sent yet another copy of my sale paperwork from the dealership. 

So now I‚Äôm wondering if I should keep asking or just assume that I‚Äôm in the clear? I‚Äôd like to refi asap.",finance

I have a credit score of 737 or 730 depending on where I check, but I've only had a credit card for two years. My credit consists of one credit card I use regularly and pay off in full, one I don't use, and a mix of student loans (some federal and some private).

I haven't had a regular job in a while (gig economy as of now) due to moving frequently for school but I'll probably have a regular part time job for the school year and then find something full time where I plan on living when I get to that point. Issue is as of right now, my income is pretty low. I can't even get approved for a Kohls card despite my score because my income is so low. I'm hoping this gets better with the new job this school year, but I'm afraid I won't have enough history of a steady job to get a mortgage or an apartment, even if I get something full time where I want to move.

I want something just outside Philadelphia in commuting distance of Temple University because I plan on applying to law school there.  Right now I'm looking at apartments in the $800s to split with my partner, who has the same income history and no credit at all.  I don't know if we'd be able to get a cosigner or not, if that's even a thing for apartments.  But really, I'd prefer a house. But I don't think that's possible with little to no money saved up....

I am 28/m and just sold my first house (in a week) and purchased my second house (this past week). First house was bought for $282K and sold for $351K after just over 3 years of owning. I had 20% down on the first one, with an outstanding mortgage balance with a financial institution at closing of approx $207K - netting me approx. $116K to ""roll"" into my new house as down payment ($465K purchase price). 

I purchased my new house this past week through a private financing arrangement with a family member who purchased my new residence in cash, with the plan for me to repay him via a traditional 30yr mortgage at a rate pretty close to the Fed AFR rate - which as of August is about 2.37% for long-term loans. **I am very fortunate to have this situation as we could not have afforded the house otherwise with mine and my s/o's salaries alone.** (Would have been very house poor paying approx 50% of take-home towards housing each month) 

My only concerns are now are that the credit is no longer being reported to a credit bureau as the loan is private and not being reported. **Does this matter?

I have 3 CC's, and a PayPal credit line totaling approx. **$50K in available credit**, of which rarely more than $7K is used on any given month. The CC's are **always paid off each month. I have no late payments.** 

Is it a meaningless concern that I have surrounding not having the new debt being reported to the credit bureaus? I would assume that I can expect my credit score to rise substantially upon the payoff of my existing mortgage given the debt will no longer be on my history?",finance

Economics,The low interest rate has me worried about all the recession talk lately if things stay true to recent-ish history.,[removed],finance
economy,The low interest rate has me worried about all the recession talk lately if things stay true to recent-ish history.,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not an expert on this topic. I'm more a history guy but I think in this situation the history might matter quite a bit. Typically the Fed drops rates to help stimulate the economy in a recession but it's only at 2.25% right now which I think is a big problem if things go south like some people are predicting. For comparison here's some history.

The US first went partially off the gold standard, a.k.a. [The Bretton Woods System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) in 1971 because of lots of reasons that basically boiled down to the US not having enough gold to cover the dollars held by foreign institutions and what reserves we had were being depleted. (Whether you think this was a good or bad idea doesn't really matter in this discussion, only that it happened.) This started a whole series of reactions around the world that soon lead to rapid inflation. Nixon made things worse with wage and price controls and by devaluing the dollar even more. 

The Fed tried to stop this inflation by raising rates but it didn't really work and by the end of 73 the interest rate was over 10% but inflation was over 12%, the Oil Embargo was in full swing, and the country was in a recession. It was [stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation). The Fed continued to raise rates peaking at just under 13% in July without it helping the recession or slowing inflation so they changed policy and just went at the recession dropping the rate over 7% in less than a year to around 5.5% and the recession finally ended in March of 75. 

At this point the country was smack dab in the middle of ""The Great Inflation"", the causes of which basically depend on which economist you happen to be listening to or reading at that moment but basically boil down to lots of people being shady, wrong, or both. So the rates went right back up to combat it to no avail. From 4.6% in Jan of 77 to 6.7% in Jan of 78 to 10% in Jan of 79 to eventually over 20%. This brought about a lot of rethinking in monetary policy and changes at the Fed but the modus operandi for dealing with a recession basically stayed the same.

When a recession happened in Jan 1980, possibly caused in part by the changes at the Fed to combat inflation which included a drastic rate hike, the rate was at 14% it kept up for the next few months hitting almost 18% in April then being dropped drastically to 9% by July when the recession ended. Kind of. Rates started back up in Sept 80 and by Jan 81 they were over 19%. This coupled with the high inflation and jobless rate helped usher in a second longer recession that started in July 81. The rate immediately started to drop getting down to 9% by the end of the recession in Nov 82. A drop of 10%!

Rates stayed in the 9-11% range until 85 when they started to creep down. In 86 &amp; 87 they stayed in the 6-7% range with a little drop after Black Monday but not much because, no recession. Then in 88 inflation crept up again and they raised rates a bit to the 9-10% range where they stayed until July 1990 when a bunch of things like the higher rate, the S&amp;L scandal (A direct result of deregulation by Carter), the 86 Tax act, the Oil Price Shock that came from Iraq invading Kuwait, etc. came to a head. But mostly it was just caused by a slight downturn after a period of sustained growth. The rate was dropped from 8.15% in July to 6.12% when it officially ended in March of 1991. Unemployment stayed high though so it continued to drop until it hit 3% at the end of 93. 

That's a drop of just over 5% for a relatively mild recession with some lingering unemployment issues.

At this point the economy was humming. Inflation was low, unemployment was low, so the fed started creeping the rate back up, to keep the economy steady. They stayed in 5-6% range for the rest of the 90's. In 2000 the fed announced a rate hike to try and calm the volatility of the stock market but it was only to the mid 6's when the tech bubble started bursting and had dropped to 5.31% when the recession officially started in March. By the official end of the recession itself in Nov 01 it was at 2% but the economy while not officially in a recession was still pretty bad so they kept dropping it until it bottomed at 1% in 2003. (The argument that this extended low rate, coupled with banking deregulation, helped cause the subprime mortgage crisis is also pertinent. As well as Bush's tax cuts.) 

That's a rate drop of 5.5% for a mid ranged 7 month recession followed by a slower than average recovery.

It eventually got back up to 5.25% by 2006 when the housing bubble started to burst and had been dropped to 4.24% by the time the subprime mortgage crisis brought down the financial institutions and officially started the ""great recession"" in Dec 07. By the end of 2008 the rate had been dropped below .25% making it effectively zero. (During this time Dodd-Frank was passed to try and prevent a recession like this from happening again.) 

That's a drop of just over 5% this time but only because it couldn't go any lower and it had to be kept there for the next *seven years.* 

The economy was fully into it's recovery by 2015 so they started slowly raising the rate back up but by the start of 2017 it was only up to 1%. At this point the fed finally decided to start normalizing the rate with steady increases through the end of 2018. (In 2018 congress also decided to do some deregulating again by gutting parts of Dodd-Frank. They also passed the Trump tax cuts.) 

The economy started to slow a bit, which was to be expected and probably needed to happen, even though this was exacerbated some by our increasingly erratic trade situation, but it was still going up. By the time the Fed rate hit 2.4% at the beginning of 2019, Trump did his freakout on the Fed and they decided to stop increases. Then, with the economy still increasing but also still showing signs of slowing the Fed decided to cut rates, according to Fed Chair Powell, ""to ensure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions."" 

So there are a lot of signs recently that a recession might be on it's way. If/when it does happen, how much much will our already very low interest rates effect things? It seems to me like it's going to be a pretty big issue and it's going to make what happens, if it happens, worse than it should be. At least that's what I get from the history of these things. Got my fingers crossed that I'm wrong.",finance

Bitcoin,Can accepting Bitcoin for online payment work out?,"A bit of background- My wife and I run a small farm in northern Vermont making CBD oil from hemp and maple (shameless plug: [Vesperfarms.com](https://www.vesperfarms.com)), and we recently tried to make the jump from farm stand to online sales-- where we were immediately hit with the ban-hammer from traditional credit card processors.  Despite being 100% federally legal to produce and sell in the US, it is still being treated like it has a schedule 1 status by banks and credit card companies.  Anyhow, after a bit of research, it appears the only options out there for accepting credit cards are extremely sketchy and usurious, and we couldn't afford them, nor would we want to expose our customers to them.

So I figured the natural solution to this problem is bitcoin.  But my fear is that accepting cryptocurrency might only further promote the erroneous negative stereotypes, and lead folks to have a ""less than comfortable feeling"" about purchasing from us.  On top of that, I am not very sure what the venn diagram of BTC and CBD users would really look like.

So, do you guys think an online business like ours can succeed taking BTC (or other coins?) for payment in 2019?  If so, is there a ""preferred"" solution/company for web payments that would have less of a chance of spooking potential customers?  I've heard Bitpay is a dumpster fire, but is Coinbase ok?  How about Opennode or others?

Lastly, is there some simple resource or service I could point customers to who don't know anything about BTC, so they can easily buy BTC to pay us with?

Sorry for the meandering post, but I'd be grateful for any help.

Edit:

Thanks for all the help and encouragement!  We did end up setting up payment options for Bitcoin with OpenNode, which was quick and easy.  We also added Monero as an option too.  Thanks again, and if anyone wants to ""test"" our system, there's an extra 3D printed toy in it for ya :)",cryptocurrency

\- what are the risks to the idea (other than the fed deciding to hike interest rates which doesn't seem likely right now).  Maybe China suddenly decide to offload their treasuries as a trade-war escalation?  Again doesn't sound likely?

personalfinance,Experience with getting a 22k Upstart Loan,"I see alot of mixed reviews so I thought I'd add my personal experience. I have roughly 21K of CC debt. I was looking for loans based on Credit Karma recommendations and was pre-qualified for a few and Upstart had the lowest interest rate (14.5%). This is a no brainer considering my average interest of 24% on the cards.

I applied and was approved on the spot for a $22K 3 Year loan for ~700 a month and just required a signing of the promissory note. I was supprised they didn't ask for additional information like other Reddit posts have stated (College Transcripts, Bank Statements, Pay Stub etc.) The only negative was the origination fee of $800 but I'll still save over the life of the loan. 

My credit scores : Transunion FICO 678, Transunion Vantage 621, Experian Vantage 611 (based on their credit pull) 

I have a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and have been at my first Engineering job for 2 years. (application requested all of this information as well as my college and graduation date)

Income  ~80k a year.

I've read people with better Credit scores get denied so I'm sure there is way more to their AI algorithm that they use to approve people automatically. 

Anyways just thought I'd share my experience. Didn't get an amazing interest rate but it definitely better than keeping the CC's with a balance. Hope this helps if you're in my situation and don't want to risk a hard credit enquiry and denial from Upstart. 

I did not qualify at my local credit untions for this particular amount because they use your credit score to determine maximum eligibility. That's why I had to resort to an online lender.",finance

I do like the convenience of having everything together, but my concern is having a diverse portfolio and getting that money working for me. I will also be receiving a payout from the liquidation of a trust.

$41,000 annual income
$7,000 owed on car loan

$80,000 owed on my home

Inheritance:
$120,000 inherited IRA
$140,000 trust dispersement
$2000 brokerage account

Is there a percentage I should be shooting for when looking at interest rates for HYSAs and investments? Based on a small Google search inflation is 1.8%, so is any return more than that OK? Is there a rule of thumb for how much should be in stocks vs bonds vs other types of investments?

stocks,"Yield Curve inverted and markets got scared, I made a Spreadsheet with ""Recession""-predictors","So there has been some news, memes, discussions and doomsday predictions since the yield curve inversion (and frankly much longer than that). Some people seem to think that the economy MUST go south because they *believe* markets have gone up too much (or they are just late to the game and don't want to buy on ATH..).

On the topic of believing, I am long, positive and hopeful. But I don't ignore hard data.

Now, I thought it could be healthy to have a discussion about it based on actual data.

Here's a spreadsheet that I made: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A8gdTJl3nOPRWjTqsJzH4zgV8cOfunwKkQ7zmH2eVU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A8gdTJl3nOPRWjTqsJzH4zgV8cOfunwKkQ7zmH2eVU/edit?usp=sharing)

Let's talk about it.

**Yield Curve -** This is mostly what has spooked the market and if you look at history, rightfully so. 

&gt;The term yield curve refers to the relationship between the short- and long-term interest rates of fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates.

The 10Y Treasury has gone below the 3M Treasury. When investors (that's ""us"") buy long Treasury bonds because we believe they offer a safe harbor and as a result of the rotation to long maturities, yields can fall below short-term rates, forming an inverted yield curve. Since 1956, equities have peaked six times after the start of an inversion, and **the economy has fallen into recession within seven to 24 months.**

**Stock Market Capitalization to GDP for United States** \- This is also referred to as the Buffet Indicator. 

&gt; probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. - Warren Buffet

We are at \~138.5% right now. That's higher than around the financial crisis of 2008 and above the 20 year average (and mean).  The US stock market is positioned for an average annualized return of **-1.5%**, estimated from the historical valuations of the stock market. This includes the returns from the dividends, currently yielding at 1.91%. 

If we look at the same numbers for China and Germany (two other large economies) they do not provide the same picture, but who cares? if US falls, the rest comes down with it... and anyway, they are both higher than their 20Y avg. and mean.

**Tobin's Q** \- It has a lot of uses, but in this case it shows the value of the stock market divided by the corporate net worth. 

A Q between 0 and 1 means that the stock market is undervalued, and above 1 overvalued. Currently we're at 1.142 and was at 0.7668 on the date of the 2008 crisis.

**Other predictors** \- in the spreadsheet, you will find a bunch of other KPIs and when I look at them I can't say that I am worried for them as standalone. They are all looking good, but as the ""heavy"" predictors points to a recession it makes me think that right now we are all just happily unaware. 

Again, I'm a bullish guy when it comes to stocks and markets but looking at say PS, PB, PE etc. it looks a bit overvalued, add to that the above discussed and it does actually look a bit shaky.

Then again, after a yield curve inversion, history has showed that the markets go down within months. And those months, could be several, and several can turn into years. Will I take home profit now and stand outside the market? A market that could possibly keep rising for another 2 years? No.

But I will be more careful about what I  invest in or where take larger positions. I will make sure that I keep some recession-resilient positions as diversification and that I have cash in hand for WHEN the market goes south, so I can find valuable companies to a lower price at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's discuss - Do you agree or disagree? why? What's your strategy? Am I wrong here and if so why?**

&amp;#x200B;

There may be errors or perhaps I've missed something, then feel free to point that out. I can be lazy, give me a break.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer**: I own stocks, I am long, I want to be bullish. I don't want markets to crash. These are just my opinions, you cannot take them as recommendations or advice. It's all just for fun. etc.",finance

My retirement account is called a TSP account, but is similar to a 401k in the penalties. The option my job has is to borrow from the account, like a loan against yourself, for a 2% interest rate.  The funds, of course, are not available to be invested so I would worry about not getting the accruals from that.  However, I am not too worried about that if a recession happens.  The credit card interest rate is variable and is at 15% now.  I have tried to pay the balance off as much as I can to limit the interest charges but I feel like I am chasing the balance.  I was considering taking out 12k from the TSP to pay off the credit cards and slowly paying off it over the course of 5 years with the 2% interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,Need lots of help trying to get through school.,"To begin, I am young and not very young at the same time, about Mid 20s. I have about 3 successful semesters of college that were scattered out throughout the past couple of years. When they tell you to stay in school, they‚Äôre not lying. 

The reason I had to drop out of school is because our family has never had financial stability. Not going to lie, I haven‚Äôt been the smartest financially as well, reason is that I never had any sort of guidance. My parents are immigrants and just recently got a green card and moved to the US. For the past 10 years I have been financially dependent on myself and my older sister. 

At this point I have the worst credit score possible due to a federal loan default. Again never had any guidance and didn‚Äôt know you had to pay of a student loan if you took a semester off and planned on returning, oops. I‚Äôm working on rehabilitation and hopefully after 9 months of successful payments, that‚Äôll be taken care of. As for my credit score, I‚Äôm working on a self lender app and working my way towards it. 

I just completed a semester at my local community college and unfortunately have not been able to pay off the past semester due to no financial support from anywhere. I myself work in the service industry and only make enough to get by. My income is so unpredictable that it is difficult to know if I‚Äôll even be able to make rent one month. 

To continue on with college, which is what I desperately want to do. I have to pay half a grand to the school with no financial support from my family and the government. What are my options for continuing on in school, I have 2 years more to go and I don‚Äôt want to stop now!",finance

personalfinance,Would you refinance this mortgage?,"I'll give as many details as I think will be helpful and can offer more. Trying to think this through and this sub can be so helpful. Also, I'm on mobile so apologies if the formatting is bad.

Current mortgage balance: $112k at 4.375% with about 25 years left

Bought the house in 2014 for $154k, put 20% down so no PMI

Current home value: around $190k

Monthly payment is $840; last payment had $207 and $408 to principal and interest, respectively. Escrow got $225. 

Excellent credit, one income, over $10k in emergency funds, putting 7% into 401k, no other debt besides mortgage.

On a quick internet search, I have found a 15 year mortgage refinance at 3.25% interest rate (3.368% APR), $787 per month with $916 lender fees. 

My overall question is, would you do it? Does the lower interest rate make it better to refinance than to overpay my current mortgage? More specifically, is the $916 lender fee in addition to closing costs, or is that the whole of it? I assume the $787 doesn't take the escrow into account, so if that payment stays at $225, would the total monthly payment be $1,012? That would still be less than 30% of my monthly take home pay.

For more context, I had a car payment I put $300 to each month. Now that it's been paid off, I've been putting that money into savings. $1,012 is less than $300 more than $840, so it would work with my budget. I am hesitant to lose that flexibility of where to use that $300, but if it makes the most sense to use it for the mortgage and lower rates, then I'll make it work. 

Is there a length of time I should plan on staying here after refinancing? I don't have current plans to move, but I am open to switching jobs if a better one comes up within the next couple years. 

The housing market in my area has been a seller's market, and the projected value of my home is $199k in a year. I realize this is in no way a guarantee, so could a refinance hurt if there's a pop in the housing market bubble?",finance

personalfinance,Not Understanding My Loan Payments,"Last November our HVAC unit went out. We decided to get a new one for Hiller and financed it through the company they use, GreenSky. During the time there was a promotional period and monthly payments were around $40. I made the monthly payments and stupidly didn't bother to look at anything else on the statements. After the promo ended, I got a letter saying that it ended and what my new payment was going to be. However, I noticed the total of what I owed was higher than the original purchase. The first bill shows a purchase of $6,177 and an interest charge of $25.69. So the balance was $6,202.69. However, even though I was making monthly payments, my balance was going up instead of down. I called and asked about this and the woman just kept repeating, ""It's because you were only paying the interest."" No other explanation. Even if I was just paying the interest, wouldn't my balance remain at $6,202.69?

By the end of the promo, the letter said I owed $6,255.12. I didn't see anything that said any charges were being withheld for the promo or anything like that so I don't understand where the extra $52 is coming from. TIA for helping me understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The promo was to pay interest only for 6 months.

Edit 2: My interest rate is 7.99% and it did not go up after the promo.

Edit 3: Maybe this can help someone explain. This is in the contract.  
 Plan Description:

Plan 2726. 84 month loan. 6 month initial period beginning at approval with up to 6 interest only payments (actual number of interest only payments depends on 1st transaction date) followed by 78 amortized payments based on the balance 6 months after your approval date.

personalfinance,Inherited $15k and not sure what to do with it,"Hello!

I am a 29 years old American, just started a PhD program in Biology - fully funded for 4 years but will probably take 5 years to complete and make \~$35k a year. My wife is a professor (different department) and makes \~$80k a year. I have $32k in a 403b mixed portfolio retirement plan, not sure what my wife's retirement looks like. No children as of now but plan to start a family in the next year or two. We do not have much in savings but are always on time with payments and have 720+ credit scores. Our debts are:

Mortgage $181,370

Credit: $4590

My student loans: $8996

A family member passed away and left me around $15k, I should be getting the check in a few weeks. I'm thinking about paying off my student loans with it, but then really not sure what to do with the other $6k. I need to get some dental work done (braces) which is quite expensive. We also need a car and with low interest rates might be a good time to buy, we're just a little worried about taking on more debt with monthly payments. My other options are putting the $6k into retirement, paying on the house (we've lived in the house for \~4 months so paying a lot of interest), paying off credit debt, pure savings, stock market, or something else. I just want to use the money more efficiently even though I understand it's not a lot to work with. Paying off my student loans isn't really critical because since I'm a student I don't need to make payments but it seems like a good monkey to get off my back.

Any information regarding my inquiry will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

personalfinance,"Finally have an emergency fund and am debt free with the exception of student loans, what now?","After years of struggling with high interest CC debt and living paycheck to paycheck, I have finally managed to pay off all revolving debt and build an emergency fund (10k). Currently, the only debt that I have is student loans which I recently paid all accrued interest on so that the remaining balance as of now is all principal (37k - all federal).

Right now, I am in a PhD program (STEM field) and as such I'm not required to make payments on my student loans, however, one of the loans (roughly 22k of the 37k) from my masters program is unsubsidized and accruing interest at 6.8% APR which is approx. $4 per day. The other 15k of the 37k total are at interest rates of 3.4% APR but since they're subsidized, they aren't currently accruing interest while I'm in school.

All of my current tuition costs are paid for by my school and on top of that I receive a  stipend that comes out to roughly 2.7k per month after taxes (essentially like a salary position at a company; I have no education related expenses for this degree). After revolving monthly expenses (rent, food, health insurance, etc.) I have roughly 1k left over for discretionary spending.

Now that I have an emergency fund (10k) I'm trying to figure out what the best use of the discretionary 1k per month would be. I have thought about just putting all of the 1k towards my high interest student loan every month, but it feels strange not continuing to put money into my emergency fund monthly. Would you all recommend splitting up the extra 1k so that I'm still making contributions to savings, throwing all of it at my student loans, or something else entirely? Also, I realize that 10k in an emergency fund may be a little on the high side and that I'm not really making any money with it just sitting in a savings account with an interest rate 0.01%. That being the case,  I am wondering if I'd be better served cutting that down to 5k and putting the remaining 5k towards my student loans as well.

Thanks in advance for the advice; now that I'm finally in a decent place financially and have some breathing room I want to keep making smart decisions.

investing,Why now is a great time to buy and fears are overblown,"Everyone is talking about inverted yield curve. But that means little in today's highly distorted markets. Plus it means little for your stock returns.

A list of yield curve inversions:

https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/df/dff1d52be616b4fd6a2d822acc04c8c7.png

If you go here:

https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/

The 1968 inversion would have yielded a 1.2% real return for 5 years and a -2.8% return for 10 years.

The 1973 inversion would have yielded a -3% real return for 5 years and a 1.2% return for 10 years.

The 1978 inversion would have yielded a 5.6% return for 5 years and 8.1% return for 10 years.

You see that after september 1980, for 5 years you would have made a 8.6% return after inflation and for 10 years a 10.7% return.

Now the next inversion happened in December 1988, again 5 and 10 year returns of S&amp;P500 were 10% and 15% respectively.

the yield curve inversion in february would have caused a 3% annual loss for 5 and 10 years. 

And the 2006 inversion would have given a 0.5% annual return and a 5.6% return.

A lot of those bad returns can be explained by high valuations though. In the 60's and 70's PE ratio was nearly 20x while inflation was sometimes as high as 12%. Obviously 17x earnings with 5-6% inflation is way more expensive than 21x earnings with 1-2% inflation. 

And in 2000 PE ratio was nearly 28x vs 21x now, so valuation was 30% higher than it is now.

https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-month

So even if a recession happens (less likely because of the distorted bond markets due to the FED) you would not even lose money a lot of the time over 5-10 year stretches. And valuation today of S&amp;P looks better (with more international exposure, so more diversification) if you account for low inflation rates. 

So a lot of panic is overblown, and IMO we will have forgotten about this a few months from now. I am buying!",finance
personalfinance,"What'sn better value, 69.5k in central Maryland (between DC/Baltimore) or 90k in NYC?","My situation: Single, male, 27, no current job but in talks with a few (two best are in topic title), US citizen, no pet, don't own a car (but I can drive and I'll buy one if I need to), no credit either good or bad, have parents with good credit who will help in case of emergencies, no debts, only have barely 4 figures in the bank as emergency money, currently living with parents (in relatively easy commuting distance to NYC) so my expenses are almost zero.

Pros for NYC:

- Extremely, incredibly, undeniably, really strongly prefer to stay in the NYC area on a personal and social level

- Job doesn't care if I work from home one or two days/week as long as I get enough done, which would save on commuting time

- Could live rent free for a couple of months with my parents while I build some savings (don't really want to, but the option exists)

- Unlimited sick + vacation days but this may be a con becuase then you feel pressured to never take them. I doubt I'll need it buy they also offer some paid paternity/maternity leave.

- Apparently there are decent bonuses at this comapny

Pros for Maryland:

- The MD job itself sounds way better than the NYC job. Less stress, more stability, better hours/week, much more interesting job, and most of all, I would actually care about the work I'd be doing. They also will let me work whatever time of day I want as long as I hit 40/week. This is kind of like five pros all rolled into one and it's a huge pro. Is this enough to make up for the negatives in lifestyle? Well shit, I don't know.

- Complete work/life separation; you are literally forbidden from doing work off-site

- Good healthcare, 13 sick days, 13 vacation days (although I'll have to accrue them), 10 federal holidays

Cons for NYC:

- Job at a small fintech startup, so hours and stress will probably be high. They're only 3 or 4 years old and seem to be doing OK but you never know when one of these &gt;15 people techbro companies will collapse. It also seems unlikely I'll be offered a piece of the pie (stock/equity/whatever), just salary. 

- Crappy expensive healthcare plan

Cons for MD:

- I just really don't want to live in a giant suburban/rural sprawl. Sorry if you like that, but I don't. DC and Baltimore themselves seem to be a bit too far to feasibly commute every day, so it's gotta be tiny suburbs.

- Absolutely zero chance of ever working from home ever. Also cell phones forbidden from work, which sucks.

- Will need to buy a car (or lease, I guess?). I don't have expensive tastes but I don't want something laughably shabby either.

- None of my friends or family live within about 4 hours. I guess people make new friends at work with they move somewhere new, but I've never been particularly good at this...

- No bonuses

- No paternity/maternity leave but again I doubt this will be relevant to me",finance

A week later, I get a $2k federal refund (not mine). HAH, I didn't tell accountant as they claimed it's not their fault. I left it alone expecting IRS to just take the money out. Was thinking to close the account but I paid for checkbooks already.

Now, accountant calling saying that a client wants his money back. (OH REALLY!?) IRS won't do anything because they did their part and deposited the money to the correct bank details specified in tax return.

The bank says this money is legally mine. Accountant says if bank won't do anything with IRS directly, please write check to accountant. HAH

So, I've lost money and time dealing with this silly mistake that was not my fault. I want to close the account and reopen for a clean slate.

This accountant has served my parents for decades and don't want to raise havoc, though I'm really tempted to burn this bridge.

I'm thinking I will write the check to accountant with a document in writing regarding their error and that I've refunded what wasn't mine (in case IRS comes after me for this BS).

However, I believe I should be compensated for the time/fees lost dealing with this nonsense.

Take a cut from the owed amount? (Though I want the check to reflect accurately of the amount that the IRS paid to my account.) Insist that next year's tax prep fee be waived?",finance
personalfinance,Can refinancing an auto loan hurt my credit?,"I have been working hard to improve my credit score taking it from a 560 to 720 in about 18 months.  Back when I was just getting  started I took out an auto loan with a high interest rate.  I'm sure I can get a better rate now but I'm worried that refinancing might hurt my score.

personalfinance,"Graduation during recession, or with impending recession.","It seems like everyone worry's about investing patterns during potential times of economic decline.

I know the recession is not for certain, but I want to be prepared if it does happen. 

Better question, for someone with significant debts, such as a mortgage or large student loans, what is reccomend around here to protect yourself from layoffs or financial instability due to lack of jobs when graduating college?

My sister graduated with a degree in advertising in 2009 and held a low paying generic desk job for 4 years before even having a shot at getting into the sorts of positions or pay grade she has where she works now. Basically it stunted her career, and she is still paying off her loans because of that. My mother was laid off and our family struggled for a long time. At times we lived off existing equity.

I will have in excess of $100-120k in loans (federal and parent plus which I have agreed to pay myself), and currently expect to make $60-80k upon graduating with a BS in Engineering (minors in EE and Product Design) next year, from a well known and respected 5 year engineering program. I have 1.5 years of industry experience from co-op internships. I also have about $9000 in credit card debt that I am working on paying off as quickly as possible.

That income number is based around working in Washington, DC, a relatively high cost of living area. I could possibly make a little more but not in my desired field (Radio Broadcast Engineering 

My fiancee will also be graduating, but debt free, from one of the top architecture programs in the country. She has interned at a large US government institution, and is on track to be one of the youngest licensed architects in the country.

We could live in a room in the suburbs for sub-$800, but we want a 2 bedroom to have a home office for our side businesses (not much income yet), and a non-shared kitchen so we are more inclined to cook.

We own our cars, and they both have under 90k miles, but are older models. I drive a pickup by choice (my hobbies and side business involve large musical instruments) and get 15 mpg, but adknowledge DC is incredibly easy to commute via subway. 

We have most of the furniture we would really need. We also enjoy cooking and don't really spend much on things other than our vehicle expenses and hobbies. We don't go out a ton, and we don't really go on extravagant trips.

personalfinance,Mortgage restructuring option seems too good to be true - am I missing something?,"I am a first time homeowner. I received a phone call and subsequent email from my mortgage company explaining that rates had dropped, and I could save money by restructuring my mortgage. Long story short, I could save about $320 per month by switching to a lower interest rate and purchasing a $500 appraisal that would remove my monthly PMI payments. Is this a scam? It seems too good to be true, what are they getting out of this?

Here is the email:


My name is [censored].  I am a Loan Originator with [my mortgage company]. This is a customer service courtesy email in regards to your mortgage that we service for you on [my house]. Due to mortgage rates dropping significantly, we have recognized an opportunity to restructure your mortgage into a much better position and save you money.


Below is a breakdown of an example of what we are able to do to improve your mortgage. If you are not currently working with anyone from [bank] please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss further. My contact info is below. I look forward to helping you.

 

Your current mortgage:

30 year fixed (27.7 years left)

Balance = 332,417

Rate =  4.25    

Payment = $2,277

 

Our new mortgage:

30 year fixed

Balance = 332,417

Rate = 3.75 (APR = 3.81)

Payment = $2,032

 

You save $245 per month and remove your monthly PMI of $83.

Or

If you choose to pay the same amount as you are on your current loan ($2,277) on this new loan, you will pay it off in 25.2 years. This takes 2.5 years off the life of the loan saving you a total of $51,120

 

¬∑         There is limited income documentation required.
¬∑         You will skip a mortgage payment. Assuming we move forward now , you will close in September, skip your October payment and have your new mortgage payment due November 1st.
¬∑         Closing cost are estimated at $1,900. Because you will skip a mortgage payment, you can simply pay your cost at closing in replace of what would have been your payment for October. You can also roll the cost into the balance of the loan.
 


And then from a follow up email:
 You will pay $500 for the appraisal upfront and the remainder of the fees are estimated at $1,900. The 1,900 can be paid at closing or rolled into the new balance of the loan. You will skip October mortgage payment and have your first new payment November.


You will be able to remove your PMI because we are doing an appraisal. We believe the value of your home to be conservatively [number]. This will show that you have over 20% of equity in your home allowing us to remove your PMI charge per month.",finance
personalfinance,Options / options on auto loan,"Hey all, first post on reddit, looking for advice on auto loan options to get out of automobile debt.

I currently have a 2013 F150 truck with 85k miles, and have owned for just over two years. Haven‚Äôt had any significant issues, until this week. I just sank $1500 into it for maintenance. I owe $14000 on the loan, at $400 a month for the next 35-36 months. I got a good deal on the vehicle, and if I were to sell the truck, I would get approximately 18k-20k, having that 4-6 thousand dollar profit for a down payment on a different vehicle.

I‚Äôve been looking at different vehicles, around the $12k price range. It would be the same style truck, but with significantly higher miles. 

If I were to sell my vehicle, I would take out a 5-6 thousand loan for the remaining balance on the different vehicle. My credit union is really helpful, with extremely low interest rates for used cars, .9% to 1.9%. If I were to get a 12 month loan, my payment on the loan would be just over $500.

My goal would be to take the profit from selling my current ride, using that 5-6 thousand dollars on a down payment on the higher mileage truck, and taking a small loan at a 12 month term. My monthly payment would be just over $500 a month. 

My question, is it worth selling my currently vehicle, purchasing a cheaper vehicle, and getting out of auto debt two years early? I have no personal debt outside of the vehicle and my mortgage.

Thanks much.",finance

CryptoCurrency,And the Centralization continues....,"So last week, U.S. bank suddenly decides to close my 2 accounts where
I had all my funds leaving me no access to my OWN money for 2 weeks. 

A bit background on this: Few weeks prior to this I got a call where
some bank manger had asked me random questions on my transactions. Some of
those transactions were transfer between people , cash withdrawals and some purchases
including Cryptocurrencies. At first, I thought it as a courtesy security call
just to confirm if I made those transaction. So I confirmed over the call that
I was the one. But the manager insisted on knowing the nature of those
transaction and wanted to know to whom and for what purposes I was making those
transaction. I understand banks also have to comply with federal regulations
and need to report any suspicious transaction. So I subtly answered to those
questions (even though I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt need to as it‚Äôs my money). However,
the manger didn‚Äôt seem to be satisfied with my answers and insist on asking
more personal level question such as ‚Äúwhy did the other person needed money‚Äù, ‚Äú
what use do I ¬†have with the items brought‚Äù,
‚Äúwhy do I have to send money to my ¬†parents, don‚Äôt I ¬†have siblings‚Äù, ‚ÄúDid I brought cyptocurrencies
for investment? Have I got any returns on it? .. etc . After spending 30 mins on
the call answering the questions, I got frustrated and said that I‚Äôm not
comfortable answering any further questions as I feel I have answered any basic
questions which should‚Äôve been enough to confirm the transactions I made and
ended the call. 

Apparently, the manger reported me as ‚Äúincompliant‚Äù to the bank and
the bank decided to close all my accounts without giving me any warning or
heads up. I had to find out when my payments got returned and when I logged
into my online profile only to find all my accounts disappeared from my
profile. 

The bank cashed out all my funds into checks and send them out through
regular mail. I asked the bank if I can collect these checks in person from the

1 week I do 16 hours, another week I do 72 hours. So my tax bracket is constantly changing (I'm assuming that's how it works). 

What I want to be able to know now is exactly how much would be duducted from me at any given income. 

So for example, if I know I would be working 46 hours next week, and the total I would earn from that is 2000, how much tax would be deducted from that 2000 ""based on my exemptions/allowances?""

That means I would require to know the percentage for each of the federal, state, Medicare, social security and SUI/SDI that would be deducted from my paycheck.

investing,Drugmaker wants billions from Mylan related to EpiPen rival,"Drugmaker Sanofi wants Mylan to pay it up to $11.7 billion in damages, alleging Mylan employed anticompetitive tactics to snuff out Sanofi‚Äôs failed EpiPen rival Auvi-Q.

The contentious federal suit began in 2017. Sanofi revealed the $11.7 billion damages claim in a recent filing issued in response to Mylan‚Äôs motion for summary judgment to dismiss the case.

The figure is based on estimated lost profits during Auvi-Q‚Äôs first brief appearance on the market plus lost profits for the time since ‚Äì $3.9 billion total ‚Äì with antitrust law triple damages applied.

‚ÄúThis is a classic antitrust case,‚Äù Sanofi said, ‚Äúinvolving a monopolist driving its competitor out of the market through anticompetitive conduct for no legitimate business reason other than to maintain its monopoly power.‚Äù

Mylan supplied this statement to The Dominion Post regarding Sanofi‚Äôs latest move: ‚ÄúMylan has moved to dismiss Sanofi‚Äôs case regarding EpiPen Auto-Injector. In response, Sanofi filed a brief on Friday, Aug. 9, which uses highly inflammatory language and relies on irrelevant evidence in an attempt to support a legally indefensible case and exorbitant and speculative damages claims.

‚ÄúMylan continues to believe that Sanofi‚Äôs claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. The company will file its reply to Sanofi‚Äôs brief on Aug. 30.‚Äù

More than 1,800 documents have been filed in the case since it opened in April 2017. Many are heavily redacted and more recent filings delve deep into the legal weeds. Here is a broad overview.

EpiPen and Auvi-Q are both epinephrine auto-injectors, abbreviated EAIs throughout the suit. EpiPen was launched in 1980; Mylan began marketing it in the U.S. in 2007.

French firm Sanofi launched the Auvi-Q in 2013. Unlike the tube-shaped EpiPen, the Auvi-Q is about the width and length of a credit card and as thick as a cell phone. Mylan officials had previously said that the EpiPen had an 85 percent market share through most of 2015.

Sanofi recalled the product and took it off the market in November 2105 because of technical problems with the dosage system. When Sanofi withdrew Auvi-Q, EpiPen‚Äôs share reached 95 percent.

In 2016, Sanofi returned Auvi-Q‚Äôs rights to developer kal√©o, which brought it back to market in February 2017.

In the suit, Sanofi said its EAI was ‚Äúdesigned for the smartphone generation to be smaller and easier to carry than the EpiPen.‚Äù It also included built-in voice instructions for use. It quickly gained traction in the marketplace.

In response, Sanofi alleged, Mylan erected multiple artificial barriers to stifle competition:

‚Äî Mylan offered steep rebates ‚Äì 30% or more ‚Äì to commercial insurers, pharmaceutical benefits managers and states (together called third-party payors) on the condition they do not reimburse for Auvi-Q prescriptions. With ripple effects on doctors, patients and caregivers, Auvi-Q was effectively shut out of more than 50 percent of the market.

‚Äî Mylan misclassified its EpiPen to federal and state Medicaid agencies, allowing it to under-reimburse those agencies for EpiPen sales and use the savings to fund its third-party payor rebate scheme.

‚Äî Mylan locked competitors out of schools by conditioning its EpiPen4Schools program on exclusive use of EpiPens (a requirement later withdrawn). Mylan spent $4 million lobbying Congress to pass the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act and at least $1 million more lobbying states. One major cheerleader was Gayle Manchin, mother of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch.

‚Äî When Auvi-Q hit the market, Mylan jacked up the EpiPen price, which also jacked up the available third-party payor rebate; while Sanofi had its own rebate program, it couldn‚Äôt match Mylan‚Äôs discount without losing money on each sale, so it was effectively locked out. Payors told Sanofi Mylan‚Äôs rebate exceeded Auvi-Q‚Äôs total projected sales.

‚Äî Mylan used its efforts to keep payors from covering Auvi-Qs as the source for a campaign to highlight that payors weren‚Äôt covering Auvi-Qs, harming Auvi-Q‚Äôs reputation and perception.

Because of those barriers, and some others, Sanofi said, its U.S. market share fell from 13% at the end of 2103 to just 7% in 2014.

Sanofi said Mylan‚Äôs annual EpiPen revenue topped $1 billion starting in 2013. ‚ÄúThus Mylan had a strong economic motive to undertake the anticompetitive conduct ‚Ä¶ to protect its crown jewel branded drug project by all means necessary.‚Äù

Mylan filed its own counterclaims, alleging Sanofi was the one to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

In the counterclaim, it noted that when it acquired the EpiPen in 2007, there was little awareness of anaphylaxis risk and doctors often prescribed ineffective products to address allergic reactions. Mylan spent millions education the medical community and the public, and making the EpiPen available to schools.

But Sanofi undertook a campaign to besmirch the EpiPen and mislead the healthcare community and the public, Mylan said:

‚Äî Sanofi falsely advertised the Auvi-Q as the ‚Äúnew EpiPen,‚Äù more patient friendly, safer, easier to carry and use. Its agents allowed some providers to infer that EpiPen was phasing out of the market.

‚Äî Auvi-Q sales staff sometimes threw away EpiPen materials in medical offices and replaced it with their own.

‚Äî At least one sales staffer offered providers cash kickbacks for prescribing Auvi-Qs. This staffer was not fired, but transferred, implying Sanofi approved of the conduct, and the conduct was more widespread.

‚ÄúMylan Specialty suffered, and continues to suffer, harm to its brand image and reputation due to Sanofi‚Äôs willingness to engage in illegal activities‚Äù to build the Auvi-Q customer base at Mylan‚Äôs expense.

The case is in Kansas District Court. For now, a jury trial is set for April 13, 2021

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"So first some background. My wife and I bought a home in 2017 for 350k @ 4.375% with ~10% down. My mortgage broker just recently emailed me that since mortgage interest rates are continuing to decline, it may make sense to refinance right now. Of course, my obvious question is what would be a large enough savings in terms of my mortgage interest in order to justify refinancing after only having the home for 2 years? Here's some information to provide a snapshot of our finances right now.

Monthly income between my wife and I: $25k
Current mortgage + escrow: $1889/month
Student Loans: ~340K with 6-8% interest with ~$2700/month payments and we overpay whenever we can afford it
Car Payment: $500/month
Utilities: 200-500/month (Summers in Arizona)
Food and Entertainment: My wife and I are bad about sticking to a strict budget for this stuff however maybe $2-3k/month

As it stands, my credit score is around 700 however to be honest I have had my credit frozen for a while and haven't checked. My mortgage broker says that our house has gone up in value to about ~400k (I'll believe it when I see it) and that with total closing costs it would take about $10k to refinance/buy down loan and we would save ~200-240/month on our mortgage. 

Does this sound like a good deal? My wife and I do not necessarily have the 10K just sitting around, however we could divert some of the EXTRA money going towards student loans to help make the closing costs. Any extra information that I left out I am happy to provide. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read!!",finance

Sanofi said Mylan‚Äôs annual EpiPen revenue topped $1 billion starting in 2013. ‚ÄúThus Mylan had a strong economic motive to undertake the anticompetitive conduct ‚Ä¶ to protect its crown jewel branded drug project by all means necessary.‚Äù

Mylan filed its own counterclaims, alleging Sanofi was the one to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

In the counterclaim, it noted that when it acquired the EpiPen in 2007, there was little awareness of anaphylaxis risk and doctors often prescribed ineffective products to address allergic reactions. Mylan spent millions education the medical community and the public, and making the EpiPen available to schools.

But Sanofi undertook a campaign to besmirch the EpiPen and mislead the healthcare community and the public, Mylan said:

‚Äî Sanofi falsely advertised the Auvi-Q as the ‚Äúnew EpiPen,‚Äù more patient friendly, safer, easier to carry and use. Its agents allowed some providers to infer that EpiPen was phasing out of the market.

‚Äî Auvi-Q sales staff sometimes threw away EpiPen materials in medical offices and replaced it with their own.

‚Äî At least one sales staffer offered providers cash kickbacks for prescribing Auvi-Qs. This staffer was not fired, but transferred, implying Sanofi approved of the conduct, and the conduct was more widespread.

‚ÄúMylan Specialty suffered, and continues to suffer, harm to its brand image and reputation due to Sanofi‚Äôs willingness to engage in illegal activities‚Äù to build the Auvi-Q customer base at Mylan‚Äôs expense.

The case is in Kansas District Court. For now, a jury trial is set for April 13, 2021

investing,Why yields are crashing further today and potentially the biggest market catalyst of the year or even decade....,"As we all know, the ECB essentially said that they going to start juicing up the economy hardcore and by no coincidence, Powell ordered a media blackout barring any Federal Reserve staff member from making any public comments on monetary policy - this is why yields have been crashing at an alarming rate in additional to yesterday's plunge as investors flocked for the worst possible scenario. (yield's plummeted yesterday because of a terrible gdp print from germany yesterday and a whole slew of recent economic data misses)

This hasn't been publicized much, there's only one article about it but it's pretty much spooked everyone on wall street as investors continue to panic bid on long-term treasuries - https://spectator.us/media-blackout-fed-jay-powell/

There are essentially two scenarios that could play out

1) Fed says its time to pump up the economy because recession signals are getting spooky and economic health globally is at a stand-still. they'll signal further rate cuts (remember they've hinted at last month's meeting that they don't expect any rate cuts for the rest of the year which is why the market tanked even after cutting rates). This will send equities to the moon as this is what the market wants. The market is currently pricing in at least an additional 50 bps of rate cuts by the end of this year - https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html

2) The Fed says that they can't afford to cut rates without ruining their balance sheet and they've essentially exhausted all options to stimulate the economy and that an intentional correction needs to happen for the sake of the long-term health of the economy - obviously this would destroy the market and we might see another black swan event similar to December's unprecedented decline

The media blackout itself is very weird. federal reserve members typically have blackout periods for specific dates before FOMC meetings but this one is essentially considered permanent until further notice which is unprecedented. in my opinion, scenario 2 is currently the most likely outcome - the media blackout suggests that powell and his crew are seriously considering giving up on cutting rates and believe a correction is necessary for the long-term health of the economy but such implications are so material in nature to the market that any on or off-the-record remarks regarding those discussions need to be silenced

anyways keep your eyes peeled for september's FOMC meeting and hedge your holdings accordingly. this is gonna be a rocky rest of the year - we also have political primaries coming up, September drug pricing vote which could ruin pharma/biotech and more

personalfinance,Is this a legal way to pay off student loan?,"Fiance has a student loan of about $20000 with an interest rate of 6.8%

Instead of paying a lot of interest to pay off that loan, how about:

- Get a great deal on a new/used car with 0%APR
- The price should be at least a few thousand $$ less than current market price.
- Sell the car for a profit, to cover for the taxes paid.
- Pay off the student loan with the money.
- pay off the car loan at 0% apr as your time and money permits.

Example: 
Loan amount $20000
Car Price: $26000
Car Price with deal: $20000
Total cost paid: $20000+$1200(taxes)+$200(insurance while you own the car)+$100(miscellaneous expenses)
Sell the car at $21500 

Now pay off the student loan with the money from car sale.

personalfinance,How to best repay $40k in student loan debt,"I‚Äôm at the beginning of repaying my ~$40k in federal student loan debt, and I want to do it in the most efficient, cost-effective way possible. I‚Äôve run a lot of numbers on different scenarios using different methods (snowball vs. avalanche; interest rate vs. daily interest, etc) but I‚Äôm not the best at math, so I wanted to make sure I‚Äôm not missing something. 

So here‚Äôs the general breakdown of my loans (I lumped the interest and principal together for simplicity, and I included the interest rate and the daily interest accrual):
1. ) $6759 Unsub (5.96%) ‚Äî $1.04
2. ) $7663 Unsub (5.16%) ‚Äî $1.01
3. ) $2994 Unsub (6.55%) ‚Äî $0.54
4. ) $4382 Sub (4.25%) ‚Äî $0.51
5. ) $3426 Sub (5.35%) ‚Äî $0.50
6. ) $5422 Sub (3.15%) ‚Äî$0.47
7. ) $5331 Sub (3.15%) ‚Äî$0.46
8. ) $2884 Unsub (6.55%) ‚Äî$0.39
9. ) $2767 Unsub (6.55%) ‚Äî$0.39

My question is what order should I pay them off in? The avalanche method makes the most sense to me, but also I‚Äôm struggling to understand why I shouldn‚Äôt pay them off starting with the highest daily interest accrual. It feels like filling in a hole while another hole twice as big is dug right next to it. If I pay $100 extra on #5, #2 accrues $200 in interest in the meantime.

personalfinance,"28 years old, clueless, need advice for long-term student loan repayment strategy.","Hi.  I'm in need of some advice on my student loans. I've been making payments and don't have much to show for it. My principal on 10/01/18 was $42,448 and it's now $40,885. So *it is* going down. But is this rate ""normal""? Looking for advice on what strategy I should follow long-term. 

**Principal Balance:** $40,855 

**Interest:** $231.99

**Year-to-date principal paid:** $13, 872

**Year-to-date interest paid**: $9,883

Loans are from undergraduate and graduate school, and all are in repayment. I'm married and following my wife for career (I am currently unemployed). She makes around **30k/yr** and will be making about that amount for the next 3-5 years (medical profession). After that, average salary for her chosen field is **\~ $125,000** **/year** but that amount is up in the air. She has approximately **80k** in student loans which are *not yet in repaymen*t. We have the option to defer her loans or do IBR for the next 3-5 years (looking for advice here, too)

I'm following the IBR plan and currently making the minimum payments of **$204.74/month** spread across all loans. This was based on my salary alone from last year when I was working. 

For a while I was applying some additional payments to the highest interest loans on top of the minimum. I don't have the money to do that anymore. I've been relatively on top of the interest, but I'm really overwhelmed with the feeling that I will never get the principal down. 

Is my best option to make **minimum payments for 25** **years** and hope we have the income to pay the taxes on the forgiven amount? Or **apply for forbearance** now and try to make up for it when we have more income in 5 years? Or something else?  I'm clueless and overwhelmed.

Details for each each of my loan below:

Principal \~ $19,679 Interest Rate - 5.75%

Principal \~ $5,133 Interest Rate - 6.55%

Principal \~ $4,818 Interest Rate - 6.55%

Principal \~ $4,156 Interest Rate - 6.55%

Principal \~ $3,648 Interest Rate - 5.06%

Principal \~ $2,161 Interest Rate - 4.25%

Principal \~ $531 Interest Rate - 3.15%

Principal \~ $495 Interest Rate - 6.55%

I'm mainly looking for advice for my loans since they are the only ones in repayment right now. But, I would like to develop a long term solution for both mine and my wife's debt if you have suggestions.

I know the position I find myself in is not ideal. 35 year old male living in Northern NJ with a wife, no kids, and a cat. Last year around October my **credit card utilization was at 99%** and reality hit me pretty hard that how I was living, what I was spending on eating out and on stuff that didn't matter... essentially what I was doing was not sustainable.

Over the last year I've adopted a budget, have been using Mint and Credit Karma. I've been making on-time payments (never late actually, throughout this whole ordeal, not once). 

I've also cut costs, moved into a cheap(er) apartment and quit it with the frivolous spending. I picked up odd-jobs to get extra cash to put towards credit card bills... everything helps little by little. 

Nothing goes on credit anymore, everything has been paid with funds out of my checking account/debit card... and I've been doing it this way for almost a year now. **Current credit card utilization is down to 84%**. It's slow going, but I see how much interest I'm paying these card companies and I'm thinking ""This is nuts. There has to be a better way"".  

I know of the usual trap... ""debt consolidation loans will pay them off, but if you just go and use them all over again you'll be screwed even worse."" ...and I hope that I've put myself through enough this last year to know better. One of the three cards is already cut up (here's looking at you Chase) and I'm certain I wouldn't need the other two, I guess I carry them around as reminders not to be an idiot.  So... I'm looking for an opinion because I like to think I have a grasp on what will happen, but they don't make it easy.

Enough rambling... the numbers...

**INCOME**

$58,000 yearly salary

~$13,000 bonus paid quarterly (one quarter could be 5k, one quarter could be 2k, the average over the last 3 years is 12k/yr).

NET monthly is roughly $3000 on non-bonus months.

The quarterly bonus checks have almost exclusively gone into paying the highest interest credit cards first.
I actually paid one card off (Chase Slate) that I had transferred some balance into at 0% but had graduated into 25%+. Avalanche method, I've been pushing extra funds into the next highest card (also Chase). I keep the Slate open so it can age with the rest of me - and I haven't charged anything to it since paying it off.

$8,200 put away in an Roth IRA before I stopped contributing to put the money towards paying off the credit cards. Can't touch this, big fees if I do.

**DEBTS**

Credit Karma: 646 TransUnion and 649 Equifax

Mint: 646 TransUnion

Discover free score on statement:  739 FICO (suuuure)


**Three Student Loans (Private Loans, not Federal, now owned by Navient)** 

I got them while my credit was excellent in 2007-2009.
I was paying Interest Only on them for 4 years (2010-2014) my first mistake, but I didn't get a job out of college and was in a bad spot:

Amount | APR | Minimum Payment
---|---|---
$23,839.57 | 8.375% | $458.17
$21,684.71|6.000%|$391.03
$3,599.92|6.000%|$64.91

The APR on these is so much better than what they could be, so I'm not planning on touching them in this scenario.

**The problem children, the Credit Cards:**

Name|Amount | Limit | APR | Minimum Payment
---|---|---|---|---
Chase Amazon|$10,111.37 |$14,500| 21.24% | $294.00
Chase Slate|$0.00|$3,000|25.24%|$0.00

**Other things to pay**

$55/mo Internet (no more Cable TV)

$149/mo Car Lease + ~$60/mo in gas

$60/mo Cell Phone

$20/mo average electricity split

**The solution?**

I've applied in the past at LendingClub and SoFi iand was offered loans with interest rates higher than the cards I was looking to consolidate, so I never bothered.

Tonight I put my information into Upstart and got a (preliminary I bet) qualification for $42,000 at 12.19% for 5 years with a $894.83 monthly payment and a $1,941.66 origination fee.

My minimum monthly payments right now for all three cards are at $958.00, and I often put more towards the Chase card to pay it down quicker, so I know I could afford the payment offered... so I'm struggling here to see a downside.  

Of course, this is just after the soft inquiry... who knows what numbers they'll have for me after I click ""next"".

What questions should I be asking, what math could I be doing to figure out after all these fees how much I'd be saving?

In particular what accounts are ideal etc.,"I really like the Barefoot investor book to start a simple plan to increase your means as much as possible, while making sure to live within them. Only thing is, the book is made for Australia, and I am in the US, so I am wondering if people know the American counterpart to the ideal places to bank at for the differing accounts that the book went into. 
If you haven't read the book, it essentially has you having some accounts in an everyday bank, and says you should find one with xero fees as a requirement, and good interest as possible for your savings accounts, and online institutions are usually best. Then a super savings account meant to never be touched, that has the best interest rates possible, meant to just sit there for indefinitely for emergencies. 
Ill leave it as just accounts to use for now, as then this thread will have too many things going on. But any advice on what the best banks etc are appreciated! Ill briefly describe the 5 account system he describes below.

The barefoot investor has you setting up four accounts in a main bank. Two checking, one getting 60 percent of your income for living expenses bills etc, the other getting 10% for fun things etc. Then two savings accounts, one getting 20% of income for paying off debts, and one getting 10% for saving up for bigger fun things, like vacations or a car etc. The other financial institution gets started with at least 2K, to be an assurance for emergencies, meant to sit and grow with interest, and later being increased to 3 months of income to never worry again.

personalfinance,Open credit card under my name or have my parent do it for me?,"So i'm 22 and i haven't opened up a credit card yet and i would like to build some credit before i leave college. My mother and I had a discussion about the interest rates and all that but some interesting thoughts came up.

1) Obviously, If I open a CC in my name and use it, I will be building credit in my name. What happens If my mother opens a CC with her bank, linking her account but using my name? Will I still be able to build credit or will all of this affect her credit score and not mine? Will using her method result in a lower monthly interest rate? I'm not sure if i phrased the question right but im asking If my mom opens a CC in my name will my purchases and activity build on her credit or mine. 

While I am not 100% sure on the answer, I think it depends who's bank account is linked to the CC. So if I have my mom open up a CC with my name but link her bank account, it should affect her score since she will be paying the card off. Whereas If I open one in my name and my account, it will affect my score only. Am I correct in thinking this? 

2) I know i'm going to get a less than desirable interest rate no matter where I go since i have no credit history, I think this is a safe assumption to make. Since I intend on paying my monthly statement in full before the due date, should I be that worried about the rate? As I understand, interest will only be ""charged"" if my balance goes over to the next month. I'm only going to be using this card for gas and other small things. Knowing that I will pay before the due date, would it be worth it to get a card with cashback? I have a fuel efficient car, I will literally only spend 70 dollars a month on gas at most.

3) Despite the interest rate, would it be wise to get a CC with my current bank? I've had an account with Chase for the past 5 yrs, would I get a lower interest rate (still assuming a bad rate) with Chase?

As the title suggests, after years of being under constant survival mode, I've finally reached the point where my credit score is decent enough (740) to finally refinance my private student loans from a dreadful 11% interest rate to somewhere around 5%.

I haven't pushed the trigger on the refinancing yet because I'm about to pay off a decent amount of credit card debt next month which will bring down my debt-to-credit ratio to less than 30%. I'm hoping to improve my credit score further to get an even better refinance rate.

* I only have about $2k in emergency funds / savings
* I currently have credit card debt but 0% interest rates on all of them (I already have a budget set per month for completely paying off credit card debt)
* No retirement funds / IRA set up yet unfortunately

&gt;The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Bitcoin,"People of r/Bitcoin, do you have a sad story including Bitcoin?","Hello, since I still grief over mine I am interested to hear yours. A lot more than half a decade back I had 420 Bitcoins, out of fun when I heard of it I started mining and bought some (like, really cheap, less than a dollar for 10 Bitcoins cheap). It was only for fun and giggles, as you might notice, and I never got into it at that time. A ""wallet"" was for me something I downloaded out of a guide but was not used to it nor used it, really. It was just...there.
After I lost my phone I honestly didn't care for the couple of bucks, combined with my none-knowledge about wallets (I didn't even know where the wallet was from, which service or how to login besides the safed login credentials on said lost phone) so I dropped that deal.

After many years, I think in 2017 it was, or so, when Bitcoin shot up like crazy, it was like a different thing for me, I spoke about it interested and checked prices daily even though I didn't have any, until one night where reality hit me that I HAD Bitcoins, I had Bitcoins that cost me around 50‚Ç¨ (overall, including but prices but mostly electricity) that was now worth 420*15.000k‚Ç¨.

Before you say how can someone be so stupid and not remember it, back then Bitcoin was not all around somewhere online, it barely existed, once in months appeared in a news article. For me it wasn't Bitcoin that many years ago, it was a fun thing online. 

Long story short: I was never able to recover said wallet, until today I don't know where I set it up, tried to check my mails, but they only go back certain amount of years and I actually believe I created it on a mail account I haven't used for a ton of years since I switched to gmail.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What would the purpose of a $1 write off be on a student loan that still owes more than $4k?,"Noticed in my payment history that back in May, there was an additional payment made towards a loan for an amount of $1. The payment was entitled ""write-off"". However, the loan is still listed under the same processor with all the other loans, and which I still owe more than $4k on. I've never missed a payment on the loans and they've always been mostly on time, save for an occasional day or so late a couple times a year due to forgetting or payments processing over a weekend (never being charged late fees for these incidents).

Is this something I have to worry about? I'm a worrier, and I want to know that they were just being so super generous by reducing my loan by a buck rather than randomly selling $1 of my loan to some collection agency that is going to sit on it for a couple years til the interest rate mutates it into a several hundred or thousand dollar bill I wasn't aware of. Or could there be another reason for this?

cardano,"Cardano, staking, and negative interest rates","This thought crossed my mind recently and I decided to put it out to the community so there could be a discussion.

With increasing talk in the US that negative interest rates from the fed could soon be a possibility, I wonder if staking through Cardano (or any PoS system, for that matter) would function as a nice alternative as a place to store your money and allow it to grow. I understand that there are other issues with a strategy like that at the moment, e.g. the current speculative nature of the crypto space. I hope we can put that aside for a moment and work under the assumption that Cardano is a well established blockchain technology. It seems to me that staking ADA and receiving the rewards that come with it is a nicer alternative than paying a bank to hold your money.

What do you all think?

I‚Äôve attached an article just as a reference in case anybody is unfamiliar with the current discussion about negative interest rates. I‚Äôve also attached a link from Investopedia explaining what a negative interest rate is.

personalfinance,Best approach for S/Os student loans?,"Hey guys. Just wanted to get your input on my intended plan of attack for my S/Os student loans. 

She has 32k direct and 33k PLUS. She's a teacher so she should be able to get the 17,500 forgiven on the direct loans after 5 years. We will go income based on that. Assuming her current salary, she will pay a little under 20k in minimum payments and the balance should be forgiven.

I looked into refinancing the PLUS loans, which have an average interest rate of almost 7%, and we can get around 4.5% fixed. I know PLUS loans have no options for forgiveness or anything so I figured that would be the best option. We can get similar rates for a 10 or 5 year plan. I am not sure which exactly to go with but I am leaning towards the 5 year just so we can be done with it all at once.

Some additional info: 
We split all living expenses 60/40. I make $73k a year and she makes a little over $50k. Our monthly living expenses are around $2,800 to $3,200 depending on the moth. 

I know not to directly assist her with her loans until we get married. I know if we get married my income will screw the income based plan so we will likely hold out for the debt relief before tieing the knot. 

Does this plan make the most sense? Is there any better options I am missing?

All input appreciated. Thanks guys",finance
personalfinance,Building credit from scratch,"Student needing to build credit from scratch. I have no income at the moment. I procrastinated getting a secured card for months and got denied yesterday at a new credit union where I opened an account (my old one is where I used to live). I hate the idea of debt because I've seen it destroy lives. I decided to do a secured/consumer loan of a couple hundred dollars. Eventually I intend on opening a bunch of lines of credit and utilizing like $10-20 of each limit for things I'd spend anyway, and pay the balance in full every month. 

My next options are:

1. Discover student (if I'm accepted with no income and no history)
2. Taking out another consumer/secured loan and letting it cycle (there's like 4% interest so I'm wary of taking out too much)
3. Take out a manageable federal student loan for the purpose of building my credit, like 2 or 3k, and start paying it back in increments I guess. I have no idea how this works but the 0 interest until I graduate would be nice. I'm not sure how to approach that because I don't actually intend on carrying debt with me. Also I get the full federal pell grant so I'm not sure I'll even get a loan.

I think those are all my options. Where should I take it from here? What should I avoid?

The money I'm using for these secured loans are parts of my education fund I earned 100% on my own. I will need access to that money once I transfer to university, where the cost of attendance exceeds my federal grants.

Any help is appreciated. thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating credit card debt using lower-interest loans/credit cards?,"I have the following credit card debts: 

* $5500 with 25% APR
* $800 with 26% APR
* $400 with 28% APR
* $1200 with 0% APR until July of next year, 14% APR after

Numbers are rough estimates but the idea is there. Currently I am paying off the high-balance card aggressively, and according to bankrate.com I am due to pay it off in 26 months paying $275/month (minimum usually runs $170-$180) - can't really afford to pay much more at the moment.

However I've been doing some thinking and I've seen a lot of info/ads for either balance transfers or loans to consolidate at a lower overall APR. I know balance transfers typically incur fees which is why I think a loan might be a better option if the interest rate is low. My credit is about 710+ last I checked.

personalfinance,Did I make a mistake? (also posted as a sticky comment in r/investing),"## Did I make a mistake?

I recently moved a chunk of 401k from a previous employer's program that was sitting there into a NYL variable annuity backed by a mutual fund. I recently got the audio book *Money: Master the Game* by Tony Robbins and am wondering if I made a mistake.

The summary of what I'm doing with this money is it's about $41k, and it's going to sit in this mutual fund IRA until I retire. I do not plan to make any contributions to it until retirement.

My understanding of the main fees are that it's 1.7% on my contributions (not interest) for the first 7 years, then 1% on the new total from then on (not interest) until retirement.

Now, this not my only retirement investment. I currently also have a 401k (moving from traditional to roth) and a cash value life insurance policy.

## Here are some snippets from the documents

&gt;**What fees or charges do you take from my New York Life variable annuity Accumulation Value?**  
You will pay fees every year you own your annuity. The Mortality and Expense Risk and Administrative Costs Charge (M&amp;E Charge) may be assessed based on either the Accumulation Value of your annuity or the cumulative premium payments you make.  
If the M&amp;E Charge for your annuity is based on the cumulative premium payments you make, the dollar amount of the charge will be unaffected by fluctuations in market performance. In a rising market, this M&amp;E Charge structure, when measured as a percentage of separate account assets, will be reduced. In a declining market, this structure will result in an increase in the charge when measured as a percentage of separate account assets. M&amp;E Charges based on your annuity‚Äôs Accumulation Value will result in a decrease in the charge when measured as a percentage of separate account assets in a flat or declining market. In a rising market, M&amp;E Charges based on your annuity‚Äôs Accumulation Value will increase when measured as a percentage of separate account assets.  
The M&amp;E Charge varies from 1.35% to 1.90% based on the annuity and is charged only on values in the Investment Divisions. There will be an annual policy service charge of between $0 and $50 for policies that have an Accumulation Value below a certain threshold. Please see the ‚ÄúTABLE OF FEES AND EXPENSES‚ÄîPeriodic Charges Other Than Fund Company Charges‚Äù of your prospectus for more details.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How will income payments and withdrawals from my New York Life variable annuity be taxed?**  
Variable annuities are tax-deferred, which means you will not pay taxes on the annuity‚Äôs Accumulation Value until the money is withdrawn. When you take income payments or make a withdrawal, you pay ordinary income taxes on the accumulated earnings. You also defer paying taxes on earnings if you move money from one investment option to another within your annuity. You may also pay a 10% federal income penalty tax on earnings you withdraw before age 59¬Ω. Please see the ‚Äú FEDERAL TAX MATTERS ‚Äù section of your prospectus for more details.  
You can exchange one tax-deferred annuity for another without paying taxes on the accumulated earnings when you make the exchange, provided that you comply with Internal Revenue Service rules for these types of exchanges. Before you do, compare the benefits, features, and costs of the two annuities.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Does buying an annuity in a retirement plan provide extra tax benefits?**  
Buying an annuity within a tax-deferred retirement plan does not give you any extra tax benefits. However, please note that the specific New York Life variable annuity you are considering provides other features and benefits. If you are buying an annuity for use in a retirement plan, choose your annuity based on its other features and benefits as well as its risks and costs, not its tax benefits. Please see ‚Äú THE POLICIES ‚Äî Qualified and Non-Qualified Policies ‚Äù section of your prospectus for more details.

I also made a basic spreadsheet to see what I would have if I assumed the only fees are the 1.7%/1% compared to what I would have if I put the money in a Vanguard IRA on the S&amp;P 500 index and they both returned 8%. [Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/xEZFBUM).

personalfinance,Why is there so much money in low return investments - What am I missing?,"There are a lot of passionate discussions on here about whether or not to pay off your mortgage early. I'm in the pay it off camp, and have pulled about half my assets out of the market to pay off my home - But I definitely see both sides. Its a compelling argument that you can earn more in the market over time than borrowing 'cheaply'. However, I do struggle with some basics, and hoping some of you smart folks can chime in. For example, mortgages are backed by investors. Investors with large sums of money to invest. Why would they be happy with their money earning historically low interest rates and lock it up for 30 years? Obviously the bank that issues the mortgage makes money too, so that would presumably leave an even smaller return for the investor. We also have bond investors, and long term rates are at historical lows too. Some places around the world, folks are losing money with bonds yet people continue to park their money there. Why wouldn't they just park their money in the US Market if they are guaranteed a much higher return over 30 years? What am I missing?",finance

personalfinance,Sooo how do credit scores work again?,"I have never paid too much attention to my credit score but it has always been pretty good, in the 800s.  Right now I'm wrapping up construction for an addition on my home which involved refinancing to get cash out, taking out a home improvement loan, and taking advantage of some 0% balance transfers to fund the rest.  I'm aware that the balance transfers don't seem smart but the construction went over budget and the interest rates to borrow additional money were higher.  I am confident I can pay them off before the promotional rate increases.  Total credit card usage is still &lt;30% of the total credit lines.

Anyway, my husband and I also refinanced our student loans (grad school debt) recently.  Between all that, my score is now 760.  Normally I wouldn't care, except with rates so low I was also looking into refinancing the mortgage and home improvement loan as we could get a much lower interest rate, especially on the 2nd loan.

I guess what I'm wondering is 1) how much will having 760 instead of 800+ affect the interest rate we could get and 2) how long would it take to ""bounce back"" from all the recent hard inquiries?  Of course I know that paying down the cc debt will also help and that will happen in due time.  I'm just wondering if I should go ahead and pursue a refinance now with low rates or wait X months to try to have better options if I'll have a higher credit score at that time?",finance
personalfinance,Continue going aggressive or save/take it slow?,"Hello, redditors of PF  


In my particular situation, I currently have about $12,800 left to pay off my student loans, which started at $18,500 back in December of last year. So far since, I have been aggressively paying off my student loans, after I set up enough for an emergency fund. I would have continued to pay aggressively until I had a discussion with my mother, who recommends I start saving instead rather than going aggressive, or at the very least take it slow if I don't want to invest rather than massively over paying. She being a business major, I find it hard to contest, but I'm coming here to get further opinions on this, since I feel it's better to have multiple opinions. To add more specific details about my currently living and financial situation to help get a better idea:  


\-I live with family and currently not paying bills (Until the start of next year when I start adding internet bills, at $119 a month)  
\-The only things I do pay monthly are my student loans (about $167 a month) and my car insurance (about $215 a month for 6 months before renewal.)

\-My loans are split unto 3 groups, the highest being 4.45% and the lowest being 3.70%, with a former 4th group being paid off already and 1 that can be paid off fully without issue. (Tackling my highest interest rate loans first, then working down).

\-My current take home is between $770 - $920 bi-weekly, depending the various bonuses I achieve throughout the work month.  
\-I currently 25 as of last month.

If all this can help form what path I should take for the long term, it would be much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,I need help deciding how to handle student loan payments.,"I'll start by saying, I read the Student Loan paragraph in the 18-25 y/o help section, and although the information was great, it didnt answer my specific question. 

I am still in college, and currently none of my loans are due. Ive taken a loan out each year, and I currently have 4 open. Each semester I have noticed the interest rate for each new loan is slightly higher than the one before. My first student loan I took out 3 years ago, and when possible I pay on it so that when I do finish school, I will have those payments already established for my credit history.  Ive managed to bring this first loan down to about $400. 

I received an unexpected bonus at my job, enough to completely pay off this loan. I am wondering however what would be the better long term option, if I should completely pay off this loan now, or if i should apply this to one of the loans with a higher balance. If it helps, the newer loan has a 2% higher interest rate. Although paying the higher loan first would save me me $$$ in the long run, I am concerned with building my credit now as I would like to buy a house within several years of graduating. 

TL;DR Is it better for my long term credit/ finances to pay off a small loan, or apply that money to a larger loan with 2% higher interest.",finance

economy,U.S. Foreign Aid Actually Helps Create Jobs and Boost the U.S. Economy,"Yes, this seems like a wild claim‚Äì but hear me out. Many people disagree with U.S. foreign aid spending because they consider this money to be a ""free handout"", or think that we are just throwing money away. I personally think we should be giving money to the poor just because are a wealthy nation and we can, but besides that, there are also great economic benefits to giving foreign aid. We should be thinking of these expenditures as investments instead of just frivolous charity.

History has shown that as people are lifted out of poverty, they transition from barely surviving into becoming consumers. In the United States, 1 out of 5 jobs are export based, and around 50% of our exports now go to developing nations. The U.S. stands to greatly benefit from these new untapped markets! From Germany to South Korea, nearly all of the United States‚Äô top trading partners were once recipients of U.S. foreign aid. For example, we spent $1 billion helping Taiwan in the 70s, now we make $30 billion a year from them on exports.

Focusing on foreign aid is the right choice! Sadly, the Trump Administration plans to cut the International Affairs Budget by 24% in fiscal year 2020, even though the budget currently only makes up less than 1% of the federal budget.

While I do believe bitcoin is not correlated to the stock market, this is not entirely true compared to gold/silver especially in recent times. Nonetheless I think we can all agree with bitcoin‚Äôs functional use as a store of value/inflation hedge/flight to safety asset, pretty much no different from precious metals.

Thus using gold prices as the best possible proxy for bitcoin, looking at price history: in the initial 2007 crash, gold prices, just like every other asset at the time, went down significantly. I have no reason to believe BTC will behave any differently. 

Yes, the Fed reacted quickly with their money printing press and gold prices subsequently skyrocketed, but so did stocks and pretty much all other assets by that time thanks to the increased liquidity. Bitcoin will no doubt ride this wave but again, I do not see any reason for it to move counter trend.

They may eventually quality for social security, get a part-time job, or startup some small business, but for now they are working on recovering and getting better. They have a lot of savings and ability to fund retirement vehicles if a method can be figured out.

I think they could only set up a traditional IRA which only has a limit of $6,000 versus the 401(k) limit of $19,000. This also would mean the individual couldn't contribute to their current non-TSP Roth IRA anymore right.

I'd love to hear some creative ways to fund retirement savings. Right now, seems that $6,000 a year in to the non-TSP Roth IRA is all that is certain can be funded though from what we've figured out.

Ideally, they'd like to fund their TSP to $19,000 a year and still contribute $6,000 a year to their non-TSP Roth IRA. You can do transfers into the TSP while retired as stated [here](https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/EligibilityAndContributions/RolloversTransfers/methods.html). They don't do the Roth TSP, just traditional. They're also open to needing to open a 401(k) or other plan outside the TSP and keeping it there if transfers aren't an option and that is.

Not sure how relevant, but they have a spouse who is working. They are a teacher with some retirement vehicle (not sure if 401(k), 403(b), 457(b)) and they also have an outside Roth IRA at the same place as the disabled individual. I doubt a spouse IRA comes into play here since the disabled individual is earning income, but though it'd be worth mentioning.

Seems really hard to properly fund retirement if you're not employed from my research. Weird how the IRS requires this, or won't allow individuals to fund higher than $19,000 like the $56,000 limits for SEP IRAs. Appreciate any advice.",finance

# **Here‚Äôs what Powell could say at Jackson Hole to soothe the roller coaster markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/heres-what-powell-could-say-at-jackson-hole-to-soothe-the-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; If the markets get their way, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will use the Fed‚Äôs Jackson Hole symposium to clarify whether the Fed is at the beginning of a serious rate cutting cycle ‚Äî or just intending to cut a few times, as insurance against a possible downturn.
*****
&gt; Powell speaks Friday morning to kick off the Fed‚Äôs annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, and that event is the main focus of markets in the week ahead. The Fed also releases the minutes of its July meeting Wednesday afternoon, and it is expected to detail discussions around its decision to cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than a decade.
*****
&gt; In a briefing following that meeting, Powell discussed the quarter point rate cut as a ‚Äúmidcycle adjustment,‚Äù implying it was just considering a few cuts. That comment shook markets, and interest rates have plunged, along with global bond yields.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhat the market wants is clearly that he moves away from the ‚Äòmidcycle adjustment‚Äô commentary and transition toward an easing cycle,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Markets also will be watching any developments that reveal how trade talks between the U.S. and China are faring. President Donald Trump soothed some nerves in the past week when he delayed some of his latest tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump also said Thursday that discussions are continuing, and that he expects to talk to President Xi Jinping soon, though he gave no details.
*****
&gt; Powell speaks at a time when markets have been doubting the Fed‚Äôs ability to head off a recession. Since he spoke on July 31, the stock market has been turbulent, with the S&amp;P 500 losing nearly 3%, but the move in interest rates has been massive. The 10-year yield was at 2.07% that day, and touched a low of 1.475% on Thursday before returning to 1.54% by late Friday.
*****
&gt; The Treasury‚Äôs 30-year bond made a historic move in the past week, when its yield fell to a record low of 1.915%, before rising back above 2% Friday. Also, the most widely watched part of the yield curve inverted, when the 2-year yield made the unusual move of temporarily rising above the 10-year yield. That would be taken as a sign of pending recession if it inverts again and stays that way for some time.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower for the week, but reversed sharper losses by the end of the week. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.4% Friday at 2,888, but was down 1% for the week. The Dow rose 1.2% to 25,886 Friday, but lost 1.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; Dramatic moves in the world‚Äôs sovereign yields came as global central banks cut interest rates, and there was talk from a European Central Bank official that the ECB could use a big stimulus program. That puts extra pressure on the Fed, which has emphasized that it could lower rates because of the weak global economy, the impact of trade wars and sluggish inflation. Rates all over the globe moved lower, and the benchmark German 10-year bund set a new low of negative 0.73 Friday morning.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to signal they‚Äôre worried about the economy because the economy is doing okay, ‚Äù said Pramod Alturi, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. ‚ÄúI think they can do it. It‚Äôs going to be a tough communications challenge. The worry is when they try to tow the line, they end up being more hawkish than the market is looking for.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said she is looking for Powell to comment on the yield curve inversion and the market turbulence. ‚ÄúIs he more concerned about the outlook?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHas he become more concerned since the meeting, given the slowdown in global data, the increase of risks in the trade war and the recent significant moves in the market‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; The fed funds futures market is pricing in two to three rate cuts for the balance of the year. Since the Fed meeting, the market has become more concerned about the economy, with weaker global data from Europe and China, as well as a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods, announced by President Donald Trump.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIs Powell going to stick to the midcycle adjustment? It‚Äôs only been three weeks, but you throw in the sharp inversion of the yield curve and the extra consumer tariffs ... is he going to let the market whipsaw him? We‚Äôve seen a big inversion and a sharp drop in rates since that meeting,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief market strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the Fed tries to avoid making policy changes at the Jackson Hole meeting, but it was done during the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIs it going to be an academic speech? Or is he going to pull a Ben Bernanke and use Jackson Hole as his FOMC venue. It was really [former Fed Chairman] Bernanke who most notably [used the meeting to discuss policy] when he laid out the case for QE twice,‚Äù Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Powell could also have to defend the Fed‚Äôs independence, and reiterate that he will stay in his position until his term expires, particularly after President Donald Trump criticized Fed policy and called him ‚Äúclueless‚Äù this week.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, there are some economic reports of interest in the week ahead. Existing home sales are announced Wednesday and PMI manufacturing and services data is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she is watching developments with Huawei, since the temporary licenses for U.S. firms doing business with the black-listed Chinese company end on August 19.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIn terms of headlines this could be a market mover because of Huawei‚Äôs importance to Beijing. If there is an extension from the administration it could suggest an improvement in the D.C./Beijing dialogue, no doubt a positive headline,‚Äù she said, in an email. ‚ÄúWe could find out what happens from a presidential tweet or from the Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the issue.‚Äù

# Down Friday/Down Monday Streak Ending: A Quick Recovery Still Needed

&gt; Barring a late-day reversal, DJIA‚Äôs streak of Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) will end today at two in a row. Recently we examined the record of past DF/DM occurrencesand noted that a quick DJIA recovery to pre-DF/DM levels was usually positive as it typically meant the worst of the decline was likely over. Today we delve deeper into the history of two or more DF/DMs in a row. 

&gt; Excluding the most recent occurrence, there have been two or more consecutive DF/DM‚Äôs 39 times since 2000. Of these 39, only four occurrences included three in a row. Using the last DF/DM of the streak as the starting point, the average decline from a subsequent high (within seven calendar days of Monday‚Äôs close) to the low sometime during the next 90 calendar days was 6.05% and all but three occurrences suffered a subsequent decline. Using Monday‚Äôs close as the refence point, the average decline was 4.53%. Only six of the 39 occurrences did not close lower than Monday‚Äôs close. The average number of calendar days until the low was reached was 45.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a585fbd0aabbcd377847808e5468eb9/5fd8a54415df2501-d0/s500x750/efa5fb4470880fa20bff91be98cac5f8a83a3d34.jpg))**

&gt; Looking at the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after Monday‚Äôs close of the last DF/DM of the streak, the patterns are similar to single DF/DM occurrences. If DJIA did not make a quick recovery to pre-DF/DM levels, then DJIA tended to struggle and drift lower.

# Yield Curve Inversion Triggers Risk Aversion

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_b4&amp;after.jpg))**

&gt; Unless you have been asleep for most of the day in preparation for an upcoming midnight shift, you have probably already heard, over and over, how the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling below the 2-year Treasury bond yield has a perfect record in recent years of forecasting a recession sometime in the future. The result was declines exceeding 3% by DJIA and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 just missed this mark falling 2.9%. Since 1971, when NASDAQ began, this combination of losses or worse has only occurred 66 times prior to today. And of these 66 times, 25 occurred during the financial crisis bear in 2008 and early 2009.

&gt; Plotting the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after past occurrences reveals (top chart) initial steep and brisk declines followed by modest average gains over the following 60 trading days (approximately three calendar months). However, market performance did pick up nicely at the 6-month and 12-month later points and the frequency of gains also improved. The market could be in for more choppy trading especially in the often-turbulent months of August, September and October.

# Yield Curve Inversion Raises Economic Questions

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell as low as -2 basis points (-0.02%) in trading on August 14.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/yield-curve-blog-081419-artimg.png))**

&gt; Typically, yield curve inversion, when long-term yields fall below short-term yields, is viewed as a signal of oncoming recession, although often with a relatively long lead. In the past five economic expansions, the U.S. economy has peaked an average of 21 months after the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields initially turned negative.

&gt; **U.S. Economy Remains on Solid Footing**

&gt; Even though we‚Äôre discouraged by the yield curve‚Äôs shape right now, we see few signs of danger ahead. Data shows the U.S. economy is on solid footing, and corporate debt spreads have remained contained in this latest bout of volatility. Financial conditions are still historically loose, yet there are few signs of excess in the financial system. U.S. stocks have also been resilient against yield curve inversions in the past: Historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has rallied an average of 22% from the first inversion to the eventual economic peak.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not convinced that this yield curve inversion is a sign of imminent recession,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúThe U.S. labor market is at full employment, healthy wage growth is fueling strong consumer activity, and corporate profits are at record levels.‚Äù

&gt; **Global Perspective**

&gt; Of course, recessions can be self-fulfilling prophecies of market sentiment, and we take that risk seriously. However, it‚Äôs a curious time for global fixed income right now, and Treasury yields have been weighed down by intense global buying pressure amid ultra-low sovereign debt yields elsewhere. Because of this, we think the yield curve‚Äôs shape has been driven more by technical factors than domestic economic weakness.

&gt; **Monetary Policy Remains Too Tight**

&gt; This yield curve inversion sends an important signal to Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers. U.S. monetary policy is clearly still too tight, even after last month‚Äôs 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut, given trade uncertainty and signs of slowing global growth. The Fed has promised flexibility, and we expect policymakers to enact one or two more cuts by the end of the year. Without an easier Fed, the U.S. dollar may stay elevated and global buying pressure will continue in Treasuries.

&gt; **What‚Äôs Next?**

&gt; We will continue to monitor the yield curve and incoming economic data. For now, we think the current U.S. economic expansion, now in its 11th year, has more room to run.

# A Closer Look at Technical Support

&gt; We continue to believe there is technical support for the S&amp;P 500 Index as discussed in our August 9 blog, and we‚Äôre already seeing some signs of the pessimism that is necessary for forming a bottom. The negative sentiment intensified August 14 following the inversion of the yield curve (discussed in our August 14 blog), so today we want to take a closer look at some key levels the LPL Research team is watching.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Va6wqOv.png))**

&gt; First is resistance, or levels that an index or stock may struggle to rise above. Despite Tuesday‚Äôs 1.5% gain, the S&amp;P 500 ran right into its 50-day moving average near 2,940. This level also marked the 2018 highs for the market, adding to its significance.

&gt; As for support, or levels at which we think buyers are likely to step into the market, there are three key levels we are watching:
2,822. The intraday low from August 5 is only about 1% below Wednesday‚Äôs close, but it may be viewed by short-term traders as a tactical way to gauge whether we have hit the bottom in this current pullback.
&gt; 200-day moving average. Currently at 2,796, the 200-day moving average is a closely watched trend indicator that is commonly viewed as either support or resistance, depending on where the index sits in relation to it.
&gt; 2,740. Perhaps the strongest level of support for the S&amp;P 500 is 2,740. As seen in the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Key Levels for the S&amp;P 500 Index, this benchmark has actually tested 2,740 two times so far this year, but it failed to close below that level either time. 2,740 also happens to be 9.5% below the July highs, right in line with a standard 10% correction.
&gt; ‚ÄúWe believe a retest of the December lows remains unlikely,‚Äù said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúWe think any decline beyond 10% from recent highs would be excessive, and we would recommend that suitable investors rebalance and add to positions accordingly if the S&amp;P 500 falls that far.‚Äù

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
finance,Understanding Yield Curve Inversion,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",finance

‚Äú withholding for federal tax and state ‚Äú

personalfinance,Rookie question- Refinancing home,"I know ppl refinance their house sometimes to get a lower interest rate. But why would someone want to refinance a 30 year to a 15 year if they‚Äôre getting a similar rate? I get that the house will be paid off faster but if you stick with the 30 year, cant you just increase they payments each month that go towards the principal? This way, you‚Äôre not obligated to pay a higher amount each month but can instead choose to do it which will protect you in case some unforeseen circumstance comes up and your unable to pay the higher mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,"Best app for tracking spending, expenses, budgeting? Best bank for savings &amp; checking with low balance?","So, I'm just starting a new job that will essentially double my personal income each month. My mom also lives with me and my kids, and she just started getting SS so her income nearly doubled, as well. We live in a pretty low COL area.

But I will also be building savings, for an emergency fund, for vacations to visit family, and for whatever.

I'll put my budget here in case it helps anyone help me, or if there's something I'm missing.

Everyone in my household has Medicaid, so you won't see medical insurance on the expenses, and we have food stamps at least until my next review, so you won't see much grocery costs.

personalfinance,"Student loan servicer says I owe money, but they won't send me any info and it doesn't show up on my credit report","About ten years ago I was attending a uni and for one year I took out some Federal loans along with a Perkins loan. I dropped out after that year, and sort of bounced around community colleges for a while before finally graduating with my CS degree this past December. 

Heartland ECSI hit me up a few months ago through email saying that I still owed on that Perkins loan from way back when. What I don't understand is that Federal loans show up on my credit report, the Perkins loan doesn't. I spoken numerous times with heartland ecsi, made sure that my address was all up to date. They keep telling me that they'll send me paperwork in the mail, I haven't received anything. When I try to put my information into the Heartland ECSI website, I get an error and nothing shoes up.

It's not like I can't pay off the loan, it's only about $600. But I can't pay it off if they don't give me any paperwork saying I owe them money. At this point I'm concerned that I'll be behind for my payments and that'll show up on my credit report, which I've worked very hard to get my scores up.

We also have a little over $20,000 in credit card debt with interest rates averaging 24% and a little more than $7,000 in medical debt. We just got a claim against us for $7,000 that we will be fighting in court but that means we will have to pay legal fees. Being that we just bought a house we used almost every last penny in savings and have no safety net. 

I make $52,000 a year and my wife makes $20,000 working full time, she is going to be dropping down to part time so she can go to a 2 year trade school and increase her earning potential. We are able to keep up on our payments as of right now and all of our bills are current, it will be tight with my wife dropping down to part time but I think we could still make minimum payments until she gets into her job path, but if this new judgement goes against us and if our wages get garnished we will not be able to pay our other debt. .

Some monthly numbers: house payment $1,150 ( rent around here even for an apartment is $1,000+), utilities $120, wsg $100, daycare $500-600, car payment $350, car insurance $120, phones $50, medical payment $200, credit payments $900.

btc,Observations of BTC proponents (twitter),"Today I did a bit of interacting with the haters responding to one of roger ver's pro-BCH tweets.... a few things struck me during the exchanges:

1. **Many people are completely unaware of this subreddit.**  After directing some to come to this subreddit for real info and uncensored discussion, one even commented that ""Roger even says that Reddit is censored and you present this as fact?""  There is still a high degree of ignorance in the BTC community and we shouldn't fault them for it. We can point them in the right direction of where to find honest information.
2. **Many BTC-core fans are innocently unaware of the history of Bitcoin.**  Most of the BTC supporters seem to have been convinced that slow and expensive transactions are ultimately a good thing.  To me these people are akin to 18 year olds who are convinced to join the military to fight and die for elitist wars.  They are simply brainwashed and need some help and truth.
3. **Most BCH haters seem to be people who arrived to crypto during the last bull run** (ok, obvious but...).  Keep in mind that most people are mainly followers.  They love to be part of the perceived majority. Those with unclear or non-researched beliefs will naturally gravitate towards the position of least resistance.  They see people piling on Roger's tweet and they join in the bashing.  It's a sad fact of human nature that must be unlearned.  Ironically, these THINK they are doing something good.

I believe it's important to have a more gentle (yet somewhat firm) response to these people.  Keep in mind that many who are 'hating' BCH on twitter and elsewhere are simply unsophisticated people in most cases.  Of course there are sophisticated trolls and whatnot, but I'm speaking of the majority here not the niche minority of aggressive disinfo agents and btc propagandists.

Drop this subreddit into twitter threads (point 1.)  Sadly, I see too few people speaking up on Twitter to defend the ideals of fungible p2p cash while directing the brainwashed crypto masses to uncensored info.  Eyes will be opened since uncensored truth and better ideas will always win out.

**Personally, I also like hitting on a few points like:  the fact that things DO change, that btc maxis are full of psuedo intellectuals like Saifedean and that in order to have true freedom we need an inexpensive and fungible p2p means of exchange.  It's hard to argue with the truth.**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Is Chase Slate recommended for me, and should I try to move two balances over?","Hello,   

Around the end of last year I had the realization that I haven't been wise with my money, and after leaving a higher payer job I had basically forgotten to stop spending like I still had that job, in addition to spending a stupid amount on gas for my commute. The short version is that I have an Amex card with 7100 on it, and a Chase at 4000. Both have APR above 24%, monthly payments are about 212 and 120 respectively, iirc. I have a few other sources of debt (car, student loans, care credit) which are relatively low and I consider manageable, and I'm starting classes again so my 340 monthly student loan payment should go into deferment next month. My fiance and I are trying to buy a home soon and my Amex has been a noted problem. I would like to move it to a 0% and see good things about the Chase Slate, and am curious if that is still recommended and if I should try to move the Chase balance over to it as well if I can.   

I've started tracking my finances on my computer and set myself up with an allowance debit card for my spending, so I can focus on paying down my debts. From memory: 
Income: 2060 monthly
Credit: 698, high credit utilization is the only negative, just paid off 2 credit cards but also taking inquiries for mortgage. 
Student loans: 20,000 monthly 340 going into deferment for classes; adding 3500 per semester. 
Auto: 3,000 monthly 105
Other debts: around 4,000 combined (medical, tools, old credit card with low apr), monthly: 200
Rent: 320 (but total commute is around 6 hours every day..)
Other/utilities/bills: 350 (from memory) 
Personal budget: 250. 

I *think* if I moved both Chase and Amex to a 0% I could pay about 7000 into it in the next 15 months (212 + 120 + 125 from two paid cards snowballing over), that it would be 0%, leaving just the 4000 for the new APR which I would think shouldn't be much more if any than my current interest rates. 

Edit: my fiance really wants to move closer to work (similar commute) in a few months, be it a house or apartment, so I have not shifted the student loan payments into this, but would be an additional 340 if we ended up not moving).

Wouldn't foreign demand for treasuries collapse in the event of NIRP and cause international monetary chaos as foreign countries dump bonds? For this reason, would the Fed never consider NIRP?

personalfinance,Isn't Roth IRA always better than Traditional if you are young now that your money will have many years to growth?,"I used the online Compound Interest Calculator on [moneychimp.com](https://moneychimp.com). For an annual addition of $6k (current IRA limit) and 30 years to grow, with an interest rate of 7% (average return if I put all in index fund), then over 30 years, I would have contributed $180k, and ended up with $606,438.25 ( https://imgur.com/R3UD6fM ) .

If I contributed through Roth IRA, assume my effective total income tax during employment is 30%, then I pay $180k \* 0.3 = $54k in taxes. But I get to withdraw all that $606,438.25 entirely tax-free during my retirement.

If I contributed through Traditional IRA, then during retirement, I would have to pay taxes on all that $606,438.25 as I withdraw my IRA fund. Assume my effective total income tax during retirement is 15% (which is 15% lower than during employment), then I pay $606,438.25 \* 0.15 = $90.965k in taxes compared to the $54k tax I would pay if I choose Roth.

Even if I use 35% tax during employment and 11% tax during retirement, that is still $63k vs $66.7k tax. So my effective tax bracket after 401k deduction and 12k standard deduction would have to be over 35% or my retirement tax bracket would have to be less than 11%, which mean I can only withdraw 10k + 12k standard deduction during retirement for Traditional IRA to be better than Roth.

personalfinance,Medical Student Loans Advice!,"Hello Reddit! Long post but much appreciated with any help! I'm sure others are in similar places.

Here is my situation. Just graduated med school and doing pediatrics. I've tried to learn as much as I can about finance. Here are the options/thought I have so far. Please forgive any of my ignorance! 

About me: Peds intern with 3 years of residency left making 58-65k/year; undecided on pursuing fellowship (another 3 years). Earning potential 130-175k starting out. Spouse is an anesthesia resident 3 years left making 62-70k/year, earning potential 250-300k starting out. We live frugally as much we can and plan to use our combined incomes to pay off my debt. We hope to live somewhere west coast (AZ, CA, TX, etc). No other debts! Our goal is to be debt free asap!

Debt info: Federal loans- 10 loans with varying interest rates averaged to 5.98% in total about $326,000! (:o); so far about 43k in unpaid interest from 4 years of med school. All debts are still in grace/forbearance for 6 months.  

Options (no particular order):

A) Refinance loans now with private lender- Sofi offered me 4% fixed interest rate for 5 year term, no origination fee or prepayment fee. Finance charge about 90k. During residency minimum payment of $100/mo, and interest is only accruing and not amortized until 6 months after residency. After residency increases to about $7700/mo for the 5 year term. However, if I did this plan, I would prepay extra $2500/mo during residency to avoid interest and pay down the principle too. Then after residency, prepay about 7-11k in extra payments per month to pay off fast. I'm not familiar enough with the finance/math to figure out how much that would save me, help?

\-concerns: i don't really understand finance charge, I'm afraid I'll lose out on federal loan benefits (income based repayments, loan forgiveness) in the case I really needed it (death, disability, can't find a job). Is potential money saved worth the risk?

B) Consolidate all federal loans to one of the income based repayment plans- This will be a weighted and rounded average to 6%. Also from what I understand, this will change my principle balance to \~369k (323 original principle + 43 of unpaid interest) and the 6% will accrue on that during the grace period and compound thereafter. If this were my plan, I would do the same in terms of paying 2500/mo during residency and 7-11k/mo afterward. Also, not sure how much that is more compared the refinance loans from Option A above. 

C) Do the above but without consolidating- I believe this allows me to pay down the accrued interest during the 6 month grace period and start off with a lower principle at the weighted average of 5.98%. This will also help me if I want to pay off certain loans first. ie, Avalanche method of paying off highest interest loan fist vs snowball paying off smallest debts first.

\-concerns: this is a bit more complex since there will be multiple loans to handle, makes things more stressful compared to a fixed payment under the consolidation from Option B above. 

D) PSLF is an option but I honestly do not trust the government enough and I also hate having debt above my head for 120 payments/10years. I also don't really want to be working full time for 10 years (requirement to qualify).

personalfinance,Should I Refinance My Student Loans to buy a car?,"Hey r/personalfinance!

I am a 26 yo with just over 41k in student loans. In the last 2 years, I have been able to pay down about 15k in credit card debt and am down from about 55k in student loan debt.

I currently make 70k/yr, and live rent/mortgage free with my partner. Due to the advantage, I refinanced my private loan last year to make my total monthly loan contribution 1000$ a month in payments as I round up to the nearest hundred on all repayments to make it easy on me with the added benefit of a little faster repayment. My private loan in a 5yr repayment with a current balance of 27,500$ at 5.2% and I'm currently paying 800$ per month toward. The remaining 200$ goes to my federal loans all with lower interest rates (3-4%) on your stock 10 year repayment plan.

I have been very consistent in paying off this debt, and I live fairly frugally, but I can't help but feel a punch to the gut when I part ways with 1000$ every single month (30% of my take home pay). I have been tracking my net worth which has been incredibly motivating, especially with the credit card debt I paid off, but I can't help but think I can be making better financial use (i.e.: investing) with my money. Furthermore, I started a job where I am commuting 80 minutes both ways on public transit, so I am currently trying to save up for a car that would bring down my commute to 30 minutes both ways by car, saving me almost 2 hours a day. I know some people have crazy long commutes is soul crushing to me. 

So, is refinancing worth anything? I got pre-approved for 4.8 and a 4.48% refi for my private loan at 27.5k and it would bring my monthly payment down to 500$ for a 5 year repayment decreasing my monthly contributions by 300$. By restarting the time on the clock would I be making any significant mistakes?

Edit: clarification on commute times.",finance

I spend quite a bit of money going out, boat fuel, various activities. Probably somewhere around $500/month or more, if I had to guess (I need to do a much better job tracking this).

My question is, am I contributing too much to my retirement instead of paying off debt?? Or should I be using some of my liquid assets/savings funds to pay off some of these loans (thinking car and student loan 1)? I've gotten a much better return on my self managed portfolio than the interest rate on these loans.

Ideally I'd like to retire at 50 (debt free, obviously), and I dont anticipate my income increasing drastically. Other than being more tight with my discretionary spending (and throwing that money at debt), anything else I should be doing? 

Thanks for the thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,Student housing payment advice,"**Throwaway because I‚Äôm honestly feeling extremely embarrassed about this situation. 


I start classes at the new university I‚Äôm transferring to (out of state) in two weeks. My parents had agreed to pay my deposit and first months rent for me to live off campus as I have just used all my savings to pay for a nearly 7,000 surgery in cash and I also had to put a down payment on a new car because my current ones transmission is going bad. Long story short, my family is unreliable and are now most likely not going to pay this expense. I was supposed to travel to my new city tomorrow to put a deposit down and pay my first months rent at my new apartment. Due to this being last minute, I do not have the money for these expenses and I am now in a bind to pay for this stuff ASAP as I start classes August 26th and need somewhere to live. I need advice on how to pay for my deposit and first month rent within the week. Is there anyway I can access my federal student loans for this? What student loan providers could disperse me the money to use to pay for housing ahead of the upcoming semester? Must I go the private loan route as to get the money this week?

personalfinance,Which is better: contributing more to 401k or borrowing less?,"My situation is pretty simple: I have a wife in school who has to borrow money to attend. Her school's tuition exceeds the amount offered in federal loans, so in addition to those, she has to borrow private loans at 7.5% interest. I have the option of reducing her private loan burden or increasing my 401k contribution. My plan right now is to contribute to my 401k up to the matching amount (6% of my salary), then use the rest to reduce her debt burden.

personalfinance,Using all my savings to pay my debts and collections?,"Finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel ... but noooot quite there. I am building up some extra money finally and want to finish paying off my debts ASAP but I am unsure what to move forward with first. I wrecked my credit when I lost my job several years ago, but it's been a few years and I'm slowly building everything back up. My car was totaled in December (parked on a city street and someone driving down the street slammed into 3 parked cars, mine being one of them). My new car loan ended up having a 14% interest rate (I cringe even writing that). I tried to refinance this loan in July since my credit score is much higher now, and I was denied a better loan from everywhere I applied. I have some extra money I can use to help my credit situation, but I don't know what is best to do first. 

Current situation :

\- 5k in Savings  
\- 4k in credit debt, around 23% APR  
\- about $5k in collections currently, and I am hoping I can negotiate to pay less. (I could use advice on this as well. Hoping to pay about half if this is possible.)  
\- 14k car loan with 14% interest rate - hoping to refinance soon  
\-649 credit score

Now, I can't afford to pay all the debt at once. But I have 5k hanging around so I want to use this. Should I pay off the collection accounts first ? They aren't accruing interest while the credit card debt is, but I am also thinking this is a big thing stopping lenders from giving me loans.

personalfinance,Painful surprise about student loan,"I'm one of those adults that was a new grad during the recession. My parents had no background with money and pretty irresponsible with money in general. I was naive and ended up going to a university that cost way too much. But I did well and I graduated with a research assistant job in 2008. I pulled my credit report and got to work cleaning up my student debt. I owed $90k. And so I lived in a room in a house for $550 in DC, shopped at goodwill, and prepaid and saved money. I wasn't making much in 2008 ($42k) in DC but I spent as little as possible. I switched jobs as long as I could make more money and then I started prepaying the debt more aggressively. So many things I did not get - no new electronics, I went to library for internet access, and I never bought furniture. I bought a super used beater car with 135k miles on it for work once I left DC. I was able to save enough to attend graduate school without borrowing a cent as I got a full tuition scholarship and only needed to pay living expenses. Then one day I was visiting family and I found out my mom and my sister were arguing about a student loan. My mom was having her wages garnished as the loan was defaulted on 9 years back. My sister is a year older and defaulted on all loans co-signed (over $100k) so my parents assumed it was hers. My dad is pretty reserved but told me he was covering the plus loan so I thought everything that was mine was accounted for....but no. This plus loan that was in default for over 9 years was apparently associated with my university. My mom is incredibly irresponsible with money and credit, but I feel incredibly guilty. She says she didn't know about it at all over the entire 9 years. I repeatedly think about just paying it off with my retirement savings but it'd be a big hit to me and she will still be very irresponsible. She is close to retirement...does wage garnishment for fed plus loans apply to social security? I needed special permission to even speak to the servicer as legally I'm not responsible for the loan. I have a chronic medical condition also that requires some expensive supplies. This is the only reason I still owe $23k of the original $90k. I'm just torn and wondering if anyone had a similar situation. My other sibling is on SSI. I know I'm going to get hit with some big obligations down the road as my parents age. 

TLDR - I diligently prepaid and am paying all debt in my name. My sister defaulted on all student loans resulting in confusion about a single PLUS loan. I don't know what it was originally as interest has accrued. O/s it is ab $47k now. This one Loan supported my education and was defaulted on 9+ years ago. I had no knowledge as plus loans don't show up on the credit report of the student...just the parent. Do I suck it up and pay out of my retirement or let it go and hope they don't garnish my mom's social security?",finance
personalfinance,FAFSA Student Assets (Need Advice),"Hello,

I plan on filing FAFSA in the next two years when I transfer from my community college to a CSU or UC. Currently, I have $18k in my personal savings accounts from working part time but it will likely be over 20k when I actually file. I‚Äôve read that student assets count most towards EFC at 20% and I would like to shift assets classes to minimize the amount this money will count against my federal aid. I want to do it legally of course, and have read that the best way is to put it into an existing 529 college savings account under my parents name or create a new 529 account under my name. Will this shift the money to a parent asset instead of a student asset? And does the fact that I will be claiming to be dependent of my mother, but have a 529 account in my fathers name make any difference? Also, does it matter when I put the money into the 529. For example, if I get audited for verification, will they care if they see a transfer from my savings into a 529 right before I file FAFSA, or does the timing not matter since this is just legal assets class shifting. A lot of questions, I know. I would just like to maximize aid and I appreciate any answers or links you can provide me.

personalfinance,Benefits of Knowing Kiddie Tax Rules,"This is a topic area rarely discussed here, but I feel deserves attention.  There are solid tax benefits that can be appropriately realized if you have children.  Ironically, the Kiddie Tax rules, as they call them, were supposed to get simpler under the new tax law.  While generally more generous at lower incomes, I find the new rules more complex.

Kiddie Taxes refers to taxes on children's passive income.  On the generous side, children can make about $4,700 in capital gains with zero federal taxes.  If they also have interest/dividend income, it gets a little more complicated as I found the potential for double taxation between the cap gains and interest/dividends.  If the child has interest/dividends, I have found it is best to keep them to $1k.  So that $1k in interest/dividends + $3.7k cap gains still leads to zero federal taxes.  $2k interest/dividends + $2.7k capital gains results is very low taxes too.  But if you let interest/dividends go much above $2k, you could get double-taxed if you also have some cap gains.

Before I get into strategies, please note that each strategy involves giving money to your kids in a custodial account.  You can access the money to cover any expenses that are for the direct benefit of the child, which is pretty loosely defined.  So camps, clothes, back-to-school, activities, etc. are all good.  A shared expense like part of your mortgage, probably not good. (Note, you do not have to justify each withdrawal to anyone as you make it, but the IRS has the right to come in and audit if they wish).  

My ideas on how to leverage these rules:

Emergency funds:  You want to maximize the interest you make on these funds.  If you put them in your name, in a high yield savings account, after-taxes you cannot even keep up with inflation.  Instead, you could put these funds in your child's custodial account (bank or brokerage) and earn interest/cap-gains tax free.  With a good investment (eg, high grade, short-term bonds), you can beat inflation while taking minimal risk, which secures the continued value of these funds.  To withdraw, you will want to justify withdrawals against expenses for the direct benefit of child, so you only want to park as much in the child's name as you think you could reasonably tap into based upon what you think you could justify.

Cap Gains reduction:  You can give appreciated stock to your kids, they can sell it tax free and then they can pay for or reimburse you for appropriate expenses until the money is fully returned to you.  

Starting a college or long term savings:  Many people leverage 529s for college savings.  But you do not need to start saving for college with a 529 since your child can earn interest/cap gains tax-free up to a certain point.  So in the case where you have not started saving because you still have on your list to figure out 529s, know that it's better to get started saving now with a custodial brokerage account and that you still have time to figure out the 529.  

Topping off college savings:  Not all costs are necessarily covered by a 529 plan (eg, room and board can get tricky).  Having some college savings in a custodial account, where the tax rate is still 0%, allows for flexibility.  Any expenses you may incur that are not covered by the 529 can be covered by the custodial funds instead.",finance

personalfinance,How are student loan interest payments calculated and does it make sense to contribute to a Roth IRA while paying them down?,"My dad and I were having a discussion about the best way for me to pay my student loans down and one of us has the wrong idea about how the interest rates are calculated.

I have about 100k in student loan debt with a 4.5% interest rate. The refinancing company overpaid slightly (5k, I should have double checked everything before signing so this is my fault). My dad is insisting that I'd be better off holding onto that money until the end of the loan rather than paying it back. His thought process is that the monthly interest payments are already calculated based off of the principal borrowed since it's a fixed rate loan. So he's saying any additional payments will only come off of the back end of the loan. 

I was under the impression that the interest payments were calculated each month based off of the remaining loan balance. So if I paid that $5000 back tomorrow, it would be like it never happened (obviously I've already paid a few days of interest on it but that's negligible). 

This then raises the question, why would I pay *anything* above the minimum ($1000/mo, 10 yrs)? By his logic I'd be better off holding onto it in a HYSA until the balance that I have is equal to the payoff balance.

So who is right?

I'm familiar with the flowchart that shows what you should pay off first and that recommends paying off all medium interest debt before contributing to a Roth IRA (I contribute to get the max match in a 401k already). I thought that it would be logical to put $3k or so into a Roth IRA this year as it would be worth about 10x in 40 years and that seems pretty appealing. However, it seems like the flowchart is saying don't contribute anything until all debts are paid off, which won't happen for 6-10 years and then I'll be that much behind in my Roth IRA.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off mortgage vs. putting money into retirement acounts,"Hello all! This question is for my version of the perennial ""pay down debt vs. invest"" question that pops up here a lot. Just wanted to get any feedback people might have on my specific situation.

My wife has a full-time salaried job whereas I'm mostly a freelancer (with occasional short-term salaried gigs that don't as a rule offer access to retirement accounts). We're both in our mid-40s. Our retirement strategy has always been that she puts money into her 401k and I put a set portion of my income every year into a SEP-IRA. We definitely haven't regretted putting money into the market for the past 10 years of a bull market! But it seems possible that there are some economic wobbles looming, plus there's a quirk of the new tax code makes a SEP-IRA a less desirable investment (details here: [https://www.kitces.com/blog/199a-qbi-deduction-reduction-small-business-owner-retirement-plan-contributions-roth/](https://www.kitces.com/blog/199a-qbi-deduction-reduction-small-business-owner-retirement-plan-contributions-roth/) but basically because SEP-IRA contributions count as ""business expenses,"" they now count against your qualified business income, and thus the total of the new 20% 199A deduction; the upshot is that every dollar contributed to a SEP now only reduces your federal taxable income by 80 cents, but SEP account funds are still fully taxable upon withdrawal). So I've been thinking about alternatives for my half of our retirement savings equations.

We are just over two years into the mortgage on our home, which started at $480,500 and is at 4.5%. I'm wondering if it wouldn't make sense to put the money I set aside for retirement into our mortgage instead, at least in part. To me, it \*feels\* almost like the equivalent to a Roth-style retirement account, in that the money you get out at the end -- in the form of either more cash netted when we sell the house or a longer period of not having to make a mortgage payment -- comes (mostly, more on which in a minute) tax free. It also has the advantage of not having any limits on what you can put in, the way retirement accounts do. (Last year, for instance, I put \~$7,800 into my SEP, but if I wanted to put money in a traditional or Roth IRA instead I'd be limited to $6,000.) I like the idea of being fairly risk-averse with at least part of our retirement savings, so they idea of a set 4.5% return as opposed to what we could potentially get from the market is honestly appealing to me.

The trick, and what makes this not quite like a Roth-style savings account, is that we lose some of the tax deduction for mortgage interest. Last year our itemized deduction was \~$33K, so we're still a ways off from filing the standard deduction, even post-tax reform. We're in a 30% combined state/federal marginal bracket. The effect would start relatively small -- if I had put in my $7,800 in retirement into the mortgage last year, it would've increased our taxes by $105 for the year -- but would snowball over time if I kept putting more in, and I'd probably be anal-retentive enough that I'd want to keep track of it and pay off the difference with money set aside for retirement just to keep everything ""revenue neutral"" in terms of my main budget. 

Anyway, this has been a long-winded way of asking if this idea is at least semi-reasonable, or if there are big tax or other considerations I'm not taking into account! Any input is welcome (although I'm not particularly interested in transforming myself into an S-Corp, which seems to be an immediate response here whenever I mention being a freelancer.)",finance

Bitcoin,"If Capital appreciation is the sole source of wealth, why does the government want to make it illegal/impossible to save money?","Under the fiat system, the government treats all economic problems as resolvable with low interest rates that shift capital from investment to consumption.

What is true for the farmer is equally true in the economy -- the more we consume today, the less we will have tomorrow. 

When many people ""hoard"" money, they increase its value, which allocates capital toward those who are best able to invest it, but does not force anyone to spend or invest for the sole purpose of escaping inflation. The result is a continually increasing capital stock, and prosperity. 

Contrast this with Japanese perpetual zero interest rate policy, where money, unable to earn a return, flees the country as fast as it is earned, and you will understand the economic purpose of Bitcoin.

Tiny bit of background. I have my RRSP humming for retirement, building an emergency fund, and have essentially no debt. I have a good salary and am looking to start building wealth through an investment portfolio but currently dont have one open. 

The logical route would be to start throwing $X/month into an investment portfolio.

The unrestricted line of credit is variable but given interest rates are low currently(and if the recession talk is true likely to not increase short term), the interest would be about 5%(maybe less), via a stock portfolio i could earn maybe 6%. 

Both of the above percentages are not guaranteed/ may not stay the same over time. However wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to pay down the line of credit by $X/month instead of buying stock at a $X/month, assuming the total value is equal?

However, hearing all the fear and hype, and seeing the Great Flight to bonds and commodities and other instruments, it causes me to reflect on what I see happening now, vs. what I remember from the past.

So, when real recessions were underway here's what I remember:

1. People were not universally warning me to avoid stocks. If anything, bubble hype was so great that I was told I ""couldn't lose"" by investing in tech, or real estate, or whatever else was fashionable at the time. I remember one friend actually becoming angry when I suggested that real estate was as susceptible to market uncertainty as anything else.

2. My company stopped giving out bonuses and raises, for years. People were laid off during successive waves of ""restructuring"". Recruiters called less often. Jobs were harder to find. Many of my friends had difficulty finding new work, or were out of jobs for months. There was a feeling of things ""drying up"".

3. During the last recession, Europe became rather expensive to visit (1.47 EUR/USD in Dec 2008). In general, purchasing power felt like it was... less, though this could have just been psychological.

In short, the recession environment made life feel like it was becoming more difficult. Whereas in the current climate, borrowing is still easy, interest rates are low, recruiters are calling, companies  pay competitively, my friends are taking trips and vacations and spending their money. The only place I notice ""recession"" cropping up is in the news, over and over.

I'm hopeful it stays there, but it makes me wonder how much of this is just fear levels reaching a fever pitch. Which could, I imagine, provoke the very thing everyone is afraid of, if the market depreciates assets too severely and everyone begins to panic.",finance

We had every service record the car EVER went through before we took ownership so we know it was taken care of (surprisingly well). 
  
  Now for the downside. I don‚Äôt know much about building credit. I know I need to establish myself because my (well both of ours) credit wasn‚Äôt established and that‚Äôs how we got. 25% interest rate. Obviously refinancing is step one for paying off the car. We looked into it but didn‚Äôt have the spare money to pay down the value a bit without draining our entire savings. They wanted 700$ and we had about 750$ saved up after some medical bills that came up with our youngest dog drained it once already. So we‚Äôre waiting for tax refunds and just throwing all of that to refinance for a better rate to save a little more money. 


  
  But aside from just paying my bills on tome and not using more than 40% of my credit card. How do I really build myself up? Do I apply for another card? Do I just keep paying everything down and making sure to use the card at least once a month to keep it active? We have a small balance on it of about $180 that we‚Äôre making the minimum payments on. When I get my performance bonuses every month I tend to throw extra at it to pay it off faster.

personalfinance,Plan for paying off student loans?,"Hello! 

I currently have about 24 thousand dollars in student loans. I currently make around 30 thousand dollars a year. 

Interest rates are: 3.7%, 3.8%, 4.2%, 4.4% and 4.6%

I average about $2400 a month but this varies as I also work on commission that is on top of my hourly. 

Here are my monthly expenses: 

Rent: 550

Utilities: About $100 a month, sometimes more. 

Pet insurance: Currently $68 a month, will be going down to $23 a month in October as I cancelled the plan for my kitten and kept it for my elderly cat. 

Food: $150 a month roughly. I don‚Äôt eat out much as is but I can maybe cut this. 

Gym: $10 a month 

Spotify: $10 a month 

Phone: $30 a month 

Cat food: $40 a month 

Prescription for my elderly cat: $15 a month 

I work downtown and do not drive, my bus pas is paid for by my work so transportation is next to nothing unless I need to Uber which is rare. 

Total: Roughly 943 a month. 

Total monthly income: $2400

I want to ask, how can I best tackle my student loans without having to survive on ramen for the next few years? I make decent money compared to my expenses in my opinion and I as of right now live pretty comfortably but I would like to pay these off immediately so I can forget about them and move on. 

I have been considering getting a second job as well and using all income from that to pay them off more quickly but I also already have a high stress job and worry about working myself too hard. 

Any advice would be amazing!! Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out subsidized federal loan?,"Subsidized loan does not accumulate interest until 6 months after you graduation the 4 years school. 

For the first 2 years when I'm in community college, Pell grant is enough. But after transfering to a 4 years university, Pell grant alone won't do it. Also there is a limit per year/semester for how much you can take loan from the government.

So I'm thinking taking out the 0% interest loan out right now while not needing it. This way I can use this money to add into later tuitions without having to take out a loan that charges interest. 

It sounds like a no brainer question but I'm just asking if it is possible to do this. Also to reassure in case I have some hidden mental disability that alter my thinking.",finance
personalfinance,"Want to pay off $80,000 in Loans and CC asap","Hello,

I'm (26m) looking to pay off most if not all my debt by the time I'm 30 if that's even possible considering all my debt, bad choices, and overall situation. I currently make $46,000 a year working in construction estimating and work a typical 9-6 weekday desk job. I studied in Mechanical Engineering in a top public university, but due to my poor efforts in school, this is about the most I have been able to get for myself. Virtually no savings at this point, but maybe I can build on that as well.

To start, I currently owe about $33,000 in student debt that breaks down to $30k in federal debt and about $3k I owe to the university itself. Each have it's own interest rate with federal being from Great Lakes . The Great Lakes account possesses variable subsidized and un-subsidized loans averaging about 5% interest rate but I'm only barely noticing that I have paid about $7000 overall in about 3 years and only $2000 of it has actually gone to my balance. Highway robbery imo so I'm looking to change this any way I can. I did sign up for income-based repayment and I just learned that it's the biggest scam on earth. As of now, I pay $360 per month and that's recommended by Great Lakes to pay off in about Dec. 2026.

In addition, I'm financing a new SUV that I pay $585 per month. It's on a 6 year plan I just started in April and it has an APR of about 5.5%, with the out the door cost being a little under $40k. Obviously not the best deal I got for a 2019 mid-range SUV but at the time I just wanted to work towards owning something (bad line of thinking I know).

On top of this, I owe about $8000 in credit card debt that stemmed from health expenses, emergency spending, and bad choices.  This is over the range of 3 credit cards with $7000 of it being on an Amazon Prime card that has 16.5% APR. I'm sure I need to refinance this card but I'm currently being denied for balance transfer requests (2 made thus far).

I currently live at home with parents who I help with apartment rent and general living expenses ($500 per month living in expensive SoCal!) . My parents understand my crappy financial situation so $500 is a minimum they need from me to live in our current apartment. So below is a list of my monthly expenses that goes to my $2740 monthly income (after taxes, some bills split with family):

* Min. Car Payment: $585
* Rent/Living: $500
* Great Lakes: $360
* Min. Credit Card Payment: $225 (total across 3 different cards)
* Geico Insurance: $130
* Savings: $100
* Gas (Work commute strictly): $80
* TMobile Cellphone: $50
* Spectrum Internet: $35
* Online Streaming BS: $35
* Gym: $10

The good news is I do have a decent 715 credit score since I have managed to make timely payments, but I realize it may take a long time for me to get out of my debt. I get various snail mail offers for refinancing that I can post. I can go into more detail for sure but figure this enough text to give everyone a good idea about how I live financially. 

I''m sorry for this wall of text but I really want to turn my life around and figure my first step in doing so is asking for help at least from fellow Reddit strangers. At this point I may need to meet with a financial adviser, but again, just thought I'd start here. Thank you for your time.",finance

My question is:
What are some other 'blow your mind' approaches/mindsets/ways of thinking in life-design/health/relationships/finance/problem solving/stress management/time management/learning how to learn/limiting beliefs/risk taking/maximising your potential  ..or anything else really..) that have completely changed your life in a big way?

personalfinance,Can't afford car anymore. Trading down a bad idea?,"Hey there, I'm currently making payments on a 2017 Honda Accord Sport and, after over a year of on-time payments, I'm realizing I can't keep this thing for much longer. Life has hit me with some unexpected financial curveballs and is making it impossible to get ahead of. I'm wondering if ""trading down"" is my best financial move. 

My car has 40K miles on it and I pay $512/mo, plus $154/mo for insurance, have a 1.9% interest rate, and owe $23,795 on my car. I believe I have around $3500-4000 in negative equity? (Unsure how to find the exact amount)

I've been thinking for a while that my payment is too high considering my compensation at work, which requires a working vehicle and am actively seeking new employment but this payment is eating a huge portion of my current monthly income, making me lose track of other payments.

Should I find a new/used car valued for significantly less, even including my negative equity, and pay on that instead?

For example, there's a Nissan dealership doing a 13K new altima event but that feels like a bad choice. After taxes, title and equity, I'd probably only save a minuscule amount on my current loan, maybe. 

But I don't mind an older car so why not go back to a 2005-2008 and save myself some money? What is my best financial choice here? Does trading down in this way even work like I think it does? Am I better off just paying on it?

MachineLearning,[D] Rectified Adam (RAdam): a new state of the art optimizer,"https://medium.com/@lessw/new-state-of-the-art-ai-optimizer-rectified-adam-radam-5d854730807b

This blog post discusses a new optimizer built on top of Adam, [introduced in this paper by Liyuan Liu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265v1). Essentially, they seek to understand why a warmup phase is beneficial for scheduling learning rates, and then identify the underlying problem to be related to high variance and poor generalization during the first few batches. They find that the issue can be remedied by using either a warmup/low initial learning rate, or by turning off momentum for the first couple of batches. As more training examples are fed in, the variance stabilizes and the learning rate/momentum can be increased. They therefore proposed a Rectified Adam optimizer that dynamically changes the momentum in a way that hedges against high variance. The author of the blog post tests an implementation in Fastai and finds that RAdam works well in many different contexts, enough to take the leaderboard of the Imagenette mini-competition. 

Implementations can be found on the [author's Github](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/RAdam).",technology
personalfinance,Big Ole Pile of Debt,"Just graduated, finally have cash flow!!! Here's my initial post, mostly to keep myself in check. (Posting here instead of at Dave's BC it seems there is more breadth of knowledge here.)

Combined household income \~145k

Assets:

1. Used car (2002 with 100k miles) paid in full, my Dave ride :) Will ride this into the ground.
2. 2014 Tacoma (3.9% interest rate, paid 30k including financing in 2015, blue book value 27k, owe 14k) will ride into the ground.
3. We own our home free and clear. . . got an inheritance for purchase/DP, been here 12 years, now paid off in full... no I will not sell, no I will not take a mortgage or home equity line of credit. Once debt (per below) is addressed, plan to move out first (husband is a first time home buyer) then renovate and sell current home with anticipated 100-120k profit OR rent it.
4. My 401k from previous employer \~40k, 403b from previous employer \~30k, plan to roll these into my new employer's plan once eligible to participate in 01/2020.
5. Husband's 401k \~50k
6. We had a lot of toys but sold them as per Dave. 

**Debt Breakdown:**

Credit Cards (snow balling these):

1. Consumer card $500 - paid off
2. Delta miles card $2k - paid off
3. Amex $4k - up next, pay off goal date of Nov 30
4. PNC $4k - pay off goal date of Feb 28 2020

Other debts (avalanche approach):

1. Husband's student loans (10k paid off, 13k remain) 
2. My student loans (209k in Direct sub/unsub loans ranging from 3.4 to 7.0% APR, 13k at 5% in Perkins loans) - currently on ?IBR for direct loans but thought I had applied for REPAYE! Working on that... once I get the REPAYE confirmed I will attack the Perkins loans first and just make min pymts on the Direct loans)
3. Truck's APR is less than that of student aid loans and will be paid off ""on schedule"" before all of the above.

Other important facts about my situation: 

1. I work for a private entity not a non-profit. I love my job, no plan to leave unless a really perfect opportunity presents itself.
2. My son is going to be old enough that he no longer requires child care!!! A lot of my student loan debt paid for daycare and summer camp. He just turned 11 and next summer will be less expensive!!!
3. My husband pays about $500/mo in child support - this will end in 2 years. We do not plan on funding college on the front end, rather helping with tuition once good grades have been earned. This same approach will apply to my son.

I am terrible when it comes to anything financial and like an idiot I‚Äôve been saving extra money instead of paying off my loans. I have $20k that I‚Äôve saved up that I‚Äôd like to use towards paying off my loans.

My private loan is for around $4k and has a high interest rate of 8.5% which I‚Äôm paying off first. The rest of the $16k I want to use towards the 6 gov loans I have. 

My question is, is interest rate the only factor I need to look at when paying off the loans? Do I just pay off the ones with the highest interest rates first or does it matter how old the loan is and how large it is?

I know that in the beginning you pay more interest and towards the end of the loan‚Äôs life you pay more principle. Do I need to take into account what ‚Äústage‚Äù each loan is at?

personalfinance,Is it stupid of me to just take my entire savings and pay the last of my student loans off in full? I‚Äôm scared to pull the trigger!,"So here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôve been working at my current job for about 9 months now. It‚Äôs my first job making (barely) over six figures. Prior to getting this job, I was unemployed for almost 6 months after getting unexpectedly laid off in a ‚Äúdownsizing‚Äù at my last place. It just so happened to coincide with me moving into a new apt of my own and buying all new furniture and spending money on repairs, etc. so I ran up some debt during this time. I think I have a bit of PTSD from that experience, as I did not expect it to take anywhere near that long to land another job. 

Anyway - Right now I have about $5.5k in a savings account. I have about that same amount remaining of my student loans, which are at 6.25%. I have about $61k in my 401k (I make the minimum contribution to get the full match from my job). I have about $3500 in employee stock and $2500 in my own little investment account. I also have about $28k in credit card debt spread across 3 cards that are all 0% for at least the next year. My take home pay is about $4k and my ‚Äúoperating expenses‚Äù are about $2500.

I‚Äôm really tempted to just zero out my cash savings and pay the student loan off in full, as it‚Äôs the only amount accruing interest right now. However, the thought of having zero cash on hand even temporarily freaks me out. Would it be wise/worth it to just bite the bullet and go for it and just work on replenishing my savings little by little? I do expect to get a bonus and tax return in the beginning of 2020 which I was going to throw toward the debt but could theoretically just replenish my savings. This would mean potentially 6 months with little to no cash savings on hand üòñ What would you guys suggest?

EDIT:  I gross $4038 biweekly. Taxes are $1210 combined per paycheck (Fed, State, SDI, City, Medicare, etc). Pretax deductions of $529 (401k, transit, healthcare, etc). Post tax deductions of $202 (employee stock purchase plan which I do to get employer match). So biweekly net is $2098. 

I budget on two paychecks a month which is usually the case other than two ‚Äúbonus‚Äù months where I get 3 checks. I usually throw the bonus one toward debt.

The $2500 expenses I mentioned are monthly and include my rent (HCOL area), phone, internet, gym, etc.

Thanks for all of the responses. Seems I need to look at my withholding based on everyone‚Äôs reactions. This job was a big raise from my last one and I filled out my onboarding forms in a hurry. I guess I didn‚Äôt notice my take home pay was so low because it still seemed super high to me.",finance

datascience,I have been in a data science role for 2 years but have never once deployed a full scale ML solution...,"I have been a data scientist for 2 years (always in consulting firms), and I have yet to deploy a model for a client.

To avoid being pigeonholed as simply a SQL / tableau guy (though I certainly enjoy both those things, I just don't want them to define my skill set), I have been compensating by learning other data engineering/devops related technologies. For instance, my clients often need assistance with cloud deployments, so I have become an AWS expert... Another client was developing a web app and was using AWS lambda to process data, so I beefed up my node.js and typescript skills.

Don't get me wrong, I'm loving learning these new skills. However, I can't shake the fact that I spent all this time learning ML when I should have been focusing on more ""practical"" tools.

**Is this a trend that other data scientists are noticing? Outside of research, where are ML skills actually needed?

As of right now I have 3 accounts. 2 with Wells Fargo, one saving and one checking, and one with Morgan Stanley which is a checking account (I think, I have a debit card hooked up to it, so I'm assuming checking).

I just turned 18 and I am now getting my first student credit card, as well as opening an IRA account!

As I get older and start making more money I read it's good to make a new account and have that as an emergency fund. How should I pick which bank to put it in? Should I go with Wells Fargo/Morgan Stanley as I already have accounts with them? Or should I look into higher interest rates?

What other accounts should I look into for the future?

personalfinance,FHA-HAMP Eligibility -- Bank pressured and did not disclose requirements,"Good morning!

I'm asking this question here since I've been rebuffed at the Federal Reserve, CFPB, and I've Googled for near a week with nothing to show for it.

I have a loan that qualifies for FHA-HAMP relief/modification. It was signed June 22, 2009. According to the bank (M&amp;T), despite their allowing us to sign the modification, we do not qualify for the ""pay for performance"" principal reduction because our loan did not originate prior to January 1, 2009. ($10,000)

The servicer has already been in major trouble before on this loan because they refused to communicate with us regarding the loan for improper reasons. An attorney was finally able to get them to communicate with us regarding the loan in order to process the FHA-HAMP modification. It was the attorney's opinion that they were violating multiple sections of the Dodd-Frank Act at the time. Water under the bridge (sort of).

The bank did not disclose the terms of FHA-HAMP (the fine print) at any point during the modification process. They sent us a letter that includes ""other qualifications"" that we would need to meet, but that's it. I never saw this January 1, 2009 date. If I had, we would not have proceeded with the modification as it was not a good deal without this money. I read the entire modification agreement along with the letter about ""pay for performance"" before signing. Namely, [this document](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/10-11ML.PDF) (letter from FHA) being disclosed would have thrown up flags for me.

Would anyone know any relevant federal or state (FL) laws that would require the bank to have disclosed these terms (including the January 1, 2009) to us prior to the modification? Seems to me that we were clearly misled by the bank and it was firmly their responsibility as the loan servicer to determine if we were eligible for this program or not. I am, of course, aware of all of the other instances of banks mismanaging their role as loan servicers with FHA.

I also feel it is important to note that our signing this modification agreement was in the banks' best interest as previously the loan did not have appropriate signatures on the promissory note and the primary mortgagee had passed away.

Our attorney at the time felt that one of our options was to simply walk away from the loan/house and the bank would be left with the bag.

Last, I'm not really looking for legal advice here. I'm simply looking for the regulations that would be applicable. If I can't find one that forces the bank to do the right thing, then we are definitely considering legal action.

Thanks for the time!",finance

personalfinance,I want to check my math on a personal loan though my Credit Union,"TL:DR - I am looking to check my math/thinking on a personal loan I was offered through my bank.  This is going to be a longer post, so if you are the kind of person that gets disgruntled about people posting ""books"", this is your heads up.  Move it along.

I have a couple different sources of debt other than my school loans and car.  I went into my Credit Union for some routine business with my accounts, and the lady asked me if I would be interested in a personal loan to consolidate some of those sources of debt.  I told her that I have a personal rule of a week before I make those kinds of financial decisions, but took down some of the information.  There are 2 options, 10k max personal loan with a max (could be less) static 7% interest rate, and 20k max credit card with I think static 12% interest rate.  She looked at my credit and, while she didn't put the paper work through, said she would be surprised if I wouldn't be approved for the max on either.  Lets assume I would be. 

So I went home, and pulled up my budget spread sheet, and did some number crunching for both options.  For the 10k loan, I picked out the accounts that would have the most impact, and then calculated an overall APR.  I did that by calculating what percent of the sum each source would be, and multiplying that percent by the APR, and then adding all the APRs up (if that calculation is wrong, please tell me).  The 7% APR was less than the calculated overall APR, and the minimum payment on the 10k would be less than the sum off the individual loans too.  But when I forecasted out how long it would take to pay off the 10k loan, I came up with it being longer than keeping the loans separate...which didn't make sense.  This assumed I was taking all the money I was paying on the individual loans (including extra payments), and chucking them at the 10k loan instead. 

I found the same effect when I ran the numbers on the 20k credit card.  

Assuming my math is right, I am not going to apply for either.  But is my math right?  Shouldn't a single 10k loan at 7% pay down faster than 5 smaller loans all at higher %'s?",finance
personalfinance,"There's something odd on my credit bureau that shouldn't be there, as I've never had credit","\*Canada

I'm in my early 30s and have never had credit before, which I realize is a mistake and is something I've been trying to rectify for a couple of years now. When I worked after high school and during college, I should have applied for one, but online shopping wasn't big and I'd just use my mom's card. I'm not working right now due to mental illness and my income is low, but I do have a stipend for disability. I also have a parent who's co-signed by putting their household income on the applications.

We tried to get a card through my bank, using my parent (with great credit, home and vehicle ownership), but got denied. They had an account at the same bank. The reason was not having a credit report.

I then tried Walmart, because I was told they are fine with low income and not having had a previous credit history. They denied me for not having a credit history.

I also tried Tangerine, but got no reply.

I got fed up and discouraged, but my parents really want me to get a card so I can build credit and get out on my own. I do too. So my dad decided we should try his main bank, where all his investments are. We went there, and applied through a bank worker, during an appointment. She did the application while we were there, and put my dad down as a co-signer. No approval came in while we were there, nor did a denial.

Two weeks later, I got a thank you for opening an account and a credit card denial letter at the same time. This pissed my dad off because he had co-signed and it made no sense.

For weeks now, he's been calling and leaving messages with them, and finally heard back today. The lady said she did some digging and it looks like there's something on my credit bureau or history that is preventing me from getting a card. Nobody told me about this before, and I have no idea of what it is because I have never had a credit card and do not have any debt, nor have I ever. She says that it looks like a former bankruptcy, which makes absolutely zero sense.

I've never seen any other signs of identity theft, and it's my greatest fear. Right now I'm shaking because of it. My dad tells me that the lady from the bank said to do something online and then contact Equifax, but doesn't have any more details and I'm lost.

I can only pay a maximum of $2,000 per month, $785 of which will go towards the monthly payment and the rest into the principal. At this rate, I will not be able to pay it off within the year and will, therefore, end up paying a lot more due to the interest.

I can buy for the same cost in terms of monthly mortgage payments (if a 30 year loan) (and I will have roommates, so it would be a 3+ bed, 2+ bath). New construction is around $320,000 right now. I'm trying for right below $300,000.

However, I am learning about all of these extra fees attached to buying and selling, and it seems like there may not be enough of a return in the short term to even cover those fees, so it wouldn't really be worth it maybe? I'm really new to this but have been researching alot. I think the housing market values might start going down in a few years (around 3 maybe?). I do have the option of keeping the property and renting it out for a while. But I will be living across the country (USA). There is alot of growth predicted in my area over the next 5-15 years, so there is alot of new construction. And the area is predicted to catch up with other towns/cities along the coast (right now it is below). And interest rates are really low right now. I think BOA is offering them at 2.5% interest.

I'd like some advice. Do you think it's better to rent cheap now and save up for properties in Colorado, or start getting into realestate investing now? I just graduated from University a year ago. But I think I could do a 15 year loan and still afford a second one in Colorado if I rent out this one.",finance

personalfinance,"Does the avalanche method still make sense in this scenario? One student loan ~10k at 5%, the other ~6k at 5.6%","Pretty much what the title says. I have 4 student loans total, the two that I did not mention have the lowest interest rates at 4.4% each, so following the avalanche method I am leaving those until the 2 higher interest loans are paid off. 

My question is should I still be focusing on loan #2 (the 5.6% interest loan) even though it has a lower balance and therefore accrues less interest in dollars per month, or should I tackle loan #1 (the 5% interest one) with the higher balance because each month it accrues more dollars in interest. I can't seem to make the math work in my head and it's really disheartening to see a decent difference in the actual dollar amount of interest I am paying on these. 

FWIW, previously on loan #1 the balance was much higher, so I did pay a lot extra on that one to get the balance to where it is now. Still just not sure if I should switch to the true avalanche method, or keep paying down #1's higher balance so that it is closer to the balance of #2, then really focus on #2 and pay less on #1.

Edit: of course everyone who said stick with the avalanche method is right. I found a few debt calculators and entered in my info, and if I go with paying the higher balance/lower interest loan first I'll end up paying about $500 more in interest over the next few years (factoring in the small extra payment I can afford right now, hoping to change that to a higher amount in the near future).

That $500 divided out per month isn't a huge difference, so this is one of the scenarios where I can see the psychological temptation of the snowball method. That said, I'm going with the avalanche method because screw paying any more than I absolutely must.",finance

personalfinance,How to go about getting a commuter car from work for work.,"I have a move to a city much further away coming soon and my company is offering me an EV to commute in to compensate for the longer commute. (that CA HOV sticker!)

We are working with a few options.

1. Company gets car under their name, becomes business expense and I drive it as my daily. Insurance and gas covered under company.
2. I get car under my name and company reimburses me the payments. Insurance and gas would become my responsibility but I build some ""equity"" in having the car under my name. This also gives me the option of getting rid of one of our cars as it would get limited use and the ability to use it for non work related purposes.

Option 1 would obviously make the most sense but option 2 has certain benefits. Option 2 would allow for my SO to take the car on days I don't commute (work from home 2 days a week), car would be ""mine"", etc.

Even if option 2 doesn't make the most (if any) financial sense, would there be any ways to go about this so that the company and I will get hit with the least amount of taxes? e.g. Company can write off car as business expense in option 1, but raising my salary for option 2 (dummy math incoming) will mean they have to raise my pay $5 for me to pay the $3 (essentially losing $2 to taxes)

Goal is to find private school loan to pay for this semester, establish line of credit based off of barriers and overall goals in next 12 months including graduation in Fall 2020 and potentially having to move from stable situation. Long term goals of completing graduate program and doing something with my life outside of Indiana by not wrecking myself any further by making the right steps today with your guidance. 

*Full Story* 

I‚Äôm coming to PersonalFinance as I honestly need help; mostly to identify what options I might have given my circumstances and where things are for the remainder of the year for me. I‚Äôm going to be sharing a lot of information that I can in order to assist in this because I do not know what else to do at this time.
I‚Äôm 31 and have not had the greatest amount of stability in my life; my savings was wrecked this year after having obtained an OWI (first and only) in March; with my job firing me the next day. As a result, my savings was wiped clean by paying bills, attorney and the like as well as my income being halved (from 1600.00-2100.00 month to 850.00 tops). 

Right now, I‚Äôm living with three others and stability is present yet there is strong likeliness that we will all be moving out in one year and presents another future problem that I am in need consider. As a result of the instability, I‚Äôve never been able to recover from starting out with bad credit at 18. This is the result of my parents using my personal information as well as sharing the same first/last name with my father; which I would learn that credit companies like Experian attach the default bill / collection to anyone with the same name living in the same home. I had debts over 5,000 by the time I was 19 and began learning all of this information.

My solution was bankruptcy at 27 to start clean after having trusted someone with my vehicle and having lost it as a result. After filling, I had been having strong gains financially (as well as stability) since filing with what were plans to establish a line of credit with my local credit union and do the rapid payment stuff in order to get myself to where I think I should be at 31. My aforementioned OWI shot that plan into the Sun as I do not want to pursue any line of credit unless I know I‚Äôm in a stable living situation.

With that being presented and set aside‚Ä¶ my last barrier is school loans. I have maxed out my federal loans this semester and I am 12 classes away. I recognize that I have to take a private loan this semester and an prepared to do everything I can to prevent any further ones from having to come into play for me. 
I‚Äôm trying to communicate this strictly as a financial, numbers approach without going into my personal history too much. Over the last five years, I‚Äôve taken this far more seriously due to clarity finally being obtained (eliminating financial leeches mostly) and staying on course. Yet, I feel like I am unable to make an educated decision moving forward and am hoping that others might have some financial wisdom I can listen to.

Before its suggested, I know that ""getting a second job"" will be offered and I do have one yet it is not a constant nor a guarantee. It is cash and is an amount I am not factoring in at this time due to the volatility of those numbers right now.

* 1,850.00 in medical debt; paying 5.00/mo

* No Credit lines established post-bankruptcy

* No Car payment (yet, vehicle is a 2004)

* Probation/Court fees paid off (1300.00‚Äôish)

* Federal loans maxed; needing to identify best private loan while not having any credit

* Zero credit established

* Access /r/scholarship and apply like mad to fulfill Spring 2020 remaining balance

* Full-time with current employer allows one paid class of college per semester; could reduce overall cost with or without scholarships. Increase of wages to over 13.80/hr and gives me a ‚Äòin‚Äô into the university for employment specifically in my field of study (Social work / Public Health).

* Establish credit despite current circumstances

personalfinance,To refinance or not to refinance,"Hello PF!

Almost exactly one year ago my wife and I purchased our first house.  It's a pretty typical 30 year mortgage, and our monthly payments are about $2054.  So our remaining total in leftover payments (assuming no early payoff) would be $2054 * 12 months * 29 years = $715k

After the recent interest rate reductions, we checked with our lender for refinancing options and the lowest monthly payment estimate for another 30 year mortgage was $1828.  That would make the total payments (again assuming no early payoff) $1828 * 12 months * 30 years = $658k total.

The fees for the refinance would add about ~~$10k~~ $15k to our principal balance; given the $226 in savings every month, we'd break even at about 5.5 years.  So if we think we'll stay in the house longer than that it's a good idea, but if we think we'd sell before, we'd lose money.  Is that the right way to think about it?

I am happy to provide any more info that is needed, but I figured the monthly estimated payment and additional principal on the new mortgage were the main factors.  Thank you so much for any advice!

i spoke with my parents who suggested falling behind on my accounts purposely, and then doing settlements on all my accounts.  i looked into it briefly and decided to do it since my score was fair and i needed help.   i also from that day have not used one credit card and have limited my spending.  after 3 months of no payments the calls from the companies started coming in but no one would do a settlement offer, i was told i had to wait until they were charged off and in collections.  after 7 months i was getting calls from the card companies and collection agencies and was negotiating settlements with them.  it took a ton of back and forth to get them down but i think i got them all down the most i can.  

&amp;#x200B;

now its 12 months later.  since unemployment ran out i have gotten a job making less than i was.  i have paid my rent on time, i finished my lease and didnt get a new car.  i bought a used car with 100k miles for cash and my insurance dropped to 35/mo.   i have saved over 10k cash and am living below my means.  all purchases i want i will only buy if i have the cash and because im using this thought process i havent bought much because i enjoy saving.  my score has dropped to 530.  i still havent paid or fully taken care of my debt.  i get calls almost daily but i try to answer all of them and explain that i cant pay the full amount and need time and help and with persistence i negotiated down

&amp;#x200B;

my credit card debts are as follows (previous debt and settlement offer rounded):

TD bank $4,950 (settlement offer $1,500)

Capital One $5,200 (settlement offer $2,700)

Best Buy $2,500 (settlement offer $1,900)

Citi $1,800 (settlement $1,200)

Chase $1,000 ($600)

Paypal $1,500 ($1,200)

&amp;#x200B;

i have watched a ton of youtube info about credit card settling and they all have 1 common factor and thats to get the offer in writing (which I have) and to also have in writing that the collection agency will remove the collections from my credit report.  the problem i am having is that when i request this, all agencies explain they cannot do that.  that is up to the original creditor and that they can put a request in for it but cannot guarantee it.  because of this, i have not made any payments for the settlements because that is a huge issue.

&amp;#x200B;

my questions for you are, did i screw up taking my parents advice doing this?

what are my best options?

how can i handle this situation now?

personalfinance,"Refinanced student loans two years ago, paying for it now... What can I do next?","I refinanced my student loans ~~two~~ three years ago because they were wanting $600/month payments which I just could not afford right out of college and they would not change their payment minimum. Before that, I had been struggling for 2 years to make payments on the loans, sometimes late or missing payments because I could not afford $600. I (stupidly) decided to refinance my loans so I could make a smaller payment of $450/month which was still barely affordable to me at the time. What I didn't realize it at the time is that it also would increase my total loan balance by $15,000 and my interest rates are still basically the same (if not more)... Since then, I've been paying the $450/month for the last three years and I'm finally starting to figure out how personal finances work. I'm feeling sort of bitter about the fact that I increased my balance by $15,000 in order to pay slightly less per month. It's demoralizing that I've been paying $450 for over three years and my debt is still higher than when I graduated. Seeking any advice you all might have to help me un-screw myself.",finance

personalfinance,Should I invest in real state so close to recession?,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting in this subreddit. Background: I'm 27 years old, I live and work in Spain, I make around 2300‚Ç¨ a month which in Spain is decent. I saved up around 40k in 2 years of work, I live with my parents to save up what I can. I'd lilke to invest in real state, I can now afford a down payment on a flat worth 100k, I saw the banks can finance up to 90% of the total at a 2% interest rate, the monthly mortgage payment would be 330‚Ç¨, I can rent it out for 600‚Ç¨/m. So my low estimate ROI would be around 7%, without taking into a account that I build up my assets as I pay off the mortgage.
So from what I see the tensions around the world,  economy deccelarating, inverted yield curve, I do think the recession is not far. Is it a good time to invest now? I do get the benefit of locking down low interest rate mortgage while I still have a job, with the rent I can certainly pay the mortgage, so if recession does come and I lose my job I won't have problems paying the mortgage or paying the bills, as I also get severance check from being fired and social help.",finance

personalfinance,"Cash-out Refinance to get out of ARM, Pay off Student Loans, and potentially use for Downpayment","New to posting, but I've been reading a lot on this sub.  Almost all of the threads about cash-out refi's are met with comments recommending against them, so I'm second-guessing myself now, and wondering when they are advantageous? 

I'm considering a cash-out refinance to do a couple things:
- Get out of my ARM which adjusts in 2021
- Get a slightly lower interest rate
- Pay off my student loans
- Use excess cash to buy another property

Some details:

I currently owe 103k @4.25% on the mortgage, payment of $775/month.

17k in student loans at 5.6%

The property just appraised for $210k, but strangely, an identical unit two doors down just sold for $150k (it was listed at $159,990 and was included as a comp in the appraisal of my property).  My other neighbor is considering listing another identical unit for $145k for sale by owner... I think they are both wildly underselling themselves, but maybe not? I have invested a lot of time and money into the property, especially the exterior, and my unit is in much better shape than the two others mentioned, but I'm wary of the accuracy on my appraisal now. 

Anyways, I am considering taking a cash out refi of $160k at 4% for 30 years.  The mortgage payment would bump up to $960/month.

This would give me about $50k in cash to pay off the student loan and be ready to purchase/invest in another property.

When we move, I plan on keeping and renting the current property and think I can reasonably receive $1200-$1400 a month for it.

Is this a good move?",finance

I am holding out on refinancing my student loans because of the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness Program although I've read that the program has a very low acceptance rate. I do also like the fact that with federal loans you can defer your payments or base your payments on your income should you experience a financial hardship. Of course the biggest hurdle with my federal student loans is the high interest rate.

Student loans are the only debt I'm paying now but I do unfortunately live in an area with a high cost of living. I'm also working on building my emergency fund (around 20k) which I expect to have by next year.",finance

**Bitcoin As Gold**  


The narrative around Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù or ‚Äúgold 2.0‚Äù has been strengthening in recent months and we have even seen Bitcoin slip into a strong inverse correlation to US stocks. For us, this is not a new story and the potential for Bitcoin to shine in this arena is something we have been propagating for years. The topic is hotly debated given the potential diversification benefits that exposure to Bitcoin has in portfolio construction.  There are certain times when Bitcoin trades in line with risk assets, selling off when equity volatility spikes and when liquidity runs dry, however it has little to no correlation with traditional asset classes like commodities, bonds, currencies, or stocks.  


The world unfolding around us is brewing the perfect storm that most perma Bitcoin bulls have been waiting for since the beginning. Bitcoin has only ever existed in a global bull-market and perhaps for the first time in 10 years that might be about to change. Amid extreme monetary policies and rising geopolitical tensions the narrative for Bitcoin as digital gold has scarcely been stronger. Combine this with the fact that investors are starving for growth and unable to hit their benchmarks with traditional portfolio‚Äôs the comparison between the current Bitcoin market cap and the market cap for investible gold becomes an enticing proposition. The best part? A comparison to gold might not even be the end of the  
road for Bitcoin. Right now there are almost no assets that largely sit outside the purview of any single government. If we see the political tensions in our world rise and the ability of these governments to service their debts comes into question the demand for non-sovereign assets is likely to boom.

The rising risk of currency devaluation, especially among reserve currencies, combined with its non sovereign nature is a longer-term catalyst that may propel BTC to new untold heights. The opportunity cost of not holding Bitcoin is getting higher every day as the long-term outlook for traditional asset classes and growth continues in a downward spiral.  


**Late In The Cycle**  


In this edition I wanted to take a step back to look at the global macro economic environment. I believe that we are entering an era where the understanding of economics and appropriate investment principles will be imperative for success. As of July we have now officially seen the longest period of sustained growth in history and it‚Äôs getting late (perhaps very late) in that cycle.

  
\-Bleak global growth projections  
\-Trade wars  
\-Weak inflation  
\-$14 trillion of negative yielding debt  
\-Unprecedented monetary policies  
\-Late in the cycle stimulus  
\-Declining corporate profits  
\-Stocks rallying into the promise of rate cuts and additional  
stimulus  
\-Explosion of low quality credit  
\-Explosion of IPO‚Äôs showing just as explosive losses

The global slowdown everyone has been fearing is starting to show up in economic data. With short term interest rates already low economic stimulus measures may need to be more extreme to be effective. The central banks of our world are preparing the global market for more rate cuts and additional stimulus as they attempt to prolong the current  
economic expansion, seemingly ‚Äúforever‚Äù. The implication of economic policies favouring growth (including the  
forecast for multiple rate cuts by the end of 2019) are already impacting market prices and portfolio structure. 

As we have talked about many times in previous letters, investors are being pushed further and further out on the risk curve in their search for a return high enough to satisfy their benchmarks. With government debt yields, fixed income and traditional value assets underperforming the focus has shifted to growth assets throwing support behind Bitcoin for the time being. Money Supply and Risk Assets Monetary policy plays a significant role in markets. When there is an  
increase in the money supply there tends to be a strong performance in risk assets while at the same time pushing investors further out the risk curve as they compete for the best returns. Lower rates and more relaxed monetary policy not only encourages borrowing (creating a surplus of money) it also forces investors to change the way they invest because it damages the potential returns from traditionally safe assets. 

It is speculated that the Fed will keep the door open for further rate cuts by the end of 2019, but be careful when analysing how much of this has already been priced into the markets, including Bitcoin. Generally speaking investors are willing to pay higher multiples when the other alternatives available to them are unattractive.

Right now bond yields across the board from sovereign to corporate debt are very unattractive which has pushed investors towards equities.  


**Analysis**  
The almost illogically high concentration of Bitcoin and high-caps in our portfolio has continued to bring in immense rewards over the past few months. There were only 12 projects with a market capitalization over $15 million which outperformed Bitcoin year-to-date. UTXO Analysis When looking at the base of Bitcoin holders compared to our previous reports not much has changed in the last three months. Holders in the 3-5 year bands have decreased however the reason for the decrease is not from selling, it is because they have been moved into the 5+ year bands which is sitting around all time highs at  21.5% of total Bitcoin supply.  
‚Äã  
The only longer dated band with a noticeable amount of sellers was the 1-2 year band where sellers accounted for about half of the 1.8% decline in that band, and a shift into the 2-3 year band representing the other half. By far the largest amount of selling during the recent rally can be found in the youngest bands. Holders in the 3-6 month band and 6-12 month band respectively. The 3-6 month band has come down from down from 10.2% to 6.8% with selling accounting for the majority of the drop. 

**Liquid Supply**   
‚Äã  
(Defined as coins that have moved in the last 90 days)  


The majority of this liquid supply is continuing to come from short term UTXO‚Äôs (traders). When compared to the previous cycle bottom we can see a very similar pattern emerge.

Around July 2015 the liquid supply began to increase as trading activity began to draw in speculators again. During this same period long term holders remained unphased. This type of movement is correlated with a rise in volatility as trading volumes begin to influence the velocity of price. From a cyclical perspective it is likely that volatility is peaking now. If that proves to be true it is likely that the liquid supply will again decrease over the coming months.  


It wasn‚Äôt until then 2017 bull run that long term holders started to contribute to the increased liquid supply, so without large increases or decreases in price I feel it is unlikely that long term holders will be drawn into trading and the current cycle of holding will dominate. 

**Conclusion**  


One thing that I would like for you to remember here is that despite the potentially favorable economic environment for Bitcoin it is very important to note the following: In the face of any serious economic downturn, market crash or correction there will be a shortage of credit and a shortage of liquidity. This forces investors to sell off assets as they scramble for cash and risk assets are often sold off first. When investors need cash, they may need to sell their Bitcoin, no matter how badly they ‚Äúwish‚Äù to hold it. A prudent Bitcoin investor will understand that Bitcoin is still an asset and has not yet proven itself in serious crisis as a miracle hedge, or even as a viable digital gold.

personalfinance,How should I pay off my student debt?,"Hey everyone, I recently graduated from college with about 39,000 in sub/unsub and ParentPLUS loans. I started working this week and I will be making 65,000 pre-tax, so about 4000/month post-tax. I am living at home with my family so I don't have to pay for rent/food and I am taking the bus to work until I save up to buy a used car. I am on my parent's health insurance still given that I'm 22 and my parent's health insurance is a family plan anyway so I don't have to worry about that expense. I want to pay off my loans in 1-1.5 years without sacrificing toooo much. I am a frugal person in general, so I don't mind living like a college student for another year. My goals are: pay off student loans ASAP, save up at least 5,000 for a car, have $1000 emergency fund, and save about $1000 for a vacation for next summer.

I'm currently broke af until I get my first paycheck so I have a little less than 1000 in my bank. Right now, I'm thinking about breaking down my monthly salary as: $3000 to loans, $150 for bus pass/random lyfts, $70 for eating out, $100 into savings, $80 into vacation fund. 

This will definitely be adjusted once I get my actual check because I'm still unclear about how my 401k will impact my pay and if I would like to do a 401k or Roth. My employer will match 6% in my 401k after I work there for 1 year. Is that better than if I put money into a Roth?

These are my loans with the interest rates. My grace period ends November 2019:

\- $16,440 (principal $14,218) at 6.31% --&gt; parent plus loan

\- $4,647.46 (principal $4,000) at 4.29% --&gt; unsub

\- $2,323.62 (principal $2,000) at 4.29% --&gt; unsub

\-$3,500 at 4.29% --&gt; sub

\-$2,204.79 (principal $2,000.00) at 3.76% --&gt; unsub

\-$5,500 at 4.45% --&gt; sub

My employer is a not-for-profit organization 501(c)(3) which means that if I continue working there for another 7 years [or at another 501(c)(3) institution] and pay the minimum IDR payment monthly then I would be able to have the remaining federal loan amount forgiven through the public service loan forgiveness program. My employer has paid $25,000 of my student loans each year for the past 2 years and will pay for $25,000 of these student loans in the coming year (total of 3 years). This is my first job since graduating psychiatry residency 2 years ago and I didn't unfortunately have a chance to start building up savings and investing in any retirement accounts until starting this job 2 years ago. I currently max out my 401k, 403b, and 457 available through my employer (my employer matches 5% of 401k). I have no credit card debt (I pay off credit card monthly) and no car loan (6 year old vehicle). I currently rent a small, older (built in 1920s) home for $1050 a month and live alone. I haven't increased my lifestyle much since I started this first post-residency job and with sign-on bonuses since starting this job I have been able to save about $153,000 which is just sitting in my credit union account. 


I am not liking my current home due to lack of space and the house is quite dated inside. I would like to upgrade my housing situation and I have been trying to decide the pros and cons for me of buying an older, renovated single family home vs renting a new townhome. I know that with my savings I could easily afford a 20% down payment on a home and with a credit score around 731 I could afford to buy a decently nice home in my area (Salt Lake City, Utah) which is a sellers market due to a continual influx of people moving in from out of state to work in our burgeoning tech sector. The single family homes I would be looking at buying range from $450,000-$550,000 which are mostly older homes (1920's-1940's) which have been nicely renovated. Let's say that I can qualify for a 4.0% APR and put down 20% down payment so that would mean that my monthly PITI would range between $2056-$2513 a month. Even with closing costs I estimate that I would likely still have a healthy cushion of savings left over for a 3-6 month emergency fund plus enough for other unexpected expenses with buying an older home. I don't have experience in DIY home improvement so any home repairs or reno would be difficult to do myself. Also I work 50 hours a week sometimes so I don't want to spend a lot of my free time working on a house. This would likely mean paying someone else for these services. I like the idea of ""owning"" a house as I am 35 and looking to settle down, but I'm not currently dating anyone seriously at the moment. This could certainly change in the next 2-3 years. I feel like I would rather start looking for a home with a partner/spouse so we could make these decisions together. I like my job, but I don't think it is my ultimate ""dream job"". My current contract is for 1 more year and I think I would like the option of potentially moving somewhere else at that time to pursue a job elsewhere including possibly in a different state, but there is a decent chance that I may stay with my current employer who offers a really nice pension if I stay on long term. The other option that I have considered is renting a newly built townhome which would be smaller than the houses that I have been looking at, but bigger and more updated than the current home I am renting. I would look at spending 1600-1800 a month in rent in this case. I like this option in some ways as I wouldn't feel tied down in a mortgage in case I do actually decide to move depending on if I get into a more serious romantic relationship in the next 2-3 years and need to move for this reason or decide to change jobs. In the case of renting I would likely consider taking a large chunk of my current savings that was to be used for the house down payment and invest in shares/bonds/index funds.


Any insights or feedback about these options would be appreciated!",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"Dads a Vegetable, Quit my job, have a house, car, and medical + lifestyle adapting costs to cover.","I apologize if this gets long and upsetting, genuinely. 

My father had a accident several months ago and sustained permanent, life changing injuries. This has impacted life in more ways than I can count. Just before my father sustained his injury he bought a new $50k truck. Seeing as he is unlikely to ever drive again my mother and I thought it best to have me take over the payments &amp; insurance, I agreed. 

For the past 5-6 months I worked a dead-end job as maintenance for a government assisted housing community. I quit because I was fed up with dealing with bed bugs, cockroaches, and quite literally picking up human and animal waste on a daily basis. I made minimum wage, (15$) had no coverage etc. (I was hired as a sub-contractor) Which only adds tax problems come April as I‚Äôm gonna owe for the first time ever. (I always pay a extra $50 into my taxes for that welcomed yearly return) 

After busting my butt for said workplace, I decided to leave after it had been asked of me to start acting as Supervisor for the complex. This entails but is not limited to, Contacting the Police, calling repairmen, dealing with unruly tenants, etc etc. I respectfully requested to be removed from said position, old boss came back in, I gave my two weeks and when I left I never looked back. 

I have a house to help pay for, a new truck, (have to keep, our other vehicle is not in good condition) and all the changes that need to be made for the house. 

I can‚Äôt spend time in school as of right now, my family needs money on the table and a extra set of hands whenever we aren‚Äôt working. 

I hope I haven‚Äôt wasted anyone‚Äôs time, I‚Äôm new to this whole... how did I get here? Type thing. Lol

At any rate, any suggestions, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to ask any questions. I waited quite a while to post here as I wanted to be sure I would be comfortable with any and all questions asked. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I hope you have a good day!

Edit 1: Selling the truck is not a option, sorry if you think that‚Äôs unreasonable, but it is our transportation, our lifeline, and my ability to move my father from point A to point B. It has also allowed us to carry construction materials to be used to better adapt the house for my fathers required living conditions. The $500 truck payment + $400 insurance (mine and my fathers combined) is my ONLY personal expense beyond helping my parents out by giving them any extra cash I have.

personalfinance,"Need some reassurance / guidance with my financial situation, including student loan repayment.","My background:

When I was growing up my family was poor and didn‚Äôt teach me about money, but I got good grades so of course I went to university and was approved for full government student loans. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to do and switched majors a few times, ultimately spending 7 years at school (science degree and teaching degree). I also wasn‚Äôt good with money during that time, and amassed 70k (CAD) student debt. 

Where I lived you didn‚Äôt just go into a full time teaching job, so I struggled with relief teaching and part time work for awhile. Then I got an education-related job that I really loved but didn‚Äôt pay very much. I learned to budget and got much better with money, but didn‚Äôt manage to put much of a dent in the student debt. When I was made redundant, I decided I wanted to travel while I was still young enough to get working holiday visas, and moved to another country (New Zealand). 

I was only going to stay here for a year, but I met my current partner, and found another education-related job that I really enjoy, and stayed. I‚Äôve been here for 4 years now and intend to stay. 

My current situation: 

Im 34, I still owe $65k CAD in student loans and it‚Äôs a constant worry for me. (Right now I also have 3k in CC debt after some dental work and immigration costs, but I can take care of that in a few months, which I‚Äôm obviously gonna tackle first). I need to see a light at the end of the long-term tunnel and know that I can get myself out of this student debt and maybe one day own my own home. Please help. 

I make $1560 NZD biweekly AFTER taxes. When I get residency in a few months and start paying into a kiwisaver (employer-matched retirement savings) that‚Äôll go down maybe $50. My partner lives with me and makes a little less than me (no student loans but has some CC debt), but we haven‚Äôt fully combined our finances yet. 

My regular biweekly expenses are: 

$440 - my share of the rent 

$350 - what we both each put into our ‚Äúflat account‚Äù biweekly for gas/power, Vodafone, and groceries. During the winter there‚Äôs just enough, but this will accumulate some savings in the summer

$15 - cell phone ($30 monthly plan) 

$100 - Petrol (expensive here!)

$35 - two weekly sports leagues 

We rarely eat out, I don‚Äôt really care too much about stuff, so I don‚Äôt really spend much money on myself. Our flat is small and low rent for the area we are in. I don‚Äôt even have to pay for haircuts because my partner does that for free. But there seems to be a lot of random expenses popping up, like dental, car repair, etc. And I do have to create a budget for travel because all my family lives on the other side of the world now. 

But on a normal fortnight with no unusual expenses, I can easily save $500 - so $1000 NZD per month. I expect to have my CC paid off before December, and then start building an emergency fund while chipping away at my student loans. Right now I‚Äôm at zero payment interest free on my student loans, but in a few months will have to start paying again. Because I no longer live in Canada, I can‚Äôt take advantage of the repayment assistance options, I either have to pay in full or ask for a period of interest-only payments (where I would try to put extra in to pay some of the principle). I‚Äôm not exactly sure right now what my interest rate is (part of it has 0%) but my regular monthly payment would normally be around $750/month.

personalfinance,I-Series bonds vs paying off mortgage,"I'm planning on paying off my mortgage in the next year or two.  Between my stock market investments, my cash on hand, some I-series bonds I bought in 2001, and some bitcoin, I suspect that I will be able to pay off the mortgage.  

However I just realized that my I-series bonds are paying out 5.3% (I bought at a good time, apparently), which is more than the interest rate of my mortgage.  

It should take about another year to make enough money to not cash in the bonds.  Does anyone have any advice on if I should hold off paying off the house and hold onto the I-series bonds?   

For holding onto the bonds:

- pros:  Effectively guaranteed returns on the bonds, all the way until full maturity in 2031.   
- cons:  takes longer to pay off the house.

Using them to pay off the house:

- pros:  having no mortgage at all
- cons: loss of about 1% for a year, and loss of access to a guaranteed 5.3% for about a decade afterward.",finance

personalfinance,Unique home buyer situation. Need advice.,"So I'm in a unique situation as a potential first time home buyer and I want to take advantage of it.

 I can get 13% off the base price of a brand new home. I can choose from homes starting at 220k with 1800-1950 sqft which is plenty of room for me (single, no kids). 220k is around the avg home price around here. Also, I can do this every five years with the company I'm with. So I can sell and build another home with another 13% discount every 5 years.

My plan is to do this every 5 years and keep rolling equity over and maybe be mortgage free within 15 years. I work really hard for my company and my job is very secure. I'm not naive and understand anything can happen though. I also enjoy the company and everyone in it so I have absolutely no intention to on on leaving. Is this a good plan that I should pursue? I cant really think of a downside.

The other part of the equation is can I afford it? I net 3k a month and live in a low cost of living state. I paid off student loans and the only debt I have is my truck that runs $250 a month with about $7,500 left on the loan at 2.4% interest. 

My TOTAL expenses PLUS maxing my Roth IRA end up at about $1,750/mo so I'm left with $1,250/mo extra each month. Also, on a side note, my $275 rent is included with that number which would obviously be paid into a mortgage instead. I could pay my truck off to free up $250 more but it's a low interest rate. So technically I just have the money sitting there as an emergency fund instead. It's extremely tempting and appealing to me to go ahead and pay it off and have zero debt but I know it's not mathematically the best thing to do.

The house in particular I want (230k base price) would be roughly 190k after closing costs, small upgrade options, 13% discount, and 15k down. That gives me 40k instant equity and my credit score is around 800 so I should qualify for the best interest rates. This puts me between 1k-1.1k mortgage after escrow. That's around 35% of my net monthly income. Is this wise? The house itself, at 190k, is right at 4 times my annual salary, which is 48k, and that's the scary part to me.

Normally I wouldn't consider this but I'm wondering if the instant equity makes it worth it. Otherwise, my only option is to put it off another year or two and continue saving for a larger down payment which I'm fine with also.

Current situation: I have $2k sitting in my PayPal credit account at about a 19.99% interest rate. I have one other credit card (Discover It Chrome) that has no outstanding balance. Currently have $1200 in savings which is just a small emergency fund. Credit score is about 718.

personalfinance,"After tax 401k, student Loans, or brokerage account?","Hey all.

This year, I am on track to contribute more to my retirement accounts than ever. I am 28, make roughly $250k/year, as a SWE on a prominent team at a huge tech company on one of the most used apps in the world (most people reading this likely use it every day). I have progressed at roughly 2x the normal rate at my company, my manager has personally put me on a growth track into management, so I think I have good job security, but of course that could change any time. Obviously, I live in a HCOL area. I have roughly $65k invested now between my retirement accounts, and know that I am super behind, but I should be able to save at least ~33% from here on without any large issues.

Here is what I have already done:

- Max my 401k with a $9500 match
- Max an IRA
- Max a HSA
- Put ~6k into after tax 401k
- Put ~3mo living expenses into HYSA 

I also have $70k of student loan debt, most of which is under 4%, but I do have some over that

I have another $30k that I can easily invest between now and EOY. Here are what I consider my 4 options:

- After tax 401k  up to the limit, something else with the rest
- Pay down my highest-interest rate student loans (~$30k @ 5.6%) which will get me to ~$40k @ 4% remaining.
- Invest in brokerage accounts. I currently have a whopping $200 in there.
- Put it all into a HYSA 

I plan on retiring/working less by the time I am 50. As long as I save 25-33% per year, I think that should be easily doable. I ran the numbers with the typical raise structure at my company, and as long as I keep with that, I should have roughly $250k/year (what I get now) in retirement.  But retiring early means I need non-retirement account money working for me, too.

In my situation, what would you do? My current plan is probably the student loans because 5.6% guaranteed is hard to say no to.",finance

Some people say keep your mortgage because it‚Äôs tax deductible.  But doesn‚Äôt the new tax law refute this until like 2026 and we don‚Äôt actually know the future after that?  Is there proof the tax deduction really more beneficial than the savings in paying interest?

Most everyone says first fund an emergency account.  Why can‚Äôt I just take money from my investments in an emergency?  While waiting for my emergency, won‚Äôt investments make more money than an interest-bearing savings or checking account?  Or does the capital gains tax nix this?

Specific situation:  If the inheritance is in a trust, and therefore protected from lots of things, would it be better to continue all debts and simply pay them monthly from the trust?

Anything else?

personalfinance,20 year vs 30 year mortgage refinance,"Hi this is my first post on this sub so bear with me. 

My parents are refinancing our house as the previous interest rate was 4.25% on a 30 year conventional mortgage, now we‚Äôre being quoted 3.25% on both a 30-year and a 20-year. Taking the new 30 year would save us roughly $330/month and about $80K over the life of the loan in interest. 

The monthly payment difference is roughly $550 between the new 30 year and 20 year. My dad wanted to do the 20-year mortgage and begin aggressively taking down the principal. I suggested he take the 30 year and put extra payments toward it and at least he wouldn‚Äôt be obligated, he said that if he didn‚Äôt have to then we‚Äôd probably end up spending the money elsewhere.

Then I suggested that he treat the difference as the required payment and put it into a relatively safe index fund with roughly 6-8% returns over time. This would definitely mean we come out ahead over time, but Is this a good and feasible idea? Also, if it is, how would we get started about in doing this?

P.S. as an aside I also have seen cash out refinances as an option so would it be smart to cash out the equity while doing the refinance and invest that as well into a safe index fund?

Also with all the talk of a recession coming sometime soon, how would that play into this decision? Obviously it would help having lower required payments each month but how would it affect the investment strategy?

Thanks!

Edit: it would cost $2K more upfront to do the 30 year loan, small cost I know just figured I‚Äôd add it.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance student loans before or after car buyout?,"My girlfriend has $40k in total student loan debt.  $13k is FedLoan @ 4% fixed and the other $27k is at 7% fixed (parent plus). She currently leases a car that she will be buying at the end of her lease for ~$13k in September and has $3k saved for down payment so far (hopefully closer to $4k by time she buys.) 

I don't see the value in refinancing the 4% loans since there are 8 of them and all small amounts, it provides flexibility for paying them off. We do however want to refinance the 7% loans with the plan to aggressively pay down and have it paid off in ~2 years. 

Is it better to refinance these loans before or after getting a loan to cover ~$10k on the car? Presumably whichever loan is financed first will lower credit score and make it harder to get a good rate on the second?

personalfinance,Refinance questions,"I am currently refinancing my house to get a better rate and am at a loss.

A month ago I was looking at two lender companies, one is a friend and other recommended lender from a real estate acquaintance.About 15 days ago, I chose to go with my friend as both had the same interest rate (3.75) and closing costs.

Fast forward to today. I am getting ready to close with my friend next week and the other lender texts me saying he can get me down to 3.5 or even better 3.375 without any points.

Do you just choose based on the interest rate and similar closing costs or is there anything else that I might be missing? The difference in monthly payment between these would be about $50 a month.

I am refinancing from a 20 year (4.125%) to a 30 year (3.75%) to have little extra income for a few years while all my kids are in daycare. Once they leave daycare, we would be paying on the 30 as if it was a 15-20 year.

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to finance a car as opposed to purchasing in full solely for the purpose of increasing credit score?,"I will be purchasing a vehicle in the next week. The car will cost around $15,000. I can purchase the car in full, but I was wondering if it'd be worthwhile for me to finance the vehicle (or finance part of the full amount) to increase my credit score?

My FICO credit score is typically between 750-800. I only have credit cards, and have never had any loans, and I noticed that one of the factors that's counting against me when computing credit score is that I've never had ""other types of credit."" 

I don't plan on purchasing a house in the next 1-2 years. I could see myself purchasing a house in 2-3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming I purchase a $15,000 vehicle and that I finance the entire amount at an interest rate of 3% (which I think I could easily get?), then I'd lose 15,000\*0.03=$450 due to interest. But I have a 2% APY savings account that I'd be using to pay off the loan and I'd be accumulating interest with the amount of money that I'm sourcing from. So, not purchasing the car in full, and financing the entire amount and paying off the loan monthly, could actually end up offsetting the $450 lost due to the loan interest.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing from 3.625% to 3.125 and still paying more over time?,"My current mortgage is for 15 years at 3.625% interest rate. I signed it 2.5 years ago, so I have 12.5 years on it left.

I was looking to refinance so I can get a better rate and pay less.

I was able to get a 3.125% on a 15-year mortgage and was given $1,229 monthly payment.

I'm currently paying $1,335.30/mo.

So my calculation is this:

I have 12.5 years left on my mortgage so 12.5yr \* 12mo \* $1,335.30/mo = $200,295. That's how much I would pay in total to pay it off.

No doing the same calculation for the new mortgage: 15yr \* 12mo \* $1,229/mo = $221,220.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted the new mortgage company to explain that I'm concerned that even tho I am getting a better rate I will be paying $21k more over my current mortgage. They told me that I'm doing the math wrong and that I'm saving something like $6k and that their system would flag the loan if it didn't break even. I tried to explain my math again but I was told that I'm doing it wrong.

personalfinance,PF Tips for new homeowner?,"Hello PF!  


Let me preface this by noting that while I have a consistent labor unionized job at a grocery, I earn at least the minimum full-time hourly status pay. Avg salary of $38-39k, With weekly overtime opportunities I can make closer to 45-55k;   
$18.69hr +2.25/hr 3rd shift differential x 40hr weekly with occasional OT. I have my paychecks set to withhold as little tax as necessary.  
My fiancee earns closer to sub-20k a year as a massage therapist, but she also has to pay taxes at the end of the year.  
Edit: Just asked her for more clearer numbers; current paychecks range from $350\~450; avg 400 - Last year her AGI is $20,513 with $1140 paid to federal, $210 to State and $400 to City; We expect her taxes to be similar to what she paid last year. We are currently not officially married (we don't fully understand the tax advantanges/disadvantages of married status or filing taxes jointly yet).  


Neither of us see our current careers changing any time soon; my pay is fixed but her earning potential may increase as she builds clientele.  
Our combined base monthly income is somewhere around $3500-3800 (my $2542+1400 puts us somewhere in the ballpark of $3942) I think which covers our current monthly expenditures of $3250 (car notes/current rent/electricity, student loans, insurance).

We just purchased a home in the midwest with 3.5% down for $92,000 on a 30yr OFHA loan (monthly mortage with PMI is about $720 before utilities, hoping to get to 20% and refinance to drop PMI asap); however the loan/home is titled in my name only (our combined income was too much to apply for the OFHA loan together).  


Going into this, we adjusted our expenditure for the $100 increase in rent/mortgage (we currently live in a $620/month - 1bdrm apartment with all utilities paid by the landlord minus electricity) and we expect electricity/gas/water/trash to altogether be at most $100-200, we still have room to stretch in the budget. Our monthly mortgage payment also accounts for escrow payments to account for taxes due and such.  
\----------------

What are some tips current homeowners or PF experts could suggest to us to make sure we don't get blind-sided by anything financially? I estimated our base monthly income closer to what I feel like we'd expect for the latter half of the year but while my job has consistency throughout the year, my end of year holiday season does more volume/sales (cause everyone loves food lol) and my income with overtime compensates for her place of employment's business slowing down during the holiday season.

My current plan at the moment is to setup a joint checking account that we both do direct deposit to and have our mortgage payment and utilities paid out of; and hopefully I can put the remainder of my savings in as a safety cushion to put us at 2-3x monthly mortgage payments. At the end of the year, I plan on using the OFHA/first time home buyer credits when I do taxes; would it be best for us to become legally married and file jointly to maximize use of those credits?",finance

I am current with all creditors, have never missed a payment, and am currently paying a little over the minimums‚Äîas much as I can manage.

But, in the hours since, I've been having serious doubt and anxiety about the possible credit ramifications. As someone who is not behind on payments or in collections, did I jump the gun? I also looked up a quote on a loan for the same amount as my total debt from a company that I took a small personal loan out with in the past. The total amount for a 5-year loan (same time length as the DMP) with that company (I apparently qualify for a previous client discount in rates) is only about $100 more than what I'd pay in the debt management plan‚Äîbut without carrying a mark on my credit report for years.

Eventually, if I can get my existing debt handled, I'd like to be a homeowner one day (far in the future, I know). Did I just ruin my chances? Should I call the DMP company and try to cancel before they reach out to my creditors? Should I have gone the consolidation loan route instead?

The issue is, my current savings account only gives an astonishingly low 0.01% interest rate. I talked to my bank today and found that they have a Money Market savings account that has a ""promotional rate"" of 2.4% but the fine text says that after 12 months that is reverted back down to 1.01% (assuming I've accumulated over $10,000. Otherwise its back to 0.01%)

This seems outrageous to me.. I am new to the savings game, but I assumed most banks offered reasonable interest rates on their savings accounts. Am I missing something or do all banks operate like this?",finance
personalfinance,Fixed Rate Home Equity Decision,"Hello! My husband and I recently had an appraisal to get rid of PMI. Luckily for us, the housing market is booming right now, so we easily were able to come in well above the needed appraisal amount. We currently owe $81,300 and appraised at $165,000.

After seeing our current appraisal, we were curious about fixed rate home equity loans and how we could benefit. We have no intentions on selling or moving anytime within the next 10-15 years (or longer). We love where we live. Currently, we both have student loans totaling around $48,000 and a combined credit card debt of $5,000. We are wanting to refinish our converted attic upstairs to be more livable and add better and more useful living space (eg a bedroom) as we are thinking of kids in the near-ish future. Should be noted, we have pushed off the idea of kids and any home upgrades due to our student loans.  


The problem is, do we or do we not utilize our equity to payoff student loan debts+credit cards and take extra to use towards a remodel?

Below our are current monthly expenses after PMI drop:

Net combined income: $63,000  
Mortgage: 570 (down from $625 after PMI drop)  
Student Loans: 480 ($26,600 with $320 pmt @ 5.8%/$22,000 with $160 pmt @ 5.34%)  
Car Insurance: 220  
Phone: 185 (drops to $115 March 2020)  
Internet/TV: 108  
Car	payment: 220 ($7,500 w/ 3 years left @ 3.2%)  
Electric: 100 (estimated average)  
Gas: 100 (estimated average)  
Trash: 10  
Water: 40  
Credit Cards: 200 ($3,500 @ 0% until June 2020/$500 @ 8%/$1000 @ 10%) CC debt is not necessarily our priority here, but if we had extra to pay it off all at once, we would take advantage of that.  
**Total 2223**

We both already contribute to our retirement/401k and have a 2 month emergency fund currently. The student loans will increase this coming spring to $640-700 due to my student loans being income based repayment  (recent raise) and my husband's will increase based on a 10 year plan. 

We are looking at a $67,000 fixed home equity @ 6.24% (recently quoted) 15 year term. The payment would be around $580 per month, but would wipe out student loan payments and credit cards. This would leave us about $15k for a remodel which we plan to do a lot ourselves. 

I'm struggling with whether or not to go the route of a home equity loan. Mostly because the interest would be a *lot* more over a 15 year term than our student loan interest  combined. But on the other hand, my loans have been around since 2012 and my husband has had his since 2002/2004. A major reason for that was financial hardship. 

Pros:  
\- payoff student loans sooner  
\- money for remodel - space would be MUCH more useful  
\- lower total monthly bills come spring 2020  
\- potentially be able to pay extra towards home equity (about $100/month)  
\- potentially pay more towards car loan  
\- potentially save more $$ towards future kids

Cons:  
\- a lot more interest paid (something close to $15k more)  
\- lose federal student loan protections  
\- would need to fully pay back loan IF we ever sold   
\- remodel would likely not add much to home value  
\- this decision is causing me anxiety 

Any advice and insight is much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Transunion credit is frozen. Transunion says it is NOT. Mortgage lenders say it IS. Credit Karma says it IS. Transunions says it is NOT. This has been going on for ten days.,"I'm going down the path towards first time home ownership. I didn't expect this to be easy but seriously, my lesson is locking your credit is a nightmare and you shouldn't do it. 

I froze my credit with the 3 major credit bureaus a while ago, since everyone says it's safer. When I knew I was serious about a mortgage loan, I unfroze all 3 of them. All of them, including Transunion, reported my credit was unfrozen. 

However, I've had several lenders try to pull my credit. The other two pull just fine, but Transunion keeps telling them it is frozen. Even Credit Karma tells me it is frozen and sends me an email saying Transunion blocked a credit inquiry because my report is frozen. 

I've used the phone automated system 3 times, and each time it tells me it is unfrozen. I've used the online system 3 times as well, with the same result. I've called 5 times and talked to a live person, and they all say it's unfrozen.  

I've now made an offer and it's been accepted and I just sent in my earnest money today. One lender wants to move forward but won't until Transunion is unfrozen. Chase won't even give me any sort of quote until Transunion is unfrozen and I want to interest rate shop asap.  Transunion won't help me because they say it's not frozen. 

Any ideas how to solve this? I'm so frustrated I could scream right now and I don't often get to that point. I'm getting no help from either end.",finance

crypto,Passage Cipher - A new way of dealing with ciphers,"Sup.

This is ForbiddenSoul here.
I have extensive experience in the tech scene, coding is only some of the stuff I am into.
I have decided to publish this paper outlining a new cipher, or at least a new way of dealing with ciphers.
It is called the ""Passage Cipher"".

The method's implementation is rather quite simple, but results in some extremely complex and powerful encryption.

This method was actually my first ever idea involving a cipher. I had the idea that you could simple randomize the method you used to mix up data, and that would be a very difficult cipher to crack. I was told that this was a nice idea, but that I was idiot, because there would be no way to decipher something ciphered at random.

During some coding sessions involving procedural generation, it dawned on me, hey, you can perform operations at random that are also reproducible. This is the exact same reason that you can supply a ""seed"" to an algorithm, maybe something like MineCraft's world generator for example, and you end up with a randomized world that is reproduced identically for anyone else using the same seed. This is the basis of the Passage Cipher.

The cipher uses the system's standard Random Number Generator. This is supplied with an integer for the starting point of it's procedure. This allows us for over 4 billion possible algorithms to choose from assuming it is a 32 bit integer.
This is not the same thing as using the exact same method every time, or switching between combinations of the same methods, which is currently most of, if not all of, the methods currently used.

Lets walk through this in sudo code first.

We need a key of some sort. Like any key, the longer it is, and more symbols you use, the more secure your data becomes.
For this example, let us simply say that our key is the binary value (a byte array) of the string value ""Password"".
We need data, for this example, our data will be a text document containing the phrase ""Encrypt this phrase."".
We need a starting point for our random number generator. This must be an integer (32 bit in this case). For the Passage Cipher, we acquire this integer by taking a hash of our key. This is typically referred to as a has code in most languages. Most languages have a default method for calculating this value, however some languages factor in build number, which results in inconsistent integers produced depending on your build. This is unacceptable. The method must consistently produce the same hash for the same supplied data, however any method at all will work (some better than others) just so long as the results are consistent. i.e. if the hash of ""Password"" is 123, it must always produce 123, regardless of any other conditions.
In this example the hash will be 123.

Now we assemble it all together and apply a very simple method into the mix.

-	We take our random number generator and initialize it to a new rng(123).
-	We stream in the data to be encrypted from our text document.
-	We roll a random number from 0 to the length of our key. In this case:

	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

	P a s s w o r d
- 	Lets say we rolled a  3.
	3  is the byte value of 's'.
- 	We bit shift the first byte of our data stream (XOR) by the byte value of character 's'.
	E ^ s
-	We output the result to a stream which can then for example be used for file writing.
- 	We continue by repeating the process.
-	We roll 1 'a', n ^ a 
	We roll  0 'P', c ^ P
	We roll 6 'r', r ^ r
	We roll 1 'a' y ^ a
	We roll 5 'o' p ^ o
	We roll 5 'o' t ^ o
	The word ""Encrypt"" has now been encrypted and we continue on until the entire process is complete.

Because we simply used bit shifting, the exact same method is used to decrypt the output data.
Some encrypted text file that would look something like: ‡º™‚àë·Ñ©Âà§·ºÜ9‡≠ó·îíÂ∞í would be decrypted with a new rng(123) which was hashed from our key ""Password"" using the random indices of the ""Password""s byte array. Which results in ""Encrypt this data."" coming back to us.

No cipher is ever 100% secure. Should someone by brute force, simply guessing, or find out by other means that the key used was ""Password"" there is nothing that can be done to protect the data, it will be deciphered, and this true of all ciphers.
However, this method makes it extremely difficult to extract the key out of the encrypted data, which some ciphers (WEP comes to mind) make it quite easy. It is actually impossible to extract the key directly. You could extract, by some currently unknown means, the starting point for the random number generator, in this case ""123"".  123 is a 32 bit integer, which is difficult to extract, but not impossible. However, the starting point does not solely belong to the byte value of ""Password"" it belongs to many multiple possible combinations and lengths of byte arrays. Regardless of whether such a method is determined, which it has been determined for other ciphers in AES, the equivalent Passage Cipher strength is your random number generator's factorial, in this case 32 bit, to the power of your key's number of bits. This means that a typical 128 bit (16 character password) Passage Cipher encryption is equivalent to (32 to the power of 128) 4.5624406176221952186411716057003e+192 bit encryption using AES encryption. In our example using key ""Password"" is the equivalent of using 2.1359870359209100823950217061696e+96 bit AES encryption.
As you can see, the encryption strength has increased exponentially, and quite drastically.

I should mention, bit by bit encryption is not really a thing. You only have two options. Change a 0 to a 1, or leave it as 0. Change a 1 to a 0, or leave it as 1. Because of this fact ciphers are applied, at the very least, byte by byte so that there are many combinations of resulting bits. That means that 128bit encryption doesn't accurately represent the strength, it is simply a fluffed up value (16 bytes x 8 bits = 128bit encryption). When you end up with a ridiculous number like this though, it is probably more appropriate to say the equivalent encryption strength is 32 / 8  to the power of the number of bytes in your key. In this case standard AES 128bit encryption is 16 byte encryption. The Passage Cipher 16 byte encryption has equivalent strength to 4294967296 byte AES encryption. 

Once again I remind everyone that the method for determining the hash code used, or even the random number generator supplied, completely changes the algorithm, so there is no grantee that organization A and organization B use the exact same method. If the Passage Cipher is intended for communications of some sort to and from organization A and organization B, they would both need to use the same method to correctly decipher each other's messages.

Here is the source code for this particular library, it quite simple, and written in C#. Please whine more and port it to C / C++ or your preferred language. (Your going to port it to assembly right?)

It includes and uses helpful things such as a buffered stream, so that you can perform operations on GB, TB, what ever, of data while only using 4MB (the default) of R.A.M. to process that data, an event that reports progress every 1/10 of a second for use with a progress bar, and an overloaded method that allows you to supply either a byte array or a string as the key.
These are not required to implement the cipher, but as previously stated, helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Synopsis:**

*Sigh*. When I first started playing with Dogecoin I used an address generated by Exodus (I know...). I accumulated some Dogecoin through the MoonDogecoin faucet signed in with my public address, and balances were auto-paid once per week. Exodus dropped Dogecoin, I dumped my keys into Jaxx, life moves on. Moon faucets later switched to storing balances with CoinPot (I know...) who continued weekly auto-payments, for a while. Then they stopped. I created a CP account to continue using the Moon faucets, for a while. I tried linking the address with my CP account, but it just failed for one reason or another (can't find my CP account {CP.system.duh}, or signed message failure) so my CP balance for this address is now in limbo. Because I had to start balance &amp; rewards &amp; referrals from scratch, and because I couldn't claim my existing balance, I got fed up and stopped.

Lately I've been using Moon faucets again, and started hoping that renewed attempts to link the address with my account would work. They haven't.

I'd like to narrow down the possibilities by eliminating one: that there may've been another private key in Exdous. I'm pretty sure there was only one, at any rate I only ever used the one Dogecoin address that Exodus generated, and only ever received Dogecoin through it from MoonDogecoin faucet. I'm reluctant to regress the Exodus version installed just to check for another privkey in case it does damage to the wallet data somehow (there are other coins in it). Besides, after importing my privkey into another client (MultiDoge) I can see my Dogecoin balance &amp; transactions.

So, using [MooltiDoge](https://youtu.be/9jWGbvemTag) (thanks Leeloo) I imported my private key &amp; signed the CP link request message that failed and have now come here with a new message signed by the same key to see if others can verify it with the signature provided.

I think I'll be using paper wallets from now on. Funny, they were the first wallets I looked at in 2011.

personalfinance,(US) Getting out of the military and starting my new life. Am I ready?,"Hello everyone at PF. I am exactly 1 year from getting out of the Navy and moving to Loveland Colorado to start my new life. I did some math and figured out the wage/salary I'm gonna need on the ""outside."" Some personal deets first:


I am 24 M, single. No kids. No girlfriend at this time. I want to rent a house with a garage because of my hobbies, so I anticipate having a roommate to split cost. I'm currently paying on a car loan. $12k left of $22k. I have 6% APR credit card debt of $7,500 and short-term savings of $3,000 in the form of a 3.50% APY CD. I am currently deployed at sea, so 80% of my income is going straight into my debt, to be paid off before December is over, barring any life emergency. I am going full monk-mode after the holidays are over for 2019. I SHOULD have $10k in savings by the date of my separation.

Here's my projected monthly budget. 

* **Rent: $875** (my half of $1,750)
* **Car Pmt: $245** (new. 72 mo 2%, bought in Jan'17)
* **Car Ins.: $175**  (what can I say... I had an accident...)
* **Groceries $375** (help me figure this one out!)
* **Phone: $120** (if I don't upgrade this September, make it $90)
* **Electric: $100** (my half of ~$200)
* **Internet:** $50 (My half of $100)
* **BUFFER FUNDS:** ~$250 (ideally put into savings, but could be used to eat out. movie ticket. etc.)

[As for my retirement fund and healthcare, I will be in the Air National Guard, and after $100/mo retirement contribution to Roth TSP and TriCare Health/Dental expenses, the Guard will earn me $100 a month in net income. Health and retirement covered.]

This makes for a total monthly expense of about **$2,200.** Yearly expense of **$26,400** and I would need to be paid, before taxes, **$33,264** in order to make this work. Which is **$16 per hour** to scrape by, paycheck to paycheck. 


**All of these numbers are BEFORE a calculated ~26% income tax. 4.65% from Colorado's state tax, and 22% from my Federal bracket, worst case scenario.**



**This seems very low.** What am I missing? Obviously, one does not want to just be paycheck-to-paycheck, and I will probably be making more like $17-$18/hr if I go into the trades (apprentice electrician wages in the Front Range- and it will steadily increase for 3 consecutive years until I become a Journeyman, which will top out at $25/hr, pessimistically) more like $20-$21/hr if I go into a job related to my career field in the Navy. (I would enjoy it less and I can't count on a promotion any time soon...) Also, if I can settle for less and skip out on the rental HOUSE and the garage, I can rent a 2-3 bedroom apartment or condo and it would cost a bit less. My half of rent would be $650-$750, and utilities would be partially included, so that's another savings.


Lastly, a point about roommates. If my roommate was shitty and I wanted to kick him out, (I'd be the one paying the rent and he would be paying me directly. Sublease?) I could scrape by and pay for my $1,750 house if I was making $22/hr before taxes. I'd be searching for a roommate ASAP, but I would not be missing any bills or groceries.



Do I have a solid plan? What am I missing? Obviously I can stand to save some extra money for retirement and I want a bigger buffer each month in case something goes wrong. Car accident. Etc. But I consider this worst case scenario, as I SHOULD be able to get a job that pays at least $20/hr with my qualifications.",finance

personalfinance,House Swap/Equity Questions,"I have two primary questions that require some background information.

My wife and I live across the street from my in-laws.  We live in an 1800 sq ft. house and they live in the 3600 sq ft home that my wife grew up in.  My family of six is needing to upgrade in size and my wife's retired parents are looking to downsize.  The in-law's house sits on land that has been in the family for generations.  We approached my in-laws about buying their house when they downsize and they expressed a desire to buy our house from us, thus a house swap.  Our home is would be an easy sell at $280,000 in our market, but the in-laws' place is tougher to gauge.  Houses of that size (with 1.5 acres) don't move quickly, but I still think it's probably worth $425,000 with a patient seller.  Our in-laws have decided that they think there is a $100,000 difference in our home values (a bit of a family discount, perhaps).  So the plan is for them to buy our house (cash sale since they own their home outright), and then for us to buy theirs for $100,000 over what they paid us.  We won't involve a realtor to avoid paying commissions.  They are willing to structure the deal in whatever way works best for us.  We currently owe $180,000 on our home.  We have a combined gross income of about $125,000 in VERY stable jobs.  Now on to my two questions.

1. What is the most advantageous way to structure this deal?  We do NOT want to pay PMI.
2. With interest rates so low (My wife and I both have credit scores over 800), there is a part of me that would like to take the opportunity to pull as much cash out of the sale as possible and use it to fund renovations and improvements to the home.  My wife would like to use that cash to pay off our two cars (2017 Camry, owe about $15,000 and 2017 Traverse, owe about $20,000).  She likes the idea of limiting our monthly outgoing payments and using the extra money each month to cash flow renovations as we go.  So, if our goal was to pull out as much cash as possible, how should we structure the deal, and what should we do with the cash?

investing,Should we be a little worried about Trump and the fed?,"Trumps been pressuring the fed but they have no obligation to listen. I‚Äôm new to this but I think they operate somewhat like the Supreme Court where they are mostly immune to political and public opinion. I have a fear that could change but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs valid. I think there‚Äôs a very good chance if a recession come by election time Trump is really going to go all in and bring the Fed into the public spotlight. My worry is as we get more populist there will be a movement to subject the fed to elections or give the government direct control over it. It probably could  be pretty popular too imo. The Fed is very important, presidents will blame them for everything wrong in the economy and the voters have the right to have a say who sits on the board. I think in that case it‚Äôs an absolute disaster, most of us are stupid and will vote for whoever is going to promise to juice the economy.. Throw in some lobbying and corruption and we have a real problem. 

So my question is: what‚Äôs the likelihood the fed could lose autonomy and if that happens how screwed are we having people run for a position few understand and running on messages that cater to average Americans that have no clue what the fed actually should do?

I am hoping for opinions and insight into my situation. I didn't understand the full impact of student loans coming out of highschool, and I am paying for it now. I have big decisions to make and just wanted to know what other people think. I frequent this sub and have read all the applicable information, however I think a discussion could still be of value.

I'm 27 working as a programmer in a relatively low COL area in the Midwest, and live with my parents rent free. I gross 85000 base with 7-10% bonus and a 3.7% employer 401(k) contribution. There is no ""match"", they just put that in once per year, and I put in 5% currently. I also max my Roth IRA yearly. Currently, I have 64000 in savings, with 30k in my retirement accounts. I don't plan on touching my retirement accounts.

I would love to move out and buy a house, but I don't think that is the prudent thing to do with the student loan debt I've accumulated.

This is the link to what I've entered on [unbury.us](https://unbury.us). The monthly payment is the minimum payment of all of my student debt. This is the only debt that I have. It seems that the snowball and avalanche method will result in a similar amount of interest even if I were to pay 2 or 3 times the minimum amount.

I know that from a purely mathematical sense that one should pay off the highest interest loans first, however it seems that it would make more sense for me to snowball, as I could immediately pay off the entirety of my federal loans and then have an additional \~$325.25 per month to contribute into my 401(k) or back into my private student loan.

So I‚Äôve been making all payments, just late trying to keep them up. So late fees are killing me on top of that.

My question is, since I‚Äôm already really behind on the cards, should I just focus on mortgage, essential bills (electric, water), and snowball one credit card at a time?

personalfinance,Roth vs. Traditional 401k - sanity check,"Just want to make sure what I'm doing here makes sense.

My wife and I make ~$130K USD annually. We have $47k in student loans with an average interest rate around 5-6%.

My work offers a 50% match on all 401k contributions up to $7k in match per year. I've been contributing $1200/mo. to max out the match.

I have been contributing to a mix of Roth and Traditional in the 401k, and lately more Roth than Traditional. We're both relatively young (late 20s) and she's not working currently so I expect our income to grow substantially, and we have 2 kids and own a home so I expect our tax rate will likely be higher in retirement than it is today.

But I don't expect we'll live a lavish lifestyle in retirement, perhaps slightly less modest than what we're doing now, so the difference in our income may not be huge. I've been thinking of reallocating my contributions to put 100% toward the Traditional 401k (basically getting the match by contributing as little as possible) and then putting any extra towards our student loans. The first tier of student loans is around 6.5% interest, then there's another around 5%, and the rest are around 4%, so I'm thinking it doesn't make sense to invest anything more than what will get me the match until I've at least cleared out the 6.5% loans, and possibly the 5% as well, then maybe starting a Roth IRA so I have access to the contributions if I need them in the future. I'll still be putting &gt;$21,000 in the traditional 401k each year, which I think should keep me on track.

Does this make sense? Anything I'm missing here?",finance

investing,Peculiar Market Signals,"S&amp;P 500 was at its all-time high on 26th July 2019 at 3,025. It is currently trading at 2,900 level, down about 4.1% from the peak but still +15.7% year-to-date.

Meanwhile, U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield declined from the 5-Year high of 3.2% in 4Q18 to 1.58% as of now. The sudden and sharp decline in 10-Year Treasury Yield pushed global bond prices to all time high as well. J.P. Morgan Asia Credit Bond Index also surged to all-time high with year-to-date return reach 11.7% as of 20th August 2019, **BEST PERFORMANCE IN 5 YEARS.**

Historically, strong economic growth has always been the main driver for rising stock prices. In a booming economy, investors normally increase their asset allocation to equity, reducing their exposure in bond, which usually yielding lower return as compare with equity in the long run.

This year, Federal Reserve reversed its Fed Fund Rate hike policy and cut 25bps (0.25%) in July-2019. This is widely anticipated and bond investors had already positioned themselves for a rate cut, which will push up bond prices.

However, equity markets are still doing very well with S&amp;P 500 increased by 15.7% YTD.

The inverted yield curve, historically, signalling an upcoming recession as bond investors are will to ‚Äúget paid‚Äù less in longer term debt securities while getting paid more in shorter term debt securities. If bond investors are right about where our global economy is heading to, then the equity markets investors are probably still in their sweet dream thinking that the fundamentals of the global economy will continue to do well.

Conversely, If equity investors are right that the global economy is going to do well, at least in the next 6-12 months, why would bond investors keep buying up bonds and pushing bond prices to all-time high?

**There could be 2 possible outcomes.**

1. Bond investors are right and equity market is set to fall.
2. Equity investors are right and bond prices are set to fall.

What is so peculiar at this juncture is that, nobody knows who will be right and everybody just continue this amazing party with the music playing so hot and loud. Many empirical evidences have shown that bond and equity exhibit negative correlation in the long run. The stellar performance of both bonds and equities post a very serious question. Which asset class will be the next out-performer?

GOLD? As claimed by many famous and credible investors recently. Gold price had risen 9.86% YTD. Almost every asset classes are performing well.

Let‚Äôs say there is a recession coming, equity is definitely going to suffer. What about bond prices? U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield is already at 1.58%, the lowest level we have ever seen since early 1960‚Äôs. Will bond remain a safe heaven if a recession is in the brewing?

When equity sell off starts, there will be more money flow from equity to bond, pushing up bond prices, hence pushing down bond yields.

If there is no recession in the next 6-12 months, bond prices may not fall that much as the rhetoric coming out of the white house is demanding more rate cut from Federal Reserve.

The strong performance YTD, up to 20th August 2019, will not repeat again. 2019 is a very special year with all the factors coincidentally or deliberately being put in place for a favourable market environment for both equity and bond markets.

I believe that it is very difficult at this juncture for both bond and equity investors to make the same stellar performance they had already achieved this year. Investors should be very careful in considering buying up more bonds or stocks. Either ways, there must be one asset class that will suffer.

My conclusion is that global market is flooded with too much liquidity. The inverted yield curve may not be an early predictor of an impending recession.

Just last week, Germany government announced that they have already prepared a stimulus plan if the ongoing trade war continues to negatively affecting its export oriented economy, on the pre-condition that Germany economy entering recession.

Edit 2: I got a call back a few minutes after sending.  $130k was firm and final, so I accepted it.  Everything else about the role is OK in the balance and it's still a vertical move in salary and responsibility for a good company. 

Again, thanks for the help!  I'm glad I asked and listened.  

I'm attempting to negotiate for the first time in my career. I did all I could during the process to not name a range, but I ended up being dumb and naming it. However, I named a range that was higher than my ""it's not worth me leaving this job"" number. The job I want to take came in at the lowest end of that range, $130k. I think they can do better - they're a big bank. They do have a bonus package, defined as ""0-35%"" based on annual reviews, paid out annually (not quarterly), and a stock purchase offer that allows you to buy up stock quarterly at its lowest point that quarter, then sell instantly. Those are darn good but they aren't base salary - I've been burned on bonuses plenty of times in my career.

The HR guy I've been working with was transparent in that a committee within the business makes the salary determinations; 9 times out of 10 they come in within or above a range named by the candidate, 1 time out of 10 they come in with a lower number. Glassdoor has a few people with my title or similar making higher than that, but realistically $130k isn't that bad. Still, I'm going to take a shot at negotiation. I don't think they'll withdraw the offer if I try, but if I do, I gotta reconcile with the fact that they might not be the best place. Even if they counter, I'll hopefully come away with something.

Moreover, they combine PTO and sick time, my current job doesn't. I'm not keen on that - ""get sick, no vacation"" has always been a shitty practice.

I'm doing what I can to draw out the process before I accept/counteroffer. Asked questions on healthcare costs, asked questions about other specifics, etc. I've drafted this as an email to go back to the HR coordinator running the process. Totally open to criticism.

&gt;Hi John -  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks again for all your help and communication in the hiring process so far. I've talked over the offer with my wife, and I'd like to make a counter-offer. I'd like the base salary to be $140,000 with 25 PTO days for 2020 and the years going forward, subject to any applicable addition of PTO days at normal additional rates in the years to come. I'm basing the salary on reported salary of similar titles at %company% within the NYC metro area and the %LocationA% and %LocationB% offices. While I understand that there's a salary differential between NYC and New Jersey, I've been interviewing at similar roles that run from $140k-$160k for Manhattan and on or close to the same for Jersey City or Hoboken.  
&gt;  
&gt;Given that %company% is a total compensation shop, the opportunities for me to make up the delta are not guarantees of base salary. Bonuses are good to have, don't get me wrong, but I've been in too many situations where either my bonus metrics were interpreted in a manner to exclude me from a full or any bonus. Moreover, while I don't doubt %company%'s state as a company, bonuses are always discretionary and could be reduced, suspended, eliminated, et cetera. Also, the stock purchase program could be subject to the same reduction/suspension/etc., and it'll require large cash outlays to buy the stock and cover capital gains taxes either in the short or long term.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore on the base salary, I'm presently hourly at my current role, with rough calculations of my overtime coming close to the $130k figure. I expect that I'll be doing plenty of work off-hours, given that the majority of %internal team acronym%'s Azure environment impacts the business and internal customers. Off-hours downtime is a given for IT, but in a salaried role, even with work-life balance in mind, I do want to make sure that my responsibilities are fully reflected in my compensation. Also, my wife and I both have our respective medical situations which have involved meeting and exceeding our family deductible annually. Given historical upward trends in healthcare costs and their eventual passing-on to individual participants in health plans, I'd like to be able to account for that going into the role and for the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;As to PTO, my current position has 20 days of vacation, 5 sick days, and a floating holiday in addition to the major federal holidays. It also offers the same work-from-home option as %company% does. As such, I'd be looking at a net loss of actual vacation time if I was to need a true sick day to focus on recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm hopeful that this presents a reasonable justification for the higher base salary and PTO days to match my current offering. Please don't hesitate to let me know if I can answer any questions you might have.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks,  
&gt;

If this is true, I will be paying 9k on my 30k loan after the full term. The only downside I can see is the upfront costs, and the yearly re-certification that I will need to go through.

I am 26, $40,000 salary, living with my parents.

I have been following a 25/60/15 budget for about a year and a half. I track my monthly expenses down to a cup of coffee. 

* TDAmeritrade (taxable): \~$23,500
* Checking: \~$2,000 (until next paycheck)

Debt:

* FedLoan: \~$22,000 ($335/month)
* SallieMae: \~$7,000 ($285/month)
* Car: \~$4,400 ($305/month)

I had realized \~$6,000 in short term capital gains YTD. I realized a $1,900 loss on a position yesterday (COTY), and a $1,500 loss on a position today (CGC). This brought my tax liability down to \~$2,500 in realized capital gains YTD.

* Take the proceeds from COTY (\~$5,000), and pay off car by end the week
* Take the proceeds from CGC (\~$8,000), and pay off Sallie Mae by end of month
* Look into refinancing FedLoan, reevaluate plan of attack by the end of the year

This will leave me with \~$12,000 in my TDA account - 200 shares of EBAY and cash - and a couple grand in my checking account. I am currently putting $650/month into my TDA (""savings"") account.

Due to my occupation in the financial sector, I can get a special employee credit card with no balance transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. After the first year it will revert to 5% interest. If I leave my job then it will revert to a regular card at like 14% interest. 

I also have the option for a personal loan of 24 months (10.25% interest) and 36 months loan (11.25% interest). Once again because of my job I can get 2% off my interest rate bringing it down to 8.25% or 9.25% respectivly.

personalfinance,Getting a Roth IRA at 20,"Hello PF!

Let me just start off with some background. I'm 20 years old currently in school with not much in savings. I generally make enough during the summer between semesters to survive for the following school year and that's about it. I have been really trying recently to limit my spending and keep a little in the bank, but it's been difficult. 

I really just would love some clarity on a few things.

1. I recently opened a Roth IRA with E Trade. I understand the basics of this type of IRA where the money is taxed before it's put in and during retirement I can take it out tax free. I also know that I need to invest this money. After doing some research I have determined that a good route here would be to invest in some mutual funds as well as some ETFs. E Trade doesn't take a commission on these so it appears that would be optimal, but what I truly don't understand is how the interest works. I hear about the  compound interest effects, but is that because the account itself has a built in interest rate? Is it then compound because the invested money also grows? If I didn't invest anywhere would my money still grow?
2. Back to the funds and ETFs. Are there any other routes I should go? What funds should I invest in? I haven't taken a position yet because I only have $50 in there, but as I start to add more, where should I invest and how diverse should my portfolio be?   
3. My student loans after I graduate won't be that much, so I intend to be debt free after 5 or so years. Although I'm pretty sure I won't be moving back in with my parents so I will have to be able to afford rent, food, etc. I opened the account now just to get ahead of the game with intentions to really start saving after I graduated. That being said, should I max out my contributions to the IRA as soon as I can or should I prioritize paying off the debt before I really start to add?

I guess I should also add that my goal is to max my IRA as soon as it makes sense to, and that I would hope to retire with (hopefully) a couple million in savings around 65 or 70. My risk tolerance is also pretty high and I'm perfectly ok with sacrificing some of the cash now in order for it to pay off big later.

Seriously any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,ITT Tech Navient student loan debt,"Hi All, I need financial advice to tackle student loan debt from Navient. I browsed through the ""Debt"" Wiki and could not find specific solution.

I'm 30 with an associates degree from ITT Tech - graduated in May 2009 and currently in $57k debt - private loan = $17k and federal loan = $40k. Soon as I graduated I could not find a job in my field of expertise. Hence, settled for a job as an Assistant teacher ($10/hour) in order to keep up with living expenses. I used to make $1200/month and could not afford to make any payments for student loan whatsoever. Fast forward to year 2017, my loan got defaulted. 

Having spoken to Navient, I decided to make Income based payment, where I paid $30 and $50 a month towards private and federal loan. In November 2018 I got a job at USPS ($3000/month) and have been saving aggressively. Navient got sick of me and have agreed to settle the $17k private loan for $8k. That's the end of my story.

Firstly, I have a hard time trusting Navient (because they are Navient). I'm trying to figure out what are the best options to tackle this. 

1. Do I refinance the whole loan through a different loan servicer? 
2. Everytime I look at my account on Navient's website, it drives me crazy because there is whole bunch of things that do not make sense.   
As of February this year, the outstanding balance was $57507. Until now I've paid $1323 (Sometimes I pay $400 a month, other months $100 etc., depending on pay cheque). Technically, my loan balance should be down to $56184 currently. Unfortunately, the balance shown in the website is $57162. I don't know where the difference went (No wonder the world hates Navient).
3. This article proved to be useful. Since, I'm a federal employee, I could possibly qualify for federal loan forgiveness program. I would be very thankful if I can get personal insights on this program -  [https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/student-loans/navient-student-loan-forgiveness-options/](https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/student-loans/navient-student-loan-forgiveness-options/)

personalfinance,Advice about paying down a large portion of student loans upfront?,"Hello, r/personalfinance!

I recently graduated from college and am now trying to decide how much of my loans to pay down now. I took out $20,000 in loans - $15,000 from Wells Fargo with a 6.49% interest rate and $5,000 from FAFSA at a 4.45% interest rate. I worked frequently throughout college and have about $20,000 saved in the bank. I am currently working as a bar manager and make an estimated $50,000 annually but am planning to leave soon to take a career-oriented position making roughly $40,000 annually in either Washington DC or Annapolis, MD where I am expecting rent to be about $1,000/month. Other than rent and cost of living, my only regular bill will be my car note at $175.00/month. 

I am considering paying down around $10,000 dollars of the Wells Fargo loan soon and then paying the FAFSA and remainder of Wells Fargo loan over time. Do you think this seems to be appropriate? Any thoughts broadly?

personalfinance,Medical school loan question,"Hi all - not sure if this is the right place but not sure where else to ask.  I came into medical school with a decent amount of credit card debt from the application process (\~$5k) and have managed to only increase the amount while in school (\~$10k over a year) because my student loans do not adequately cover my expenses.  It is all on 0% cards, but I am running out of ways to stretch those out and am looking for a more long-term way to borrow money at a low rate. I am fully on federal loans, but they are just not enough to cover my expenses (not extravagant: I pay less in rent than school dorms, don't go out a ton, haven't bought clothes in ages).  I am not super worried long term about the debt because I plan to pay it down quickly once I have an attending salary, but I am not sure what the best move is in the meantime as I have several years of school left and continuing to juggle 0% credit cards as this debt continues to grow seems unsustainable. Does anyone know the best way to consolidate my credit card debt into a low-rate  loan?

Ideas I've had:

1) Ask financial aid office to adjust my federal loans up so I can borrow more. Technically federal loans can't be used to pay for credit card debt or non-school expenses, but most of these expenses were accrued while in school (rent), so maybe they would allow it or just won't ask questions if I request more? 

2) Private medical school loans - but they all have language along the lines of : ""loan amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid received as certified by the school.""  I have already taken out federal loans up to the cost of attendance so if I am understanding correctly that means I am not eligible for these loans?  Called Sallie May and they couldn't seem to confirm this so not sure if this is true? There are downsides to private loans though so would like to avoid if possible. 

3) I have about $13k in two IRAs that I could pull out and throw at the credit card debt. I know this is subject to a 10% penalty + the income tax but apparently there is an education [exception](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions) that would waive the 10% penalty.  Apparently it must be paid directly to the school though so not sure that would help me pay down the credit cards?

personalfinance,"Bank sold all regional accounts, now my credit score has been lowered","I banked with a popular national bank since my parents helped me open the account when I was a kid. I had a savings account from the age of about 12, and I added a checking account when I turned 16 and started working. I even opened a college credit card through this bank when I turned 18. I'm now 21, so these accounts were fairly old and were great for my credit score. 

However, this past December my bank sold all of the accounts in my region to a different national bank. After this happened I closed the accounts with the new bank because I didn't like their customer service one bit. The buyout was announced only a couple of months before the change was set to begin, in September. I was in Morocco studying abroad for the semester when they informed me that my debit and credit cards would be deactivated at the end of November. This left me without access to my bank accounts while in a foreign country for almost a month before I came home. I had to go through the terror of traveling overseas carrying only cash on me and without any way to get more money if I ran out or of it was lost or stolen. To top off a horrible experience with this bank, they decided to transfer over all 200,000 accounts in a single weekend. They were not at all prepared and there were numerous technical issues which left many people without access to their money. The bank's phone lines were constantly busy too because they weren't staffed enough to deal with this massive transition. 

So I transferred everything over to a small, local bank that I'd already started a small checking account with as part of my student loan with them earlier that year. That account is now a little over a year old. 

I went from having accounts that were 9, 5, and 2 years old to only a couple of 1 year old accounts. It's caused my credit to drop a decent amount. I used to have credit over 700, now it's high 500s. I also have the issue of my student loans, which I've completely deferred until graduation so the amount I owe is over the principal because of the interest that's been collecting (I have a full ride so I only took out loans for my semester abroad so it's not a huge amount but it is a decent chunk of debt) that I'm sure isn't helping.

Fast forward to now, I'm apartment hunting with my fiance and one of the places I'm interested in has a minimum credit score of 650. Is there anything I can do to raise my score? Or, in your experience, would a leasing office be open to an explanation of the drop in my credit (this was a massive buyout, they closed all branches in my state and several others and it made the local news and everything)?  What can I do here?

Edit: I definitely seem to have misunderstood which accounts are counted in the credit score. That credit card seems to be basically the only account I had that could be counted. I think that the main issue is probably the student loans that have been collecting interest. I assume it doesn't look too good for the amount owed to be higher than the principal.",finance

personalfinance,A very popular online free mortgage calculator has a bug with 1-time extra payments,"Just a heads up if you use bankrate.com's mortgage calculator: check the results if you are inputting one-time payments into a mortgage model.

On this particular calculator, after calculating a basic mortgage you can click on ""Amortization Schedule"" and see the full mortgage schedule as well as additional options to model your the mortgage. The bug is is with the one-time payment input option.  

When you use this feature the payment will be immediately subtracted from the first row (the first month the mortgage starts), regardless of the date you have selected for that one-time payment to be applied. If you selected a payment date that is BEFORE the mortgage start date then the payment will be applied only once. If you select a date ON or AFTER the mortgage start date then the payment will be starts then it will be applied twice...once immediately and once on the date you chose. 

Example 1:
Sept 2019 start date, $200,000 mortgage, 30 years, 0% interest, $10,000 one-time payment scheduled for Aug 2019.
Result: Success! Sept 2019 Balance owed is $189,445, so the $10k was applied only once along with the regular principal payment

personalfinance,Credit report question.,"My wife and I went to apply for a home loan a couple of days ago and the bank got back to us today that we were denied and they gave us a list of accounts that they used to come to their decision. The issue is none of the accounts are ours and they do not show for us when we pull our credit reports from Credit Karma or  CreditWise. I know those two don't use the same metrics to calculate credit score is what the bank would use but I thought I would show you all the accounts associated with your real credit report. After some digging around we know that one of the accounts for sure is for a woman with the same first name as my wife and her SSN is 1 number off from my wives. We have been dealing with collection calls for as long as we have been together, it is actually the reason we start monitoring credit with Credit Karma, we pull our fico real credit report every year or two just to make sure it is clean and we have never seen her accounts on there until now, the last one we pulled was about 3 years ago because we knew we would be buying a house this year.  The bank did tell us that when they ran her credit report they got an SSN mismatch error, so they reverified our SSNs. What really stands out to me is my wife had a ~750 score but the accounts that showed as negative were 2 foreclosures (one this year) some medical bills and a car loan that is 90 days past due. 

We feel completely crushed by this and we don't know where to start to get this resolved. Should we pull our credit report on our own and see if they accounts show to start disputing them or is there another course of action? We have been working really hard for the last handful of years to be able to buy a house and now we find that we are unable to because of this mess up.  the more I am thinking about this the more I suspect this has been an issue for a while, since in 2016 we went to buy a car and we couldn't get a car loan with an interest rate lower than 20% on a $16k car with almost no debt, $1500 down and credit scores in the Low 700s.

Update: So we went to go pull her credit reports and all the questions to verify ID were for the other person so we are not able to pull her report. So now we are having to send ID information to all there agencies to get her reports. Today has been a fun day. /s",finance

I‚Äôm currently making about $55k/yr. but will likely see an increase when I relocate, potentially an additional $5-8k/yr. I‚Äôve been with the same company for 4 years and my job is stable.

I currently owe $115k on the condo at an interest rate of 4.25%.

Zillow values the condo at around $315k but I‚Äôm really not sure how accurate those estimates are.

I‚Äôm just looking for some advice/perspective on what my options are. The average rent in the area I‚Äôm moving to for a 1 bedroom apartment is around $1300/mo.. The average home price is about $315k. I realize I have a fair amount of equity in my condo and if I was to sell I could probably afford to buy a house in the area I‚Äôm moving to but I also have thought about keeping it and using it as a rental or potentially a home for myself when I retire.

investing,(newbie question) am I understanding bonds and ROI correctly?,"I am new to finance and am trying to understand the basics of bond metrics

Say there is a bond with par value of $1000, 4% annual coupon and 10 years to maturity. Say the discount/market rate today is 1.5%, which would mean the price of the bond is $1230.55¬†

If I buy this bond today and hold it to maturity, regardless of what happens to future interest rates, I spend $1230.55 today and get a total cashflow stream of $40 per year \* 10 years + my principal back at the end, so a total of 400+1000= $1400

At this point, my brain would say, OK, I spent $1230.55 and got $1400, so $1400-1230.55= 169.45 of.....profit? If I divide this profit by my investment, I get 169.45/1230.55= \~14%. Or in other words, my ROI on this investment is 14%.....right?

Everything I read about bonds is that they are measured in yields, yield to maturity, etc. The current yield above would be 3.25% and 1.5% yield to maturity

I guess my question is.... the 3.25% and 1.5% figures make this investment seem fairly mediocre. However, where I work in the engineering field, a 14% proposed ROI on a new project or buying new/faster equipment would be considered pretty damn good. But projects take work and machines fail, so why would we move forward with anything if we could just buy those bonds and sit on our asses and collect 14%? Or in another way, the average S&amp;P return over time is something like 11%..is a bond like this basically a free ticket to market beating returns?

I currently have $61,364.79 in federal student loan debt, including unpaid interest with an average interest rate of 4.98%. I also have a car loan, which due to problems with the website I can't access my online account, so I don't know exactly how much I owe, but I bought the car about 2 years ago for around $6,000 and it was a 5 year loan, so I estimate I owe about $4,000. But I don't really count that as I make the payment every month and so it should be paid off in 3 years.

I'm currently a Ph.D. math student. I have a graduate teaching assistanceship, and so they pay for my school. I will graduate in roughly 5 years, given that I pass my qualifying exams. If I don't, I will graduate with a masters in 2 years. I don't forsee taking on any more loans during my schooling as the stipend I receive for working for the school is enough to live on.

I don't plan on making any student loan payments until I graduate and get a job. My job prospects seem quite good to me, as I will have an advanced math degree, and I have a good amount of working experience with 7 NASA internships totaling a little more than 2 years of experience. I also plan on having more internships during the summers I have left in school.

I honestly don't think my prospects are that bad, as I will be graduating with approximately $77,000 of debt if I get a Ph.D. and $67,000 of debt with a masters, and I would hope that that would be equivalent to about one year of work with whatever job a get.

Bitcoin,"Is there a correlation between the Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and traditional markets?","[In our previous material,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/csu24e/cryptocurrency_correlation_analysis_how_do/) we figured out whether there is a correlation between Bitcoin and other coins. We have clearly demonstrated that a direct correlation is observed between almost all digital assets. Somewhere ‚Äì to a greater extent, somewhere ‚Äì to a lesser extent. But what is the relationship between the digital asset market and the traditional market? Does this help predict the dynamics of the movement of coins? Let‚Äôs get it right.  


When Bitcoin was created 11 years ago, it was believed that its main advantage as a new class of assets would be the lack of correlation with other classes of assets. But a decade has passed, and we can say for sure whether this is actually so or not.  


A few years ago, digital assets didn‚Äôt actually correlate with traditional assets (stocks, commodities, currencies in the circulation of countries). But now a different situation is already observed. Many investors are trying to understand whether it is possible to hedge risks associated with the traditional market with the help of cryptocurrencies.  


Based on last year‚Äôs data from reputable publications, we‚Äôll try to discover the connection of Bitcoin with other markets. JPMorgan analysts conducted a detailed analysis, during which it turned out that over the past five years, the correlation of Bitcoin with the S&amp;P 500 index, US government bonds and gold has been at zero level. Studies have shown that the volatility of digital assets is significantly higher than that of stocks (which, incidentally, was already understandable). Experts concluded that ‚Äúit is not known how the coins will behave during financial turmoil, but they can be used to diversify due to the low correlation with stocks and bonds.‚Äù  


However, this is not the only opinion. For example, analysts at Bitwise Asset Management, on the contrary, believe that the correlation between the two markets is only growing from year to year. They found that the correlation of Bitcoin with stocks and bonds is 0.12 and 0.25, respectively (as you remember, the ideal case is +1). For comparison, we can cite their data on the correlation of US and global stocks. Here the indicator is 0.88.  


Sifr Data found a negative correlation between Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index (-0.27). This tells us about their weak correlation. For gold, the indicator is even lower (-0.1 ‚Äì both types of assets are neutral to each other). By the way, experts consider their information closer to reality. We told you about this when we analyzed the correlation table of digital currencies.  


Blockforce Capital, an American asset management company, also revealed a slight correlation between Bitcoin and Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs 500.

&amp;#x200B;

[Rolling Correlation](https://i.redd.it/2mbeewpn9zh31.png)

Crypto correlation with stock market. The low correlation has its own reason: the growth factors of the two markets are different. In the case of traditional markets ‚Äì economic growth, interest rates, corporate profits. And for cryptocurrencies, legislative changes and investor confidence are important.  


However, digital assets continue and, most likely, will continue to be popular with investors. Due to the low correlation with traditional markets, during economic and financial shocks, investors invest a certain part of funds in this sphere, since such a maneuver often saves investors from huge losses.  


Some experts believe that the cryptocurrency industry will undergo major changes in the future. Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management, claims that after institutional investors enter the digital currency market, they will become more like securities.",cryptocurrency

As an estimate I'll probably have anywhere between 5-7K USD unused from the loan a year from now, and I'll be working plenty this next year so that's a lot of added income that will allow me to use the money from loan even less and therefore possibly have even more to put somewhere (I'm thinking investments? high interest savings (but its not in there long so idk)?

personalfinance,Are streamline loans worth it?,"We bought our home 2 years ago for 317k at 3.75% fixed.  It was our first home, so we ended up having to get an FHA loan.  Now we are looking at streamlining our loan, which would reduce our interest rate to 3.25% fixed.  Our payoff amount as of today is 295k, bit the new loan will reset our term to 30 years, and raise our amount owed to 301k due to PMI and MP.  The benefit is that it will lower our monthly payment from 2000 to 1700.

investing,Inverse Yeild,"Hey guys,

Just wondering what will cause the Fed to lower interest rates in the future, that would cause the current short term bond yields to be low, where in the pre 2007 crisis the inflation rates where almost double the rates now. And considering the previous 2-3 years the inflation rate currently is lower. 

Can the current decrease in yield, be caused by a mixture of Trump Tweets and media overreacting. 

And if my theory is correct would it be wise to buy the short term bonds know since they are priced low and gain a much better return in the future. 

Would like to hear both opposing comments! and concurring ones if any.

personalfinance,Should average Joe's invest in bonds?,"I recently understood how bonds work, and I find it incredibly interesting. It's like a loan you're giving to a company, with me as an individual acting as the bank. I have a few questions regarding the actual application of buying &amp; collecting bonds. 

Is it reasonable for me to buy a bond in Microsoft or another AAA bond, given the current interest rate is 3-4%? Would I need a broker for this? 

Secondly, what's the process on buying and collecting bonds? I would sign a legally bonding bond agreement, but would I represent myself if the bond somehow wasn't paid off? Or would this be covered in whatever agency I use to buy the bonds? 

Third, the future interest rate of bonds only affects my bond if the company is interested in buying it out (maybe because interest rates are lowered), and if I have a clause in my contract for this. Can't remember the term. Is this correct? If there is no clause, and interest rates rise, I'm just stuck making less potential money than if I invested in a bond in the future. 

I probably wouldn't actually buy a bond for a few years, but it seems like easy investing.

personalfinance,"Buying a house with no money down, pros/cons?","So I've read the wiki for buying homes regarding a down payment and I've done some research and reading and the consensus seems to be that a down payment is a requirement. 

However when I purchase a home, I would be using the VA home loan program as part of my veterans benefits. According to their website, the VA backed loans do not require a down payment, they do not require PMI and they set limits on how much closing costs and fees lenders can charge veterans. 

Additionally, the interest rates are all fixed rate and competitive with the national standard. I know that the VA program is restrictive in that you have to be a veteran/active service member (I meet this criteria) and the home has to be inspected by a VA approved inspector and appraised by a VA approved appraiser, but I think given the pros of using this benefit, I think these small downsides are tiny. 

For the sake of this post, let's say the house is $170,000 which is right around 3x my annual income, and monthly payments would be roughly $1200 which covers taxes, principal and interest and home owners insurance. That amount is roughly 30% of total take home monthly payment. 

I guess given the numbers, my question for you fine folks is should a down payment be made or save that for home emergencies/repairs/debt pay off. Or given my situation and numbers, is there a downside to not making a down payment?

I am also considering investing into funds but I find it impossible to do so from here. Are there any good tips on this?

financialindependence,Reminder to be grateful for what you have. Happy birthday to myself and being FI as birthday gift,"hi all,

This post is a reminder to my future self and hopefully serve you here as well to be ***grateful for what we already have at this very moment***.

As with this subreddit, i notice myself commonly fretting about not having the target desired net worth to fretting about the upcoming recession and SWR not lasting into infinity and beyond. (Damn those pesky retirement calculators at the sidebar that i always use! why am i not at my net worth yet!! i'll still have a 20% chance to die penniless arghh!)

For myself, as i prefer to remain anon, and so i came to reddit to have a mini celebration with you like minded random strangers about hitting FI on my 30th birthday and to share my journey with you as well.

My FI crossover point is measured not in the traditional way of SWR of 4-4.5%(MMM/bengen) invested networth but in terms of cash flow from dividends and rent. though it is getting there.

Being in South-east asia in singapore, i'm considered living at a high COL area. all $ is in SGD. here is me sharing my journey towards FI with you:

2013: just graduated.  NW $2k from internships and being lab tutors teaching programming and engineering in university. started job mid aug. Salary $40k. lived with parents like a hobo. graduated without student debt.

2014: salary SGD45k. NW \~$35k. lived with parents and started contributing. no longer living like a hobo.

2015: salary SGD60k\~. NW \~$65k. towards end of this year i got married and started on my own doing my own freelancing engineering work. me and my wife had a simple wedding. still spend close to $18k total. lived with parents while continuing saving.

2016: freelancing results \~$60k. oil crisis hits and major layoffs in SEA engineering companies. However, this is a major turning point in my life, i invested heavily into the downturn. many panicked and many were laid off. i panicked too, but from not having more cash to invest and me being conservative being cash flow fluctuating heavily due to freelancing. in retrospect would have generated more investment gains if i were still fully employed. NW crossed $100k by year end.

2017: freelancing results \~$90k. results from investment returned close to 50% total from correct investment calls, made a killing, general market recovery and dividends.(general market returned 20% in comparison). NW crossed $200k (my own). great thing about singapore is capital gains are tax free. Ta-da!

2018: continued freelancing. results almost similar to previous year. expanded business with mixed results and bought a home. household NW $280k inclusive my share of home equity. (my wife contributed $40k to home equity, i contributed $80k. we simply account them together)(me and my wife)

2019: business expansion. freelancing still onging. more expansion planned. household NW crossed $400k.

present day household NW - $410k.

invested assets $220k

Cash $60k ($40k for my business cash flow , $20k my wife. such huge cash is to let me and her sleep well at night)

Household value - $340k - mortgage($165k) - govt grant($45k) = \~$130k

Investment dividends @4.86% - $10.7k

Rental results after deduction mortgage interest and electricity - \~$1100/m = $13.2k.

Both combined expenses \~$20k-$22k/y for the past 2 years.

We had issue borrowing money for mortgage, as my status of being self employed did not sit well with banks as much of my ""income"" is bonus related and not being able to fix my salary at the time. but oh well, on the bright side, it forced us to prepay a large portion of our housing mortgage using cash. which lowers our mortgage payment now to miniscule level. \~1.8% mortgage interest rate in singapore at time of writing.

investment dividends and rental results after mortgage deduction is just above our combined expenses. we just barely hit our ""crossover"" point. we can argue that i did not put in slack buffer for various repair expenses here and there.

i pick my own stocks based on fundamental analysis for that is how i prefer to run my business and my investments. though i know this subreddit prefers indexing and all the arguments against picking my own stocks but i guess its how i am comfortable operating my finances and allocating within my own business.

Though its true that All in all i'm FI(based on cash flow), and it's also true that i'm still not out of the woods yet in terms of 4.5% withdrawal rate. i guess i'll get there someday.

All these calculations and reasoning pale in comparison to ***living and being in the present moment*** for that is what truly matters. And to always keep in mind that my wealth, anything and everything can be taken from me except my character.

Remember (me), regardless of age, time and wealth, always give your best in each and every moment, and always remember to be kind.

Happy birthday. Cheers!

personalfinance,"Update from post from the other day about paying off my debt, growing savings and fixing my withholding.","I posted the other day about wanting to take my savings and pay off my student loans. The consensus was that that was a terrible idea and I needed to focus on my credit card debt immediately.

So I sold most of my individual investments and a large chunk of my employee stock in order to pay down my debt a bit. This has taken me from a total of just over $28k to $22,908.93 spread over three cards as follows:

BOA: $12,000 / 0% until 05/15/20 / 18.99% after
Amex: $4,000 / 0% until 07/28/20 /
Citi: $6,908.93 / 0% until 01/03/21 / 25.99% after

My last remaining student loan is $5,752.86. That is accruing interest at 6.25% but I don‚Äôt HAVE to make any payments until 04/2025. This started out at $35k+ and I made huge payments last year which pushed my payment date out. Haven‚Äôt made payments this year but I do want to knock that out ASAP as soon as I get the credit cards out of the way.

My remaining assets are:
$61,360.82 - 401k
$1,337.69 - Employee Stock
$5,895.23 - Cash Savings (Emergency)

I expect an end of year bonus anywhere from $7k-12k. I also expect a tax return but have gotten different results when I try to estimate what that will be. Which brings me to my income...

I gross $4,038.46 bi-weekly. Taxes are $1,209.74 ($590.90 Fed, $191.65 State, $234.61 OASDI, $130.28 City, $54.87 Medicare, etc). I didn‚Äôt select any withholdings when I filled out my W4 so I know I‚Äôm overpaying but don‚Äôt think by THAT much.

Other pre-tax deductions are $528.96 (401k, med, dental, transit, PTO purchase). Post tax deduction $201.92 for employee stock. So I net $2,097.84 bi-weekly ($4,545.32 monthly).

I estimate my monthly expenses around $2,500.

My plan is to take any extra funds I have and throw them toward the BOA card as the 0% expires first. I think (hope) larger monthly payments along with whatever bonus and tax return I get should be able to take care of that in time. Minimum payments on the other two in the meantime and larger once the BOA payments free up. Then throw everything at the student loan until it‚Äôs gone. Then I can finally save my money.

I guess I just wanted some input on whether that‚Äôs a good plan. Should I worry about/bother beefing my savings up more at the same time or just wait until the debt is gone? And also are my tax withholdings way way off? I‚Äôm single w/no dependents. I know I can figure that part out myself, but based on my last post, people were acting like I was MASSIVELY overpaying. When I used the IRS withholding calculator it said I‚Äôd have a $1,280 overpayment for the year, which is nothing. Am I doing something wrong here?",finance

personalfinance,"No down payment, no equity, but no PMI? Can PMI be ""hidden"" in a higher interest rate?","(I'm not interested in debating the pros and cons of decisions that have already been made. I'm aware that buying a home at a high interest rate with no down payment is generally a poor financial decision.)

We used down payment assistance to purchase our house last spring. Our mortgage loan was $160,500 at 5.625% (ouch) and our ""down payment"" was entirely composed of a secondary loan for $5,500 at 5.5%. We had very little cash savings at that point, so our plan was to pay down the secondary loan as quickly as possible (despite the marginally lower interest rate), then make extra payments on the mortgage to get up to 20% equity, and then refinance to a reasonable rate. The secondary loan is paid off, and all is going to plan so far. We're targeting a refi in January - hopefully rates stay low until then.

My understanding is that PMI is required if your equity is less than 20%, but I am going through our mortgage documents again and it explicitly says that $0 of our monthly payment is for PMI. We do pay $277 per month in ""taxes and insurance"", but that is accounted for in property taxes and homeowners insurance (that insurance amount matches what the insurance company says our policy costs, and the tax amount matches our property tax bill, so PMI isn't being included in that monthly escrow amount).

In doing some research, I've found that SoFi (our lender is not SoFi) doesn't require PMI on 10% down payments, but instead charge a higher interest rate and pay the mortgage insurance themselves. I imagine that something similar is happening with our loan - our credit scores were in the 720s or better at the time of closing, so we certainly could have qualified for a better rate if we had a larger down payment.

So my question is - are we effectively paying PMI for the entirety of the loan if we never refinance? If the lender is paying the mortgage insurance, I'd be surprised if they dropped the interest rate once we hit 20% equity. The plan was always to refi after a couple years, so we were aware (and okay with) getting a raw deal to start out with, but I'm curious about how this all works.",finance

I recently accepted a new job where I'll be required to use a personal vehicle for off road and long distance trips. I'll be carrying surveying equipment so a smaller 4x4 pickup would be ideal. I currently drive my beater saturn ion from high school.

The only problem is that used 4x4 truck prices are insane. I'm getting really stressed about where to go from here. A 3 or 4 year old Chevy Colorado with ~50k miles is basically the same price as brand new. Anything suitable for my needs under $15k has over 100k miles.

I will likely be putting 25k+ miles on the truck a year, with most of those being for work. I need something reliable as I'll be working in very rural areas. I am going to be reimbursed the federal mileage rate for work miles.

I will be making $54k plus my mileage and likely a 10% bonus at the end of the year. I only pay about $550 in rent, which is the majority of my expenses. I have about 17k left in student loans which my parents are helping me with.

personalfinance,Personal saving strategy as a start-up employee in Switzerland (26yo),"Dear all,

I am working for a Swiss start-up company. I have no dependents, although I live with my girlfriend who works full-time. My work setting implies that I earn below average salary (CHF 6-7k) whilst I may reap future capital gains on an equity stake in the company. It naturally also implies a reduced job security.

Considering that the Swiss federal AVS pension fund is experiencing large gaps in funding contributions, I do not want to be adversely impacted by potential pension age extensions or other problems associated to relying on the AVS. See [link](https://www.ubs.com/ch/en/private/pension/information/magazine/2018/pensions-are-falling-despite-no-vote-to-reform.html) for more information.

Facing these circumstances, my aim is to set up my own long-term investment portfolio. Before carrying out any illiquid investments, the high cost of living and reduced job security imply the need for a large cash war chest for rainy days. I have already saved up CHF20k. So far, I am able to save around CHF1500 monthly, in spite of living frugally in one of the country's (and the world's) most expensive cities. I expect to maintain this savings rate the coming year.

Whilst I greatly appreciate any general comments on my situation, I do have two concise questions:

1. Is CHF20k a large enough rainy day fund?
2. What are the most cost-effective instruments to purchase into a long-term portfolio? I am looking into ETFs however the cheapest broker I can find still starts around CHF 7 per order (!).

All the best,

personalfinance,Are debt consolidation loans ever a good idea?,"I am currently using the debt snowball method to pay down about $27,000 in credit card debt, spread out over 8 accounts. The cards have interest rates ranging from 18%-30%. I am prepared to pay $2000 a month to aggressively pay down this debt, which should take roughly 14 months, adding the minimum payment for each paid off account to the $2000 (snowball).

I was pre-approved for a 36 month debt consolidation loan at APR 14.58% with a minimum monthly payment of $872.

My question is, does it make sense to pay off the credit cards using the loan, and then use the $2000 to aggressively pay down the loan balance?

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my own assumptions:

Benefits:

* A single payment per month. Easier to manage.
* Lower interest rate, significantly so for some cards.
* Lower credit usage should increase credit score sooner

Disadvantages:

* I lose out on the snowball effect, where the amount I am able to pay off each month increases as accounts are paid off and the minimum payments become available.
* The minimum payment stays at $872 throughout the life of the loan.

My end goal is to be completely out of debt, build my credit score, and be in a good position to start building wealth.

My instinct is that I should not get a debt consolidation loan and should just pay off the cards 1 at a time. It seems to me the benefit of a better interest rate over 14 months does not make up for the increase in the amount I would be able to pay off each month due to the snowball effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: It was pointed out to me that I have been thinking about this in the wrong way. I forgot to add the amount I am currently paying just to meet the monthly minimums to the total amount I can pay per month. In total, this means I can pay $2846 per month if I consolidate. In this example, consolidating to a lower interest rate will save me tons of money over time, and reduce the time it takes to pay off the debt by a few months.",finance
personalfinance,"More Ally Bank scam calls, be cautious","I saw the posts over the last 1-2 weeks from other Ally bank customers receiving sketchy phone calls and I think I would‚Äôve caught on anyway, but as soon as I got a call from ‚ÄúAlly Bank‚Äù I was suspicious. Given that my suspicions were right, I thought I'd share since there were some contradictions in the recent posts about Ally scam callers.

Basically, early Tuesday morning (3:40 AM) a charge was made on my Ally debit card for around $15 for a Lyft ride. I was sleeping and have never even used Lyft, so it wasn‚Äôt me. I‚Äôm not sure how or where someone got my card information, but it happens and we‚Äôve yet to transition to never using our debit cards. It is what it is. I used the app to turn off my card, but before I could call Ally I received a call from ‚ÄúAlly Bank.‚Äù

A man from ‚Äúthe fraud department‚Äù at Ally asked to confirm he was talking to [MY NAME], I said yes, he asked if I had time to go over fraudulent charges on my account, I told him no and hung up. I then later called Ally, had a new debit card sent out and then was told I‚Äôd have to wait to dispute due to it being a pending charge. An hour later it went through from being pending and two declined charges of around $17 from Lyft showed up. Yay card controls? So I called Ally, started the process to dispute the charge (which was credited to me today and I‚Äôm super impressed how quick they took care of that, just to praise Ally for a moment).

However, I‚Äôve continued receiving calls from ‚ÄúAlly‚Äôs fraud department.‚Äù Most of which I‚Äôve just ignored, or answered and said the same ‚Äúno, I‚Äôll call back.‚Äù

Now, I was pretty sure this Ally guy (same guy called every time) was a scam and was never going to give him information anyway, but some things had me wondering if maybe it was actually Ally trying to talk to me given how persistent it was. Most important thing to note though is that the number he called from was spoofed as the Ally bank customer service number.

Each time I told him that I‚Äôd hang up and call back, I‚Äôd get a ‚Äúoh, no ma‚Äôam no need to call back.

Wanting to verify my suspicions and also let Ally know about the situation, I called their line today to confirm it wasn‚Äôt them calling and‚Ä¶ yep, it wasn‚Äôt them. The calls I‚Äôd been receiving were in fact someone impersonating Ally. Who apparently knew about the odd Lyft charge on my account and may have been connected to it (or it was a real crazy coincidence).

Just figured I‚Äôd share this so people are aware to be cautious - of course, you really shouldn‚Äôt ever give information to anyone on an incoming call. Live by that rule. Hang up and call your bank. Even if you know you have fraudulent or suspicious account activity, even if they keep calling over and over - don‚Äôt talk to them. Just call back. If it is legit, it won‚Äôt be an issue.

---

TL;DR Had a charge to my card that wasn‚Äôt mine, handled the dispute by calling Ally and they confirmed they never contacted me, got 6 calls over 3 days spoofed to be from ‚ÄúAlly Bank‚Äù saying it was their fraud department, confirmed with real Ally that they weren't contacting me. **Moral of Story: Don't give information on incoming calls, even if you know you have fraudulent/suspicious account activity. Just call the known number for your bank/the number on the back of your card.**

**Edit to add:** Figure I'll take a moment to remind everyone reading this to talk to your family and friends (especially those that are elderly as they're the most susceptible) about scam calls, emails, etc. and teach them to have a healthy suspicion. Taking some time with them can save a lot of suffering and it is the best way to combat this stuff.",finance

personalfinance,Question on whether to refinance,"I was looking into refinancing my townhouse and wanted to know if you all thought it was worth it. I bought my townhouse Dec. 2017 for $173k. Using the Colorado Housing program I was able to only put down 3% and I didnt have to pay mortgage insurance BUT it meant taking a slightly higher interest rate of 4.25% fixed on 30 year loan. So I was looking into the refinancing because the townhouse has appreciated to about $225k so the whole mortgage insurance wouldn't be an issue anymore. My current loan amount is $160k. I went to lending tree just to see and I got a call back from one of the lenders who offered  Rate 3.250%//APR	3.497%//$6,073 for closing cost/etc. They can roll those costs into the new loan.  To me it seems like a good deal as I would be saving about $100 on my monthly payment, would save a bunch of interest over the life of the loan. Yes I would have to pay that $6,073 but it seems like over the life of the loan it would be a much bigger savings. My credit score is 820+ if that makes any difference.",finance
personalfinance,"Someone Tell Me If My Idea Is Bad - Regina, SK, Canada","So I took on a car loan that feels... suffocating. I was told by my salesman that if I felt that the payments were too high, we could get me into something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, fast forward 9 months, and I'm paying $800 a month for a car that is NOT worth that. I have about 20k in negative equity after the valuation a dealership gave me, and the salesman that sold me the car can't get me into anything to lower my payments.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to start saving for a house, and this payment will not only kill my ability to save, but also stop my eligibility for a mortgage. So, I've come up with a plan. For extra details, keep in mind that I have a family and take my kids to daycare every day (about 3 blocks away), and I put on about 30km of travel per day between work and home (both ways). My car loan right now is at roughly $42k, and my car was valued by the dealership at $23,500. (Subprime lending, woo. Worst mistake I've ever made)

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

\- Take my car to a dealership or sell it privately.

\- Go to my bank and take out a loan or get a line of credit to pay off whatever negative equity there is. I've been approved for a loan that would pay off my current loan in full, but that was at a higher interest rate than I'm paying right now (13.5% vs 10.99%), though I'm sure I could get a lower interest rate on a lower amount.

\- Take a little bit more money and get like a $2k Cobalt or something to putz myself around the city. I don't need something that looks great, or something fast, I just need cheap and reliable. I also work at a scrap yard, so a common car like a Dodge Caravan or a Cobalt means I've got literal TONS of parts to pick from if something breaks, so maintenance is nothing to worry about.

\- Continue making my $800/mth payments towards this loan that's effectively been sliced in half, with a lower interest payment. Running the numbers through an early payoff calculator, a $23,000 loan at 7.99% paid at $800 per month, even as a 5 year loan to start, will be paid off in 38 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

The plan seems pretty ironclad to me. I get out of this insane car payment, cut my loan in half, and I can pay it out and get a home within the next couple years (I have a secondary saving plan going on that's completely unrelated to this situation).

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone PLEASE poke some holes in my plan so I no longer consider it? My current car is a 2017 with low KM and in great shape still, so I know it'll be an easy sell.",finance

My interest rate is around 4 percent. If I pay off the car early I'll save between $3,000-$3,500 over the course of those 48 months.

I want to pay to pay off the car because it will save me the payment each month ($339 per month) and I will not have to pay the interest. A few reasons I DON'T want to pay off the car is that I don't exactly feel comfortable shelling out 15 grand. I will still have plenty in savings to cover myself even after paying the car off. It's just the idea of paying $15,000 in one shot that scares me a bit. Second reason I don't want to pay it off is that I heard that it hurts your credit if you pay off a car loan early.

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin really Scarce?,"I saw a post here the other day, where a guy asked some very valid questions about Bitcoin, and one of them got really stuck in my head. Not only for the nature of the question, but also, because some of the replies he got, really made me question BTC.

The guy asked about how is the increasingly scarcity of BTC not a problem. 

Given that there's a finite amount of BTC to be minded, and that some of it will eventually get lost (either by negligence or by the death of BTC owners) wouldn't that make BTC so scarce that it will be actually less useful?

The thing that intrigued me the most was the answer someone gave. This person said that in the case that most BTC is lost, we could just use a smaller unit of measure that the sat, since BTC is not a physical asset we can divide it infinitely.

Now that freaked the shit out of me, because we went from a hugely scarce asset to a potentially infinite one. I mean what's the difference between a federal bank printing lots of money and people just creating potentially infinite smaller denomination of BTC.

Is that possible? If so, how is it even possible given that BTC is decentralised, I mean, who decides what the smaller denomination of BTC will be?

personalfinance,"I‚Äôm 28, should I cash out my $19,500 IRA to pay off my $16,000 credit card debt?","I am 28, and have been a financial idiot for many years now. I have racked up $16,000 in credit card debt. From what I understand, this is a common mistake for someone my age. I‚Äôve been lucky to have been paying into a Simple IRA through work for the last 5 years, and have about $19,500 so far. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm crazy to consider taking my IRA money and paying off my heavy interest rate credit cards (all are 20-25% interest).

Some info on my IRA situation:
- I started by putting in 3% - company I work for matched that for entire 5 year span
- Moved to putting in 6% two years ago
- We are being switched from IRA to 401k due to the company growing (which is why I started considering this so seriously)
- Going forward, the company will match 4.5% on up to 9% put in (so I feel like I can get aggressive about saving if I clear my debt)

Things I have already considered going into this endeavor:
- Aware of 10% penalty from IRS for taking money early, before the retirement age, I think they have set to 59 (essentially $2,000 penalty)
- Aware I will be taxed on it at the end of the year - I would be taxed on it at any point when I took it out so that‚Äôs a wash IMO (additionally, I can have them give the tax value to the IRS when removing it from my account)
- With these penalties and costs of taking the money out, I will be just short of fully paying off my credit cards if I take out my full $19,500 value 
- Yes, I have considered debt consolidation options. Most things are similar interest rates to what I am already paying on my credit cards, if not more.
- I also have owned a home for the last two years. From what I can tell, I am not eligible for refinancing this early, and I have not paid off enough to get a home equity loan.
- I used to be good about paying off my CC‚Äôs as I got my charges, was on top of it for two years (maybe 6 to 7 years ago). I have faith I could get back to those habits, but honestly would prefer to not even have a CC for a while after this. 
- I briefly got into better habits while maintaining a tracked budget, but certain expenses increased over the last two years, and my payments became less aggressive. Additionally, I fell out of maintaining the for about a year, and have just made an update and change to how I track my money and my spending (albeit, too little too late).",finance
MachineLearning,[N] Announcing the xView 2 Prize Challenge: Assess Building Damage,"https://i.redd.it/6h9ydxj644i31.jpg

When disaster strikes, speed is critical. The time it takes to properly assess damage in the wake of a major event can be the difference between life and death. However, emergency responders must often navigate disruptions to local communication and transportation infrastructure, making accurate assessments dangerous, difficult, and slow. While satellite and aerial imagery offer a less risky alternative that covers more ground, analysts must still conduct manual, time-intensive assessments of images.

The [Defense Innovation Unit](https://www.diu.mil/)‚Äôs (DIU‚Äôs) xView2 Challenge (Challenge) seeks to automate post-disaster damage assessment. DIU is challenging machine learning experts to develop computer vision algorithms that will speed up analysis of satellite and aerial imagery by localizing and categorizing various types of building damage caused by natural disasters. The xView2 Challenge is DIU‚Äôs second prize competition focused on furthering innovation in computer vision for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) efforts. This year‚Äôs competition builds upon the xView1 Challenge, which sought out computer vision algorithms to locate and identify distinct objects on the ground useful to first responders.

‚ÄúDIU‚Äôs goal in hosting this Challenge is to enlist the global community of machine learning experts to tackle a critically hard problem: detecting key objects in overhead imagery in context and assessing damage in a disaster situation,‚Äù said Mike Kaul, DIU AI Portfolio Director.

‚ÄúWe are always looking for ways to improve rapid damage assessment to ensure we and our partners deliver the right resources to the right places at the right time, and we are confident the DIU Challenge can contribute to that goal,‚Äù said FEMA Regional Administrator Robert Fenton, a partner in the Challenge.

DIU led a team of experts from academia and industry to create a new dataset, xBD, to enable both localization and damage assessment before and after disasters. The dataset will provide the foundation for the Challenge. While several open datasets for object detection from satellite imagery already exist (e.g. SpaceNet, [xView 1](http://xviewdataset.org/)), each represent only a single snapshot in time and lack information about the type and severity of damage following a disaster. xBD is currently the largest and most diverse annotated building damage dataset, allowing ML/AI practitioners to generate and test models to help automate building damage assessment. The open source electro-optical imagery (0.3 m resolution) xBD dataset will encompass \~544,556 building annotations across \~19,520 square kilometers of freely available imagery from multiple countries\*. Six disaster types are included: wildfire, landslides, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes/tsunamis, and wind and flooding damage (\*more data are being added to xBD as the labeling becomes available).

There are three competition prize tracks for the xView2 Challenge:

1. **Open source.** Teams compete for leaderboard position and awards for top scores. By releasing their models publicly under a permissive open source license, teams also become eligible for an additional open source award.
2. **Non-exclusive Government purpose rights.** Teams grant government purpose rights to become eligible for awards or top scores on the leaderboard. Solutions can be used to help future disaster recovery efforts.
3. **Evaluation Only.** Teams retain IP and only grant rights to benchmark their solution and compete for leaderboard position. Top teams in this category will still be eligible for a special monetary prize pool for their submissions.

The best solutions for all three categories will be eligible for a share of a $150,000 prize purse. Top solvers will also be invited to present their work at the December NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on AI for HADR. Winners of any cash prize will be considered eligible to be awarded follow-on work with the Department of Defense. The competition will start in September 2019 and run through November 2019.

Findings will be applied in both operational and academic use cases that include, but are not limited to: obstructed roads, rerouting across obstructed roads, force of nature identification, resource allocation decision-making, object recognition, and object identification . Baseline models, developed collaboratively between DIU and Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Software Engineering Institute, will be publicly available as a starting point for the Challenge. In addition to advancing the state of the art in damage assessment, it is envisioned that the xBD dataset will provide researchers, companies, and other groups with the means and motive to develop algorithms that bring humanitarian assistance and disaster response into the age of AI.

The Challenge‚Äôs partners represent a first-of-its-kind coalition between the artificial intelligence and disaster response communities including NASA Earth Science Disasters Program, Federal Emergency Management Agency‚Äôs Region 9, California Governor‚Äôs Office of Emergency Services (CAL OES), California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), California Guard, DoD‚Äôs Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, Carnegie Mellon ‚Äòs Software Engineering Institute, the United States Geological Service, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN).

Additional details about the dataset can be found at ([CVPR 2019 xBD Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/cv4gc/Gupta_Creating_xBD_A_Dataset_for_Assessing_Building_Damage_from_Satellite_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf)) which was first discussed at the IEEE CVPR in June .

I'm active military and bought a 190k house last summer on a VA loan. I planned to stay in it for 3 years, but I came down on orders to move in spring of 2020 for a 6 month school. After the school I will move to my final duty station, after which I won't move again.

**Financials**:

*Home*: I'll owe 184k at moving time, projected sale price is 195k - 205k. Loan is in my name only. Mortgage is 1130/mo. Expected rental value is 1200/mo on the low end. I know I would pay out of pocket monthly if I rented it out.

*My income*: 5850/mo taxable, 2000/mo non-taxable (military). 

*My debt*: none beyond current home loan.

*Wife's income*: 5000/month taxable (RN).

*Wife's debt*: 30k car loan.

*Combined assets*: 20k saved. 5k cash, 3k individual stocks. 12k index funds. Currently net green on index, slightly red on stocks. Potentially another 30k cash in play if she puts her graduate degree on hold. We will both be saving between now and then, but I'm not putting that in play right now.

*Retirement*: 

Me - 7% contribution, additional 5% matched. 

Her 5%, 5% matched.

Both credit scores are above 750. We are mid 20s with credit history beginning at 18.

**Goal**: 

Buy a forever home near her family in early 2021. Expected price between 450k and 600k. Location will be permanent, and we will continue in our current careers for the foreseeable future. Don't factor in that the military might move me, because it won't due to the job I will be filling.

Is it feasible to have both mortgages out at the same time? I know VA limits are going away in 2020, but I'm concerned we won't be able to absorb that much debt at an acceptable interest rate.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

By my calculations, if I stay the course with my current monthly payment of $1,908 the loan would be paid off in roughly 21.5 years with a total interest of about $162,500.

I can refinance with my current company to a 15 year fixed rate mortgage at 3.125% interest for $2,300 per month (principal and interest), so a real increase of about $400 month from what I'm paying now. By my calc this would result in about $84,000 in interest, so a potential interest savings of $78,500 over my current mortgage. The cost to do the refinance would be fairly minimum as they are offering $500 refinances, and since it is with the same company they do not need to do the extensive and expensive title work and other traditional fees.

The increase of $400 is very doable for us, and I would be happy to pay off the mortgage in a shorter overall term then I currently have. Both my wife and I are contributing up to the match for 401k from our respective employers, but we're not contributing to our IRAs at this time, although I am hopeful/expect that even with the new mortgage payment, we could still max them out this year.

EDIT: we also have a fully funded emergency savings account as well. I've largely followed all steps in the Prime Directive up to this point.

Is there anything I'm missing here? would love to hear any thoughts/opinions.

personalfinance,"My daughters bank account was hacked, what to do?","My adult daughter just called to say that her bank account was hacked (or more correctly, socially engineered), and her checking and savings accounts drained.  Someone called her (with a spoofed TD Bank caller-ID) to inquire about certain transactions that she confirmed she had not made.  They then got her online account username and somehow got the 2-factor authentication code for login generated and sent to her by text, which she unfortunately gave them over the phone.  Next thing she knows is the account balances are zero.  She has spoken to TD to report this fraud and they have told her that they will put the money back in her account but it will take a week or more to do so.  I am concerned that the perpetrator had sufficient info about her (that she had a TD Bank account, how to reach her by phone, etc.), and I am wondering what steps she should take to prevent further fraud, identity theft.

 I told her to ask TD Bank fraud unit if they file a police report or whether she needs to do this herself.  I also showed her how to lock down her credit with the 3 reporting bureaus.  Anything else she needs to do?  Thanks",finance

worldpolitics,"HK people are fighting for freedom, democracy and autonomy, not just for ours but also yours.","Dear free world,

&amp;#x200B;

HK people are fighting for freedom, democracy and autonomy, not just for ours but also yours.

&amp;#x200B;

As you may know, the protest in Hong Kong reached the 11th weeks without any sign of cooling down, youth in Hong Kong have written their testaments before peaceful protest and are prepared to be killed by the brutal police of Hong Kong. They are prepared to use their lives to wake the free world up, to make the free world understand one inconvenient truth: Chines Communist Party (‚ÄúCCP‚Äù) the authoritarian government is initiating a New Cold War against the free world.

&amp;#x200B;

You might thought: it is just China‚Äôs local business, not ours! But you are wrong, CCP is attempting to use money to buy up influences among nations, mute their voices against CCP, so that CCP can exploit the international rules to do its bidding. Hong Kong is just the front line of the struggle, and the example when the fight was lose out of your indifference.

&amp;#x200B;

Take Australia as an example, in the book ‚ÄúSilent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia‚Äù by Clive Hamilton, it is revealed that wealthy Chinese businessmen linked to CCP had become the largest donors to both major Australian political parties. CCP is trying to buy up your local politicians so that they can spread their corrupted way to your country and turn your politician system into their pawns. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Siri Lanka, under the Belt and Road Initiative, the local corrupted politicians controlled the nation to borrow money from China with high interest rate to build a port which is of no benefit to the local populations, then as the Siri Lanka Government failed to repay the debt (as expected), Siri Lanka has to handing over the port to China. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are just too many examples to list out, to name just a few more:

1.	Huawei, Xiaomei and other Chinese based phone companies have backdoors in their phone and send your personal information to China, so that they can exploit them to threaten key personale in your country to kneel;

2.	The management of Cathy Pacific and HSBC were forced to resign, as they failed to suppress the voice of their staffs in the movement, and they are now inserting their pawns to these British owned companies to cleanse the supporters of the movement. Just as we speak, some staffs have been fired only because they showed support to the movement in facebook. Buying up the shares of your company, then force your company to do their bidding, mute the voice of people through their jobs, this is the classic CCP way of infiltration;

3.	The Chinese consulates and Confucius Institutes have been well known to be spy bases to organize Chinese people to disrupt any protests in your countries, send death threats and assault people who does not support CCP.

4.	CCP through ‚Äú1,000 Talents Plan‚Äù attempted to steal advanced technologies by bribing the researchers. 

5.	CCP have been caught buying twitter accounts and facebook accounts to spread fake news in an organized and massive way.

&amp;#x200B;

From the above, you would have no difficulty in seeing that, as an authoritarian regime, the thing it fear most is to let its subject knows what freedom, democracy and autonomy truly means. Thus in order to protect its ruling, it will instinctively attempt to subvert and compromise your countries‚Äô political system, until the word freedom, democracy and autonomy becomes a distant tale and your country becomes its subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

In short, it is a new cold war, if you don‚Äôt fight, you will be beaten and defeated and fallen into CCP‚Äôs subjects. 

&amp;#x200B;

You may ask, ‚Äúwhat can I do? I am not in Hong Kong and I have no stake in Hong Kong!‚Äù You are correct, but you have your vote in your country, you can write to your local politician to tell that to beware of the Chinese‚Äôs plot, impose strict control to Chinese spying activities and restrict CCP funded buy-out to important companies, if they turn a blind eye to it or were even compromised, you can vote them out! 

&amp;#x200B;

You can also stop buying Chinese products, every penny you spent to the Chinese products are used to fund the authoritarian regime, helping it to build concentration camp for the Muslims in XianJian, to fund its Surveillance project and the black-mirror style Social Credit System, to fund the weapon which may well be used against you and your next generations.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also support your countries‚Äô politicians to impose sanctions to those individuals and their families who disregard human rights and force CCP to obey international trade and human right rules. You can stop your countries from selling weapons to Hong Kong and China which is used to toxify, wound and kill the youths.

&amp;#x200B;

Freedom is not free, your grandparents well understand this and fought against the Nazi regime and the Soviet regime with blood. You don‚Äôt need to bleed as your ancestors did, you just need to use your votes and money to tell your country to do the right thing, to stop the authoritarian China from growing to a size which is too big to be fought.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not just a fight for Hong Kong people, but also your fight. Join this fight when it is still a easy fight so that your next generation doesn‚Äôt have to fight with blood.",finance

personalfinance,"Father ran up credit card in my name, destroyed my credit. What can I do?","Hi Everyone, 

When I was 18 my father and I opened a credit card for me at a credit union to help build my credit. Originally, I thought it was my father's card that I was an authorized user on. However, I recently found out that it was solely my card, that he does not appear on whatsoever. I have never had the physical card in my possession, nor have I used it. The idea was that he would use it and pay it down every month to develop my credit. 

I only became more financially literate within the last few years, and when I pulled my credit report I saw that the balance on this card was nearly maxed ($3500), and he had missed a payment here and there that hurt my credit. He ran up the card years ago, and has been making monthly payments, but the balance has remained high. My dad's line of work has not been doing well these last few years, and he's been struggling financially recently. This month he not only went over the credit limit on the card, but he also missed a payment. This tanked my already low credit score 80 points, and brought me down to 588. His credit was not affected, because he is not on the card. 

I called the credit union to explain my situation, but there doesn't seem to be anything I can do besides getting a new card issued to me so that he no longer has access. I can't report the charges as fraud, because I would have to file a police report against my father, which I'm not willing to do. 

My mother-in-law is of the opinion that I can go to the credit union and either try to get the card transferred over to him (which I don't think is a thing?), or to negotiate the balance on the card to a lower amount that I can pay, and then close the card. Is that an actual possibility?

Do I have any options in this situation besides either waiting for my father to pay down the balance, or paying off the card myself? I had wanted to get off this card (when I thought I was only an authorized user) and raise my credit so that I could refinance my private student loans and my car loan, which are at horrible interest rates (9%, 10%, and 11.2%, respectively). I will also need to rent an apartment next year, and I don't think I can do so on my own with such abysmal credit. 

I sincerely appreciate any advice anyone can offer. I'm extremely frustrated and feel trapped in this situation.",finance

personalfinance,Confused how mortgage and interest work,"Hi there!

While looking at redfin houses, I started to look at the mortgage calculator they have built into the app. I was trying to play around with some numbers and I think there is something I am missing here... Let's assume the following example:

I borrow $200k at an interest rate of 3.875%. according to Redfin, the principal and interest payment for 30 years is $940.

Here is where I start my confusion...

If I do $940 x 12 months x 30 years, the total is $338,400.

Is it right that if you borrow $200k you end up paying over $130k just in interest? (Around 69% more from the initial $200k)

I was playing around with other figures and the amount you end up paying is even more lol.

personalfinance,Down payment - Which loan should I choose?,"I have 2 loans

Car loan - $59,000 - 10 years - 0.25% for 3 more years, then 3.5% for the remaining 7 years.
None of the interest rates are fixed.

There is room in my economy to pay more than the minimum down payment on these loans but I am not sure which loan I should focus the extra down payment towards.

After the low interest rate on the car is up I am likely going to merge the remaining car loan in to the mortgage.

I am leaning towards focusing on the mortgage, but if for some reason the market value of my apartment goes down drastically due to unforeseen circumstances I won‚Äôt be able to merge the loans and will be stuck paying high interest on the car loan.

personalfinance,Cosigning student loan and home buying question,"My sister in law is in her last year of college. After FAFSA she is $6,000 short of what she needs for the entire year. Normally, my father in law takes out a parent plus loan for the remainder but was denied this year.  

She spoke with financial aid, who said they can extend another 3,000 in federal loans, but she will be 3,000 short still. She cannot afford the payment plan for the remaining 3,000 as she has other bills including car insurance and the car payment. Sister in law has asked my husband to cosign the parent plus loan.   


We fully understand that by cosigning we are agreeing to pay the loan if she does not pay it back (she will assume payments instead of father in law). However, we would like to buy a house in the near distant future. If we did purchase a house it would be at the earliest in 2 years (6 months remaining on lease with our intention to resign another 18 month lease). We both currently have student loans of our own, mine at roughly 50,000 and his at 18,000. He is still in school so he will continue to take our loans for the next 2 years, meaning this $6,000 cosign wouldn't be the most recent loan on his report when it comes time to buy. 


Essentially, I am wondering how an additional $6,000 would affect our chances at purchasing a home. I know it's difficult to say since we aren't actively looking so I don't have an amount in mind to be approved for. Naively, I would assume that 6,000 wouldn't hurt too much since we would otherwise have a significant amount of debt, but want to be fully informed before making a decision.",finance

personalfinance,Will a Traditional to Roth IRA conversion count as income?,"Long backstory:
I quit my job in June 2018 to travel for a few months with the plan to come back and find another job in the fall (I'm a software engineer then based in SF, so there are many opportunities). However, while traveling I got a concussion and am still recovering. As a result I haven't been able to work since June 2018 and have been living off savings (plus the good fortune of having a supportive family and partner + relatively cheap rent). 

In January 2019 I switched to a fairly expensive Covered CA health insurance plan as I was planning to have foot surgery and the more expensive plan worked out best cost-wise when factoring in the surgery. I assumed that I would get some money back through the Premium Tax Credit, but I didn't realize that this only kicks in if you make 100-400% of the federal poverty level. Based on the rate that I'm recovering from my head injury, it seems unlikely that I'll be able to work again before the year is out - and thus I won't hit 100% of the poverty level. I'm also not eligible for Medicaid as I have too much in assets, but AFAIK this is irrelevant for the premiums I've already paid for my plan through Covered CA. 

My actual question:
If I convert some of my Traditional IRA money into a Roth IRA, will this count as income in such a way that it'll push me over that magic 100% of the federal poverty level number? I was planning to do some of this conversion anyways this year as my income will hopefully not be this low (ie $0) in a future year. If so, does it work the same as regular income? For example, if I need $12,500 income to cross that threshold, can I convert exactly $12,500 from a Trad IRA into a Roth IRA (or my former employer's traditional 401k into my rollover Roth IRA)? 

TL;DR: 
Concussion has kept me from working for the past year, but I need to hit the federal poverty level to qualify to get some money back for my health insurance. Can a Traditional to Roth conversion help me raise my income enough to qualify?",finance

I have about $5,000 in savings from working summer jobs, and I have no incentive to spend that money until after college. 

I recently applied for a scholarship from the US Bank. One of the requirements was going through a course study that opened my eyes to different types of investments, such as TIPS or Certificate of Deposits. I learned about each type of investment very briefly, but not enough to actually understand whether or not I should invest. 

So I have a few questions: Which type investment or bond would be the best for me? I know I just want to throw the money into a bank account, then let it sit for a few years as it accrues interest. A 5 year time span would be the best option.

And another question: Will a recession affect my savings if I choose to invest? I previously wanted to invest into a CD with a local credit union since they had a high APY.

I have a 403b account from my old employer with Valic/AIG that has around $14,000 in it. When I called a few minutes ago to get my online login information, the service agent informed me my current rate of return this year was 21%. Which sounds really good...? They asked about my employment and if I was going to rollover the account, which I didn't know what they were talking about so I brought my confusion here! Yay.

My big questions, which is a better choice for me? do I leave the 14k where it is with Valic/AIG or transfer it into a different account? And if I transfer it, which account: my current employer's Vanguard 403b (current employer matches 5% AFTER a year, I have only been here a month) OR my own retirement account I can start through my bank or maybe even Vanguard ...?

more details on my own finances:

* Income: $65,000
* monthly expenses: $1,750
* old 403b: $14,000
* current 403b Vanguard target fund 2050: 1st deposit of 300 starts next week (i'm paid monthly)

* Capital One: $12,865.53 ; 22.05%

* Private loan: $14,250 ; 6% interest
* Student Fed Loans: $36,800 ; deferment until 4/2020

My first task is going to be to build up my savings to 1k, then I am going to tackle my debt with my lowest balance first. My credit cards are 3-4 months past due so I will be catching up.

States will be peacefully formatted into the Confederation of the United Nations, while maintaining their independence:

\-The judicial system (in its area of jurisdiction);

\-Legislative system;

\-Governance with its own economic and migration policies;

At the same time, the global government should carry out international functions:

\-Stabilizing (international dispute resolution, financial assistance and sanctions, internet and payment systems)

\-Regulatory (development of international law, standardization, international transport projects, space industry)

\-Preservation (combating financial fraud, illegal migration, terrorism and international crime, environmental pollution)

If a State is formatted into such a confederation, it shall transfer its international jurisdiction through its own legislative branch.

**Domestic structure:**

General Council - heads of member states (USA, China, Russia, France, Great Britain) or their deputies, and additional four representatives of the assembly. Decisions are taken unanimously.

\-creates laws and declarations;

\-creates policies and programs;

\-recommends the Secretary General;

General Assembly - consists of heads of member states or their permanent deputies. Has relevant committees. Decisions are taken by a majority.

\-Approves laws and declarations;

\-Approves policies and programmes;

\-Appoints a general secretary;

\-Appoints representatives to the General Council;

All activities are public.

Confederation Secretariat - the tasks of the Secretariat shall include implementation of the adopted policies and programs. It has relevant offices and departments. The Secretary General calls on the staff of the Secretariat, consisting of the members of the MI, to enter the drawing of lots, for a period of up to one year.

Meritocratic Institute (MI) is a decentralized association, outside the state, consisting of specialists in basic human activity profiles, selected for entry of multistage professional competitions, repeated every year, the size of the pool is unlimited. The process and results of the tests are public.

Independent organizations, consisting of specialists elected for a year, by profile, by lot from among the members of the MI: International Court of Justice, International Bank, International Police, etc.

Receiving income from the taxation of international economic activity in national currencies, using them as an equivalent of the sold goods as funding for the issue of common terrestrial currency, which can be used on an equal footing with national currencies. The estimated annual budget is currently available at $2.9 trillion, for blockchain technology and as transparent as possible online.

A condition of this concept is that the permanent members of the United Nations with the right of veto will be able to reach an agreement in the name of the security and well-being of their peoples, creating a third force - an arbiter, an earthly government. And also, in order not to fight each other, but to unite in the described framework, and thus unite other countries for the universal goals of sustainable development.

**Current policy:**

The whole earthly government, through diplomacy and national referendums, will gradually implement the following policies in order to increase social stability and general welfare:

**In the sphere of economy, the ""Moderate Capitalism"" policy, which is aimed at**

1. Increase of taxes on material assets exceeding the established limits for any physical and commercial legal entities. (The reasonable limit is to present the property as conditional $ 1-100 million - the essence is that this side-chapel should include any local small business - snack barn, small factory, farm, IT office, research laboratory, gas station... etc.)
2. Large private property, such as a logistics network, a trademark, can be a cluster property - belong to the board of owners;
3. The established maximum margin for this or that business, including the chain manufacturer - consumer.
4. Relevant specialists and teams working on this property should participate in the management of public property;
5. There is a need for an established minimum rate of return for each employee in accordance with the specialty, regardless of whether they are private or public property;

**In the field of environment, the ""Protection and Recovery"" policy, aimed at:**

1. Rational consumption and processing of resources on a global scale;
2. cleaning the environment and maintaining biodiversity;
3. Creation of large, partially isolated from people, but interconnected nature reserves of all-natural zones;
4. Replacement of the underground above-ground infrastructure, creation of green, pedestrian and bicycle zones instead;
5. Greenery with solar panels of the Sahara Desert;

**In the sphere of international migration, the ""Sovereign Law"" policy aimed at:**

1. the limits and conditions for receiving migrants are determined by the nation-states.
2. The conditions for obtaining full or limited national citizenship are determined by the nation-states.
3. the right to visit any country for up to 30 days per year, with full reservation of residence and departure.
4. Protection of national states against illegal migration by the United Nations Confederation as well as by national states.
5. Organization of voluntary migration and labour camps with full respect for human rights. (When suppressing illegal migration, a person is faced with a choice - a camp, or return to the country of origin, until there is a permit for migration by limit and condition, to this or that country)

investing,Intentional devaluation of the US dollar on the horizon?,"In an open letter from Wall Street economist Steven Ricchiuto to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a dollar devaluation to save the economy is what‚Äôs being demanded of the Fed.

Ricchiuto wrote the following: ‚ÄúThe key to breaking out of this deflationary downward spiral of interest rates is to target inflation by expanding the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet ‚Äî in other words, print money. This bold action will keep the domestic economy from being pulled down the hole in which both Europe and Japan find themselves ‚Äî that of negative, long-term interest rates.‚Äù

Trump tweeted this: So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....

If the Fed raises the rates then as i understand with the current corporate debt, pension funds and baby boomers will ultimately be taking a massive loss. This sell-off from pension funds could ultimately trigger a market sell-off.

worldpolitics,A MESSAGE FOR ALL LEFTISTS --- http://caliphofgod.org/MESSAGE-FOR-LEFTISTS/ ---,"### ¬†IT IS MY HOPE THAT MY WORDS ARE NOT IN VAIN, for most of you ¬†know full well of what I speak, and that is that there is something terribly wrong with our society, our government, our legal system, our monetary system, and while most of you feel this, few actually understand it, or know why it is so important that they take the time to understand it, but it is only by understanding a problem, that you can properly deal with and solve a serious¬†problem.

### WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

### The problem is that we as human beings, should be free, free to live as we choose, do as we please so long as we do no harm or infringe on the rights and freedoms of any other people. ¬†AND WE CANNOT, because we are forced by the system to live lives where everything we do is considered commerce. ¬†¬†¬†We go to work, commerce, we drive registered vehicles, commerce, we¬†have licences, commerce, permits, commerce, and a vast array of benefits from the federal government and it's affiliated organizations which all add up to being involved in commerce. ¬†

### IS YOUR WORLD SUPPOSED TO REVOLVE AROUND MONEY??? ¬†¬†DEBTS?? ¬†AND PAYING THOSE DEBTS?

### ¬†IS THAT NATURAL?

### ¬†IS THAT FAVORABLE?

### IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY, our government wasn't always ruled by big money, and corporations did not own the news media, and we were not all enslaved to debt, paying ridiculous amounts for CHEAP houses made of wood.

### ¬† ¬†We have all been enslaved to USURY which is profits on lending for¬†bankers and loan sharks, and if you take the time to THINK ABOUT IT, USURY is what you should and must all fight against, because it is the cause of the police state, the drug war, and your enslavement to endless debts. ¬†¬†

### ¬†LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO SET YOURSELVES FREE.

\----------------------------------------------------------

¬† ¬† **This boils down to a simple story, because the characters may change but the story stays the same, unless we change it.**

¬† ¬† **LONG AGO, early man wandered around in loose family groups who ran about scavaging, but over time, eventually ¬†some men realized that if they could control a resource with force and violence that they could force others to trade and barter for that resource and as such they could become technically rich by forcing all the wild humans to collect things they wanted in trade for whatever resource they controlled, be it a wonderful food, or clean water source.**¬†

¬† ¬† **Eventually those who are** ***willing to hurt people and use force*** **realized that barter is not a great way to rule over a people, and that if they created a money system, based on something scarce they can control, like Gold, then they could force people to work to make Gold, which they would then need to pay rent, buy food, and pay taxes, otherwise, those with WEAPONS WHO ARE WILLING TO USE FORCE, will burn down their home, kill their children, take their food and assets and then in the end if they refuse to pay their taxes and use GOLD, then they die. ¬† ¬†THIS IS HOW KINGDOMS OF MEN¬†GOT STARTED... FORCE.**

¬† ¬† **THEN with money in place, and having the people (fooled)¬†convinced of it's value, the KINGS could then set up a tax based economy, where the people were subjects, based on force of arms, arms paid for with Gold controlled by the King, using Taxes to rob all the people of 50% or more of their productive value. ¬†OVER TIME, issues arise, such as price issues, and so the KING then is able to establish price controls since he owns half the sheep and half the wood, and half the chickens and half the production of all things, he can then say to the people, THIS IS THE PRICE OF GOODS... ITEM BY ITEM, and then if a seller wanted to charge too much and¬†rob people, the buyer could simply go to the king and buy the same product, sheep, wool, fruit, whatever at the KINGS PRICE, and in this way, the KING justifies his position by pretending he is regulating the market and prices to protect the people, when in fact he uses swords and force and murder to force the people to trade in Gold and coin he controls so that he can tax them, and enslave them all as owned subjects who work for him, and who's profits ¬† MOSTLY ¬†all go to him.**

¬† ¬† **Then again over time, when¬†you have an economy you discover the need for lending, and realize that USURY, which is lending for profits, and with interest payments, is the ultimate way to enslave your people to serve you as KING because by being the lender, the KING could profit off of all ventures taken up by the labors of his people. ¬†Every baker, every woodsman, every farmer, every craftsman could be made to take loans to buy goods, and get items they need to work and live, such as land and food (BECAUSE THE KING CONTROLS PRICES), and such a KING could in this way drain every last penny of profit possible beyond taxation, and so maximize their profit. ¬†IT WAS IN THIS WAY, using USURY that the Egyptians built the pyramids. ¬†They took all the gains and profits from their economies with USURY and taxes, to fund the vast and never ending projects of grandure to serve the over lords who ruled and wanted to live in these extreme levels of grandure, palaces, temples, and insane over the top Pyramids to house their¬†dead bodies.**

¬† ¬† ¬†**Moses understood this, having grown up as an Egyptian nobleman next to the soon to be Pharoah, and once he set his people free he set forth as GODS LAW, that USURY is forbidden. for he knew that was how the few Egyptians enslaved the many and took advantage of them all to fund the building of TOWERS OF POWER for the few KINGS who used USURY to enslave their people. ¬†SO MOSES SET FORTH USURY LAWS, for the Jewish people, who are not allowed to use lending to profit off each other, and the charging of¬†interest for loans was strictly forbidden. ¬†THE REASON WAS that in this way, all lending between Jews would only be to help each other, instead of robbing each other. ¬†THIS ALLOWED THE JEWISH PEOPLE, to rise together as a profitable people who only charged interest of non-jews, and as such money can only flow into the peoples hands from outside, and all that money cannot be drained into the hand of one JEWISH LENDER who robs all his brothers. ¬†THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF BROTHERHOOD, where God says it is ungodly to profit off of loans to a brother. ¬†Because money is a fake thing, invented for the purpose of enslaving others to force and control of resources. ¬† A FAMILY, UNDER GOD, would not rob each other, profit off each other, but instead would work together, help each other rise and prosper, so that together as a group they share a mutual development plan and shared destiny of shared gains.¬† ¬† ¬†THE SIMPLE FAMILY SHARING CONCEPT.**

¬† ¬† ¬† **THEN Jesus came¬†along and said, WE ARE ALL BROTHERS, and at the time this of course would ruin all JEWISH banking and lending practices by causing all lending to be without USURY, and as such, lending would become un-profitable. JESUS said, TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR as yourself, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, and the problem with this is that JEWS had made their money nationally by banking and lending ¬†to non-JEWS who they could charge USURY OF, and if Jesus was accepted then those bankers who WERE RICH, could no longer profit off of loans to NON-JEWS because according to Jesus we are all brothers under the one God. ¬† AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON, that all christians for most of history, since JESUS, have been forbidden to use USURY, or profit from loans in anyway, IN FACT THIS WAS SO NORMAL, that shakespere wrote a play, THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, which was all about USURY, and how in old Europe only JEWS were involved in lending¬†practices, because christians had to recognize all people as brothers, and as such could not give loans for profit, BUT THE JEW, who did not accept this global brotherhood of all humans, could and would lend at interest to anyone who was not a JEW for interest, USURY payments. ¬† JEWS rejected JESUS and his notions of all humans being brothers.¬† AND IF THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH, Jesus also put aside Kosher laws as¬†not being needed to follow to get to heaven, as he said¬† ""one is defiled by our words, not by what we eat"", and this also was a major problem because all Jewish Rabbis were involved in BUTCHERING animals which MUST BE SACRAFICED in order to be clean for human consumption, and if people listened to Jesus the Rabbis would possibly go out of business as butchers on the side.**

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†**In time, Muhammad was born, and being raised on the teachings of Moses and Jesus, he did not make the grand gift¬†of Jesus which was to allow himself to be killed as a willing sacrafice for mankinds sins, and instead he raised an army to fight against what he precieved as the evil of his world, and at his time, he was the greatest advocate for womens rights that had ever come along, and he set forth detailed rules for the treatment of women for what was a primitive nomadic desert people who at the time greatly benefited in every way from his leadership in the seventh century. Muhammad also put forth a repeat of the same principles which is LAWS AGAINST USURY, and lending for profit, as loans must be to help each other instead of robbing each other for profitable gains.**

¬† ¬† ¬†**NOW, 2017, Mosheh Eesho Muhammad comes to offer the world a simple solution, which is a way to end the USURY profit system and replace it with a much better system, of USURY FREE MONEY, USURY FREE LENDING FOR THE PEOPLE, and yet allow the banking system to continue with BUSINESS LOANS AT USURY combined with massive nation and world wide market expansion programs to build up the global infrastructure to begin building the destiny of our species.**

**YES... ¬†I AM TALKING ABOUT MY SOLUTION PLANS. ----** ¬†[**A GLOBAL CURRENCY SYSTEM**](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/)

MY SOLUTION PLANS, show how we can clearly create a USURY free currency system.

MY SOLUTION PLANS, show how we can clearly create a USURY free personal banking system, to benefit people.

MY SOLUTION PLANS, show how we can clearly create a new business lending enviornment which is highly profitable due to massive large scale development and investment projects nation wide, and world wide.

**TO THE LEFTISTS ¬†I SAY THIS :**

¬† ¬† **......... WAKE UP PEOPLE, you say you want revolution and a leftist movement but you fail to understand the nature of the beast. ¬†IT IS THE USE OF MONEY, especially in this day and age.. fake money.. usury based money... ¬†which is the major drain on all of society and is why all the people make pennies, it is why business owners can only afford to pay their workers the least amount, because all profits from all sides is being taken up like a giant fucking vampire which is sucking the life blood out of every business and every person by USURY loans, interest payments on credit cards, actual loans, student loans, and all manner of personal and business finance has been taken over BY LOAN SHARKS, who act like they are doing you a favor, by offering a lower interest loan. ¬†(vampires like the Pharoahs of Egypt.)**

¬† ¬† ¬† **IT IS ALL USURY, FORBIDDEN BY GOD, because they are all robbing you!!! ¬†MONEY IS A FAKE THING.. ¬†INVENTED FOR THIS PURPOSE.... ¬† to enslave you all to work for it... money... to pay bills.. they use swords and guns to mandate that you pay.**

**YOU HAVE ALL BEEN ENSLAVED... ¬† BY CORPORATIONS... BY INVESTORS.. BY BANKERS... ¬†BY THE RICH GLOBAL ELITE.. WAKE UP.**

**YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT USURY IS BEING USED AGAINST YOU, THE WORKERS.**

**YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP to the fact that WALL STREET investors invest into all the banks and corps which own your debts, student loans, credit cards, bank loans, they OWN YOU, AS AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE. ¬†if you pay, then the investor makes his money off of you, but if you do not pay, the investor does not get paid and the police state exists to force payments... By beating you, arresting you.. convicting you, and imprisoning you.**

**IS THAT HOW IT SHOULD BE??? ¬† COME ON??? ¬† ¬†WAKE UP MORONS..... THE CONSTITUTION WAS CREATED TO PROTECT YOU!!!!!**

**WE MUST GET IT RESTORED AS THE RULE OF LAW, or the wealthy banker elite will continue to enslave you all.**

**HOW DOES THE CONSTITUTION PROTECT YOU?**

**BY RESTORING THE COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEM WE HAD BEFORE 1938.**

**BY RESTORING YOUR TRUE PROPERTY RIGHTS.**

**BY FORCING THE GOVERNMENT TO ONLY USE** [**COMMODITY BASED MONEY**](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/) **AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES.**¬†

**WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**

**BECAUSE DOING SO...**

**ENDS THE POLICE STATE.. ¬†ENDS THE DRUG WAR... ¬†ENDS THE VAST DEBT SYSTEM ROBBING US ALL.**

**TO THE ANARCHISTS I SAY THIS :** ¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† **.... ¬†Come on... ¬† what THE HELL¬†is wrong with you people??? ¬†HAVE YOU NO BALLS??? ¬† ¬†WHAT THE F@#&amp;????? ¬† ¬†¬† I used to call my self an ANARCHIST, until I realised that most Anarchists are morons and idiots who have no idea as to how to use ANARCHY to solve their problems, and while they may enjoy mayhem¬†and chaos as a means to an end, IT IS NOT, because without actual solution plans to the system as it stands today then WHAT HOPE CAN THERE BE FOR A BETTER WORLD????? ¬† FACT IS... ¬†WE MUST HAVE A SOLUTION PLAN.. FOR WHICH TO FIGHT FOR.. ¬†TO BURN FOR.. TO REBEL FOR... ¬†FOR IF WE LACK THAT PLAN.. ¬†then we are just angry morons who have no clue how to solve anything but are so upset we burn things. ¬†And that does not¬†solve anything. ¬†WE MUST HAVE A SOLUTION PLAN, BEFORE WE BURN THINGS, SO THAT THE BURNING... ¬†SERVES A PURPOSE-----¬† ¬† ¬† --**¬†[**http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/**](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/) 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† **WORST CASE SENARIO, you could pursue an A.R.D.D. SYSTEM. ¬†An Anarchistic Representative Direct Democracy. ¬†Which if our government can be represented as a pyrimid, with the few at the top controlling all below, with most people being the bottom layer ruled over from above. ¬† IN THIS CASE, an A.R.D.D. system would be an upside down pyrimid,¬†where all decisions are voted on locally by regular weekly voting sessions of¬†all the people by¬†use of a DIRECT DEMOCRACY ¬†METHOD to directly vote on all issues,¬†INSTEAD of electing representatives to vote on our behalf, WE SIMPLY VOTE OURSELVES, and our elected representatives job is ONLY to explain ALL¬†sides of each issue, TO STUDY THE ISSUES IN DETAIL.. ¬†and to explain it to the people they represent, so they, the people CAN VOTE ON THE ISSUE, all issues¬†and major decisions to be made could just as easily be voted on by the public as any city council. ¬†This would lead to local, county, state, and national issues to be voted on. ¬†THIS TAKES ALL THE POWER OUT OF THE HANDS OF GOVERNMENT except under emergecy conditions, and puts government in it's place, which is under the thumb of the people. ¬†The people deside, and all government elected representatives serve the sole purpose of doing the research and provide clear explinations of both sides so the public can be WELL INFORMED when voting to make any given decision. ¬†THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS, is that in such a society, if it used money and people traded for profit between each other, then always conspiracies will fester between people with influence to make money in one way or another by helping mold public opinion just as is done today with corrupt politicians. ¬†It could however work in a family based, non-money based communal housing system.**

**TO ALL¬†REBELS GLOBALLY I SAY THIS:** ¬†

**WHAT THE HELL¬†ARE YOU¬† FIGHTING FOR??? ¬† ¬†COUNTING ON???? ¬†WHAT IS THE GOAL????**

**1) COUNTING ON?????**

¬† ¬† ¬† **Seriously, it seems as if your all waiting for someone to come along and just solve everything for you, fix everything so that you can claim your protesting served a purpose, that your rebel actions mattered, but it does not. ¬†RANDOM CHAOS.. ANARCHY... ¬† ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT.. OR ANYTHING... ¬† may be fun.. ¬†but if it lacks purpose and goals then your just being stupid wild beasts, who like blowing shit up, and acting as if you are a REBEL or some kind of hero leader of the new order?? ¬†It is sad. ¬†PUT THE WEAPONS DOWN, and come follow me, for I am Caliph of God, there is no other, and I offer you the one thing YOU DO NOT HAVE.. ¬†ACTUAL SOLUTION PLANS.. TO MAKE A NEW.. AND BETTER WORLD.... ¬† so now.. once you realize how to solve the world's problems, YOU CAN NOW HAVE FOCUS, but you should also realize that war and fighting is not a path to solution, but massive protests¬†and RUNNING FOR OFFICE to replace those who reject the** [**new age plans for solution**](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/)**, IS A VIABLE PLAN OF ACTION, AND A GOOD WAY TO FIGHT, long term......... ¬†¬†¬† ¬† You have been counting on someone to lead you, well I am here, I can show you the path, but you have to walk it, all of you.** ¬†

**2) ¬†FIGHTING FOR?????** ¬†

¬† ¬† **Seriously, WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR, RISKING YOUR LIVES??? ¬† ¬†Because it is historically clear that no¬†matter what form of government you replace with another one, the new one will always end up just as corrupt and has more often than not, had to of¬†¬†been completely brutal to stay in power as it competes with all other groups of wealthy men who buy politicians and fund their campaigns to control nations. ¬†SO THE FIRST THING TO ASK, is will your new government be able to be THAT MUCH BETTER?? ¬† ¬†WILL IT HAVE THE MEANS?? ¬† WILL IT HAVE THE FUNDS? ¬† What if it does not?? ¬† ¬† What plans are prepared to solve the many huge issues of poverty and hunger and re-building, and re-regulating, and managing resources. THIS IS ALL VERY IMPORTANT, because without REAL PLANS, and real preparations to immediately deal with what can be endless problems from outside influences, embargos, constant war and worse sedition amid the people you try to rule over with force.**

¬†¬†**FACT IS, any group which uses force to take power and kill to hold power are assholes, and while you fight and while you recruit you may make claims and offer grand hopes and dreams of wives and wealth, the fact is most of your soldiers will likely die, and if you win the fight and take nations and land, you still will be powerless to control it, save it, use it, feed and confidently lead it's people as anything other than a tyrant asshole... unless... you understand** [**MOSHENIAN ECONOMICS**](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/)**. ¬†IT THEN BECOMES POSSIBLE TO WIN, not with fighting or with guns.. but with a political argument for why the world should turn BACK TO GOD, TURN TO ALLAH AND THE USURY LAWS OF THE BIBLE AND KORAN, and re-organize all nations monetary policies as well as begin a new** [**GLOBAL CURRENCY SYSTEM**](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/)**. ¬†IF YOUR GOING TO FIGHT, and are willing to die, then you should atleast have the balls to run for office, stand for the cause and risk being assasinated for Allah, as a leader, not a killer. ¬†THAT IS A FIGHT WORTH HAVING, .... ¬† but you must grow a pair of balls and fight with words, as a leader, run for office, form political parties, and lead for** [**solutions.**](http://caliphofgod.org/ECONOMICS/)

**3) ¬†¬† ¬†WHAT IS THE GOAL????**

¬† ¬† ¬†**Seriously, WHAT IS THE GOAL?** ¬†[**A SOCIALIST PARADICE?** ](http://caliphofgod.org/KINGDOM-OF-GOD/)¬† ¬† **An end to poverty? ¬†An end to hunger? ¬†Freedom for all people? WE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT GOALS. ¬†And I would as Caliph set forth very clear goals for all rebels world wide to strive for.**

**a) ¬†WE DEMAND A WORLD WITHOUT EXTREME POVERTY, but also want a free market world of choice.**

**b)** [**WE DEMAND A WORLD WITHOUT HUNGER AND OR HOMELESSNESS for all humans under all conditions.**](http://caliphofgod.org/KINGDOM-OF-GOD/)

**c) ¬†WE DEMAND A WORLD WITHOUT USURY PROFITS on loans to the people for homes and vehicles.**¬†

**d) ¬†WE DEMAND A WORLD where USURY is allowed for when lending to businesses and corporations of any kind.**

**e) WE DEMAND A WORLD where each nation can guarrentee** [**ZERO UNEMPLOYMENT.**](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/)

**f) WE DEMAND A WORLD which is not used to profit the few,** [**BUT HAS A NEW FAIR GLOBAL SYSTEM.**](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/)

**g)** [**WE DEMAND A WORLD WITH REAL GOALS, FOR A REAL FUTURE FOR OUR SPECIES.**](http://caliphofgod.org/EXPANSION-TO-THE-HEAVENS/)

**h) WE DEMAND A WORLD with real freedom,** [**COMMON LAW FREEDOM, not endless statutes and rules.** ](http://caliphofgod.org/RESTORE-FREEDOM/)

¬† ¬†**I SAY WE CAN ACHEIVE THESE GOALS. ¬†IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I would do exactly what I¬†say I would do, but, even if I am not elected¬†what matters is that you¬†understand the real scope of the problem, and now, hopefully you understand how to solve it.**

¬† **OUR PLANET, IS LIKE A GIANT PLANT, SITTING IN A LIMITED BOWL OF DIRT... ¬†for that plant to thrive, it needs four¬†simple things, it need SUNLIGHT (ENERGY), it needs ¬†DIRT (resources), it needs CLEAN WATER , and it needs FOOD (NUTRIENTS), in nature any plant can thive to it's best if these things are abundant and free and easy, BUT IF ANY OF THESE FOUR THINGS ARE RESTRICTED, or¬†if the plant is eaten and attacked daily then it's ability to thrive is reduced. ¬†SO LIKEWISE, any given economy of people, IF THEY PAID NO TAXES, AND HAD NO DEBTS, and everyone helped each other with goods and loans, like one big family, ¬†and they worked hard, they could prosper to the maximum possible amount. HOWEVER, take that same given economy and impose taxes, and USURY debts on all the people, and set the people against helping each other by creating poverty and scarcity of goods, then, while the entire society becomes very profitable for the few who have enslaved everyone, the whole plant itself as a people, nation, or even the entire¬†planet, cannot possibly grow and develop at it's maximum rate, because it has leaches all over it sucking it dry of all it's value, and all it's leaves and branches have been set up to be used by and to support some parasites which are feeding off the fat of the whole plant.**

¬†**USURY LENDING IS THE DRAIN.. WHICH IS BLEEDING EVERY PERSON AND BUSINESS DRY of all the profit potential they could of had if USURY WAS ILLEGAL like it is in the BIBLE AND KORAN. ¬†GET IT??? ¬† OUR SYSTEM AS IT IS TODAY... is all usury based, and it is bad, because it is a vampire leach system of sucking the gain out of peoples work, by way of contracts, loans,¬†laws and corrupt politicians that let it all happen.** ¬†

¬† ¬†**Can you ¬†imagine digging up an ant colony and finding that some of the worker ants had taken over the ant food source with little stick weapons and demanded that they be allowed to take over.. instead of the queen, or no ants¬†get to¬†eat. ¬†In this case only one of two things can happen, the weaker dumber ants comply out of fear, or they all rise up and kill the ants who used force to take power.. ¬†one way or another, it is likely, that since their power is based on force and control of resources eventually the ants as a whole will find a way around the few ants, or otherwise wake up one day and kill them all. ¬† I THINK IT IS TIME FOR ALL THE WORKERS TO WAKE UP, but, we do not need to kill anyone, we can simply¬†RUN FOR OFFICE, LEAD, form committed political action groups to demand the global implementations of plans** [**TO END USURY.**](http://caliphofgod.org/ECONOMICS/)

personalfinance,Yield curve inversion confusion,"Hi everyone, I've been trying to educate myself on bonds recently due to all the news about the yield curve inversion. I think I have a fundamental misunderstanding of something that I hope you all can help clear up. 

I understand that currently, investors have a more positive long term outlook than short term outlook. Thus, the demand for long term treasury bonds has increased, driving up the price and driving down the yields.

What I dont understand is why there would be lower demand, and thus higher rates for short term bonds. It seems to me that in the face of a possible recession in the next few years, a low-risk short term bond would be a good investment, especially since I expect interest rates to decrease when/if a recession hits. Shouldn't this increase the value of this bond? So why wouldn't investors want to buy this now?

It seems to me that a good investment (if I believe the signs a recession is coming in the next 1-2 years) would be to buy 2 year treasuries, wait for those to mature, then put my money into the market when prices are low. But that seems to be the opposite of what is happening. What am I missing?",finance

Just want to start off by acknowledging how valuable the information provided by the wiki is, thank you to everyone who put that together, learned a lot. Since my exact situation doesn't perfectly fit the info in the wiki, so I thought I should ask if what I'm doing won't make my future catch on fire. 

I am going to be a sophomore in college, and will have about 14k in federally subsidized student loans by the time I'm done with school. Planning on going through med school as well.

I did manage to make a bit over 5k this summer through internships, and out of the that I have invested 3.5k (VGT, AMD, MSFT, MA). Blew the rest due to carefree spending. 

So my question is, should investing even be in the books for me or should I pay off the student loans first? The way I see it, my loans are really low interest and don't have to be paid back for a while, so I invest now (and most of the money I make in the future), hold for a couple of years, earn a profit, then pay off the loans in full in let's say, 5 to 6 years. Am I mistaken?

investing,Eurodollar futures for the retail investor?,"I've heard a lot about buying eurodollar futures with high leverage as a bet on US interest rates continuing to fall.

Apart from the obvious risks on a gamble like this (and need for stop losses), I'm hoping someone can help me with the basic maths to figure out what kind of leverage you'd need to make, for example, double your money...

**1 contract** is priced at **$1,000,000**, so if I invest **$10,000** at **100:1** leverage, I get **1 contract**.  Now let's assume I buy at 98.8 (i.e. LIBOR at 1.2), and in 6 months eurodollar futures move to 100 (e.g. LIBOR at 0).  I make only **$3,000** according to ""Eurodollar (GE) - Globex"" on [https://www.danielstrading.com/trading-resources/futures-calculator](https://www.danielstrading.com/trading-resources/futures-calculator)

I'd need to buy 3.3 contracts to make **$10,000 (2x)** profit - meaning 300:1 leverage.  

Can I really have got that right?  I watched an interview with a professional investor hoping to make 5-10x returns with eurodollar futures, but I'm having a hard time believing anyone could get 2000:1 leverage?

Thanks for any thoughts",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 26th, 2019.

# **Week ahead: Stocks could be rocky on trade, economy fears, as August breaks low volatility streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/week-ahead-stocks-could-be-rocky-on-trade-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; The final week of August ‚Äî the bittersweet end of summer for many‚Äî could be highly volatile, as markets fret over the economy and the latest developments in trade wars.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump joins the G-7 leaders in France over the weekend, and markets will be watching to see if the meeting exposes new fault lines in the shaky relations among a once fairly congenial leadership group that fought the Great Recession together. Trump is expected to discuss the U.S. economy and highlight the U.S. pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda, under his leadership.
*****
&gt; The U.S. trade war with China escalated sharply in the past week, with a new round of tariffs from China on U.S. goods announced Friday and new threats from Trump, who ‚Äúordered‚Äù American companies to find alternatives to China. That immediately triggered speculation that the trade war will be extended and more contentious, and the U.S. economy risks falling into recession.
*****
&gt; After the close Friday, Trump retaliated against China‚Äôs tariffs by raising existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, as of Oct. 1. In a tweet, he also said he was raising new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that have not yet gone into effect to 15% from 10%.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs trading was volatile, and stocks fell by about 2.5%, erasing what would have been a second positive week for the market. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to go lower amid worries about the economy and fears the Fed will not act aggressively enough to head off a recession.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4.5% in the month of August.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, State Street Advisors chief investment strategist said the first seven months of the year were more certain for investors in terms of their expectations for Fed rate cuts and a possible trade deal. But the trade tensions have worsened, and the trade war could escalate even further.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole Friday morning, but while he left the door open for rate cuts, he did not explicitly promise rate cuts.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed has become a lot less certain. Until we get more clarity, you‚Äôre likely to see this volatility, and stocks will trade sideways,‚Äù Arone said. Even though corporate earnings weakened, ‚Äúinvestors took a big leap of faith in the first seven months of the year, expecting both a trade deal and monetary policy easing.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The escalation of the trade war makes a deal unlikely anytime soon. This, however, did drive market expectations for rate cuts higher Friday afternoon, and the market was expecting three more cuts this year.
*****
&gt; Trump tied his feuds with China and the Fed together Friday, when he tweeted that the Fed is not helping with easier rate policy, along with a question about ‚Äúwho is the bigger enemy‚Äù ‚Äî China President Xi Jinping or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the Fed is in uncharted territory, and I continue to have empathy for Chairman Powell. I think markets want faster and more aggressive policy. He‚Äôs dealing with challenges the Fed has never had,‚Äù said Arone.
*****
&gt; ‚Äù[Powell] is literally walking a tight rope. He has the president who is daily bashing him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBond markets are demanding a much greater number of rate cuts, and he‚Äôs got geopolitical challenges, whether it‚Äôs Brexit or trade. He‚Äôs also got dissension among Fed voting members. That‚Äôs a lot to balance.‚Äù
*****
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including durable goods Monday and personal spending and consumption data Friday, which also includes the PCE deflator, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation indicator.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe data will give us some indications on business spending. Durable goods has capital expenditure orders. It looks look consumer confidence will come out [Tuesday] as well,‚Äù Arone said. Business spending has been taking a hit from the trade wars, and economists are concerned it will continue to weaken, ultimately leading to weakness in the consumer economy.
*****
&gt; The week ahead could see some swings ahead of the long Labor Day Holiday weekend. ‚ÄúGiven high absentees and low volumes, my guess is it‚Äôs going to add to volatility,‚Äù said Arone.
*****
&gt; Frank Cappelleri, Nomura executive director, said he also expects volatility, and the S&amp;P could test the outer limits of its recent range.
*****
&gt; Of the 17 trading days this month, nine of them saw absolute 1% moves in the S&amp;P 500. The last time that occurred was in December, when there were 10 days with 1% moves, according to Cappelleri. The most in one month was February, 2018 when there were 12. Contrast that to the entire year of 2017, when there were just eight.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs action was volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 3%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is the third-biggest decline we‚Äôve had this month. Each of them started within 10 points of each other, near the top of the range,‚Äù said Cappelleri. The top of the range is 2,943, its Aug. 13 high, and the bottom is 2,820, near the Aug. 5 low.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre obviously still in a trading range that has been characterized by sharp moves and acute turns, so I think when we had that initial drop on Aug. 5, the question is where is it going to stop,‚Äù he said, adding traders are watching that Aug. 5 level to see if it will act as a floor.

# Second Half August Trading: Historically Weak Too

&gt; Following three straight days of gains, the market has recovered a sizable portion of its losses from earlier in the month. Losses earlier in the month and gains over the past three days (prior to today) have tracked August‚Äôs typical trading pattern for over the last 21-years quite closely. The magnitude of the moves this year has been larger than average, but the pattern has been tracked.

&gt; Due to the magnitude of this year‚Äôs moves, August‚Äôs performance over the past 21-years has been plotted on the left vertical axis in the chart above and 2019 is plotted on the right. From right around mid-month or now through the end of August, the historical trend has been weaker. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have all averaged a loss in August from 1998 to 2018 and they are on track to repeat this year.

# Is a Small-Cap Labor Day Rally Coming Soon

&gt; In the below chart, forty years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the ‚ÄúJanuary Effect‚Äù in the annual Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c3b63cadd687e835cca014192dd72/fcd39e87be04620c-93/s500x750/7e0c19f7fee940a61f9ece5a88f65d53900365f3.jpg))**

&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for ‚Äúbargain‚Äù stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of Friday‚Äôs close (August 16, 2019), Russell 2000 is up 10.8% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 15.5% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

# September Almanac: No Respite in Pre-Election Years

&gt; The start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. September gets no respite from positive pre-election year forces.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e73bc3f171da163b1e601cc26081c21/773b35094e2a77db-2e/s400x600/50353a79845a11b2bdb490f6a5ae95d25a672388.jpg))**

&gt; Although the month used to open strong, S&amp;P 500 has declined eight times in the last eleven years on the first trading day. As tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (DJIA: ‚Äì11.1%), 2002 (DJIA ‚Äì12.4%), the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (DJIA: ‚Äì6.0%) and U.S. debt ceiling debacle in 2011 (DJIA ‚Äì6.0%). However, September is improving with S&amp;P 500 advancing in ten of the last 15 Septembers and DJIA climbing in nine.

# Leading Indicators Signal Growth Ahead

&gt; U.S. leading indicators rebounded in July, a good sign for the durability of the expansion.

&gt; The Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index (LEI) rose 0.5% month over month, the biggest gain since September 2018, and above consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Leading Indicators Slowing But Growing, the LEI climbed 1.6% year over year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DUqIDwl.jpg))**

&gt; The LEI, which we include as one of the ‚ÄúFive Forecasters‚Äù of our Recession Watch Dashboard, has yet to turn negative this cycle. The index has fallen negative year over year before all nine recessions since 1955.

&gt; ‚ÄúSome investors have pointed out slowing LEI growth as a reason for caution,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúHowever, the LEI is signaling moderate U.S. economic growth ahead, with no signs of an imminent recession.‚Äù

&gt; The LEI is calculated from 10 individual leading data sets, including weekly jobless claims, building permits, and stock prices. This year, the majority of LEI components have boosted month-over-month growth in the index, but more internationally exposed data sets have turned into net drags.

&gt; In July, 6 of 10 components rose month over month, but four components‚Äîaverage hours worked, manufacturers‚Äô new orders, new orders for nondefense capital spending, and interest rate spreads‚Äîfell month over month. Historically, breadth in LEI components has deteriorated further before a recession began. In contrast, at the end of each of the past six economic cycles, more than half of the LEI components were in decline.

&gt; While evidence of slowing growth in leading indicators is disappointing, we are encouraged by what we see outside of manufacturing. Global manufacturing has been the sector hardest hit by prolonged trade tensions and weakened demand, and we don‚Äôt expect to see much improvement until a U.S.-China trade resolution is reached. Even then, a recovery in manufacturing may take some time.

# Crude Oil's Descending Triangle

&gt; Earlier this week, crude oil was trading well over 2% higher than last Friday's close. Over the past few sessions, though, oil has given up all of those gains. The catalyst for today's declines are the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US crude which are expected to dampen demand. This week's negative reversal comes as the commodity ran into multiple points of resistance. For starters, the rally began to stall out mid-week when it met the converging 200 and 50-day moving averages. This also coincided with a downtrend that traces itself all the way back to the highs from late last year. In fact, crude is down around 30% from these previous highs.

&gt; Overall, the technical picture for crude oil is not in a great place as the chart is forming a descending triangle pattern. Despite the big gains at the beginning of 2019, over the past few months, crude has been making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Given this most recent failure to retake the moving averages and break out of the downtrend, the next major support level to watch is around $50 which is a level that has held up at multiple times in the past few months. This support also draws back to late last year prior to the collapse in December.

# Yield Curves: Another Record Streak Bites the Dust

&gt; After the 3-month vs 10-year US Treasury yield curve first inverted earlier this year, the market has shifted its focus to the 2-year vs 10-year part of the curve which had yet to reach inverted levels. That was, until yesterday. While the 10s2s curve flirted with inverted territory for the last few days on an intraday basis, Thursday was the first time in more than a decade that the closing yield on the two-year US Treasury was above the yield on the 10-year. And with another closely watched part of the curve moving into inverted levels, recession fears increased.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Long-Terms.png))**

&gt; As the chart above illustrates, it has been a while since the 10s2s curve was inverted. In fact, the streak that just ended was the longest on record going back to 1977, and it wasn't even close. Going back to 1977, there have only been three prior streaks where the 10s2s curve was inverted for more than 1,000 days, and never before had the curve been positively sloped for more than 2,000 days. The current streak, though? 3,054 days. It was fun while it lasted!

# Adapt or Die

&gt; A common characteristic of most investors and traders is to always be on the lookout for patterns and connections between various asset classes. Whenever one correlated asset confirms the move in another it adds a layer of confidence to an investor's thesis. One long-held example is the Dow Transports as a leading or coincident indicator for the broader market. For decades now, many investors have followed the transports for confirmation of the broader market moves. If the transports ‚Äî which move all of the physical goods in the economy ‚Äî rally, it suggests that the broader market will be strong, while periods when the transports start to roll over are read as a signal that there's an underlying weakness in the economy.

&gt; As the US economy has become more service and digital-oriented in nature, there has been a valid argument made that the transports have lost some of their importance as an indicator of the broader economy. Along these lines, we have suggested that rather than transports, semiconductors may represent this century's 'transports' as they are a part of just about everything in this digital age. Whether you agree with this or not isn't important, but the important takeaway is that just because two asset classes have been highly correlated in the past doesn't mean that they will remain that way in the future. It's one thing to recognize a correlation between two asset classes, but it's much more important to understand why they are correlated and be on the lookout for factors that may change the status quo in the future.

&gt; One example of a radical change in a relationship between two asset classes is the interaction between the relative strength of growth and value stocks versus the slope of the yield curve. From 2002 through 2011, the two were closely correlated. As the curve flattened in the early part of this century, growth stocks underperformed value by a wide margin (falling blue line). Then in mid-2007, as the curve steepened and came out from inverted territory, growth stocks started to rip higher relative to value. Beginning in 2009, though, the curve stopped steepening and the relative strength of growth relative to value stalled out. The two series were so closely joined at the hip during this ten-year stretch that the correlation coefficient between the two was +0.82, which is indicative of two series moving in lockstep with each other.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2002-2019.png))**

&gt; If the paths of the yield curve and the relative strength of growth versus value couldn't be separated from 2002 through 2011, the relationship soured in 2012 when the two came down with a case of the ten-year itch. At that point, they couldn't separate fast enough. The chart below shows the same two series from the start of 2012 through the present. Now, when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa, as the paths are nearly exact opposites. In fact, in the nearly eight years since 2012, the correlation between the two is -0.90.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019.png))**

&gt; In the chart below we have shown the two series over the entire time period spanning 2002 through 2019. The non-shaded area represents the period covered in the first chart, while the shaded area covers the second period. Right around the time where the shaded period starts is when the positive correlation turned on a dime, and beginning in 2013 when the curve started to flatten, investors who were still hanging on to the idea that a flatter yield curve was a green light for value stocks, saw what turned out to be an extended period of misery relative to the performance of growth stocks. In the words of Intel Founder Andy Grove, ""Adapt or Die.""

# Nasdaq 100 to S&amp;P 500 Ratio

&gt; Below is a chart of the Nasdaq 100 going back to 1990. While it took 15+ years for the index to make a new all-time closing high following its March 2000 peak, the index is currently 65% above those March 2000 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndx100.png))**

&gt; Below is a ratio chart of the Nasdaq 100's price versus the S&amp;P 500's price since 1990. The ratio started well below 1 in early 1990 but quickly overtook the S&amp;P in price by the mid-90s. As you can see, the ratio spiked dramatically above 3 during the peak of the Dot Com bubble in late 1999. The Nasdaq 100 then gave up much of that outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 over a 2-3 year period where the ratio got all the way back down to 1, but since then it has been steadily trending higher to its current level of 2.65. While it went through a bubble and a burst over a 5-year period, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for a long time now.

ethereum,Lending ETH in a true decentralized way,"The ROI per year is very low for ether for example in compound. I have noticed that of course the best interest rates are offered for Dai or other erc20 stablecoins.

What's the best platform that offers the best ROI for ETH?

And by best I mean fully decentralized where you control your funds at any moments like Compound.

Someone tried to lend ETH at a good APR? How was your experience?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Inherited IRA - setting up tax withholding on my RMDs.,"I inherited a small traditional IRA and i'm setting up my RMD's (required minimum distribution) on the Vanguard website. When I plug in my RMD that vanguard calculated for me, I have a screen where I have to account for any Federal and/or State tax withholding. 

For federal tax withholding, Vanguard pre-populates a 10% withholding. I can increase or decrease it or skip withholding altogether. I do want to withhold. However, my federal tax rate is 24%. Does that mean I should increase the pre-populated 10% withholding up to 24%?  Unfortunately, I don't have a tax person or a financial planner to consult with. 

Thanks!

Edit: The IRA is less than $8k.",finance
investing,Ordering companies home,"If companies move operations and manufacturing  back to the U.S.. Our current low employment rate goes lower or does it create higher wages for the currently employed? If manufacturing comes back at the expense of the companies , will this translate to higher prices charged for the same goods? If you have both wages and component parts prices rise , does this not raise inflation concerns? In the face of inflation , doesn't the central bank raise interest rates? So how can the administration keep telling corporate America to increase their costs and be upset when the Central bank holds on interest rates as they look to increasing price inflation. Maybe  the price increases will slow consumer spending so much that the consumer pulls back on buying the more expensive goods and we the have a recession that we are tying to avoid. So now rates can be pushed down?   Any insight is helpful.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off subsidized student loan now before graduation, or wait to pay loan off right before graduation?","Hi everyone,

I currently have a federal subsidized student loan with a principal amount of $3,500 (I did not save up enough for my living expenses sophomore year so I needed one to cover me). I am in my senior year and will be graduating from college come next spring. I currently, thanks to my job, have enough money saved ($4000) to pay the entire amount right now. The account says that the interest to accrue at this time is $561. However, from my understanding of a subsidized loan, this interest should be covered as long as I am in school. If I am wrong please correct me.

My initial plan was to store my money in a high-interest savings account or some other form of interest-earning mechanism for the next year and then pull it out right before graduation and pay it off. This way I could earn a little extra as I keep adding to it before paying. However, I am not sure if this is the best use of my money (maybe I am misunderstanding interest or something idk). I was hoping for input from others about whether my plan sounds good or if I should go ahead and just pay the whole principal now.",finance
personalfinance,Upcoming forced career change...next steps,"I am being forced to change careers in no less than 6 months. I have a personal budget that allows me to save at least 1k a month after retirement contributions and bills. I owe 10k on a 2.25% car loan, and have a 60 month 0% card with 4K on it. I have about 8k in my emergency fund, and although I will need to pay for any relocation upfront(probably around 3k based on previous experience), I will be reimbursed for it.

I am playing in 2 player mode, and my spouse works, but makes only around 2k/month. She has almost no debt.

I am looking for new careers in the 60-120k range(depends on the chosen career path), and have no other debt besides what is listed above. I am confident I will have a new job when the time comes, but don‚Äôt know exactly when it will happen. 

My dilemma is if I should attempt to pay off my vehicle loan, which will only net about 2-300$ in saved interest, but will reduce my monthly financial requirements significantly(450$/month). My other option is that I could contribute further to my emergency fund. Due to the vehicle being almost 10years old, and my low interest rate, I suspect a refi is out of the question.

My desire is to pay off the vehicle loan now, in order to minimize my debt and feel more comfortable about the transition but I know that is not the best option. 

I would appreciate any opinions or outside perspectives, even if it is just confirmation one way or the other.",finance
personalfinance,California state income tax for independent contractor?,"I've been searching online trying to find a good calculator to estimate my CSIT liability. I found [this](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-paycheck-calculator#6lslrMiw1b) but don't know if it applies for contractors or just employees. I've found several ones online that estimate my income tax that I'll owe to the IRS as a contractor, but those don't usually factor in state taxes. Would software like QBO estimate both my state and federal taxes? Are both paid quarterly? I'd appreciate any help. Thanks!",finance

ethereum,Libra-based 'SHC' = New SDR,"[As predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/clm110/applying_the_libra_model_to_the_sdr_currency/), central banks are now pursuing a potential Libra-like network to govern over an SDR-like basket of fiat currencies as the world further transitions off of the USD as the global reserve (as was laid out in [Carney's rather historic speech yesterday](https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-england-governor-calls-for-digital-currency-replacement-to-the-dollar)).  The likely path would be to first convert fiat currencies into CBDCs (central bank digital currencies), which would then be added to a weighted basket controlled/governed by a Libra-like network of central banks where each bank runs a node and thus sets global monetary policy (one bank/nation = one vote).

IMO, this is not merely a significant validation of blockchain but a complete re-ordering of the global economic order to be fully based upon it!

Here are some excerpts from Carney's speech: ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-england-governor-calls-for-digital-currency-replacement-to-the-dollar))

""Carney suggested a number of possible replacements to the dollar, most notably, a digital currency supported by an international coalition of central banks.

&gt;'It is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies.'  


Technology can disrupt the current network effects that protect the dollar, he explained, noting that an increasing number of transactions occur online and use electronic payments rather than cash.""

personalfinance,Can I afford this house in HCOL area?,"Hi all,

My husband and I have put in an accepted offer for a $635k house (HCOL Area). Our combined incomes are $264k.

We have $124k in liquid savings, and I will receive a 40k bonus (pre-tax) in a month. We will pay $90k toward 10% down, closing costs, and some pre-payments to lower our monthly mortgage ($3.3k to pre-pay PMI, $2.7k to get discount points that have a 4.8 year payback period). 

The house is newly renovated and the inspection game back with minor things the seller will fix. We will hold $6.5k in savings toward a home repair fund and once I receive my bonus we will change our 3 month emergency fund to a 6 month one.

Our mortgage will be $3k (interest rates are very low right now - this includes PITI) and we calculated we would still be able to pay the mortgage and save 20% of our incomes even if we took a 40% household paycut and maintained our current lifestyle spending. In calculating this, we took into account higher utility and home repair funds.

I currently max out my 401k, and my husband maxes out a backdoor Roth as he doesn‚Äôt have a 401k. Our only debt is that my husband has student loans he will have forgiven in 5 years through PSLF and pays just over $500 a month on these, which is included in our budgets (FAQ: yes, we are sure we qualify. No you don‚Äôt pay a tax bill via the PSLF program. Yes it is in his loan contract so politicians cannot retroactively repeal the program, they could only repeal it for future generations.)

Are we missing anything?

Are the rules on 6 month emergency fund + 1% of purchase price in savings additive and are there other funds you should be holding for major repairs?",finance

personalfinance,Klarna financing to boost credit history?,"I am in my mid-to-late 20's and recently moved for work.  I have never had a credit card and have been considering getting one for a while.  A few weeks ago, after much deliberation and getting advice from lots of people, I decided to apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited card.  I was surprised to find that I had been immediately rejected.  I decided to call to find out why, and the representative on the phone said it was because of me not having a credit history.  For context, my only form of debt is student loan debt, which I have paid religiously.  I thought having a good credit score would be more than enough, but I was naive.

My dad and I have been thinking about options to help fluff out my credit history.  Yesterday, he told me that one potential way to do it was to finance my furniture.  Furniture companies usually have very low credit score thresholds and typically high interest rates, from what I understand, so it seemed like a good option for me since I could afford to pay off whatever the monthly fee is.  I was on Overstock looking at furniture, and at checkout there is an option to pay using Klarna, which is apparently a point-of-sale lender that has longer term financing options that are potentially interest free, given some stipulations.

Would making payments on Klarna show up as positives on my credit history?  My thinking is that I could use Klarna for a few purchases on other sites over the next few months and then have a nice and self-limited history of paying for things on credit and not accrue interest in the process.",finance

personalfinance,How do you evaluate if a rental property makes sense?,"I'm looking at a rental property that just hit the market in my area. Listed at 1.2 million, with 4 units. Total income for the units has been historically 92k a year.


* Unit 1 - 1900
* Unit 2 - 1650 (I believe this unit is either available currently or is becoming available soon and would probably be the unit we'd move into if we lived here since it is the largest unit)
* Unit 3 - 1941 (this is an airbnb unit requiring more work and if we did a lease on this unit it would be MUCH lower since it's only like 500sqft)
* Unit 4 - 2100

Historic utilities+maintenance+taxes have been 14250/yr.


Mortgage cost after downpayment = 4900-5300 depending on interest rate. We were preapproved at one rate but believe we could get lower.


So I'm trying to figure out if this is a good deal. This would be a first home purchase for my fianc√© and I and since we're in a HCOL area I thought maybe it makes more sense to maintain our lifestyle (currently living in a small apartment) but use our high incomes to get a rental that could potentially become cashflow positive if we ever moved out. Assuming we lived in either unit 3 or unit 2 we'd be spending money to live there, BUT since we can comfortably afford to put up to about 4500 a month in the mortgage we could theoretically pay of the home in as little as 11-12 years and then have 1.2million in assets at that time.


In my eyes it seems like it could be a good investment, we'd have to live frugally but could pay it off completely soon enough and then in the future move out and rent the units for profit. Opinions/advice?",finance

Forex,Market Timing of Regular Transfers from Europe to Canada,"My apologies if this is not directly related to trading forex on the market.

I live in Sweden and I'm trying to pay off debts in Canada. This means I transfer money (I use Transferwise) to my Canadian account regularly, maybe once every two or three months. 

My question is regarding how to time the transferes since I also have to consider the exchange rate. It's a somewhat stable currency pair though SEK has had a long trend of devaluation; on a more short term basis, the fluctuations over the last six months make a difference of about $20 for every $1000. How can I go about deciding the best time of day, day of week, and day of month? I've recently started following financial new/announcement like unemployment, inflation, repo rate, etc. but haven't found a good source that would have a calendar. 

Or am I overthinking this and should just make regular transfers regardless of market? I tried to do some calculations on excel for comparison but didn't reach any conclusions. If anyone wants to try to go that route, the principal is sitting at around 18k right now with an interest rate of 6.45%. Exchange rate has fluctuated between 0.1360 to 0.1420 SEK to CAD.

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth Strategy Idea,"Hi all,

Wondering about this strategy. 

My wife and I have about half of our retirement money in rollover (pre-tax) IRAs. We also have active 401k/403b with our current employers. We plan to retire in 5 years and expect our retirement spending to be about the same or a little higher for the first 10+ years of retirement.

Our current effective federal tax rate is relatively high (25%), we are both late in careers and earning our highest salaries. 

The plan I'm vetting is this: When we retire, we'll roll the 401k/403b funds into the traditional IRAs. We then live off cash for the first year of retirement to create a year of relatively low AGI (&lt; $50k) and backdoor the IRA money to Roth that tax year. 

Assuming the tax laws are the same in 5 years, would this be a viable option? Would the results be what I am expecting, which is to only pay \~12% federal tax on the converted funds?

Thanks for reading.

Over the last weeks I've introduced some concepts I think are useful, demonstrated how a person could use them to make profit and presented for consideration ways you can go and test if what I am saying is true in your trading. Now I am going to start to bring this all together to show you how a person can plan well ahead and be well prepared to profit in Forex.

&amp;#x200B;

Three weeks ago I gave a swing analysis on GBPUSD (as part of speaking about a broader idea of trend following). It said this.

Source [https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/clbxk2/shorting\_noobs\_common\_trend\_following\_mistakes\_im/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/clbxk2/shorting_noobs_common_trend_following_mistakes_im/)

&amp;#x200B;

Long term bearish picture here of 1.190.  An area I expect us to have a big move in possibly feature a 100 plus pip candle (dare I speculate ... news event, or random fundamental).  We got into 1.199s, and then price started to stall. 

I then explain by ""ping swing"" theory and pointed out all the indicators this ping swing was coming. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wsdjmcb9ihi31.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/oe7823ncihi31.png

[When explaining what the ping swing was all about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ctifde/forecasting_the_end_of_major_corrections_and/), I said it set up the really big move in the other direction. The breakout. What I more commonly refer to as the impulse leg. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bqd1nzmpihi31.png

Source [https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/clx0v9/profiting\_in\_trends\_planning\_for\_the\_impulsive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/clx0v9/profiting_in_trends_planning_for_the_impulsive/)

&amp;#x200B;

So based upon all of these factors I am prepared to trade a move that  may be surprisingly strong from a really specific area (will get into trades later).  Everything in my analysis form and strategies design allow me to be ready and position my trades to profit from  some wild event there may be in the coming week or two weeks (maybe three ... four, eeek. I'm hedging).  Now I'm not saying I know there is going to be a certain type of Brexit news ... I do not care.  I'm not saying we should think it's very possible the FOMC spikes high and then fucking crashes  (surely something to do with that illusive ""pricing in"" thing) ... I do not care.  I am not predicting these fundamental events. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am saying is based upon the information I have shared with you so far, a person can design a trade plan that would position them for this sort of price action, and this sort of price action almost always happens when there's a news event.  Got that? Think it's very possible there is a huge  swing coming, entirely unrelated to any news events that may happen in the future that I could not know about now. 

&amp;#x200B;

What sort of price action could we expect ... ? 

&amp;#x200B;

We already have the trade plan for that last week.

&amp;#x200B;

GBPUSD closed near the high on some of my brokers but crashed 30 pips in the last minute of the day on another, and this probably means it's opening up gap low.  Exactly what we'd expect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uai4g2blkhi31.png

Do this experiment, find this double top pattern. Find the ""confirmation"" move I explained, and then honestly think where you'd set a stop ""safe above the highs"" here.  Count how many pips it went past that. Probably about 5 - 7 and then crashed. That's the trap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lays the next trap.  For this let's recap the traps I've shown you and see where we are in the cycle of possible mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mkipd82lhi31.png

Last week I said we were at the transition from black to blue. Then ""the news"" made that happen. Then late in the week I said look for spike out trend continuations.  All this happened. 

So selling into that event was either devastatingly unlucky, there was nothing you can do about it and it is what it is if it happens again (frequently). Or, it was selling mistake #2 (shown as 4 here near the low) 

 

https://i.redd.it/4xrmb3pilhi31.png

What do we have after selling mistake number #2. Selling mistake number #3 (no need to re-invest the wheel). 

\#3  is a 5 (just to be confusing), and this is ""deep correction"" selling mistake.  Would you think it would be fair to agree anyone selling the double top like move we've discussed here would have made the mistake of thinking a deep correction was a trend continuation? People will have. They do every cycle. This is why I can  ""predict"" it. Or, it's lucky and there's no way you can know. Pick  your flavor. 

Mistake #4 .  Single candle price action. In this case I am forecasting this to be the crash pre-close (on some brokers) or the gap down (a gap is just a big swing).   This looks like the real deal on the trend continuation. People will sell into this early in the week.  It may be in the form of a big gap down, it making it's low early in the week and then people sell the gap fill (or part retrace).  Anyway, the better trade is on the other side of this. We have not yet hit the 61.8 fib and this sort of sell off would be a ""known"" seller trap. 

\#5 tends to  form when price first hits the 61.8, There is an immediate and dramatic sell off. Then there is a spike out of the 61.8 and the real trend move begins.  We should watch for this sort of action Tue/Wed and should expect to be seeing it (very specifically) close to 1.2343. 

Which is no surprise to see shaping up since this specific PA is what I started speaking about when it was at the lows. 

https://i.redd.it/frstw4dinhi31.png

&amp;#x200B;

So if we see these further confirms; 

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Price spikes/gaps down and then returns aggressively to the high

2 - Price hits 61.8 and falls quickly 

3 - These things happen  in the immediate foreshadow of a news event (FOMC?) 

&amp;#x200B;

All of these things would be consistent with things that happen before the following scenario: 

&amp;#x200B;

1 - News is released. It's unexpected.  Either the number is off, it was random (tweet etc) or the market just moved totally different from how it would be expected to (cue theories to fill gaps). 

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Price moves rapidly up. It makes a ""new breakout"" of a ""key level"", and then capitulates.  100 + pips can be moved in very short periods of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 - After this move has happened, there is a sharp low made and we uptrend for the next few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not ""predicting the future"", but this is a viable trade plan for the coming week(s). We sell GBPUSD 1.2340 area. Stop 1.2410 or so. We target 1.1900. Then we look for the market to make a low (after a very volatile fall) in the 1.1850 sort of area.  As a rule of thumb (and I am not being flippant, this is true), if you see people in forums asking what just happened, that will probably be your cue to go and find this trade on your chart.  This is a regular indicator. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think if this is to happen this week, the high will be made Wed/Thurs and crash late week. If it's not to happen this week, a ranging week may be ahead. Even a couple weeks. These would not invalidate the analysis, for the market to range a few weeks to form a ""strong high"" and then do this take out move I've described is also something to be expected.  I would be surprised to not see GBPUSD drop 300 pip from the high in coming month.

Current situation; I live in a home that is paid off, but in terrible condition. Bad insulation, and weak spots in the floor in some spots. Utility bills are expensive because of location. In a ""coop"" so I can only go with 1 electric company. Only 1 company offers internet at my location, and it's $110 monthly. Because of the condition of the house, electric runs about $250 per month. I drive about 80 miles per day strictly on my work commute (40 mi. each way)

I currently make about $2,000 per month after taxes, retirement, benefits, etc. \*\*without adding in overtime\*\*. I can very easily add in another $800 a month in overtime, but I don't feel putting myself in a situation where overtime is required to make ends meet is something I should do.

Current mortgage company says they can loan me $85,000 and that will have me at approximately a $750 monthly payment (including approximate taxes, home owners insurance, and private mortgage insurance) I am paying over $200 a month on electric currently, but I feel it would lower down when I get into a house that is better insulated, but then I got the cost of PMI to replace it.

To my knowledge, I am approved for a texas heroes program (in law enforcement field) thing that gives me a grant up to 6% of the total loan for down payment, but I think it does in fact increase the interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Current bills, not including utilities/groceries/gas etc are;

$360 car payment per month

$100 monthly Car insurance

I have a $300 limit credit card, of which I just opened and am keeping about a $30 balance on. Paying minimum monthly payment just to help boost credit.

**\*\*(Edit: I understand what you guys are saying; I will definitely be paying it off completely every month before the interest hits. - Thank you! for taking care and explaining it thoroughly)\*\***

No other loans/bills/debt

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be worth it to just invest some money into my current residence (an old mobile home) and wait another few months / year(s) to buy a house? I feel like I'd have to put in 3-5k into our current place to feel comfortable/safe. (repairing some floors, some insulation, better windows maybe)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Edit\*\*

Cannot/will not sell current residence.

Car interest rate is 16.56%

estimated mortgage % is 5.25% ""because it's FHA loan with 0 down"" according to mortgage company.

Only 2 accounts are opened up on my credit currently. One has been up for 15 months (the car) and the other less than 1 month (the credit card)

If I remember right off the top of my head, I owe $14,300 left on the car. It's a 2017 corolla w/ 61k miles on it (I bought it with 35k miles) and the \*\*interest\*\* is 16.56%

My credit scores (according to mortgage company when ran) are 649, 655, and 720. Credit karma says significantly otherwise, at 616.",finance

personalfinance,Dumb question about interest rates on savings options,"Edit:looks like there's no significant difference between the interest gains, mystery solved. Thanks

Like I said, perhaps a dumb question, but, I have $13,000 set aside as an emergency fund. Until now I had kept it in a money market savings account with a laughable interest rate, but I've realized that account is totally pointless compared to other options out there, so I just opened on online savings account with Ally and plan to move the $13k there, where it will still be accessible, there's no minimum balance fees, and the interest rate is much better at 1.9%. 
Something I've also done with my money (from a different checking account) is buy 4 week Treasury bills, with reinvestments, mostly just to see how that worked. Sometimes the rates were 2.3%, now they look to be around 2.03%. 
My question is, what would yield a better return: leaving the full 13k in the Ally account with 1.9% APY, or leaving say 5k (more than I could really imagine needing for an actual short term emergency, not to mention I have a healthy checking account balance) in the Ally account and using the other 8k on 4 week securities with &gt;2% APY for 2 or 3 reinvestment periods at a time, all things remaining normal.
I guess another question at the core of this is if the interest is calculated the same for these two approaches.",finance

cybersecurity,Local PD's role in Cyber Crime,"Hey all, 

I started thinking about to what degree my local PD will deal with cybercrime before kicking it up to the feds.

I looked around online for some info, a particular line to report cybercrime locally, an office, pretty much anything but didn't see much.

I stumbled upon a document from a national police assocation about how they need to improve their knowledge and ability to handle these things on a local level. Things like using private companies, recruiting from local colleges, etc.

I decided to swing by the headquarters rather than call to see if I can get some answers.

The initial answer I received from a gentlemen at the front desk was ""I've been here 2 years and never heard one mention of cybercrime unfortunately"", the other dude thought I was trying to report a crime and when he realized I wasn't he didn't have much to add. 

After them trying to figure it out for a few mins a voice form the back yells out that they sometimes will have cybercrime detectives in the building. 

This gentlemen had a little more knowledge but not much and just knew they existed and dealt with mostly revenge porn, stalking and financial crimes like CC fraud etc. 

None of them could find a contact for one of these detectives or knew when they might be there. It was Saturday so I didn't expect anyone there that day, thought I could maybe pull a direct phone number from them.

Basically it ended with them asking me to come back Monday when more people were available. 

They never asked my name or for me to identify myself in anyway, gave up a lot of unnecessary information and are clearly not trained in any meaningful way on social engineering etc.

I am going to go back tomorrow and see what else I can find out, maybe talk to one of these detectives. 

I don't know if anyone else is interested in this but I found it pretty revealing and concerning at the same time. My intention is to find out how they contract out work to private companies and what kind of services they look for.

If there is any interest I'll post an update. 

Has anyone else looked into this locally or have more info about it? 

Thanks.",technology

personalfinance,Lying on a loan?,"Hello, I recently bought a house in cash from a foreclosure auction, I owe nothing on the home and I have almost fixed it up without needing to borrow any money. I've been planning on renting this home to get some cash back and build my savings back up. The issue is banks seem to be rather greedy when it comes to rentals, interest rates are higher and my options seem to be more limited. Even my insurance is almost $200 more per year because I told them it was a rental, it's kind of bogus. 

Here is the issue, I don't ""need"" the money but I do need access to cash if something goes wrong with the home until I build my savings back up. I was thinking of doing an equity loan, aka you have a line of credit and wont pay interest until you use the money, seems like a great solution to my current problem.

The rub and the lie, it's almost a 3% interest difference and almost $1000 more in closing costs to go this route as a rental vs claiming I will be living in the home. If I claim I live in the home they will pay the closing costs if I get a 25k line of credit and my interest rate will only be 3.75%, the other route it costs me $1000 closing and 7% interest as a rental. Utilities are in my name currently and I can change my address since no one is living in the home yet (still finishing it) , suppose the question is, what's the worst case scenario?

personalfinance,Downpayment money - Savings account or principal re-payment on current home,"Hi all - going to use hypothetical numbers to illustrate the point, but hoping to get some feedback here

I currently own a condo with a 30 year 3.75% mortgage. In the next \~5 years, I plan on upgrading to a single family home. I have the downpayment (20-30%) of what I expect to pay for my next home currently in high-interest savings account. Given the relatively short time period, I don't want to put this money in the stock market and have enough in the market through other accounts. 

My question is this, with interest rates coming down and savings accounts yielding less (\~1.9% on Ally), does it make sense to take the downpayment (lets say $100K) and leave it in the savings account or to pay down principal on my current mortgage with the idea that the savings in interest payments over the next five years would be greater than the interest I would earn at 1.9% (and potentially lower if rates continue to fall) over the next 5 years? The downside of this would be I would lose liquidity of having the downpayment ready to buy without being reliant on selling my current condo. The upside is that I believe I would save around $15-20K in interest over the next 5 years according to my amortization calculator. Am I overlooking anything? Thoughts/suggestions.

personalfinance,Long term vs short term loan for a boat,"Hi All,

I wanted to get some advice for long term vs short term loans for a boat, lets say sticker price is $30,000.

Now i know the best option is to pay cash up front but i'm more looking for help in terms of justifying my way of thinking. So lets say i plan to own a boat for the rest of my life and i aim to buy a used new boat and trade it in every four years. Because i'm planning to own for a long time and trade in every four years i should just be focused on monthly payment right? and not so much how much interest ill be paying because i'm always going to have a monthly payment?

So now comes the obstacle i'm trying to get my head around. What are the differences in my situation of a short vs long term loan if i plan to trade in every four years? I'll pay a higher interest rate and more interest in that four years for a longer loan term but i'm trying to understand how that would affect me when it comes time to trade in every four years vs a short term loan? The only thing i can think of is that for a shorter loan i'll pay more to my principal so when it comes time to trade in i'll have more equity in the boat. Does this matter if i'm going to be having a monthly payment on a boat for a long time since i'll be trading in every four years?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope i got my point across and i guess you could argue the same with cars or any loan for a thing that you intend to have a for a long time and trade in every x amount of years.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all help / advice is much appreciated and if i've confused the hell out of you, i apologize :)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. So what I struggle with when it comes to the majority of advice is that life and my time is priceless. I could save for a year or two and pay in cash or experience being out on a boat and that life tomorrow. None of us know where we'll be in a year or two myself included. With that said there is definitley a healthy balance in terms of paying cash up front for things and financing ""toys"". I would happily pay 2k in interest to enjoy boating for the next two years starting tomorrow if that makes sense?

For anyone in the same ""boat"" as me or is just interested in different opinions have a read of this thread, it's a great read with a ton of different points of view:

investing,Why do people from China like investing in residential real estate?,"The city I live in is flooded with money coming from China and the prices of residential real estate is sky high. I was talking with my neighbor who is from China, she said she owns 8 different apartments that has no one living in them and are just empty, because she believes that prices will ALWAYS go up.

I asked her, how she can be sure that prices for apartments will never go down, she told me to not worry too much as everyone is buying apartments because it is a good way to make money.

But I doubt prices WILL ALWAYS go up like she said, all bubbles come to an end. Literally in my building, only 30% of the units have people living in them. The rest are completely empty, and the owners are all living in China. They don't rent them out either, just sits empty. If interest rates goes up or the banks stop lending, then there will be so many apartment on the market, the bubble will burst very quickly. Whatever the appreciation in value is only on paper unless you can convert into real returns.

It seems like such a waste of Capital, alot of that investment could be going into businesses or more productive parts of the economy. Instead they just put them into steel and concrete.

Can someone explain to me why Chinese people think this way? Are there cultural reasons to this? Is this just a case of: ""everybody does it, so I will to""? I don't see many white folks or other people lining up around the block to purchase apartments from the sales office when a new building is planned.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing Options,"Background info: 22 years old, recent college graduate, international affairs. I wanted to wait to make this post until I got a job offer as it‚Äôs a tad difficult to refinance loans without an income, but I finally secured a full time job a few days ago and wanted to explore loan refinancing and repayment options. 

Currently I have around $141,000 in total student loan debt for a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. Oops. About $115,000 is privately held debt, with the remainder being a mix of federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The private loans were for each individual year of schooling, so the interest rates vary slightly, but they‚Äôre all generally around 8.5-9.5% interest. I wanted to refinance ASAP to get to a manageable monthly payment and hopefully be able to reduce the interest rate significantly, but my main worries were: 

With the possibility of Federal funds rate cuts in the future, I‚Äôm not sure if right now is the optimal time to refinance, but I‚Äôm also not sure if I have many alternative options, either 

My loans did accrue interest throughout my time in school as I was making only the minimum $25 payment, so the interest would be capitalized 

I am woefully financially illiterate and am not really sure about how to go about the process. I‚Äôve heard good things about SoFi and a lot of employers in the area that offer refinancing assistance that I‚Äôve seen go through SoFi. Beyond that, I‚Äôm not sure of any other providers or what some of the more popular options are. 

Regarding the federal debt, I was planning on applying for an income-based repayment plan, especially given that their interest rates are significantly lower than my private debt. I thought it made the most sense to pay off high-interest debt aggressively and work downwards from there, making use of income-based repayment minimums for the federal loans for now. 

Current living expenses: $1200 for rent and utilities, I‚Äôm unsure of transportation but it shouldn‚Äôt be more than $150 monthly for commuting with public transportation. I haven‚Äôt worked out food costs yet but a nearby Costco should be a great help there. 

Income: $50,000 base salary, and time and a half paid for overtime. I was told that others usually average about 60-65 hour work weeks, and essentially never work fewer than 50 hours. Normally I‚Äôd be a bit skeptical that they‚Äôre just saying that to get me in the door, but given that it‚Äôs a law firm I think those numbers are probably accurate. If I had to ballpark total yearly compensation I would give a conservative estimate of around $70,000. (Averaging 60 hours/week would be around $86,000 but I think $70,000 is a safe estimate for now). Another potential issue I see is the fact that a significant portion of my income will be coming from overtime and not the base salary; will the refinancing terms be calculated from my base income, or could I present a pay stub with the overtime hours factored in? 

Am I on the right track for some of my tentative refinancing plans? Should I be refinancing at this income level? How aggressive should I be with the loan terms if I do refinance? I‚Äôd love to hear any similar experiences or recommendations. 

Tl;dr: $115,000 private loans at 9% interest, $25,000 federal loans, $1200 rent+utilities, approx. $70,000 yearly income, what do

energy,How To Fix Climate Change Inside Our Lifetimes,"Dear Everyone Who Wants to Save the World;

We all want to save the planet, but our methods are tired and never worked in the first place. Lets stop with the symbolic protests and fix the problems directly, effectively, and immediately. Our leaders are inadequate to the task, but we can solve things directly, without them.   

I believe the answer is to pursue solutions, not to stand around with signs demanding other people solve our problems. Here is how we can save the  world for nearly no money, using existing tech and proven methods. Anyone with a few tens of millions of dollars could pursue one or more of these solutions, and become a multi-billionaire in the process.  

**The lowest hanging fruit** in the present day is cleaning/fertilizing the oceans in order to restore them to the state they existed in prior to industrialization. This can be accomplished by way of filtering the garbage patches, and adding rice hulls soaked in wood paste and iron oxide. These rice hulls serve as time-release, fully biodegradable fertilizer, supplying iron and silica to the de-nutriated deep oceans. The second part of this will be immensely profitable and save commerical fishing, by reversing 400 years of taking more from the seas than we give back.  

Obvious partners: Florida bauxite mines have the iron oxide, wood pulp mills have the wood paste, rice farmers have the hulls. All are currently waste products, and can be acquired cheaply ($150/ton, will fall with economy of scale.)  Commercial fishing companies are going under worldwide, and the larger players would likely partner with us to save their livelihoods.  

Obstacles:  UN law of the sea prohibits deliberate dumping of fertilizer in international waters. For this we need fishing companies as partners. The profit motive will serve us to get fertilization going, and cleanup can be tied into the granting of fertilization/fishing rights.  

Estimated costs: a few tens of millions of dollars annually would cover the costs of fertilizing the oceans, and this would be recuperated annually in  the form of greatly increased fish haul. Unknown lobbying fees to pass laws allowing UN (or someone) to grant fishing exclusivity in exchange for fertilization and cleaning responsibilities.  

Likely outcome: immediate(under 180 day)¬† 40-50% reduction in oceanic albedo in treated areas, rising as the plankton community grows around the time-release fertilizing rice hulls. Estimated carbon offset, after fertilizing all nutrient-depleted oceanic waters, and both polar oceans, of 50-75% annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Massive production of oceanic plankton, shrimp, fish, at observed rates of upwards of 10+ tonnes CO2 sequestered for every 1 tonne of fertilizer added.  

Additional beneficial effect of plankton exhaling DMS (dimethyl sulfate), a cooling chemical which promotes marine cloud formation, leading to additional localized cooling and further reducing albedo. Difficult to  calculate, the increase in cloud production is a common feature of all  algal blooms worldwide.  

*By my (admittedly incomplete) calculations, this is the cheapest, fastest, most easily deployed method of climate healing available to us today.*  

**Second  Solution:** Widespread microbial treatment of oceans, river outlets, to treat nitrogen and phosphate overload from agricultural runoff.  

You can't add nutrients to most of the shallow ocean, and especially not around river outlets, because the issue there is over-nutriation, and oxygen is the limiting factor.

So, in a two part solution, we need to add microbes that metabolize  phosphates and nitrogen, and we need more biologically available oxygen. The microbes are easy, they can be grown in agar and applied via a  spray system (boat, buoy, barge, or terrestrial) to river outflows as they meet the sea. The harder part is increasing the biologically available oxygen.  

For this we can use tethered aerators on buoys, which can convert wave action into finely dissolved oceanic oxygen by way of a simple one-way valve which allows oxygen into the top of the buoy, and then forces it out of the bottom of the buoy through a fine sieve as the buoys descend from each wave crest. By letting the waves do the work, we cut costs precipitously, and the machinery becomes much lower maintenance/cost.  

Combined, the microbes and increased oxygen break down the abundant phosphates and nitrogen into biologically available nutrients, which other species can utilize. Because the buoys keep the water from going hypoxic, life flocks to the now-available nutrients. By balancing the available nutrients with sufficient oxygen and innoculating the river outflows with species which can process agricultural runoff, we keep our shallow oceans alive, and prevent the massive die-off of coastal waters. We additionally sequester substantial (though yet unknown) carbon into the bodies of living creatures.  

Stabilizing the oceanic life web is of utmost importance. The seas are most of the surface of our planet, and without them functioning as they have been for millions of years, we will soon perish. They produce most of our oxygen, and sequester most of our greenhouse emissions. We must rebalance the seas, and part of that is management of our wastes.  

I don't know enough about this particular solution to estimate costs, but objections will be from anyone who has to foot the bill, especially agriculture. Coastal environmental group opposition is guaranteed.  

Desired results: remediation and elimination of river outlet dead zones, closing the cycle on human waste of fertility causing oceanic hypoxia. Revitalization of coastal oceanic waters, massive carbon sequestration.  Because I haven't worked on precisely this sort of project in the past, I will need to do more research into the numbers before I am comfortable providing specific estimates of the carbon sequestration and overall effects on the seas. The result will be a massive reduction in worldwide oceanic dead zones, and a concurrent bloom of all living things, each sequestering carbon in the process of living.

**Third solution:** reversal of oceanic acidification through usage of Olivine mineral degradation through tidal action.  

I love the simplicity of this one. We need to make the oceans more alkaline, quickly and cheaply, before the changing pH kills all the corals and the rest of us  too.¬†The best solution available right now is to take an abundant mining waste product, the mineral Olivine, crush it up, and distribute it in into the tide zones of the ocean. By putting crushed Olivine on the beaches, we allow the natural wave action to slowly degrade this alkaline mineral into the coastal waters. This will return  the oceans to their pre-industrial pH balance, and save us all from the nasty fate of being suffocated by the seas belching out methane and carbon.  

Possible allies: mining companies would love to sell Olivine, and this is a good way to bring them into the climate fight on the side of life. Anyone interested in saving the oceans. Coastal fishing companies, also anyone who wishes to save the corals. This is a good candidate for carbon offset programs as well.  

Objections: it's geoengineering, so environmentalists  and beach protection groups, first and foremost. There are no international legal problems with a nation doing this inside of its own economic exclusion zone, but in the USA, state, federal, and local environmental regulations will have to be modified.  

Estimated costs: I don't have current numbers, but Olivine is sitting in massive heaps worldwide. The costs of transport, crushing, dispersal will all measure in tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, spread across a decade or more. Re-application may be necessary with time, depending on other climate actions taken/the rate of drawdown of GHG emissions.  

*The biggest obstacle* is that this is not monetarily profitable, and will have to be paid by  governments/society. Economic benefits are hard to define due to the nature of measuring the effect of pH on ocean life. Ultimately, this is cost that must be paid to save the seas, not a business, and thus unlikely to be implemented before more profitable solutions.  

Desired results: a decadal reversal of ocean if acidification benefits all oceanic life aside jellyfish and acidophilic species. All fish, whales, plankton, corals, kelp, sea grasses, most oceanic life benefits. Humans benefit immensely, when we don't die with the seas belching greenhouse gasses into the air.¬†Saving the seas from going acidic is among the most crucial projects of the near term future. We save it and live, or else fail to do so and die suffocating in our own wastes.  

**Fourth solution:** widespread terrestrial revitalization through balancing of the soil biome. We can correct the imbalanced soil microbiome, revitalize exhausted land, reverse desertification and remove nearly any soil pollution simply by adding microorganisms which consume the waste products, and which excrete biologically available nutrients.  

This is not new tech, but an acceleration of existing natural cycles. Members of my family, myself among them, have worked in this industry since the early 1990s, and we have been successfully cleaning up sludge ponds, wastewater treatment plants, mining and agricultural runoff, and fuel oil spills for nearly 30 years, for pennies on the dollar as compared to other methods.  

Microbes  breed so quickly that (if properly motivated) they can remove decades of damage in a matter of months. Once you have inundated the soil, you simply must keep them wet for 90-180 days, and they will balance the soil for you, before dying out and becoming food for the next generation of soil microbes.  

In but one example, we have quietly restored several hundred square miles of desert to grasslands in the southwestern USA, and as long as the soil stays wet, the grassland keeps expanding. The total cost was $850 before water and labor.¬†Anyone can do what we do. It's bone simple and the only reason it isn't done everywhere is there's no profit in fixing people's problems virtually for free, or in giving them the means to do it themselves. As such, you've likely never heard of it, and these methods are rarely emphasized in microbiology, remediation, or environmental science. Nonetheless, they exist and work better, cheaper, faster, than any other method we've discovered.

Obstacles:  Halliburton, Monsanto, Denali, large fertilizer and chemical companies.  We put them out of business by doing their job better, cheaper, and faster. Environmental regulations and pressure groups. Sadly, environmentalists are one of the biggest obstacles to widespread  microbial soil remediation.  

Costs: next to nothing for the microbes, but lots of water is necessary to keep them alive and happy. Because untreated/minimally treated groundwater or wastewater can be used, water costs can be minimized and human drinking water preserved to the greatest possible extent. Most projects will see results within weeks, and be fully completed within 6 months. For perhaps 100 million dollars across ten years, we could turn every desert and all the marginal land on Earth (roughly 11% of Earth's surface) into vibrant, growing grasslands, rich with life and sequestering carbon more efficiently than any other landscape.  

Desired results: by revitalizing the land, we would sequester more CO2,  methane, and GHGs than any other method except for solution 1, which is  to do the same thing to the seas. Estimated offset of performing this more than 50% of annual anthropogenic emissions, as an annual offset. Additionally, the creation of multiple inches of topsoil annually multiplies the carbon sequestration of this method, but in order to improve our measuring techniques, we will likely have to implement this method and perform careful field observations.

**In conclusion**, these solutions, totalling well less than a billion dollars over a decade, would have the result of sequestering more carbon than we emit as a species. They will give us the time to implement new forms of power generation,  transportation, and infrastructure, and save us from climate apocalypse.  

*If  we could find the funds, I have the contacts for everyone we would need  to make these projects happen, and further, have access to all of the  relevant tech. We could start this immediately.*  My entire career, and my father's career, and our entire company's history has been an effort to discover the means of arresting anthropogenic global warming, and to that end, we now have the methods by which we can save the world.

We lack the financial means, and political connections, to make more than a tiny dent in the problems faced by mankind. But by sharing the knowledge we have gathered with the millions of willing and able people who wish to save our Earth, I know that we can solve this problem. Not mitigate it. Solve it dead, and live the rest of our lives on a living world. It's worth untold billions of lives. Surely, it is worth trying, is it not?  

I've  been bashing my head against the wall for years trying to catch the ear of someone with money or power, and meanwhile making a tidy living doing at small scale what I'm suggesting we do globally. But I cannot stand by any longer, watching mankind commit suicide when the means to save ourselves are within our grasp.  

It  will work. It will cost shockingly little. We will save the world in a decade, and most of what I'm proposing is profitable. We just need to get this message to the right people.¬†So, who knows some billionaires/millionaires/enough concerned citizens to fund this?¬†We  have the solutions. Let's make the conversation one of implementing  proven solutions, not one of demanding action from corrupt elites.We can fix this. So let's do it, instead of begging others to!

personalfinance,Full time job and Grad School Student Loan refunds,"Hello everyone.

I currently have a full time job that pays $53,245 (with 3% COLA raise after August 31st every year). After monthly expenses/bills, I have a fixed net income of $1,024.01 per month. I am also going to Grad School to obtain my MBA (I graduate in the fall of 2021). I have been awarded grants/scholarships and 1 unsubsidized loan (8226.00 per semester, 6% interest rate), since I have been granted the maximum aid I will expect to get a refund each semester. Each semester I will get a net amount of $8000. I have no credit card debt, I have an excellent credit score (I treat my credit card as a debit card and follow a budget), the only debt I have is roughly $18,000 in unsub and sub student loan debt from my undergraduate degree.

My dilemma here is what to do with the student loan refund. My future goals are to save up $40000 for a house and possibly pay off all my student loans.

I have came up with some choices:
- invest both net income and loan refunds. [I need an investment strategy (was thinking an SPY ETF or a mutual fund)] although it comes with risk.

- save everything into a high yield savings account (shooting for an APY of 2.15-2.55 that compounds daily)

- return the refund aid money. (From what I gather might be the best choice)

I want to gather as much information of any other choices and consequences of each so I can make a decision. I also want to know what decision to take if my student loan changes next year for example, I was no longer awarded unsubsidized loans, instead I got subsidized loans or grants.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance (4.5% on $353K) and/or focus on paying down the mortgage?,"I bought my house last spring (2018).  Probably bought the house a little sooner that I should have following best financial practices, but my now husband and I were getting married and life wise the timing made sense.  The house was $460K, we put 10% down and got a 4.5% interest rate for the rest-- I paid the house down another 10% by the end of December and had PMI taken off.

We live in Texas.  Our principle is currently $353K with a monthly payment of $3464 (includes property tax and insurance).  Our original lender sent me a refinance proposal at 3.65% for a 20 year loan, same monthly payment terms.  My credit score is around 800 and our household income is over $250k/ year (I am the primary breadwinner but my original loan was granted based on a base income of $80K).   The house is still just in my name but my husband is a service disabled veteran if that makes any impact.  

After a bit more research I feel like we got a little hosed on the 4.5% last year, and I don't think the original lender's new proposal is anywhere the best we can get, but I'm wondering if it's worth looking in to the refinance?  Ideally I'd like to sell the house in around 4 years.  

More broadly should I funnel money into paying off the house or do something else with my surplus income?  I'm making more than I have in prior years and previously was paying down student loan debt.  Theoretically I could have the house paid off by the time I'm looking to sell.

personalfinance,Anybody understand unemployment benefits?,"TLDR: Does relocating from California to Puerto Rico affect your unemployment benefits?

I am particularly interested in obtaining unemployment benefits and relocating. I am currently  employed but due to current paranoia of being fired or let go, my intentions would be to seek unemployment benefits. Based on my $80K salary, I would obtain the max of $450/week in California. Then, I would prefer to move to Puerto Rico to take advantage of Act 20 and 22 capital gains law (of 0% tax). I would divert my current savings of $250K in various investments or Bitcoin and just ride the wave to greater wealth. I currently work as an environmental engineer for the federal government and I hate my job but certainly don‚Äôt want to quit or be fired. I‚Äôve had steady employment now for almost 7 years (3 years as a contractor, nearly 4 years as government employee). I doubt I would be fired but I do want to plan for the possibility. I have been fired in menial jobs in my past which has always instilled that paranoia in me because since I‚Äôm on a single income. Sure, the notion of unemployment is appealing - get free money while everyone else is working but I certainly don‚Äôt want to deal with that uncertainty. Unlike most people, I sadly live for survival (not actually leaving) as a quintessential product of the brutal recession (not having steady employment between 2008-12 after graduating with an engineering degree in Dec. 2008).

If I relocated to Puerto Rico after receiving unemployment benefits, would that reduce or deny my benefits? The link below is very confusing. I would genuinely seek employment in Puerto Rico but that would be a hard sell to EDD because Puerto Rico‚Äôs economy is in shambles (you don‚Äôt leave California for Puerto Rico to seek work). I could easily survive on $1800 (assuming it‚Äôs not taxable). 

I could see my plan failing for a variety of reasons (assuming I was fired or let go).  #1 Unemployment benefits are not a guaranteed thing and despite many appeals, I could still be denied. #2 Assuming I am granted benefits, there is no certainty it could last up to the maximum of 26 weeks (per California). It could be abruptly cut short upon my relocation or for some unusual just cause by EDD. #3 I could move to Puerto Rico and discover that EDD has significantly cut my benefits to align with the max benefits of Puerto Rico which is $133/week (a 71% reduction). This would significantly curtail my plan to depend on unemployment benefits. #4 Assuming everything goes well, I can effectively move to Puerto Rico and get 26 weeks of $450 benefits clearing me to end of 2021...I still would have no health insurance after a loss of job. That would be a significant gamble if something goes wrong. I believe Obamacare requires you to have healthcare and there are no exemptions for unemployed.

I highly doubt that I will ever go through all this but I certainly want to explore the possibilities and learn vicariously from anyone who‚Äôs gone through such a process. I would appreciate any tips regarding this scenario. I don‚Äôt want to reap the benefits of unemployment because I could see so many things going wrong (perhaps I‚Äôm too cynical). Obviously, I would love to capitalize on Puerto Rico‚Äôs 0% capital gains laws while having steady employment in Puerto Rico and not depending on unemployment benefits but I see hell freezing over before that happening. I‚Äôve actually applied for several jobs in Puerto Rico but no luck. If there are any experts on this topic, I would really appreciate your advice. Thanks for reading.

personalfinance,"Housing trusts, are they legit?","Please forgive my ignorance, I‚Äôm trying to read up on housing trusts but I would love to hear from people who are more educated.  Thanks in advance

So I recently moved to Vermont and I am looking to purchase a home.  My credit is near 800, zero debt, take home $2,800 monthly from a federal job after paying healthcare and retirement.  No kids, have money for a down payment, closing costs and unforeseen repairs. I‚Äôm looking to spend about $125-200,000, on average my mortgage, property taxes and homeowners insurance would be $800-1,100. 

One of my coworkers was telling me she wanted to buy a home through a housing trust, as long as you met income requirements and had money for closing cost they would help get you in a home at a very affordable price.  Thing is to my understanding you don‚Äôt own the whole out right, the coop owns about a third of it if you decide to sell you have to sell it within the cooperative. 

I‚Äôm guessing that have to be some downsides because it sounds like a good deal.  Yes you don‚Äôt own the whole property but you can get into a nicer home this way.  It would allow me to get into a newer home, a home closer to the main population centers, a home with more land or some combination which would be nice. 

I‚Äôm wondering are there tax implications or are you losing money doing all the repairs and upkeep on a home you don‚Äôt fully own.  How about worrying but when you do decide to sell the trust values your home less than the free market work or you have difficulty selling because the house has appreciated enough that lower income people don‚Äôt qualify?

personalfinance,Need help with whether I should commit or drop out of college,"I just finished my first 2 years of college at a community college last May, and tomorrow is my first day for a new semester at a university I transferred to.

But due to my mother's remarriage 2 years ago and the tax return they filed jointly last year, my University determined that I do not qualify for financial aid due to my parents' income. My parents do not contribute to my college tuition due to their own financial hardships, and because of this, they have several debts, which means private Banks rejected our applications for student loans (the federal student loan isn't enough). I looked into DIRECT PARENTS PLUS loans but that'll be on my parents responsibility instead. I also have a car loan of my own that I've been paying for since over a year ago, but the car itself was stolen and I lost my job because of my loss of transportation, and insurance payout failed to cover the full auto loan.

personalfinance,"Discover vs Ally Bank (checking, savings, money market)","Hi all,

For the past two months or so, I've been ping-ponging back and forth with a decision to keep my money with Discover Bank or Ally Bank. 

I'm well aware of the pros and cons of both banks--I really like Ally's higher limits on deposits and withdrawals -- but those aren't dealbreakers.  I don't really care for Ally's app or web interface and find Discover's app and web UI to be superior.

I'm over the whole ""Discover isn't as widely accepted..."" argument as I've since made the switch to pay with credit cards (Discover and Mastercard and even a Visa prepaid that I can load using my Discover debit card using the Cash App by Square in a pinch, if needed)

Interest rates between the two seem to be on par historically with Discover currently taking the lead there (2.05% savings vs Ally's 1.9%; and 1.85% Money Market vs Ally's .9%) but that's not particularly important to me as I'm realistic and am willing to admit that for the amount of money I'll be keeping there, the difference is only a few dollars per year between the two.

I've read some negative stuff about Ally's customer service (recently) that leads me to believe they're beginning to slip into ""big bank"" territory with a more relaxed view and outlook with regards to their customer's wants and needs--where as with Discover Bank, I've recently has MANY calls with them to discuss their products and my accounts and I don't think I've EVER waited on hold and have always been made to feel like I'm an important part of their business--that means a lot to me considering I'm not really mr. moneybaggs depositing lots and lots of money.

Aside from being made to feel like they care about me, I get the feeling that if anything were to happen to my account in the form of fraud, or hacking, I'd likely have an easier time locking things down and making things ""right"" with Discover bank than I would with Ally--I'm not expecting or planning for anything like this, but the security of that thought goes a long way considering I'm talking about my personal finances.

I've been following the topics on here and searching for both ""Discover Bank"" and ""Ally Bank"" quite in depth and it seems like both are widely liked/loved -- I'm just curious if there's anyone on here who's used both, or had an experience with either that's pushed them over the edge to choose one over the other?

REFI quote: Conventional 30 year fixed rate.

Interest Rate: 3.75% APR: 3.929%

But don't I  refinance on the current principal amount left on current loan which is  closer to $281,000? It doesn't make sense to me to refi at a higher  principal balance, or am I being paranoid?

Estimated Closing Cost:

0.295% of Loan Amount (Points) =  $855.46 (&amp;lt;-I was told not to do this by a friend.)

Processing Fee: $450.00

Title - Lender's Title Insurance: $1,200.00

There  might not be any money due for closing cost due to the equity on our  home. But if we use the equity on our home to pay for the closing cost  is that bad? My gut tells me its not a good idea? So is this a good  deal? Another thing was that it was my understanding that refinancing meant I could get rid of the mortgage insurance, but I am seeing it on the refi estimate. Why would there be a mortgage insurance on a refi? Also again when refinancing don't I refi on the current principal  balance on my mortgage ($281K) and not a higher amount? Am I getting a fair deal?

personalfinance,Where to put future down payment money - savings account or principal repayment in current home?,"Hi all - going to use hypothetical numbers to illustrate the point, but hoping to get some feedback here

I currently own a condo with a 30 year 3.75% mortgage. In the next \~5 years, I plan on upgrading to a single family home. I have the downpayment (20-30%) of what I expect to pay for my next home currently in high-interest savings account. Given the relatively short time period, I don't want to put this money in the stock market and have enough in the market through other accounts.

My question is this, with interest rates coming down and savings accounts yielding less (\~1.9% on Ally), does it make sense to take the downpayment (lets say $100K) and leave it in the savings account or to pay down principal on my current mortgage with the idea that the savings in interest payments over the next five years would be greater than the interest I would earn at 1.9% (and potentially lower if rates continue to fall) over the next 5 years? The downside of this would be I would lose liquidity of having the downpayment ready to buy without being reliant on selling my current condo. The upside is that I believe I would save around $15-20K in interest over the next 5 years according to my amortization calculator. Am I overlooking anything? Thoughts/suggestions.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"21,151 CC Debt 22,000 Student Loan Debt just want advice","I‚Äôm really new to this as I have always read things on reddit but never posted and honestly I thought about making a fake name and account but at this point I care more about just venting and hearing advice than covering up my identity from others. Yes I am going to vent a lot here as I don‚Äôt have really anyone to go to but it‚Äôs the best way for me to just get out a lot of stress and hopefully somebody who does decide to read will share advice. I will also start by saying I accept fault for my situation as I know over the last decade I could of made better choices but I can‚Äôt focus on the last several years of all my wrong choices but just use this platform to let out some emotions I‚Äôve built up and to Just listen to any advice or criticism that I know o am deserving of.

I find myself at 29, approaching 30, in such a hole that I no longer have many options left from what I can see beyond debt settlement or bankruptcy. I had a friend tell me to just stop paying on my credit card as that‚Äôs what they did and wait for them to take me to court and just lawyer up and settle the debt as that would be the cheaper option than paying on this card with a high balance and extremely high interest rate, but I‚Äôm not sure just because that individual was successful that route that it would work for me even if I used his same lawyer. Honestly I have never missed a payment or had any negative marks on my credit since I have had my first card at 17 and now that I‚Äôm in such a hole financially I‚Äôm wondering if it would even matter or if it‚Äôs worth keeping a ‚Äúperfect credit history‚Äù not that my score has dropped all the way down to 590 and I can‚Äôt afford to make my payments anymore. The thought of ruining my perfect credit history use to bother me but I have reached the point with bad choices that I can‚Äôt afford to make the next payment and I know if I missed my student loan payment (which is fairly high but not as high as what I pay monthly for credit card) the consequences to me would be worse. I have tried to cover expenses for myself and my girl (as she has lost her job and hasn‚Äôt been able to find work so it‚Äôs just been my income covering us both) but at this point I feel like I have failed since it has been over a year since she had a job and I‚Äôve just got into a deeper hole over this span of time.  I don‚Äôt intend to talk negatively either on her as well as this isn‚Äôt what this post is about as I know she has tried to find work. We have one car and live with my sister in a small town with no work and the nearest jobs are roughly 20-40 minutes away and she isn‚Äôt able to drive. I work 40 plus hours from Friday to Sunday with my job that‚Äôs 48 minutes away that I‚Äôve worked the last 8 years (that I intend to keep working as I am enrolled in a public service student loan forgiveness program) so most jobs don‚Äôt even give her a call back because she isn‚Äôt available to work during the weekend with my current work schedule (and no bus systems run from our city to the closets one with any jobs to apply for and the cost to Uber wouldn‚Äôt make sense from how far we live) and I keep trying to apply for a second job to work Monday-Thursday part time or full time but no job will hire me it seems like for not being available to work on the weekend. I am a diabetic as well and I use to be able to work two jobs when i was younger a few years back but I find myself unable to stand for over a couple hours as the nerve pain in my feet has gotten so bad so I‚Äôm limited to what I search for in a second job as it can‚Äôt be one involving standing and walking for long periods of time. I know that might just sound like an excuse or complaining but I‚Äôm sure any other diabetic can relate to this issue and I know my biggest reason for my nerve pain getting so bad is I haven‚Äôt been able to afford my medications anymore. So back when I was able to work my current job and another at a retail location it was difficult but still manageable and I did it for awhile but that was years ago and I no longer have that ability. My car isn‚Äôt dependable enough to do Uber or anything like that and constantly breaks down but I can‚Äôt afford to buy a new one or even get a loan for one and luckily I own it so I don‚Äôt have to make car payments (which I couldn‚Äôt afford now). I feel bad like I‚Äôm suppose to be the provider for my girl and two dogs and just knowing the situation I‚Äôm facing has put me in such a low place emotionally. I fear I‚Äôll never be in a position to bring a child into this world and it kills me to even think that.

So the financial side of things that I hope I can seek out even just any advice for, my current monthly income is roughly 1400 a month and after slashing every possible monthly expense I could only get things down to about 1350. Those monthly expenses include 200 a month I spend on gas for work, 60 for liability car insurance, 108 for my student loan, 50 for dog food, 60 for medications(I can‚Äôt afford all my meds I need as a diabetic but I‚Äôm not even really able to afford this 60) 450 a month on my rent, and 450 on credit card minimum payments. These are the monthly expenses I can‚Äôt cut and so that leaves me only $50 a month for groceries for 2 people, personal care (such as toiletries, deodorant, etc, car expenses (which are constant as I have a older vehicle that often has problems, and other random expenses that pop up such as doctor visits and dental work, vision needs (such as new glasses and eye exams).  I have 21,151 in credit card debt and 22,000 in student loan debt and I just don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt expect a hand out either of course that‚Äôs why I have turned to making this post. I only seek advice such as what strategy to pursue (do I get a lawyer and go for bankruptcy or do what my friend succeeded with and just stop paying on my credit card and lawyer up when they look to take legal action and hope to settle?). I haven‚Äôt felt this lost or torn on a matter in my life and everything has been spiraling downward out of control the last several months. I know some solutions would be ‚Äúyou should move somewhere closer to work‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have the money in my bank to afford let deposits, first month rent, security deposits, and moving expenses. Thank you to anybody who can offer advice. 

I know many will be critical and have much to say, I don‚Äôt want this to sound like I‚Äôm asking for money or looking for pity and trust me I accept fault for my poor decisions through the last couple years to get me into this situation. Grateful for the words of wisdom from all the minds that come across this post. Thank you for listening.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage options: lender credit vs. buy down option,"Hey all,

I am in the process of refinancing my mortgage and have a question about what others would do. I have been approved at an interest rate of 3.875%, which comes with a lender credit of $1,088.  I could also ""buy down"" the rate to 3.625% for $725.

That is a total difference of $1,813 for a difference of $41 in monthly Principle+Interest payments.  It would take just over 44 months (3.5+ years) to ""make back"" that money if I buy down, but over the life of the loan (30 years - assuming minimum monthly payments) I would save $14,809.53.

My wife and I agree that this is NOT a forever home for us, but definitely see us staying here for 10+ years - assuming no job change, which certainly isn't expected.  Either way, we do plan on paying extra towards the mortgage, with hopes to be mortgage free in 10 years - whether we move or not.

So, would you keep the $1,800 or buy down to save over the long term?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: in case it's not clear, we would not ""get"" the $1,088 lender credit.  It would be applied to our closing costs - which we currently plan to roll into the new mortgage.  The $725 would be cash we bring to close.  Therefore, we would technically only have $725 (of the $1,800) in cash to invest instead of buy down the mortgage rate.",finance

personalfinance,Why not Refinance?,"Is there any reason one shouldn't look into refinancing?   


Skipping a month on mortgage payments seems especially nice. With the loan to equity ratio improving every year, is there any reason one should not look into refinancing every year?   


Obviously higher interest rates would be bad. but outside of interest rates, why wouldn't you want to refinance?   


Does anyone take ""points"" in refinancing to get cash out from the lender? I spoke to a lender who will offer cash towards principal payment if i take some extra points on the loan. Which is essentially free money upfront with the caveat of paying more in interest over the life of the loan. Pending on the terms of the loan, I believe I could refinance again next year with a similar loan, giving me more money out towards the principal.",finance

solar,Residential and the 30% Tax credit,"Folks, there's a fair bit about the federal tax credit that suggests that you can still get 30% on your system even if you install in 2020 by spending 5% on the system in 2019. However, our research suggests that residential systems do not qualify for this. There are two sections of tax code that describe the tax benefits. One is for residential and the other is for commercial. The commercial tax code makes this clear but nothing makes it clear for residential installations.

The conservative, non-tax professional in me suggests I tell customers that it has to be installed in 2019 to get 30%. The risk taker in me says, don't worry the IRS will never catch you anyway. (Shirley, I'm jesting and stop calling me Shirley).

business,The Business of Management ‚Äî Daily Small Business Advice to Help Keep You Going ‚Äî Lesson 1: Standardize,"Happy Monday and Best Business Wishes!

Short Intro:

I have been a part of this subreddit for a couple of months now. Admittedly, I came here to try and find leads for my own business, but found a really nice little community of people giving each other real help and I am here to do that very same thing.

By profession, I am a Senior Advisory Consultant for a firm in DC that deals predominantly with Government agencies and large corporations where I focus on Financial Management Operations, Strategic Planning, Budget, and Financial Reporting. A few months ago my wife and I decided to begin the process of shedding the corporate yoke and start a business of our own, and there began the life of Terragon Solutions LLC. I provide small business owners, sole proprietors, and individuals with business management advisory services, strategy, budget, career counseling, interview coaching, and project management support to help get their own business and ventures off the ground.

Working in the corporate and federal worlds have their own challenges and rewards, but at the end of the day, unless you are at the top, you are just another cog in the machine. You help make decisions, you provide your insight, and invest your time and passion in the hopes that maybe you will have affected change, in whatever way you can. Working with small businesses and individuals is an incredible passion for me because everything you do as a small business owner can truly mean the life or death of your business, and your livelihood by extension.

If I can express my own passion through helping to make your life easier as a business owner and be the value add that helps you grow and thrive, then I know I am making a difference in the best way I know how.

Now, onto the first lesson!

STANDARDIZATION:

The first thing that might come to mind when you read this word may be a clipboard with a list of tasks to accomplish or some pencil-thin man in glasses and a bow-tie reading off a procedural manual. In a word, ""boring."" But this underappreciated principle is one of the most difficult and costly lessons that a small business owner will learn as they build their business from the ground up. It is a critical lesson they will wish they had invested the time developing a model for before wasting countless man-hours in trial and error, do-overs, and needless refinement to get to where they eventually end up.

We have all read the statistics of small business failure rates within the first year and in my experience, one of the least appreciated, but most glaringly obvious points of failure is the utter lack of standard procedures, processes, and planning when faced with the daily operation and care of business practices.

Now, I understand completely; starting a business from scratch is daunting in and of itself without adding layers of procedure to the mix, especially for things that will be the bread and butter of your business practice or offerings. What standardization does is provide a framework and a baseline from which you as a business owner can automate your day to day, priority to priority. 

Think of it like this: we all have a morning routine right? Get up at 6 am, brush your teeth, get dressed, make coffee (or tea), read emails, and the work day begins.

Well, that is a standardized process. Every day, you start off in just about the same way with a standard framework for how you will attack the rest of the day, almost without thinking about it, but you can tweak it as needed to accommodate the random turnings of life. Running a business has random turnings every single day, but devising a framework to attack each of the most important aspects of running your business is key to ensuring longevity, flexibility, and readiness to address whatever issues may arise, calmly and effectively.

Standardization in the way that I mean to teach you has several pieces to it. Every process should be given the same care and attention so that you can put it all together to make the bigger masterpiece that is your business:

1. **Identify the Process:**
   1. Whether it is getting your financials in order or ordering supplies for the next big project, identifying the process and putting it down on paper is crucial. 
      1. What steps do I take every time I must accomplish this task? 
      2. What steps do I miss or avoid the most?
      3. Are there steps I am missing?
      4. What are **‚ÄúBest Practices‚Äù** when it comes to this particular task?

***Write it down***

1. **Organize Your Necessary Resources:**
   1. You know what you have to do. Thinking about the right materials and taking stock first is a tremendous time saver.
      1. Do I have everything I need to do it? 
      2. Am I using the best materials?
      3. Am I using the most cost-effective materials?
      4. Is everything close by and easily accessible?
      5. Do I have the people I need to do this effectively?

Centralizing what you need helps save time, effort, and money in the long run.

***Write it down***

1. **Schedule Your Time:**
   1. There is always a best time to  accomplish a certain task. I save time on my commute when I leave at 6:30 as opposed to 7:00 am because traffic is much lighter. Scheduling my bills for the 1st or last day of the month helps me plan my household budget.
      1. When does a task *need* to be completed?
      2. Do other tasks rely on the completion of this one?
      3. How much time does this take?
      4. When is the *optimal* time to do it?

Answering these questions can save you immensely in time and money. 

***Write it down***  


1. **Plan Around It:**
   1. Incorporating your process into your overall business plan helps pave the way toward cementing your overall Line of Business (LoB). These are all the processes that make up your business goals and shape your outcomes. 
      1. What happens next? 
      2. Does this fit?
      3. Does my plan make sense? 
      4. What are the risks?
      5. How do I tie these different processes together? 

***Write it down!***

1. **Iterate, Tweak, and Optimize:**
   1. You will find that as you implement these small steps into any process that there are places where you are definitely lacking resources, wasting time, spending too much, or just plain don't need to do it, even if you really thought that you did. This is the perfect time and opportunity to flex your small business muscle and find better ways to do what you are already doing or cut out processes that you find you don‚Äôt need. This process is the **BEST** way of increasing profit margins, finding cost savings, improving the quality of your work, and impacting your business outcomes. A new client is great, but discovering that you have been leaving money on the table is often the best way to keep your business healthy in the long term.
      1. Is there a better way to do this?
      2. How much time could I save if I did this another way?
      3. How much does this process cost me?
      4. Are there products on the market that could save me time and money by automating this task?

***Write it down!***

Rightfully so, a lot of you are going to think that this is obvious and rudimentary and I completely agree. But if you take the time to read through the steps, how many of you have really sat down and done this for each of your critical processes, collected, and then studied the data that a real focus on these steps helps to yield?

Landing a client is the heart of any business. Providing services or sales of things people want and need is the very essence of community, society, and business. It is the glue that holds us together through a mutual understanding that what I pay you will yield a desired and quality result. Not to mention, it pays the bills and puts food on the table. 

What we often fail to realize and acknowledge though, is that while the heart needs to drum on, the brain needs to make the decisions that keep that heart beating. Taking the time to think about each of your processes and how they interconnect - from execution to invoices - helps you make the decisions necessary to ensure that you are providing your customers with the best service or products in the best possible way, while keeping every dollar you can in your own pocket to put back into your business, or even keep it at whatever size you want to keep it. 

Taking a critical look into what you do, how you do it, and how you can standardize it and optimize it is the best first step any small business owner (or aspiring small business owner) can take toward growing their business, improving their products and services, and increasing their  

bottom line. Most importantly, it gives us the critical information that each of us needs to make the best decisions for our businesses.

I hope this helps. See you next time!",finance

energy,How to build of a New Photovoltaic Plant,"Hello, I dont know if this is the right subreddit but I am having some doubts about how to make a new photovoltaic plant for my city/state. The target size is small/medium, only for some portion of the population. The goal is to start, make something good for the community and this world. If everything goes good, then the pv plant can grow.

All the plants Ive heard of are made by some big companies which I guess they have big $$$ to invest or get some loans from big banks, so I dont know how to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

Im from M√©xico so excuse me for my english if I don¬¥t explain something right. Im a Civil Engineer and I have a masters in Energy Administration and Renewable Resources, so I kind of know how to build stuff and I understand energes but I have never worked on the energy field and only as an administrator for some company building schools, houses, small buildings and remodelation and also as a consultant for construction companies.

Im from a small city (\~\~400k Population) named Cd. Obreg√≥n in the state of Sonora, M√©xico. Most of the city energy comes from a Thermoelectric plant in the southern state of Sinaloa which is conected to the grid. For those that doesnt know the location, Sonora is in the northwest of M√©xico at the border with Arizona, USA. The state is a great geographical zone with a Yearly Averaged Insolation Incident On A Horizontal Surface of about 6 kWh/m2/day.

&amp;#x200B;

The question and some other info:

¬øHow do I create a new photovoltaic plant in M√©xico and how to sell its energy?

* I have access to land. My father is an agricultor and have about 100 hectares (\~\~250 acres) of land outside the city (10-15km), its fertile soil/land which I know is more expensive than just plain ground but if I cant find land for the project, it may be used.
* All the energy in M√©xico is sold by CFE (Comision Federal de Electricidad or Federal Electricity Commission). I know that from X kWh i need to get a permit. I guess I have to make a contract with CFE in which I establish how much energy kWh I will generate and how much they are willing/obligated to buy and for how much time. ( I get I can be generating for example, 150-200kWh but if they are only obligated to buy 120 by contract they will only pay for 120 or thats what i believe.)
* The idea is to make this project mostly on private investment. Maybe start with a small project but the idea is to start and then grow while selfinvesting the profits so we can move to green energies. Ive made some budgets at the past while studying but I know all of them are just test to ""learn the process"" so I want to know what is the real investment I have to make for a plant of X size, the maintenance/operation costs and the ROI. Have any of you heard of any similar project?
* How big a PV plant can be with 250k USD, setting this as a starting point. (In terms of area needed and kWh generated). 500k USD, 750k USD, 1000k USD.
* Which kind of Solar Panels, structure, grid, inverters, cleaning, do you recommend. Do the solar plant need any kind of insurance? Any tips are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: ¬øHow to make a small PV Plant in M√©xico for selling its energy entirely or mostly on private investment.?

Ive made some budgets at the past while studying but I know all of them are just test to ""learn the process"" so I want to know what is the real investment I have to make for a plant of X size, the maintenance/operation costs and the ROI.

personalfinance,"New car purchase, available large downpayment, gap insurance","I have been thinking about our next new car purchase, and am wondering if having a large downpayment is really a good idea. 

We typically have a 50% downpayment when we buy a new car. For example, in 2017 we bought a 30k Legacy and had 15k down. We have very low monthly payments and at 0% interest, we are paying the minimum (and no, we didn't refuse cash back or a rebate to get 0%. 0% was the only incentive Subaru offered)

But now that we are saving for our next vehicle, likely 40-45k (need a suv for our growing family, thinking Highlander Hybrid), I am wondering if it's ""safer"" to use a minimal downpayment, and purchase gap insurance, on the chance we total the vehicle after purchase. 

If we drove off the lot and got in an accident within the first year or two of ownership, we would essentially ""lose"" part of the downpayment due to depreciation. But if we offer no downpayment, purchase gap insurance, and total the car, the only financial loss to use would be interest and the cost of the gap insurance. 

It's not a issue of being able to afford the car or the payment. That isn't a concern. We have great credit, so interest rates should be fine, and that cost minimal. In fact, once the replacement value equalizes to the vehicle cost, we would just pay it off saving some interest on the back end. 

If it makes any difference, we buy vehicles for the long haul- 12-16 years. So unless the car would be totaled or a lemon, we won't be selling during the repayment period.

Edited to add: we would still have the downpayment in our account. I am not talking about NOT saving, I am talking about just NOT using the cash as a downpayment.  When the payoff value and the car value were equal, we would pull the money out to likely just pay it off.",finance

investing,Will Bond Mutual Funds pay a dividend when negative interest rates come to America?,"The experts are saying it is only a matter of time before negative interest rates come to America (From Europe).  Now I know that dividends paid to bond owners and interest paid to people who have money in the bank are different things but in time negative interest rates for bank depositors would cause people and businesses to put their money in bond funds and  I would expect bond dividends to reach near-zero unless you are talking about risky junk bond funds.  The European version of treasury bonds is now negative. And the European Bond Market is crazy.

So in time won't negative interest rates pretty much destroy the bond market which I understand is bigger than the stock market in volume.  With the bond market soon to be in crisis, where would retired folks put their money to protect themselves against stock market crashes?",finance

personalfinance,Streamline-IRRL (VA loan refinance) question!,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I was hoping to gain insight on a question as a relatively new homeowner. 

Background- bought a home in PA October 2018. Used a VA loan to get the home and settled it with a loan of 281k and 4.5% interest. I pay about 1820 a month. 278k left on loan.

Today I get multiple offers from various companies about streamlining my loan. After talking to two companies here‚Äôs what I was offered.

Current mortgage company - change loan to 3.5% interest. New payment about 1650 a month , up front fees 1500-2000$.

Competing offer- 3% interest rate, new payment around 1580 a month. Will require 8000$ to be added on to what is leftover in current loan.

So here‚Äôs my two questions.  

One is the streamline-IRRL for VA loan as good as it sounds? I feel like there is still more to it besides upfront cost

Two, between these which is the better offer if we decide to go for it? I understand the interest rate is better but it has significantly more cost.

personalfinance,Should I do a balance transfer with my new credit card?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a recent college graduate - I have about five credit cards. I have a total CC avilable at around $12-$13k  (but subtract the current utilization and I have around $9-10k available to me). I also have a car loan that my dad cosigned for me at around $11k. I have $30k in federal student loans. I just got a new credit card with my checking account at a limit of $5k. (I went into the bank to reset my password and they offered me a card, which I don't plan on using.. but he talked about a balance transfer which enticed me.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have two credit cards at the same APR (15.24% or so..) one is a Discover card with $1500/$1500 \[maxed out\] and a Bank of America card at $2300/$2300 \[also maxed\]. I just got a job and am working to pay them off by January. I want to set aside around $600 a month total to pay off both cards. I don't make much, only around 20k a year, and am working currently for experience until I apply to medical school. I owe about $3700 combined, to the banks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want any more of this debt lingering, and by January is when my grace period ends on my school loans - so my plan is to finish paying them off by January and then start paying school loans (around $300 a month already)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is it smart to take advantage of the 0% APR for 12 months or so on this new card and transfer both of my balances on my other card to this new one? So I don't have to accrue any more interest? My banker did the math and he stated I'd be paying around $500 in interest versus the \~$200 fee I'd have to pay the bank for the transfer balance instead.

But I slipped up and started spending money I didn't have at the time, and now I'm in a bind. I just want to finish paying it all off and want to know if this is feasible. My banker said I have about 60 days to make a decision on the balance transfer, if I want to do it.

A. Make additional payments on the loan I am already paying down which has a lower interest rate, but the additional income would go to the principal of the loan.

B. Pay the minimum on the lower loan and use the additional income on the higher interest loan, which I have been letting interest accrue on, so the money would all go to interest. 

C. Invest/ open an IRA with the money

personalfinance,My plan to eliminate $3k CC debt in 16 months.,"Using a throwaway because none of my friends need to know about these issues.

I am a 22 year old male in the Northeastern US. I currently have a 662 TransUnion and a 676 Equifax, I'm not sure about the FICO. I made some poor personal decisions regarding assisting parents in financial difficulties and in dealing with the personal strain it put on *my* finances, I racked up roughly $4k in CC debt across three accounts ranging between 27-29% interest.

I have not spent on the cards since then unless absolutely necessary; gas while paycheck-to-paycheck, and *those purchases* have always been paid off as sson as I could. Still, the balance loomed over my head.

In the last year, I have since moved out of my parents' house and into an apartment with my girlfriend. Almost immediately, I cut a solid 70% of my nonessential spending and thought I was doing well, paying above the minimums on the cards with the avalanche method. My credit score was slowly working its way up. I planned on clearing my ledger in approximately 3 years (given the relatively high minimums and the amount of money I thought I was able to put away). That is, until earlier this month.

Early in August, my father had planned a vacation. I didn't want to go, but it was paid for. I literally couldn't not go without isolating myself from my family (made harder by the recent divorce of my parents), and as much as the financial clashes hurt me, I still love my dad. I missed out on an entire paychecks' worth of income and following vehicular trouble prior to the vacation, had to wipe out my personal emergency fund in order to make sure my car ran. The vacation came and went, and I found it hard to enjoy myself. Upon returning from the vacation, I immediately looked into methods of quickly reducing and eventually eliminating this debt.

My initial plan was to take $200/mo. spread across three accounts and eventually pay the debt along three years. I'd still accrue a shitload of interest along the way, but it'd have gotten done. 

My work at this for the year or so prior to the vacation had paid off, and it seems like I have a solution to this problem. On a whim, I stopped into a local credit union to ask about opening a checking/savings account with them. The representative and I got to talking about debt, and I mentioned I might be interested in debt consolidation. Three days, and one meeting later, I'm approved for a 3-year loan that covers my CC debt entirely with a minimum monthly roughly $50/mo. less than my CC minimums combined and an interest rate significantly (about 11%) lower than my highest CC interest rate.

As soon as the money is financed into my account, I plan on wiping the balances on all three cards to zero. The two cards with the highest interest rate will be closed and forgotten about for the rest of time. The last card, the lowest APR card, will be used weekly for gas expenses and small recurring payments and paid off in its' entirety every month in order to keep utilization at a reasonable number and rebuild the damage I've done.

I'm still planning on paying that $200/mo. into the personal debt consolidation loan, but with a lower monthly and a lower interest rate over roughly the same (planned) term; I couldn't be happier.

My budget allows me to save roughly $2-550/mo on top of monthly expenses and the $200/mo. loan repayment until my emergency fund is replenished. After that, the payment on my personal loan will increase and I'll begin to deposit into a proper savings account in anticipation for a retirement account when I have a proper career.

Without you guys, I'd have never been able to determine the proper course of action that led up to the loan, and I certainly wouldn't have known what to do after the loan was approved.

I know it's not the course of action that you all might have taken, but it's taken a load of stress off of my shoulders and will allow me to be CC-debt-free by the time I graduate college. Just in time for student loans, yay!",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on investing in land,"Hey guys, I'm 23 years old and I plan on buying my first property. This weekend my parents and I went down to a pretty popular lake in southern Virginia where they were having a liquidation sale on lake-front and lake-access plots. When we arrived all the lots were getting sold pretty quickly so we were under a lot of pressure, but my parents ended up deciding to go for a .32 acre lake-front plot for $165k and I decided to get a .48 acre lake-access plot that is around 300 yards from the lake for $40k. My parents wanted this land as a potential building project, but I wanted it as an investment property to sell once the area is more developed and the land value gets a lot higher.

&amp;#x200B;

What we did not know about purchasing land before we agreed was that most banks do not give out land loans and that the interest rates for them are much higher than homes. When we started looking at financing options, my parents decided that they could not comfortably make the monthly payments for the property for it to be a smart investment for them. We found out through a lawyer friend of ours that since the community has $600 yearly HOA fees, they can pull out of the deal and get their 25% down payment back. They called the sellers and they agreed to pay them back their down payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my parents think that I should back out of my property as well. Right now I am putting down $12k that includes the 25% down payment and the $2k closing costs. The loan they are offering for the rest comes at 4.25% interest over 5 years. I cannot afford to pay full price for the lot right now so I would have to take out a loan. The lot is in a wealthy community that comes with a boat docking ticket and a free country club golf membership. This will be my very first investment so I admittedly don't know whether what I am doing is smart. I need to make a decision by Wednesday. Are my parents right? Is this a poor investment? Will I see a return on investment a few years down the line? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,"Am I being too conservative paying extra on all debts, instead of paying minimal and investing?","Hey all! Long time lurker first time poster:

I was just checking in on the finances and started to wonder with all the talk of a possible upcoming recession forecast by the yield curve inversion... well I have some questions about what to expect interest rate / opportunity wise. My current situation is I have always heard paying off a debt with whatever interest rate is the equivalent of investing in an interest baring account that guarantees the rate of return the debt. Here are the two major payments as examples:

car financing = 324/mo -- 18k remaining @ 3.49 APY ( I currently pay an extra $175/mo on this making it $500/mo)

mortgage = 1,200/mo -- 200k remaining @ 4.56 APY (I currently pay and extra $200/mo on this making it $1400/mo)

In this example I have an extra $375 I'm paying towards debts each month and based on their rates that's the equivalent of investing and getting a 3.49 to 4.56 rate of return -- except it's guaranteed as opposed to other investment options which contain risk.

So, questions:

1 - During a recession, (when there is less money moving around?), are banks looking to entice customers by lowering interest rates to get / keep customers they know are good for making payments (high credit score - to keep them to moving to another bank at a better rate). Or during a recession to banks raise interest rates because money supply is low (people not spending/investing). I'm thinking of this in the context of should I expect an opportunity to to consolidate/refinance to lower rates on existing accounts? Reading on this it sounds like quantitative easing comes into play and interest rates do lower but not for the reasons i think it would...

2 - If #1 is true then that means i can hopefully lock in an even lower interest rate, but that makes the ""investment"" side of this current arrangement weaker... Lets say banks drop interest rates a point and instead of 3.5-&gt;4.5% it goes to 2.5-&gt;3.5, well now, my question would be does it still make sense to pay extra on the loans? Or at such a low rate of return would it make sense to start looking at alternative investments like real-estate, stocks, crypto, etc.. 

3 - Even if #1 is false (that is banks don't lower interest rates) then still -- what is everyone here doing? If you knew a recession was coming and you had some extra income, what would you do, save up to make stock/real-estate purchases during the recession, or what other types of hard assets/strategies are you considering?

**""If anybody can modify it, then that source can go f***ed-up.""**


Then the guy answered,


**""If that suggestion for revision is stupid, the owner of that open-source would not accept that suggestion for revision""**


Here, he mentioned the **""owner""** of open-source here. There's gotta be someone controlling that open-source, which means it is not decentralized. So this is where I don't get the meaning of ""open""-source.

personalfinance,Fixing my credit score to get better mortgage interest rates,"So a few things before I get into the meat of my questions

I love in California, married, and my wife owns a condo that we current live in. I am not on the mortgage at all. My wife and I work, and both make slightly under what our job descriptions call for, but the mortgage on the condo, property tax, and general monthly bills can all be covered by my wife's salary alone.

I had student loans with the department of education and Navient (private loans). I was always broke before I met my wife, so I didnt pay them at all, the DOE ones defaulted eventually and went to a collections agency. With help from my amazing wife, I was able to settle my DOE loans, and pay off my private loans completely.

Using tools available through bank portals, I tracked my credit score from low 500s to 760, and I was stoked. We went into a bank to get preapproval for a mortgage loan because we would like to buy a house. After having my credit report ran, it turns out my score is actually 680, a whole 80 points off, and that is forcing my loan rate to skyrocket.

TLDNR: Defaulted student loans, settled some, paid others. Its hurting my credit for mortgage loan now.

My questions are, how can I get those negatives, such as collections and defaults removed from my credit report? Neither DOE or collection agency say they can do anything. If i were to dispute one credit bureau, would that propagate to the other ones? How can I get a better rate when getting a mortgage loan?

personalfinance,How does my budget look?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

So i pulled a credit report from the listed bureau at the bottom of the letter. it shows this timeshare on it. i have had this time share since end of 2014. i stopped paying it beginning of 2018. 

* how can they only report it this long after i stopped paying it?
   * Will it be 7 years from the first missed payment, or 7 years from this ""update""?
* If they reported it to the bureau before i took out my mortgage in the end of 2017 (before i stopped paying it), i believe that my credit score would have been higher, and i could have gotten a better interest rate. Could i sue them for that?  
* I believe the balance to be incorrect. their is a ""Balance"" and ""updated balance"" that are vastly different.",finance
personalfinance,Help me with Student Loan Decision!!,"Hello redditors! This is my first ever reddit post but I'm really out of my depth in the world of loans (luckily?)

TL;DR should I use federal loans to pay off private loans? using debt to pay off other debt?

Anyway, I'll try to explain this well. I'm doing an accelerated nursing program, second degree BSN. My undergraduate degree, the first one, was paid for by my parents- I'm extremely thankful for that. But they said they'd pay for one degree, which is completely fair. So here I am taking out loans for this one. For everything- living expenses included. So I'm racking up quite a bill as you can imagine. 

Here's the situation I need advice about: This is my last semester, and I still have federal loans to use since those weren't used in my first undergraduate degree. For this semester, the loans available total **$6,184.** ($2,721 from Federal Subsidized Loan and $3,463 Federal Unsubsidized). This amount has already been applied to my account balance for this semester. Okay so I received, thankfully, a $9,000 scholarship for this semester, a true blessing. Some of this will go to my remaining balance ($1,242 of tuition/fees) and some to my living expenses (rent, groceries, gas) for this last semester. But the rest I will have leftover. I could return the Federal Loans then for this semester/cancel them. They are automatically at 4.5% interest, I'm assuming this interest rate is for all federal loans? 

HOWEVER, from past semesters of my program, I have **$21,273 of loans/debt** through Sallie Mae, at interest rates ranging from 8-12% based on the loan. Here's my question and the reason for this post. Should I keep the federal loans that I have for this semester, that I've just been given, and use these funds to pay off some of my Sallie Mae debt, since the interest rates for the Sallie Mae loans are way higher??? OR do I just cancel the Federal Loans for this semester

personalfinance,1099e and how to take HSA and 401k out of it,"Hello! Not sure if this is the right place but....

As an egg donor I am considered an independent contractor. So if I get chosen and go through the procedure, they cut me a check and then send me a 1099-misc form in January to use when doing my tax return. They always tell you to save about 30% to pay taxes from. 

This donation I will be getting $10,000, and I'm curious if I take part of this and put it in my 401k or HSA will this make my taxes owed go down? Also, is there a form for this so that it comes out pre-tax or can I just add a contribution and then it gets automatically adjusted come tax return time?

investing,The sectors - an introduction,"Hej everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

over the last couple of days and weeks I have dug myself into the world wide web to learn about investing. Far too late, at least in my opinion, I discovered this topic for me and have spent most of my time scavenging the web for information and compiling one Google Spreadsheet after another containing said information. Now, all the information that I have come across has helped me to understand something and those spreadsheets with all that information is what I want to share to those who are on the same path as I am. Maybe some of the more experianced investors in the sub also take a look just out of curiosity and maybe some of those will leave some input which I would find fantastic!

&amp;#x200B;

So the first thing I had to learn about were the different sectors and this is what this post is about. It is nothing groundbreaking and no rocket sience, but I have learned something out of this too. I understood the concept of diversification as a way to split the risks of loosing across different sectors since it is very unlikely that all will crash at once. That this concept carries a lot further than that is comething that I just then realised. Here is what I have learned:

&amp;#x200B;

\- You split your investments across different sectors to split the risk of a sector failing and ""loosing"" your investment

\- Different sectors carry different risks with them

\- The risk within a sector can originate from different sources: Consumer Discretionaries: Economic cycle, Energy: Political Events, Utilities: Interest rate and so on

\- You can not only offset the risk of loosing you investment by diversification, but you can also offset the risk with a (in comparison) saver investment (Consumer staple : Consumer Discretionaries)

\- Offsetting the risk reduces the fluctuations within an investment portfolio and smoothens the highs and lows

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I went through the articles regarding the different sectors on investopedia and noted everything down for myself for later reference. This is what the Google Sheet is all about. I combined different sectors into one sheet since this is how I am treating them within my portfolio since I regard them as one or they are so similar that it makes sense in my mind. As an example:

\- Consumer Goods: Consumer staples + Consumer Discretionaries 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some combinations might not be understandable at first, like: 

Energy: Energy + Utilities

Utilities also includes partially areas that I would count towards energy. The problem is that energy is considered a basic utility that it is taken out of the energy sector and added to the utility. I am only including the energy part of utilities into the energy sector. The remainder I count towards the industrial sector. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides listing the key points of the respective article (link is also provided), I also listed a couple of companies to just give an idea (not as recommondations!). If you have any questions feel free to ask, if you have any comment, feel free as well.

Income after expenses is $2,394. Now I need help in making the decision of whether or not to stay in our apartment and throw all of our extra cash at our student loans, or to save up for a down payment on  a small house after our lease ends in august 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things to consider.

* She's not done with school. She's currently working as a CNA and has about 1.5 years left to finish her nursing degree. She hopes to get back to school next september with in-state tuition. Additionally, her employer is offering to pay for the tuition. Once she's done, her income will likely triple as nurses can get a job anywhere and are almost recession proof.
* I hope to stay at my current job for at least 5 years (this comes into play for buying a home). They have AMAZING benefits (7% 401k matching, 8-12% bonus, 10% profit sharing), The 401k isn't fully vested until 5 year and since I just started in June, I hope to stay with them as long as possible. My job isn't recession proof but the industry I'm in makes money whether the market goes up or down and the company didn't lay off anyone in 2008 so I think I have pretty decent job security.
* Median home prices in our area are $383,000. However, I have found many beautiful homes for less than $250,000. So minimum down payment needed is $50,000
* My employer has a student loan assistance program, paying an additional $167/month for up to 5 years to my loans.

Option 1) - Pay off loans before buying a house

Using [undebt.it](https://undebt.it) and the avalanche method, if I were to allocate $1000 of our budget instead of $720, we would have our loans paid off by 2025 with a total interest paid to about 10k. However, that's allocating only an additional 300 out of the remaining $2400. I would crank that to $2000 of our budget, which would leave the remaining monthly cash roughly 700 and our loans paid off by 2022 with a total of 5k interest paid.

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Paid off Student loans quickly with minimal interest|Spending $1400 of rent and not building equity|
|Don't have to worry about housing maintenance|Only saving $10k in total interest paid vs 10 year payment|
||Rent will likely go up every year|

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2) Save up for the next year, paying the minimum on our loans

So instead of taking that 2000 and using it to pay off our loans, we can put it aside for a down payment. For the time being, the money is being used for our wedding and honeymoon in november, so let's assume we can start saving in december. Given the timeline that we have to either renew our lease or move by August 2020, that gives us 9 months to save. This would allow us to save up to $18000 by august for a down payment, which isn't anywhere close to the $50k mentioned about. I've thought about an FHA loan and paying PMI until we get to 20% equity then refinancing to conventional. Additionally, we would definitely be able to afford a 15yr mortgage as that would put our monthly payment to  2,448  (assuming 4% APR -- Includes taxes and insurance) which ~~doesn't strain our budget at all~~ kind of strains our budget now that I've considered taxes and insurance. It does leave some wiggle room for home maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|We get to buy a house|Can't pay student loans as quickly|
|Monthly payment goes towards equity|We take on more debt|
|Monthly Payment doesn't go up|Paying a total of $16k of student loan interest|

&amp;#x200B;

So I know this is extremely long and I doubt anyone has read this far. But if you have, I applaud your resolve and would love to know your thoughts. Is there anything I'm missing? Am I an idiot or too aggressive/conservative in my estimates? Is there another option I haven't even considered yet? Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Received 65k Life Insurance Payout - How do I best use it to invest for my younger brothers futures? [Massachusetts],"Throwaway because this information is not a particular secret to some of my friends, and I dont need it tied back to my main. I also poked through some of the PF wiki pages, but didn't quite find any one post that fit this. Please let me know if I missed something! 

Background: Earlier this year my mother passed away, and her life insurance policy for $65k was paid out to me. She also was a retired state worker, and on her retirement had selected an Option C, which continues to make monthly pension payouts for the rest of the life of the named beneficiary. She selected my middle brother, as he is on state disability. These payments will be roughly $1800/mo for him, and will go towards living expenses and a small savings. I (29) largely have my own finances in a manageable state and plan on using a small portion (\~5k) of the policy to pay off a credit card and one of my smaller student loans. It's been enough time that all the post-death stuff is largely resolved, or at least in a manageable state. My issue is how do I best use the rest of that to help plan for my two younger brothers futures? (Note that our father is very much still around, but just isn't particularly relevant for this.)

My brothers are 26 and 23 - the 26 year old is on disability and is currently unemployed (note that his payments from the state will likely stop once he starts receiving the pension payments). The 23 year old works in retail while going to school part time (college expenses are low enough that I can cover the gap between his federal loans and the school bill). Since my mom passed, I've taken on financial support for my youngest brother, and my middle brother lives with our dad. Everyone's normal monthly expenses are already in a stable state, and I have an emergency fund that I maintain for myself, and also anything that comes up for the family.

Of the $60k, I think it's best to keep $10k liquid as a family-specific emergency fund. I've used the one I have now to help my parents with covering family emergencies in the past, but now that mum is gone, a higher percentage of potential emergencies will fall to me (note that I have no issues with this increase in responsibility - dad helps as much as he can, but he's on a fixed income).

I'm not really sure what to do with the remaining $50k. Given that I'm pretty comfortable, I want to use this money as a stable, long term investment for my brothers. I've always had my 401k/Roth set up through my employers, so I'm not really use what to do to set up accounts on my own, let alone for other people. Or even if a 401k or Roth is the best thing to do for them? Even if I opened those and maxed them out for the year, there would still be money left over, and I probably do want some of it to be accessible before they hit retirement age...I just dont want them to touch it any time soon. I'll admit that I am woefully undereducated when it comes to investing - I just make sure to maximize my company matches for my 401k, and get as close to the yearly contribution limits as possible. 

So yeah. Given that normal expenses for myself and the family are covered just fine, how do I best use this money for my brothers in the long term?",finance
personalfinance,University took out a student loan in my name without my permission. Will this effect my credit history?,"I got an email today saying that my student loan had been processed. Interesting, I never applied for a loan. So I check my university account online and sure enough, my school had credited my account with a $17000 federal loan I never applied for or accepted. In fact, I never even completed the FAFSA. 

I am fortunate enough that my entire tuition is covered from a combination of scholarships, stipends, and the GI Bill. Because of this, my account is showing a negative account balance, the school owes me money. The last thing I want right now is to take up a $17000 debt. I called my schools financial aid office and they asked me to send an email. 

Now, since the loan has already been disbursed to the school what I think will end up happening is my school will send me a check for the negative balance posted in my account which I will then use to pay off this loan I never wanted.

personalfinance,I discovered my student loan company has set my repayment amounts below my interest accrual ‚Äî for more than 20 years,"I'm not sure where to go next with this. I've never had much income until the past several years, and I went through periods where I needed to get a month or two rent covered by parents (a long time ago), or just barely had money for food (cooking at home) and sanitary things.   

So it's really causing me to meltdown, to realize that the student loan company was leading me to think that i was paying off my loans, when I don't seem to have been.  Most of my loans seem to have a higher principle now than when I got the loans, which is part of what tells me I'm right that the interest accrual is higher than the repayment amounts.  (I have about 8 loans of different sizes, consolidated and spread across various interest rates)

I don't understand how this was legal, and I don't understand what to do now that I've been paying for more than 10 years, and my loans are higher than when I started!  Has anyone had this happen?  Do I have any recourse?  Please help if you have any advice",finance
personalfinance,Refi options for an underwater co-op,"I purchased a co-op back at the height of the madness in 2006 with a business parter, we were young and got caught up in the real estate hype. We got it for $131,000 with $10,000 down, giving us a $121,000 30-year fixed mortgage with 6.625% interest. After 2008 the complex dealt with many foreclosures and the units were selling for $60,000 - $80,000. 

Fast forward to 2019, things have gotten better and units are now selling between $90,000 - $110,000 and the loan is down to $95,000. The property has been rented for most of the time and we have been pretty much breaking even for years (taking about $50 - $100 / month loss). The current nut is $1,500/month and the unit rents for $1,400/month. My partner and I have alway split the loss.

All that being said, I'd really like to refi and cut that interest rate in half. I think it's the only way to make this thing even a little bit profitable. The problem I've had is that the unit has been underwater. Even now, I'm not sure I could get it appraised at a high enough value that any bank would let me refi. I'm wondering if anyone out there has any suggestions about how to turn this thing around and make it worth it? My business partner doesn't want to pay any money into this (other than the closing costs, etc that would come with a refi) so that makes things a little more complicated.",finance
personalfinance,Almost 34 and Trying to Get My Finances Together Once and For All,"I'm not trying to dwell in the past and have made a lot of financial mistakes for a variety of reasons which aren't important.  I have read budgeting guides and get overwhelmed with some conflicting information.  I got my MSW in May of 2018 and have spent a year working for a 501c6 that has paid me at market rate for the past year and have gotten myself out of the Earnin/Brigit/Dave hole and want to start correct over a decade of financial self sabotage.  I have no savings, save for my IRA which started in November that I've been contributing 3 percent of my income to (matched by my employer).  I have a lot of debt and my credit has tanked to 571 due to missed payments from not being able to make two payments the month I entered a Debt Management program and a few accounts in collections.

YNAB is too complicated for me.  I need a method with attainable goals so I don't get overwhelmed, give up, and start financial self sabotaging myself again.  Here is my breakdown:

Annual salary- increasing from 48,000 to 51,000 on 8/30 (raise of 6 percent, paid twice monthly).  Right now before my raise I net $1502 twice a month (after IRA contribution).

Half of Rent: $525

Cell phone: $105 (lease on phone ties me to Xfinity for another year and a half- subsidized $75 a month by employer)

Half of Internet: $26

Half of Electric: \~130 (fluctuates)

Gym: 23.99

BiteSquad: $5.99 a month for no delivery fees

Affirm: 42.70 a month (complete 7/19/2020- 29.99 APR) 409.05 Balance

ML Loan: 22.61 paid twice a month (complete 5/1/2020- 5.99 APR Plus membership Fee)- 349.79 Balance

Debt Management Program Payment 215 paid twice a month (complete 12/2023- balances range 0-15%- around $13000 balance

Private Student Loan: $130.70 a month- just refinanced  6.345% fixed  $17,141.31 current balance)

Paycheck floating app fees: $35 a month

Other Outstanding/Recurring Debt/Expenses

Car insurance: $370 twice a year- full coverage, rental car and roadside coverage, $1000 deductible

Car Registration/tax: about $200 a year

HSA: Need to pay back about $450 I took out erroneously before Dec 31

Medical bills in collection: about $550

I have over $160k in federal student loans (current IBR payment is $0 based on 2018 income- surely will go up January 1)

High Deductible Health plan- come January, 2020 1 I will have to pay out of pocket until I meet $1500 deductible- can usually be met by April through a steep discount I get on a prescription).

I own my car but it has over 130k miles, is 10 years old, and a Prius.  It may need brakes, new tires, alignment, transmission flush, etc.

I owe my parents about $1400 which I intend to start paying back (the amount doesn't matter but it needs to start)

Unless I can find a side gig and make my own hours I can't take on a second job.  I need to be able to travel for work and spend some nights and weekends working.  I tried to sell some clothes on Poshmark but have had no luck so far.

Other income sources:

I have sold back a week of vacation which I will get in November so I estimate an additional $700ish then.

As stated- $75 a month for cell phone

Various mileage reimbursements ($100-200 a few times a year)

$125 a month deposited into HSA

$1,000 in Visa gift cards in November to buy presents from employer

About $200-350 net quarterly bonus for grant admin at work

Annual bonus (this year is gross $1500 and going to replace the $900 hole I have from my paycheck advance apps).

Another thing to note is that I claim 2 federal deductions so I probably won't have much of a tax return.

I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck.   How do I get out of this cycle without taking complete austerity measures?  My boyfriend and I like to eat out (we have different diets so when I buy groceries for myself they tend to go bad).  How do I make sure I have enough of an emergency fund (my job, despite my performance, could be eliminated at any time), pay off the right debt, and leave myself with enough money to tide myself over without dipping into a paycheck advance app?

Right now monthly payments are $1458.61 which is pretty much half of my current take home income.  If I don't dip into paycheck advance apps I'm left with about $1620 a month until 1/1 when I need to start paying my public student loan (no idea the amount).  How should I prioritize preparing for emergencies (3 months of bills alone is over $4500), saving for car repairs/insurance/etc, saving for wants (house downpayment, move out of state potentially, travel, clothes, furniture), paying my parents back, paying off debt, preparing for federal student loans?  I recognize that in my state I make close to  over $5100 a year net (not to mention bonuses) than my peers so if I am forced to look for a new job I will likely get paid less.  Is $500 a paycheck enough to live off of?  How do I allocate the remaining $310?  What should I do with the extra 6%?  It looks like it may result in a paycheck increase of $70-$100.   Should I invest in a $45 a month unemployment/disability insurance that pays $9000 if I'm laid off or out on short term disability after 90 days?  Invest it into my IRA (even though it's unmatched?)  What should I do now with my tiny quarterly bonuses (up until this point they went to getting me out of some short term hole or another).  How do I cut back without going completely stir crazy?

Currently my Student loan monthly payment on the Income Based Repayment is $729 of which a whopping $4.xx (yes FOUR dollars) goes to the principle which is just upsetting.

personalfinance,Another upside-down car loan question,"Hi guys,  

I need some advice as to how to handle my vehicle situation.  
I have the same story a lot of people here have -  I bought my first truck and got screwed on the deal.  I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing and had a significant spending problem that I‚Äôve been working on.  Over the past couple years, I‚Äôve paid down ~5k of my 15k credit card debt, but I‚Äôve only been paying minimums on my car payment because the interest rate is significantly lower (~7%) than my credit card debt.  

The car loan has finally caught up with me.  I bought this truck, a 2011 Ford for ~24k about 3 years ago.  It had about 80k miles on it and now has close to 125k.  I owe 14k on it, KBB values it at 10-12k but that is not factoring in the repairs.  Today, I found out from both the dealer and an independent mechanic friend that the engine would need to be taken apart to diagnose what exactly is wrong with it and will need significant repairs or engine replacement.

The car does run for now, so these are the options I‚Äôve thought of:

1. Repair it.  I‚Äôve been told this will be thousands to fix, at least, and I can‚Äôt afford to pay it today.  Do I put another few thousand into an aging car that I‚Äôm already upside-down 5k on? (Do I have a choice?)

2.  Trade it in.  Roll the negative equity into another auto loan.  This is what my friend suggested to me since it runs for now.  Ive been thinking of trying to trade it in for a Camry or Civic for under 5k.  Obviously I‚Äôd be paying 10k on a 5k car, but this would also save me in maintenance, like oil changes, repairs, and gas.  Is this even possible?

3.  Keep driving it.  Like I said, it runs for now but I‚Äôve been told it could keep going for months or die tomorrow.  I do only have a 1.5 mile commute to work now, so maybe I should drive it until it falls apart?

I feel like one of these answers should be obviously correct, but I feel so stressed about it I can‚Äôt think straight.  Please help, Reddit!",finance
personalfinance,Car Loan Refinance?,"My SIL purchased a new Toyota Rav 4 hybrid this weekend.  Put 8K down, financed around 28K including the 8 year warranty.

She feels like this is too high and is under the impression that it may be beneficial for her to look into refinancing the car to get a lower interest rate.  I have never refinanced a car and am unsure what advice to give her in this situation.  Would there be enough savings to make the refinancing worth it?  Are there costs associated with doing the refi?  Any other information that should be taken into account is much appreciated.

Management at this company is usually bumped to $60-70k which is currently my long-term goal.

personalfinance,401k versus pay off high interest credit card quickly.,"Here is my situation, I am currently contributing $400 a month to my 401k and paying $300 a month toward a high interest credit card.  The card has a little under $4,000 on it and is about 23% interest rate.  I am estimating that it will be paid off in 15-16 months, incurring that high interest the whole time.

My thought is if I temporarily move my $400 401k contribution to start paying $700 a month toward the credit card I cound pay it off in 5-6 months.  By my calculations this would save me over $300 in interest.  Once paid off I would resume the $400 401k contributions and reevaluate my budget to see if I can increase that with my freed up credit card payment.

**Update:** they agreed that this does not represent their business well and agreed to compensate by lowering my interest rate. I accept that as a reasonable reconciliation. 

**TL;DR:** Two days before closing, PMI increased by 26%! WTF? Can I do anything about this without delaying closing?

**Long version:** I am relocating for work and will be purchasing a new home while still owning my current home. I got information from four lenders and chose the one that gave me the lowest initial offer (interest rate and PMI with no origination points). I made the mistake of going with a lender that I had not heard of. They seemed to be a relatively big-name bank, so I trusted that I would be fine going with them.

The whole process has been very sketchy to me. Poor communication, very informal, miscalculations, and so on. I had a phone call last week where they were telling me I couldn't close on the house until I sold my current home (due to a high debt-to-income ratio). Understandably, my response was ""WHAT?"" because I told EVERYONE up front that we were not selling our home until after. All four lenders were aware of this and pre-approved me accordingly. The problem? They didn't calculate my income OR my salary correctly, and they didn't know what they were messing up. They were going to push my closing back until I asked them how they were even calculating that and I told them what they had wrong.

Now we are two days before closing. Every single document up until this point has had the EXACT same PMI number, with absolutely no disclaimers about being subject to change. Today, the final number shows an increase of 26% to the PMI... which is 12% of my principal and interest. These seems unbelievable, and I don't even understand how this is legal.

Now what am I supposed to do? I asked them about it and their response is ""oh well, we can't control that."" Do I really walk away and delay closing to get a lender that isn't going to screw me and not care? Help!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin: Time is on longs side; keep holding and keep buying,"Just my thoughts:

&amp;nbsp;

The upward pressure on bitcoin will persist for the next ~5 years. This is going to be a slow squeeze recession where sovereigns will likely lose control of monetary policy and enter perpetual QE with zero and negative rates. There is a real yield cost to holding cash and bonds, there is not a cost to holding bitcoin (if you can withstand short term volatility). Equities will be slow squeezed with low returns for years as they leveraged up and as trade tensions rise and the global population flat-lines/decreases. And real estate will continue to face pressure as millennials who cant afford a down payment struggle to absorb the housing market.

&amp;nbsp;

On an industry level we have: Libra which despite the Maxine Waters aneurism is still steaming ahead, Telegram creating a bitcoin wallet and trading for their 300 million users (this is releasing soon), we have Bakkd, TD and etrade to offer bitcoin to clients, other companies like Wal Mart are thinking about a coin, bitcoin ETFs can still be approved in October, etc...

&amp;nbsp;

^ We have heard of these developments but they are still very much relevant

&amp;nbsp;

Stay strong and stay long;

I say keep holding and keep buying because retail has the ability to keep driving this up and institutions who are hesitant because they missed the run-up (and are waiting for retail to drop their coins) will eventually cave when they realize its not in the cards.  We've had some institutions enter (Yale and Harvard endowment for instance) but there are many out there with little or no exposure.

I will use the bank's $6k and my $1,800 from another account to pay off the loan, receive a bill of sale and receive the title within 10 days.

However, I want to know the true cost of the personal loan. I have sold 3 used cars in the past, all within 30 days of advertising them.

personalfinance,Need some guidance with my financial situation and paying off a large student debt.,"I hope this is okay - I posted last week and the post says ‚Äú2 comments‚Äù but also says ‚Äúno comments yet‚Äù and I cannot see any comments, so not sure if anyone did actually comment. But I‚Äôm hoping some people will help me out with guidance and/or reassurance. 

My background:

When I was growing up my family was poor and didn‚Äôt teach me about money, but I got good grades so of course I went to university and was approved for full government student loans. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to do and switched majors a few times, ultimately spending 7 years at school (science degree and teaching degree). I also wasn‚Äôt good with money during that time, and amassed 70k (CAD) student debt. 

Where I lived you didn‚Äôt just go into a full time teaching job, so I struggled with relief teaching and part time work for awhile. Then I got an education-related job that I really loved but didn‚Äôt pay very much. I learned to budget and got much better with money, but didn‚Äôt manage to put much of a dent in the student debt. When I was made redundant, I decided I wanted to travel while I was still young enough to get working holiday visas, and moved to another country (New Zealand). 

I was only going to stay here for a year, but I met my current partner, and found another education-related job that I really enjoy, and stayed. I‚Äôve been here for 4 years now and intend to stay. 

My current situation: 

Im 34, I still owe $65k CAD in student loans and it‚Äôs a constant worry for me. (Right now I also have 3k in CC debt after some dental work and immigration costs, but I can take care of that in a few months, which I‚Äôm obviously gonna tackle first). I need to see a light at the end of the long-term tunnel and know that I can get myself out of this student debt and maybe one day own my own home. Please help. 

I make $1560 NZD biweekly AFTER taxes. When I get residency in a few months and start paying into a kiwisaver (employer-matched retirement savings) that‚Äôll go down maybe $50. My partner lives with me and makes a little less than me (no student loans but has some CC debt), but we haven‚Äôt fully combined our finances yet. 

My regular biweekly expenses are: 

$440 - my share of the rent 

$350 - what we both each put into our ‚Äúflat account‚Äù biweekly for gas/power, Vodafone, and groceries. During the winter there‚Äôs just enough, but this will accumulate some savings in the summer

$15 - cell phone ($30 monthly plan) 

$100 - Petrol (expensive here!)

$35 - two weekly sports leagues 

We rarely eat out, I don‚Äôt really care too much about stuff, so I don‚Äôt really spend much money on myself. Our flat is small and low rent for the area we are in. I don‚Äôt even have to pay for haircuts because my partner does that for free. But there seems to be a lot of random expenses popping up, like dental, car repair, etc. And I do have to create a budget for travel because all my family lives on the other side of the world now. 

But on a normal fortnight with no unusual expenses, I can easily save $500 - so $1000 NZD per month. I expect to have my CC paid off before December, and then start building an emergency fund while chipping away at my student loans. Right now I‚Äôm at zero payment interest free on my student loans, but in a few months will have to start paying again. Because I no longer live in Canada, I can‚Äôt take advantage of the repayment assistance options, I either have to pay in full or ask for a period of interest-only payments (where I would try to put extra in to pay some of the principle). I‚Äôm not exactly sure right now what my interest rate is (part of it has 0%) but my regular monthly payment would normally be around $750/month. 

Am I totally f*cked? What would you do if you were in my situation?",finance
personalfinance,Should I buy my Grandmas home?,"Hey everyone first time poster so be gentle!

So the situation is this. My grandma is currently selling back her home to a bank through a reverse mortgage and it is up to my father and I to now take on this loan and stop the reverse mortgage. We are living on the central coast of california where homes go for 400k to 650k at the high end. My father and I wouldn't be living in the home so it is technically an investment property.

The balance on this loan is $185,937 with around 100k in equity still in this home. This equity is going to be gifted to us by my grandma for taking on the loan and then put down as a down payment and we hope the balance will remain about 186k. Our credit scores are 750 and 730 and our outstanding debt (which in my opinion is our biggest hurdle) is around 85k with 2 car loans and a few CCs which we were hoping to roll into the home loan anyways. I have shopped around for better interest rates. The best seems to be 3.375% at a 15yr which is a $1632 a month payment. we can easily get 1800 in rent out of it and upwards of 2400 if need be.

The reason we are have decided to buy instead of refinance is to stop any future family squabbles before they even start. As a refinance would mean the home is still technically be my grandmas and unwanted family members could come and collect their share if and when she were to pass.

Maybe im ignorant but with 100k give or take 20k in equity already in the home, it sounds like a great deal. And if all goes well tomorrow we'll apply for the loan. Is there anything I should be worried about? This is my first home, is there anything I should pay close attention to?

Edit: I forgot to add that my grandma already has tenants living there who could pay the mortgage, however do not have the credit score/income necessary to acquire the loan in our place.",finance

personalfinance,My spouse and I are 36. What is the best way to pay for my spouse's graduate program?,"So, I work in a salaried position and make about 130k a year. We live in CA in a city with a high cost of living. My spouse has been a stay at home parent for the last 8 years and has decided to go back to school and go through a 2.5 year graduate program to ultimately work in the field she's always been interested in. This program will cost about $50,000. We went ahead and filed the necessary FAFSA info and she is now approved to get an unsubsidized federal loan for $20,500 for the first year, and likely the same amount for the next one. This loan will accrue interest during her program but will not require principal repayments until after she completes the program, at which point she will work in a paid internship position.

Currently, we have around $65k saved up and around $245k in a roth 401k. My current idea is to turn down the aid for this year and pay for the first year out of pocket. That will put us down to about $44k next year. I thought I'd put some money (keeping an emergency fund available) into a 529 plan for the next academic year but I've found that California doesn't give tax credits/deductions for 529 contributions. I admit that I haven't done the research to understand the fees and other costs that may be associated. I've read that it's also possible to put money into a Roth IRA to use for college, but this seems to have the same downside -- there's no tax credit or deduction. Whichever savings vehicle we contribute to, I thought we'd take on the federal loan on the 2nd and half-3rd year for the difference.

If at all possible, I wanted to set aside about $10k for improvements to our house. I may be being too conservative with our emergency fund, we do have family that could help financially support us if there was some kind of dire situation. Also, it may be prudent to make the 529 plan because our family has indicated that they'd like to help with the cost and that would allow them to make a contribution without triggering the gift tax. But, I'd prefer not to take money from them unless absolutely necessary.

personalfinance,"On Disability, was supporting artist bf for years, now he left me with more debt than I can pay. What now?","I am on Disability. That provides me $789.25 a month.  


My portion of the rent is $475  
Phone, internet, Hulu is $75  
Utilities: around $20  


Over the last few years, my boyfriend (now ex) was struggling to keep up with his part of the rent and bills. He paid more rent that I, having the small bedroom as his office. When money was tight, I covered $150 additionally towards his rent, which meant I was living on credit cards those months. At least 12 months in a year and a half span, I covered him. I also blew out my FoodStamps feeding us, and fed us on my credit cards for most of our time together. As a result, I'm now around $5,000 in debt.   


He said he'd help pay off my credit cards, but paid into them for only three months after we broke up. One of those months he paid late (he insisted it wouldn't matter as long as it was paid no more than 30 days late), and as a result, my credit line was reduced by $4000, and my credit rating was reduced by 80 points in one month.   


My ratio of available credit is now crappy enough that I can't get a consolidation loan. Being low income, my cards all have crap APRs of 25-27%.  


Just paying my minimums each month is costing me $220, which is literally all I have left after essentials. I hadn't gotten any money from the ex for six months. He went on vacation last month, knowing he might be evicted from his place a month and a half later. I've had to abandon any hope of him giving me any further money.  


My only long term goal, as a person on Disability, has been to foster good credit and low debt so that I could buy property someday and get unearned income through charging rent. Investments like that are the only means of income that doesn't put my benefits at risk. The debt he's left me in has really screwed me and my long term survival.  


Now that I am on my own again, I'm no longer in the red every month. I can cover my shit, tight as my budget is. But I'm hardly keeping afloat trying to keep my credit in decent standing. If I keep paying at this rate, it will take me 11 years to pay it off, and I'll end up paying something like $3,700 in additional interest.  


I've looked into debt management plans, but those would close out my cards, and the best they could offer was a reduced interest rate of around 12%. It would reduce my monthly minimum to $120 a month, and would only take me 5 years to pay off, but..... that erases all the hard work I've put towards balancing my finances and trying to get good credit.   


I don't have any bad marks on my credit report, aside the high ratio of use and less than six years of credit history. Tossing that all aside and having to wait five years to start from scratch again is mind bogglingly depressing.  


I've got a friend who is telling me to sue him.   


I'm wondering if there are any other paths I could try that I haven't get investigated.

EDITED TO ADD: Suggestions that I work are not helpful, and is not what I am asking for. I am legit Disabled, and already do what I can to bring in three or four hundred extra a month on the side when I am capable, but that goes directly to medical costs, because most Lyme Disease treatments aren't covered.

personalfinance,Getting a car in Canada and moving to US after a few years (x-post from r/PersonalFinanceCanada),"\[reposting because the previous post got stuck in a filter\]

Hi all, I'm moving to Canada from the US in a month. I'll be in Ontario and I need a car to get around. However, I'll be moving back to US (in somewhere between 1 - 3 years). What's the most financially efficient way of buying a car given these constraints? I read that cars in Ontario tend to be more expensive than in the US but due to a lot of reasons I don't want to purchase a car in the US and drive it up.

Constraints and expectations:

* Will move to the US in 1-3 years.
* Want to get a decent car in Canada and take it back to US when I move (provided there are not many costs in which case I'd like to sell the car and move back)

Questions:

* Since I'll move back to the US, are there any costs or regulations I should be aware of while getting a car in Canada? Are cars sold in US and Canada different? Emission tests etc.?
* Should I lease or buy? (I'm assuming the answer to this is buy (since I could move back in say 1.5 yrs) and my other questions are based on this)
* New or Used? I'm inclined to get a used car to avoid paying for depreciation but is there anything I'm missing related to the move back to US?
* I'm new to Canada and will have a new SIN. I have considerable and good credit history in the US (multiple credit cards and an auto loan) - Can I leverage my good credit history in the US for a better interest rate in Canada?

A) 3.625% rate and 20% down (which is $50K)  

B) 4.125% rate and 0% down, with no PMI

My Idea: If we take the cash from the settlement and apply it to our credit card debt, we can reduce the amount we are paying in interest. The next step would be to get a balance transfer card to consolidate the rest of the debt.

personalfinance,Predatory loan advice while on UE,"I  took out a bad loan through Upstart last year to fund schooling. I  already know this was a bad choice, but after trying to get good loans  through FAFSA or grants, none would work because it was for a  non-accredited, super small, fairly new art school. I enjoyed the  teachers and program, but the school's admin was shit and didn't offer  up a tuition payment plan that worked for me. I.e. their payment play  was $700 a month which I couldn't pay while working full time and rent.  So, I made the choice to choose education and get the loan. I'd do 1  year of tuition on this loan. I didn't want to put off my education any  longer.

So now I owe a sizeable  chunk of money w/ a bad interest rate. I obviously regret going through  them, but was paying it off OK. However, I got laid off a few months ago  and can no longer make my monthly payments, and have asked for  deferment. They gave me a 2 month lower payment rate, which I paid. It  jumped back up to the regular $250 a month minimum payment, so I  requested a 2nd hardship deferment. They asked for proof of hardship,  which I gave, showing the unemployment amount I receive. I got approved  for a two month deferment but with the following scary lingo:

 - Additional interest accrued is approximately $5.00. This is included in  the new monthly payment amount and is not a fee.
- Please note that under this hardship plan, all payments made will be  reported with a special comment code and may affect your credit rating.

Right  now, I think I'd like to move the Upstart loan to a new 0% credit card.  However, I've actually never done this. I don't know if I can move the  entire balance, which is sizeable (over $7K), or what. I'm just curious  if anyone has any advice. I pay all my bills on time. It's just hard to  get dinged on credit, when you're on unemployment. I'm not at all  shocked that a predatory lender does not give a shit about my credit or  burying me further in dept. I'm just curious if money smart people out  there have good advice. P.s. I know this wasn't a great choice and I'm  living with it, so I'd appreciate helpful replies with advice vs.  negative 'told ya so's. This the first loan I've ever taken out that was  a gamble and it was for my art career - not for something dumb, so  please be less troll-erific if possible. Thank you!!",finance

The period in which creditors can claim money on his estate is almost over (officially over September 9th, I believe). My brothers and I have been collecting his mail and going through everything and sending any debtor stuff to the probate lawyer so creditors can file an official claim on the estate. 

Today my brother (where the mail is being forwarded) gets a FedEx letter from Bank of America saying my fathers account is past due and requires an immediate payment of $110.00 to avoid charge off.

Here‚Äôs a few reasons I‚Äôm skeptical: my dad HATED BoA. That‚Äôs one of the last places he would go to get a credit account or anything causing him to pay them money. 

This is the FIRST we‚Äôve received any notice from BoA about an account at all. There have been no bills, no notices to pay, nothing, until this letter.

His long term girlfriend was unaware of any account through BoA. She knew about everything else that we‚Äôve found, but she had no idea about this. (Not that he‚Äôs not capable of keeping a private account. But he was getting REALLY senile)

* new construction home going up in 3-4 months
* cash deal (rolling it into my mortgage but using some of my house downpayment to pay for the solar)
* no shade
* significant south facing roofline. larger installs might bleed a few panels into the west roof also without shade.
* Good net metering deal. So long as generation doesn't exceed consumption I get 1:1 pricing for generated power. After that it's wholesale pricing of about 40% of what I pay.
* Only the fed rebate is available for me.

* balance cost, features and reputation/references.
* I am very interested in monitoring with as much detail as possible for the least amount of money and I'm not sure I want to spend on Sense or E-gauge just yet and both of those can be installed after solar install if I want the data from those devices.

Some questions.

* Since I don't need extra efficiency from panels going with LG/Panasonic/SunPower doesn't seem worth the extra cost and commodity panels are just fine for  my use case.  Is this a reasonable conclusion? I see all sorts of different specs, since as Monocrystaline vs. Polycrystalline, temp coefficient of power, number of cells but short of needing density, power efficiency due to a small roof or shade or both(and neither applies to me) it just seems like a 300W middle of the road PVC is as good of a value as a 300W high-end PVC.  Is this a reasonable conclusion or is there a property of a mid-range PVC that I should consider?
* Considering how reliable panels are. Do I really need 20+ year warranties on the panels?  I'm thinking that in 10 years, if a panel fails they current models will probably be efficient enough to be worth it to buy another panel.  Though, on the other hand, in 10 years they wont be replacing any panels with 10 year old panels.
* I'm debating the value of the the Solaredge warranty upgrade(from 12 year to 25 year) for the same reason as above.  What are folks thoughts?
* My understanding is that there was/is a real issue with Solaredge HD Wave units reliability since late last year but that seems to have been taken care of according to the installers I spoke with.  Has anyone heard the same?

Conclusion:

All installers seem reputable and I'm currently having them get some residential references and asking for at least one reference from someone who has done a service call with them.    That said, I really like Installer 1. I have several friends who can offer personal references and these guys have been installing Solar in Austin 10+ years and that makes them pretty mature compared to the others but their pricing is not great. I'm going to try to get them to come in lower but they seem pretty firm on their pricing. I might get a nickel cheaper but I don't expect much more than that.

Assuming references check out all signs point to the fact that I'm likely to just go with the Cheapest Solar Edge at $2.40/w because a) it's the cheapest by a country mile and b) it's solaredge and I really want all the bells and whistles that their monitoring API offers.  I'm figuring what's the worse case scenario in terms of SolarEdge reliability? I'm out power generation for a month or so while Solar Edge is back ordered on Warranty replacement. That's maybe $150-$200 tops in the Summer and with the cheaper option I'm saving approximately $1200 over the cheapest enphase option and approximately double that for the other Solar Edge option.

So /r/solar, what am I missing in my analysis. I'm bracing for a heap of wisdom you guys can toss my way.",energy

personalfinance,Does Marcus lower the interest the more money you add?,"When I first made an account people were boasting about the great 2.75% interest rate. I joined up and it was that for awhile. So then I decided to add more money to the account. Not too long after that, it lowered to like 2.16%. Thought that was strange, but figured maybe they have a lot of users now and they're lowering it. Then I just pushed another bulk of money into it and once again, about a week later ,I get an e-mail of them saying they are lowering it to 2.00%.

Bitcoin,On Satoshi Nakamoto,"Satoshi Nakamoto will be remembered in history as one the greats alongside inventors and scientists such as Tesla and Salk, even if their identity is never revealed. I mentioned those two names for a specific reason. 

Like Tesla this individual is an eccentric genius, and their invention will revolutionize the world. In Tesla's day as the electric grid was slowly built out over many decades, most people didn't quite understand or see the potential of having electricity in every home. They did not and could not see the lives we live today. The existence of the electrical grid gave rise to THOUSANDS of new inventions, that would not exist, if not for the existence of the electric grid. Even the inventors of these inventions, would not have foreseen the invention of the key basic ingredient that would allow them to even THINK about their own invention.

I see block-chain being as revolutionary as AC current, and btc is just one implementation of a block-chain.  I'm not saying that in the future we'll have star-drives, and flying cars, and  free money. However with block-chain one can appreciate the depth and magnitude of the 'invention' even if one doesn't know how exactly to use it and what to do with it. 

I also mentioned Salk, again for a specific reason. Did Salk (&amp; team) invent or discover the polio vaccine? I think it's a bit of both. Computer scientists like microbiologists invent things (algorithms) which are based upon recombining things occurring in nature (mathematics). After Salk invented his vaccine, he gave it away. He did not try to monopolize his invention for personal wealth and fortune. Nakamoto has done the same. One could argue that he had to give it away, otherwise it would never go anywhere etc. etc. and giving it away was the smart thing to do. Hind-sight is 20/20. As anybody that has designed anything will tell you, it is difficult to step back from your design and divorce your ego from the fruit of your intellectual labor.

Finally Nakamoto's ""fortune"" in btc will never be spent, and this is the main reason I'm writing this piece today. This is the single act that will put Nakamoto in league with history's greats. However I have to make a fundamental assumption: that Nakamoto is not spending their coins, and not seeking publicity out of their own volition and for an overarching reason. 

To me Nakamoto's original, unspent, ""lost"" hoard is a design choice. It's like the ""lost treasure"". It exists to attract interest to the btc blockchain. Lot's of people are thinking to themselves ""i wish I had satoshi's coins"". Satoshi will never spend his coins, because those coins are meant to be, to use a inappropriate term ""hacked"". They are essentially unclaimed coins in the public domain, and if you can figure out and solve the problem of getting to those coins then there is a big reward in it for you.

I was a long time btc skeptic (from  an economic perspective). Recent events in the world made me look into btc, and now I've become a convert. 

During the last financial crisis there were many countries that were essentially insolvent, and looking at using the currencies of a different country to replace their national currency. Iceland was looking at using the Canadian dollar instead of their krona. In the end they didn't do anything, and Iceland still has it's own sovereign currency. 

However who's to say that the next financial meltdown will not result in adoption of btc as a national currency in some sovereign jurisdiction ? It can happen with the stroke of a pen. There are over 190 sovereign jurisdictions in the world.   
Argentina HABITUALLY devalues their currency and defaults on their debts. I can't think of a country more in need of btc than Argentina. The infrastructure, markets, trust is all there, ready and available for any daring state to switch over to btc as official currency. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot think of a more ground-breaking discovery than bitcoin and block-chain since the turn of the 21st century. Some might say that I'm being hyperbolic but I think it is going to be difficult to overstate the impact of block-chain.

&amp;#x200B;

To quote the great Dr. Ron Paul: "" An **idea whose time has come** cannot be **stopped** by any army or any government.""

business,Banks Are Still Relevant: Record Set For Small Business Loans Approval,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://i.redd.it/cammqjkcd6j31.png)

Digging up the [archives](https://www.become.co/blog/a-brief-history-of-loans-business-lending-through-the-ages/) led us to the revelation that business loan date back to over 4,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, this was when the payday loan was used for the first time. Later in 1754 BCE, the concept of the interest rate was introduced, and the Sumerian temples of that era were taken as the banks along with worship temples. Over time, multiple changes took place in the world of [**small business loans**](https://www.onlinecheck.com/blog/business-loans/banks-are-still-relevant-record-set-for-small-business-loans-approval/), from temples as a bank to official banks to credit and debit card to alternative and online lending. This was a brief timeline of the financial lending institutions over time.

When you were looking for the lending institution in 2019, three platforms come to the mind: alternative lenders, banks, and government-administered loans by the Small Business Administration. Each lending institution has its highs and lows, some have more advantages as far the interest rate is concerned and the other has an edge over in the terms of the loan repayment. After literature review, one might conclude that more small business owners are inclined towards the alternative lenders, but according to some research, it is also evident that many people still turn towards banks to get the external funding to manage the cash flow.

Let us look at multiple resources to analyze the shift and trends in the small business loan industry.

In the first half of 2019, American Reporter reported a [survey](https://www.theamericanreporter.com/survey-reveals-60-of-small-businesses-obtained-unsecured-business-loans-from-non-bank-lenders-in-1st-half-of-2019/) conducted by one of the leading institutions: Balboa Capital and following were the results:",finance
personalfinance,HELOC or cash out refinance for quick &amp; cheapest access to my $ in house during a break up ??,"My ex boyfriend and I own a house. We've broken up but are on good terms, trying to work with each other to make it as low cost as possible. I've left and rented an apartment, and have *a lot* of credit card payments coming up associated with the cost of the new apartment and all the furniture, payments, etc. On top of that I'm a teacher so I have zero income during the summer. My checking account is almost totally diminished. 



Originally we were going to do a HELOC for the amount of money I have tied up in the house, and then work together to pay off the interest. However now he is saying he wants to consider all of his options to make sure he's not paying more interest than he needs to. I'm stressed out because the HELOC is almost completely underway (should be able to access it this week or next week), and I *need* the funds in order to avoid interest on my credit cards. 



Here is our financial information for the house for reference: 



15 year conventional mortgage (taken out in 2016)

current principle balance: $193,099

current interest rate: 2.625%



amount I have in the house (that I want out): $40,000



*possible interest rate on HELOC: ??

*possible interest rate if we refinance to 30yr and do a cash out for my $40k:   3.42%





SO... HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS: 



1. What interest are we looking at overall if we go ahead with the HELOC and pay it off within the next 5 years? He is likely going to sell the house and would have the funds available to pay it off completely. I keep using online calculators but they give me monthly payment plans and I can't figure out what the total cost would be in interest



2. Alternatively... how much more interest would be paid if he refinances to a 30 year mortgage and does a cash out of $40k for me? 





I know eventually we need to just take my name off of the mortgage and call it a day, and I was thinking that if the cash out refinance is a better option we'll do it at that time. We opted to start with the HELOC as a way to get the ball rolling on they money side and keep my name on the mortgage in cash in a couple of years things change, we want to make things work, etc. But at this point my main goal is to access the money I have, and make it as low impact as possible to not cause issues.

1. Next year my overseas income will not generate any US taxes (because of FTC). If I rollover the 401(k) amount next year (maybe rollover to a traditional IRA this year, and then to a Roth IRA the next; or just do 401(k)-&gt;Roth next year), will the $50k be added to my overseas income to calculate the tax liability (i.e. max tax bracket for the entire amount), or will my US income start from $0, resulting in a $2-3k tax liability for the rollover?  
2. Can FTC reduce my tax liability from US income? I think not, but maybe...

investing,"Yuan continues to fall.. Longest Drop Since 2015, lowest since 2009","1. Every time we raise tariffs on China, Chinese Yuan devalues making their exports cheaper, hence cancelling the effect. At the same time US exports are double tariffed - from the currency devaluation and tariff added by China.  


2. All of US exports to China are tariffed but only half of Chinese exports to US have a tariff. So the other half of Chinese product is becoming more competitive, their companies can more profit on them.  


3. In 2015 USD Yuan was at 6.20, today it is around 7.19. Yuan wasn't so weak since 2009.  China can fight the trade war for many years but that is decimating US exports. US exports are dropping not just to China but to rest of the world as well. 

4.  As Yuan devalues, so does Euro, Korean Won, Indian Rupee... This makes US exports less competitive around the world vs Chinese/Korean products. Eg. iPhone more expensive in Europe and China, Samsung is cheaper. Makes Boeing more expensive than Airbus.   


5.  Better way to fight China is by isolating them. Together with EU. Human rights is Hong Kong and north China.   Why is Huawei getting repeated exemptions?

personalfinance,Refinancing options,"I'm currently shopping around for a Refi. 

Bunch of different rates from a bunch of different companies. 

My overall question: Is it better to have a higher loan amount with a lower interest rate, or a lower loan amount with a higher interest rate?

Doing the math on two quotes, one option was a 2.75% interest rate on a $255k loan, and another option was 3.125% on a $243k loan. 

With both, my P&amp;I would be about $1,041. (They're only different by .07¬¢). Both would have a total payment over 30 years of about $347,750. (They're only about $20 apart). 

The difference is on the 2.75% @ $255k, the total interest paid is about $120k and the 3.125% @ 243k would be about $132k. 

So I can't figure out which is more beneficial. Inherently, I feel it's obviously the one with the lower overall principal of $243k, right? Like, the less principal I'm paying interest on, the sooner I can pay it off (making additional principal payments monthly of course). And when I go to resell, the less I owe, the more potential for a greater profit. 

So if this is the case, should I pursue other loan options that will gave me a lower Total Loan Amount at the expense of a higher interest rate? 

It feels like a trick question, like I'm over looking a crucial detail in understanding this fully. Or maybe I'm just overthinking this to the point where I've lost all ability to see the forest from the tree.

personalfinance,Neither debt snowball or avalanche?,"Please poke holes in my math!

I currently have 2 loans, a mortgage and a car loan. The mortgage is roughly 115,000 30 year at 1.15% and the car is 30,000 10 year at 2.5% (I live in Japan, that‚Äôs why the rates are so low). Now, both the debt snowball and the avalanche would have me pay off the car first as it is both the smallest debt and it has the highest interest rate. 

However, using an amortization calculator, it seems like prioritizing the mortgage first would be the more financially beneficial choice.

With the above numbers, the total interest on the mortgage would be 21,030.45 and the total interest on the car would be 3,937.16.

Paying an extra 1,000 per month on the mortgage would save 16,112.91 and it would be paid off in 7 years 4 months whereas paying the same extra on the car would save just 3,149.68 but it would be paid off in 2 years 1 month.

It seems to me that if the goal is paying off all the debt in a way that reduces interest payments in the most efficient manner it would make sense to pay off the mortgage rather than the car.

However, general consensus promotes either the debt snowball or the avalanche, and no one talks about paying off high balances first because of the cumulative interest... so... why am I wrong?

The only advantage I can see of paying off the smaller balance first is to free up the cash flow that would be going towards that payment, but I‚Äôm not especially struggling to pay my bills and I have more than enough in investments to pay off the car at any time if I wanted to...",finance

Of course, this ignores the tax advantages and possible rental income. Also, the absurd amount of leverage allowed in real estate might mean that a linear return is still a net positive.

CryptoCurrency,"Blockchain Forensics Firm Chainalysis Offering ""Suspicious Transaction"" Alerts For 15 Cryptocurrencies, Compromising Anonymity And Freedom","[http://www.cypherpunklabs.com/blockchain-forensics-firm-chainalysis-offering-suspicious-transaction-alerts-for-15-cryptocurrencies-compromising-anonymity-and-freedom/](http://www.cypherpunklabs.com/blockchain-forensics-firm-chainalysis-offering-suspicious-transaction-alerts-for-15-cryptocurrencies-compromising-anonymity-and-freedom/)

The blockchain forensics firm [Chainalysis has announced](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/real-time-alerts-press-release) that they are offering ‚Äúsuspicious transaction‚Äù alerts for 15 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, top stable coins, and some ERC-20 tokens. What this essentially means is that after Bitcoins are purchased on a regulated platform like Coinbase or a Bitcoin ATM, they are then tracked to see if they are being used on the Darknet or for other illegal things like money laundering and tax evasion.

Indeed, government agencies are pouring tens of¬†millions¬†of dollars into blockchain forensics firms such as Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinfirm, Blockchain Intelligence Group, CipherTrace, and Scorechain. These government agencies include U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Breaking this down, the IRS is tracking cryptocurrency activity in order to increase the taxation of cryptocurrency users. The cryptocurrency tax code in the United States is quite complex, time consuming, and expensive, and it seems a large fraction of cryptocurrency users have not paid taxes at all due to that. The IRS uses blockchain forensics in order to make a case to audit cryptocurrency users, and this may be connected to the [10,000 warning letters](https://news.bitcoin.com/10000-american-cryptocurrency-owners-will-receive-warning-letters-from-the-irs/) recently sent out to cryptocurrency users across the country. Apparently Coinbase, the biggest retail crypto exchange in the United States, handed over all user data from 2013-2017 to the IRS.

The ICE, DEA, and FBI are all involved in trying to bust the Darknet, so it is no surprise that they are using blockchain forensics to track down cryptocurrency transactions that are being sent to the Darknet, since that can provide evidence to take down criminals that are otherwise highly anonymous.

The SEC and CFTC are involved in regulating the cryptocurrency markets, so they use blockchain forensics to track any unregulated cryptocurrency trading and investment, continuing their efforts to completely centralize the cryptocurrency market into the hands of a few big players that are fully know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliant.

Zooming out, the rise of blockchain forensics is another step in the government‚Äôs attack on the cryptocurrency economy. It perhaps started when peer to peer Bitcoin trading, like on Localbitcoins, was outlawed. This led to Bitcoin trading only being legal on major exchanges like Coinbase where the full identity of users is collected, from which point user identitification data and their transaction activity is accessible to any government agency that wants it. Now blockchain forensics are making it so any Bitcoins which originate from regulated venues can be easily tracked, compromising the pseudo-anonymity of the Bitcoin network.

In fewer words, the government has worked to ensure that people can only obtain Bitcoin at fully regulated venues, and now blockchain forensics is being used to track Bitcoins and other major cryptocurrencies originating on those regulated venues, and this comprises a large fraction of the cryptocurrency in circulation.

Cryptocurrency users should be aware that a significant amount of Bitcoin originates on Coinbase or other regulated exchanges, so even if Bitcoin is obtained in a peer to peer deal it may still be tracked by blockchain forensics firms working for the exchanges and government. There are options available to increase anonymity, like using a mixer which sends the Bitcoin between numerous addresses, mining the Bitcoin yourself, or using a fully stealth cryptocurrency like Monero.

Cypherpunk Labs does not advocate the use of cryptocurrency for illegal activity, but privacy and anonymity is a basic human right, and cryptocurrency users should be aware that cryptocurrency lacks anonymity nowadays due to the rise of blockchain forensics, if proper steps are not taken.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should current bond outlooks impact the mix of bonds as you start your portfolio?,"Let's make two assumptions.

If you're starting out investing, #1 is where you'd start with 80/20 in index funds.

Currently, I have a couple job prospects lining up for when I graduate and I should have a starting salary of at least 54k, depending on where I end up. I live with my parents and am in no rush to leave, they aren't in a rush to kick me out either. I have this idea of starting my career and just pumping in nearly all of my income (after retirement/saving contributions) and attempting to pay off my student loans in no more than two years. Is this feasible and a good idea? Or should I be putting my money to better use than paying off loans?",finance

personalfinance,An acceptable human error or shady business?,"Hi! So I‚Äôve been looking into refinancing my mortgage. I did some shopping, and my preferred lender was able to beat another lenders offer slightly. The preferred lender told me 3.49% on the phone, but today I got the loan document to sign and the interest rate is listed as 3.499%. A small difference, but over the life of the loan equates to hundreds of dollars.

Would you let this go as human inaccuracy in a phone conversation, or would you call it out? I did question it and he said he had meant 3.499%, but my expectation would be for one to speak accurately and honor what they said even if it was a mistake.

But i just want to talk to someone who can view me and the wifes budget, income, debt and break down what best options would be and how to proceed to get back on the right track. is there any place like this and what are they called?

edit: wanted to mention the issues are the fact that i have $56k debt on credit cards which is dropping my credit score, and i'm just able to make minimums on it, which is futile. 401k has $46k in it. pension is $15k i no longer work at the job so the $15k can be cashed out as a lump sum. most of the credit debt is at 25% interest rate but 10k of it is a business loan (doesn't show up on credit score, not sure what happens if i default on it but i've been paying minimum) and another $15k is 0% apr. the rest 31k is at 25% interest rates.

the cash out value after fee and income taxes would net me roughly $30k from both 401k and pension. which would eliminate all the 25% credit debt. but also leave me with zero retirement plan as of right now. but I'm only 34 right now.",finance

personalfinance,What kind of loan could I apply for?,"Context:

I am 15k in credit card debt across 7 cards that has build up while I was in school. Interest rates 20-26%.  I now make about $2,800/month net. My living expenses are about $1,800/month. Minimum payments are about $800/month. Job related expenses about $200/month. Credit score is a lovely 550. No savings unfortunately. 

Situation:

My job requires me to use my car for transportation. It has been having problems lately and just yesterday began having worse problems which are now preventing me from being able to do my job. Unfortunately my company does not have company cars for my position so I am completely unable to do my job and may very well lose my job if I cannot figure out what to do.  

My Idea:

Debt consolidation. I am wasting a lot of money with very high interest, and paying more in minimum payments due to the number of accounts. A really reliable used car would cost about 5k from my once a car dealer, now retired Dad. My parents would also likely be willing to cosign on a loan to get my monthly payments down and save me some money in interest, as well as solve my car problem. Yay parents! 

My Problem:

I have no idea what I'm doing, what I should be looking for as far as rates, if I can even qualify, even with my parents (who btw have good credit and income:debt). This is what I've found so far using a loan calculator from a local credit union. 

Loan amount: $20,000  
Loan terms: 4 years  
Interest rate: 10%  
Monthly payment: $507.25

Would this make any sense? Would I qualify for something like this? Am I looking in the wrong direction? Better ideas?

personalfinance,Student Loan Question,"Hey everyone,

I currently have 7 federal loans totaling 150k with a variety of interests rates ranging from \~3%-7%. I have been paying a substantial amount monthly on these loans, about $1,800, with the majority of monthly payment going to the highest interest loan first, this also happens to be the loan with the highest principle. Basically I'm using the Avalanche Method. The other loans receive enough to cover interest for each loan and then a little more to try chipping away.  So, a two part question:

1) Should I consolidate these loans. If so, why? 

2) If I don't consolidate these loans, should I strictly pay the minimum payment on all the other loans and devote more money to the highest interest loan? This would allow me to pay about $1,700 on the highest interest loan. Whereas right now I pay about $ 1,100 toward it.",finance

It‚Äôs not quite ready for full-time van life, but it‚Äôll make a great weekend adventure vehicle while I prep it for more long-term living. The selling prices is $60k, although the van itself (sans all the interior work) is worth about $36k, so bank will only loan that amount or 120% of that amount (depending on the bank). So, here‚Äôs my options for purchasing and I‚Äôm wondering which is the most prudent. I think it‚Äôs a great deal for a well-built van, especially considering you can drop $60-$100k on JUST the buildout from what I‚Äôve seen with other van owners.

Option 1 - Pay $60k in cash
I can pay for it in cash, but doing so would take up a good chunk of my non-retirement, non-emergency funds. I like having a good cash buffer for whatever life throws my way, so I‚Äôm not sure if this one makes sense.

Option 2 - $42,750 loan @ 4.74% for 60 months. Pay the remaining $17,250 in cash.

Option 3 - $37,000 loan @ 3.79% for 60 months. Pay the remaining $23k in cash.

I don‚Äôt know what the future brings, but I imagine I‚Äôll have the van for 3-4 years. There is also the potential of renting it out and using it as a secondary income stream. I called one site and they are reporting that people are making $10-20k every year renting out their adventure vans. Although it‚Äôs worth noting that every time I have ever leant my vehicle to someone something horrible has happened to it, but that‚Äôs what the insurance coverage is for.

Which option makes the most sense here? Paying a little more cash out of pocket and going with the lower interest rate / monthly payments?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,A long and detailed update to my post about getting rid of a car with a lien,"Hello,

I wanted to share a happy update on my post below. Idk why the numbering is weird and don't know how to fix it. They still  serves their purpose, though, haha.

http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/clyf76/cars_with_liens_and_insurance_claim_payouts/

I am so thrilled and relieved that I am going to type out my longest text ever on Reddit with the hopes that I will help someone else.

Also, I'm procrastinating cleaning my apartment haha. 

For the record, a few months ago, I made the decision to leave an 85k paying job that made me miserable for a job that is 10k lower. 

I did the math, and I could afford it on a small margin every month and preserve 8k in savings. 

As time when on, I found it difficult to stick to my austere new budget and I wished so bad that I'd never bought the stupid HR-V. 

A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders and I am much happier, actually, with the 2016 Honda Fit EX with 15k miles vs the 2018 HR-V EX-L that had 43. I freaking love it and 0% miss the HR-V. The cupholders are way better situated, too haha. 

The HR-V was 25k (down from 29k, which added to my decision). The FIT was 15k. 

1. I went to the Honda dealership near my place in California. I bought the car in Colorado, btw. 

2. I explained my predicament. I took a lower paying job recently and am so much happier. However, the car payment is more than I can bear and is cause me a lot of stress. I asked if I had any options. 

3. Their first offer was for a 2019 Honda Civic. The guy told me that my only option was to get a new car. I was 2 grand upside down on my 2018 HRV with 9k miles. 

He pushed me to fill out paperwork them and there because the finance department was completely free. It would take an hour, he said. 

4. I said that I had to go to work, but would get back to him. Self preservation mode I suppose. 

5. I went home and assessed the offer, using online calculators. 

He gave me a financing offer that actually had a longer term and higher interest rate. The 18k car would cost me 28k in the end! 

He also told me that the 2k upside down would ""wash out"", even after I asked him to explain the math. It would not, of course. 

6. He called me that night! I said that I was not available via phone for the week due to work. Said I was happy to email, though. 

7. I sent a very short email thanking him for his time, but explaining that I did the math, showed him my figures, and said that I couldn't do it. Shared with him that the Kelly Bluebook is 20k and I could afford to sell it at their 18k offer. Thanked him again for his time. 

8. His boss emailed me back. He said he could give me Kelly Bluebook and cheaper options, like the FIT. 

9. I went to see the FIT and liked it a lot. I was again pressured to buy it right away, of course. I went home and did the math again, and found it to be fair. It ended up being 200 bucks less a month and the final sum would be 18k on a 15k loan. Not ideal, but better. Looking at it that way, I lost $200 a month for 6 months with the old car payment, but I can see it as a big lesson learned. 

10. I looked over my contract and saw that I let myself get talked into the Honda Care extended warranty for $2k, my upside down amount. In my defense, I was starving.

Also, I drove my 2003 Civic until it from 2014 until it died 6 months ago. It was 2 grand off bc of hail damage, that I never bothered to fix. 

I had paid it off in 3 years and it never broke down on me. In addition, it got hailed in Colorado and was deemed a total loss. My loyal friend made me $6k lmao. 

RIP Jhames (named after the VIN number haha)

11. I went to a different Honda dealership to make it simple and cancelled it. Got $1750 back. 

12. Went back to see the Fit and said I would think about it, even though I'd decides on yes.

13. My friend told me I could get any car inspection for $90 bc I'm a AAA member. Who knew! I went back the next day and did that to be safe.  

14. I had already decided on yes, but emailed that I would see if I could make it work. 

15. They emailed back and added a few perks, like some really nice floor mats lol. 

16. I went back to buy and put down 2 grand. Having done the math, it is worth it to me in the long run, since I plan on paying off the Fit as quickly as possible and overpaying $50 a month until I can do more. Also plan on driving it for 15 years and pray for hail in California haha. 

I am now saving $200 a month plus I have a smaller lump sum at the end. 

I am so happy and relieved that I took the time to write this long ass post. 

Now, I know what it's like to feel financially screwed. I have always been frugal, so this was my first huge mistake. 

I thought I'd be screwed forever. I checked Reddit and Google for advice and it seemed like I most likely would be

I lost sleep for one night and told myself the next day that I've solved a lot of hard problems before. I decided to try and now I can breathe again!

investing,Bloomberg: German Unemployment Jump Adds to Pressure for Fiscal Stimulus,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/german-unemployment-jump-adds-to-pressure-for-fiscal-stimulus?srnd=premium

&gt; The number of people out of work increased by 4,000 to 2.29 million in August, the fourth straight month that joblessness failed to drop after six years of almost continuous decline. The unemployment rate remained at 5%, near a record low.

&gt; The government, after years of running a budget surplus, has signaled it‚Äôs willing to step in with fiscal support if needed. 

&gt; The German economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter and the Bundesbank is among institutions expecting another decline in the current three months. That would meet the typical definition of a recession.

&gt; Business confidence fell for a fifth month in August, and blue-chip companies including Henkel and Continental have cut their profit expectations for the year. Consumers are turning more pessimistic in surveys.

&gt; The European Central Bank has also called on Germany to use the leeway in its budget, as the nation‚Äôs woes threaten to exacerbate economic weakness in the euro zone as whole. German inflation due later Thursday is forecast to come in at 1.2% for August, a slight improvement on July but still feeble enough to drag on the ECB‚Äôs goal of just under 2% for the currency bloc.

&gt; ECB policy makers are widely expected to cut interest rates further below zero when they meet on Sept. 12.",finance

personalfinance,"Loans, 401ks and pension advice","PF has been a big help in starting to chip away at my student loans. I'd like some advice though. I started this job about two years ago under an unusual arrangement where I was technically a ""temp"" for about a year before a spot opened up and they hired me full time. Since then I've been eligible for the 401k and a pension. I recently lowered my 401k contribution to 3% to help throw extra cash at my loans. Because of the pension, the company does not offer a 401k match. I also throw a small amount each month in to a rollover IRA from a previous job.

I have about 10 student loans ranging in interest rates of 4 to 6.8 percent. The loans range in balance from just over $2k to $15k., total balance around $95k. Without adding extra $, monthly total balance comes to just under $1,100. The majority of the loans are 6.8% and I'm throwing the extra monthly money now at the lowest balance one with that rate.

I'm 32, live with my fiance, we own a home with a $130k mortgage, $1,185 monthly. Own my car outright, no other debt. We generally don't eat out &amp; cook our own food. My share of monthly expenses is just over $2k. Take home pay is just under $3k. Have about $25k in other retirement accounts.

The question is, do I stop contributing to the new 401k and throw it all at the loans? If not, what's a decent percentage to aim for? The pension fully vests after 5 years, I don't see myself staying here for the 30 years it takes to get the maximum payout.",finance

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed a bit more than initially thought in the second quarter as the strongest growth in consumer spending in 4-1/2 years was offset by declining exports and a smaller inventory build.

Gross domestic product increased at a 2.0% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second reading of second-quarter GDP on Thursday. That was revised down from the 2.1% pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the January-March quarter. It expanded 2.6% in the first half of the year.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a conference of central bankers last week that the economy was in a ""favorable place,"" but reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the economic expansion on track.",finance

personalfinance,Put more towards house or keep investing in 403B?,"I'm in my early/mid 30s and I just bought a new house in May of this year. 

It's a 30 year fixed @ 4.250% interest rate.

My current payment is $1,435.25 on the house, I rounded up my monthly payment to a flat $1,500 so I'm already paying a little extra.

I work for a university so we have a pension/retirement acct through the school. But i also signed up for a supplemental 403b through fidelity and have been contributing an extra $160 per month. I was showing steady increases there so didn't think about until around 2018 when [my graph](https://i.imgur.com/MCIs1JN.png) started fluctuating a lot more...

On 8/1/18 my fidelity account was at **$19,157.21** today it's at **$21,191.18** and **$1,920.00** of that has come from my contributions. So in 12 months I've made roughly **$114.00**?

Not completely insignificant and I know it's a relatively short term (ups and downs, etc) ...**but I'm wondering since I already have my primary pension retirement acct if it would be a better investment to take that $160 (or a portion of it) to pay off my home quicker where the benefit is essentially guaranteed?** 

Using one of those calculators I punched in paying an extra $225 per month ($160 + the $65 I already pay) and it says I'd pay off 8 years and 2 months early, and save roughly $54,979.36

economy,Trade War is Monetary Policy,"I have a theory...

Trumps Trade War is slowing down the US economy and it was actually exactly what was necessary to stave off a recession. 

Record low unemployment, negative bond yields, and long term growth have historically been very strong indicators of an upcoming recession. The government then attempts to use monetary policy to slow down the economy and stave off recessions. 

Trumps trade war is doing what monetary policy normally does because tariffs create dead-weight loss of economic efficiency. Plus the US government gets more money which it needs to help pay for its budget.
All in All the Trade War not only has been a necessary step to create fair global trade but it has inadvertently staved off a recession. That is not even getting into the whole would you want communist China ruling the world economy argument.",finance

I make okay money, but my credit score is terrible from some dumb mistakes in college, so anything I‚Äôve even remotely looked at (Best Egg, Tally, Loans, CCs), gets shot down almost before I can even finish the form.

personalfinance,Paying off a credit card with IRA withdrawl: My maybe crazy plan that I think will save me a bunch of money.,"I'm 32 with a job that pays pretty good, but I have a frustrating amount of debt in one credit card, like $10,000.That number got out of control during a month I discovered some super fun medical issues. I no longer use the card, but  because it‚Äôs near the maximum limit it‚Äôs slowly slicing away at my previously stellar Credit Rating. Currently I can really only pay the minimum due on the card every month, but every month that number ticks up slightly because of the interest rate. I‚Äôm essentially paying money to them while my balance increases and my Credit Rating drops. It‚Äôs like being in Quicksand.
I did a ‚Äúhardship‚Äù program with the card company but it only lasted a year and while it did help I‚Äôm back in the quicksand. Just not as bad as before.
As of today have fully paid off every student loan I owe, and will be able to divert the money I usually set aside for that (~$290) into my credit debt, but I know that paying it down that way will be a slow, expensive process. 

**Here‚Äôs the question**. I have a bunch of money in an IRA. More than enough to pay for that card in one payment and still feel confident in my future. Everywhere I look people say it‚Äôs dumb to withdraw because of fees and taxes on the money I withdraw. 

But tell me if this makes sense. 

If I was to pay off my card as aggressively as I can it would take about 4 years and end up costing something like $22000 total. Maybe more since it's hard to tell when the aforementioned medical issues will be a super fun drain on my finances.

BUT If I was to take $10000 out of my IRA I will get charged a 10% penalty + I‚Äôll be taxed that extra income. 
That‚Äôs only like $13000 total. That $13000 could rid me of this quicksand card right now. 
THEN without that credit card payment I can also add say $250 to my monthly IRA deposit (*plus a percentage my work adds*) within 2-3 years I should be able to fully recover the money I withdrew.  

If I‚Äôm doing my math right that saves me over $9000.

I am going to speak to my bank tomorrow and see if I can get information from them about why this has come up again, but it would seem they‚Äôve sold it and are no longer even party to the collection of the funds. 

$200 wasn‚Äôt the end of the world at the time, I just didn‚Äôt want to pay it unjustly, but $1500 is absolutely insane over the course of a year.

personalfinance,"Looking to consolidate mismatched private student loans across two adults to ""swap"" debt","**Background:** I'll try to make this quick--my (31M) wife's (29F) parents took out two sets of private loans for college for both her and her sister (31F), with her dad as cosignee for both sets of loans. The problem is, the parents took out the loans unequally in my wife's name and less so in my sister-in-law's (SIL) name, despite college being cheaper for my wife. Unfortunately I don't have exact recent up to date figures, but according to my wife she has \~76% of the total debt in her name, while her education cost only \~45% of the total overall cost of both her and her sister's education.

**Goal:** My wife's parents have been making on time payments but have been asking for partial payments from my wife and SIL. Both my wife &amp; SIL would prefer the correct amount of debt to be under the correct persons name. I know that since all of the loans are private, averaging around 7.5% interest, refinancing could be a good idea even if the mix-up didn't exist.

**My main question is:** Does anyone here happen to know if lenders are willing to open two different sets of consolidation loans, that are effectively paying off a different principal than is owed?

**For example (numbers &amp; ratios simplified for math):**

Assuming a total debt = 125k (it's higher than this)

Wife's actual college costs vs owed debt = 50k | 100k

SIL's actual college cost vs owed debt = 75k | 25k

Is there any chance at all a lender may grant my wife a loan of 100k but she is only accountable for 50k of it, and grants my sister-in-law a loan of 75k that she's fully accountable for to essentially ""swap"" the debt?

Both outstanding loans would be paid off, with the new loans totaling the same amount as the old loans, but I've never heard of a loan arrangement where borrowers swap unequal amounts of debt, which makes me think no lender would ever go for this, despite being consensual between all borrowers.

**If this isn't in the realm of possibilities:** the only other solution I can think of is to have them look into refinancing all of the loans in their dad's name, since he was a co-signee of all of the loans. I don't think this would help split the debt fairly, but it'd at least take it out of my wife &amp; SIL's names (unless they have to cosign) and provide an opportunity to at least potentially reduce the interest rates.

Really appreciate any thoughts on this, it's been an annoyance on all parties involved, but moreso for myself, my wife and my SIL. I know any decent resolution would feel better than the current arrangement. Please ask additional questions if needed. Cheers.",finance

personalfinance,Choosing which debt to pay first (Personal Loan vs Car Loan),"Hello All,

I want to make sure I am making the correct choice in which debt to pay down first using the avalanche method. I just took out at $10k personal loan to consolidate credit card debt ranging from 18-27% APR. This loan is 36 months with a $300 origination fee, interest rate is 6.46% with a 8.52% APR (i'm assuming this is because of the origination fee). My car loan is 7.69% with a balance of $32k. FYI my gross income is $96k, and I rent for $965/month. I just want to make sure the responsible decision here is to pay the car loan first (or attempt to refinance for a lower rate) because although the APR is higher on the personal loan, the actual accruing interest rate is lower. I will be putting around $2k/month towards debt. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,401k transfer from old plan to new plan distribution,"I think I may be getting confused on this wording here? 

My wife received this from her previous employer in a 401k options package in the mail. I believe she has about $300-400 in the account so not a lot, does she have to take a distribution with penalties or can she rollover to her new employers plan? ...I am confused if the distribution meaning is in relation to it exiting the old 401k or if it refers to taking it all in cash which would result in the penalty for withdrawing.

Also regarding the 30 days does she only have 30 days to do this ..I think she is benefits eligible after 1 month at her new position so it will likely kick in then?



Under the law you have the right to consider your payment elections for at least 30 days from the date you receive this distribution package from the benefits administrator. The 30 day rule is intended to give you sufficient time to weight your payment options. However you my waive the 30 day period and receive your distribution sooner. 


If your vested balance is $5k or less the plan requires that you take the distribution. If you do not return the forms to your benefits administrator within 30 days, your distribution will either be paid in a lump sum or will be automatically rolled over to an IRA. If your vested balance is less than $1k, your distribution will be paid to you in a lump sum. If you have attained the later age of 62 or the plans normal retirement age and your vested balance is less than $5k, your distribution will be paid to you in a lump sum. If your vested balance is between $1k and 5k and you have not attained the later age of 62 or the plans normal retirement age, your distribution will be automatically rolled over into an IRA as explained in the enclosed ""supplement notice regarding plan payments"". Please note that lump sum distributions above $200 are subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding.""",finance

solar,Solar as an Investment Strategy,"After some trees were taken down on my road, my home in MA has an opportunity to go solar. I'm still in a less than ideal  E-W lot with steep roof pitches and heavy shading, but there is hope! I'm all about digging in to the numbers and while I'm certainly Pro-Solar, it still needs to make financial sense from an ROI and lost opportunity cost perspective, especially when you are talking big investment over 25 years with up to 8 year paybacks. $25k over 25 years @ 7% is $135k factoring in inflation, so we're talking big money at stake here. A lot of people get caught up in the monthly bill saving, etc, but you need to look in to the ""real cost"" of going solar vs staying the course.

While MA isn't a huge producer, it has good incentives to make it attractive. MA Smart program is roughly 25%-30% credit paid out yearly over 10 years, on top of the 30% Federal Credit. Another $1000 MA Credit as well. Expensive electric at .23/kwh, and a 4% rise in rates every year over the last 19 years. 

My strategy involves paying cash upfront, get the 30% back from the IRS and that is considered your investment price because the incentives take 10 years to materialize. All credits get re-invested in the stock market @ 7% compounding return. You continue to pay your solar portion of your utility bill, but it now gets invested every month, and also increases 4% every year with your electric rate. You keep paying like you've always done, but it goes in your own pocket.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XELYtZxxTttpVoQP1r-IxUl71FMudNcnsLwbtgjINWM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XELYtZxxTttpVoQP1r-IxUl71FMudNcnsLwbtgjINWM/edit?usp=sharing)

The first box shows an annualized ROI on your investment, accounting for the money you are missing out in the market by using cash for the purchase. These are top of the line Sunpower Series with an expected 95% rating after 25 years. I didn't account for that slight drop in production but should have. 3 tabs show 3 proposals I have.

Second box shows estimated costs if you don't switch to solar. Energy costs rise 4% year, but are offset by passive income having not cashed out your investment. Eventually rules of compounding can catch up. Electric car in your future?

What I call the ""real cost of switching"", is the swing between these two values. You have a choice to make- ""save"" $5000 by switching, or cost yourself say $5000 in utility costs. That is a $10,000 decision! This drives my yearly ROI. 

Last line is how much you are paying yourself, see the $$ add up!

25 years is a loooong time. I'm not sure I can picture myself in my same house at 62. If you play with the investment return, it's satisfying to see if the market drops to 1% a year when this bull run ends, that I'm still getting a solid 10%+ in a bad economy. Likewise, a 10% average will make the retirement account add up!

Anyways, this is what I've been working on all week. I""m curious your thoughts and if anyone dives in this deep or if its just me. I apologize if there errors, it's been some late nights. Cheers.",energy

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I was thinking of purchasing a rental property and using the income to pay off my current mortgage. I still haven't worked out any numbers but wanted to check other opinions.

investing,Basic Bond Questions,"I'm hoping to sense-check my understanding of some bond basics and how it relates to ever-growing negative interest-rate environments...

* a bond's **coupon** is fixed (as a percentage of its face value) until maturity.  It's only influenced by central bank interest rates upon issuance in the sense that the issuer sets coupon rate taking into account wider interest rates.  Central banks changing interest rates have zero effect on already issued bonds' coupon payments.
* a bond's **yield** is the rate of return (that varies in real-time) due to interest rates and price (depending on which way you look at it).  You don't get paid the yield - it's just an expression/abstraction of how much overall return your coupon payments represent.  So if the fed cuts to zero, then existing bonds in the market (with &gt;0 coupon) will have a comparatively more attractive yield than newly issued ones, creating a buy/demand-pressure and lifting the price.  

Assuming I've got that correct, a few questions...

* in my example of the fed cutting to zero, it wouldn't raise the price of newly issued bonds right?  Just the ones that had a higher coupon already secured?  In fact, shouldn't the newly issued bonds trade at a lower price in relative terms?
* when we talk about investors losing money on negative yielding bonds, it's simply that the coupon doesn't fully offset the wider interest rate right?  i.e. even in a negative-interest rate world, bonds are still making positive coupon payments - just not large enough to offset central bank rates.
* when we say there's $17 trillion negative-yielding debt and counting, that's growing by the day simply because new bonds are being issued with coupon rates that don't offset interest rates right?  The only time already-issued-bonds could spill over to the negative-yield side is if the central bank dropped interest rates (i.e. this won't happen day-to-day)
* With yields this low and getting negative, why on earth would the average retail investor not be selling their bonds now/soon?  Surely they have become assets that are almost irresponsible not to sell when you have the double-sell-incentive of falling yields and rising prices.  I suppose you may think yields could fall even further, but at some point everyone has to turn into a bond trader instead of a long-term holder now because the price has to correct at some point?

After I pay off the personal loan, my remaining debts will be the following:
11.5k on a 2016 Ford Focus at 4.6% (336 a month/ 2.5 years left on the loan)
5900 in student loans ( Federal loan. Believe the interest is 3% ish /79 a month.)
208k for my home

The car is not worth what I owe on it. I purchased the Focus in Alaska and now live in the lower 48. I have been told I should put this one on the back burner. However, I am recently divorced. I kept the car but need to transfer the title into my name solely (joint loan) before August 2020 ( two years). When I called to refinance through the original loan bank, I would have to come up with a 4k down payment and the lowest I could get is 6% because it would be considered a used car.
Conventional financial wisdom indicates the student loans might be the better bet to pay of first, but would I be foolish to finish the car first? Ex and I are on decent terms so he will sign the title over no problem. I would double up on payment and have it paid off in less than a year.",finance

personalfinance,"First time poster to this thread, want to see if I'm making smart decisions now in how I pay off debt.","So I finished my Bachelor's this past December and came out with about 30k in student loan debt plus about 8k in credit card debt (some of that CC debt is also due to poor decisions I made with them throughout school).  I make about 45k a year using the degree I got.

I work for a government entity (University) and I don't see that changing soon, so I applied for a income driven repayment plan for my federal loans so that I can qualify for the public service loan forgiveness program through the fed government.  As such I only pay about 90 on my student loan right now.

I recently came up with a plan to clear all my credit card debt in about 14 months.  Since the debt is spread across multiple cards my plan is to pay off my highest interest rate first while paying only the minimum on my other cards.  The other cards are on a special interest rate due to some balance transfers I just did so there is no interest accumulating on those, only the one I'm paying on first.

Once the first card is paid off I was going to go in order of amount owed and pay the amount I was paying on the first card, $370 + the minimum I was paying.  The final card will receive $550 a month while the others are paid off.

Besides my credit cards, I was thinking of paying down my car by the extra $550 after I finish the cards.  At that point I'll be at around 13 - 14k on my car.  My car has double the interest rate of my student loans so I thought that would be the next best thing to pay off.  Then save for a down payment on a house.

It seems to work out in my head, but I'm not sure if I'm missing anything since I'm pretty much self taught on personal finance, hence the poor decisions.

personalfinance,"""Time, Value, Money,"" Low interest rates, and Debt","Hey Folks on Personal Finance! I have noticed quite a few posts recently regarding the personal dilemma of paying down debt vs. saving/investing. At the end of the day, this is most definitely a personal preference. However, there are a handful of things one should consider:

1. How old are you, how much have you saved for retirement, and when do you want to retire? 

Utilizing peak career cashflow to pay down 3-5% interest rate debt (when you can assume 7-9% return over the long run in investments) can really hurt later in retirement, especially if your current nest egg is low and your time until retirement is within 10-15 years.

2. What's the real reason as to why you want to pay off debt?

Really think long and hard about this question - some will come to the conclusion that it makes a lot of financial sense. For example, utilizing the last three years of employment free cash flow to pay off outstanding debt before retirement (assuming that nest egg is now in a much more conservative asset allocation that probably only gets 3-5% return).

Others will find that they ""just want to pay off debt."" - ask yourself: is this an emotional decision or is it a wise decision? Think about the opportunity costs and evaluate other outcomes.

3. Low interest rate cycles happen, high interest rate cycles happen - this will never change in a capitalist society. However, they will change on a relative basis (maybe 3% short term rates are the new 7%). What does this mean for you?

Absolutely nothing - save money and live within your means, but have fun doing it. Interest rates, stock market returns, and debt have nothing to do with your ability to learn, continuously educate yourself, and make wise decisions throughout life.

personalfinance,advice on trading in a car for a better interest rate,"hello!

I am looking for some advice regarding my car. I have a 2014 Kia Soul with 100K miles on it (I drive pretty far to work everyday). I bought it when I was 19. I‚Äôm not sure what my credit score was then... all I had on my credit is a 6 month lease on an apartment and a credit card I used for gas. I pay 8.25% interest on the car... which seems very high to me. My payment is $230 for 6 years, which also seems high/long compared to my friends that have car payments. 

My question is, would it be worth it to trade in my car for a newer one with less miles, and would I get a better interest rate? I‚Äôm 23 now, have much more on my credit (3 cards, the 6 month lease, overpaying on the Kia monthly, and utilities on a house for over a year) and my credit score is in the high 700s. 

Side question- I‚Äôm also in the process of getting another apartment. Should I do these two things a few months apart, or does it matter?

personalfinance,double checking W2+1099 estimated taxes,"Hi

Want to double check that I'm estimating my taxes correctly .... didn't last year. 

Revenue : $30,000

Business expenses : $5000

Business profit: $25,000

Taxable earnings : $25,000 \* 0.9235 ($23087.5)

Self employment taxes :  $23,087.50 \* 0.038 (SSA covered by W2) =  $877.325

1/2 SE taxes = $438.6625

Qualified Business Expense: $25,000 - $438.6625 = $24,561.3375

Personal 401k - $10,000 (no W2  plan eligibility -- using $10k for example, know it can be $19k)  = $24,561.3375 - $10,000 

Business Income, taxable =  $14,561.3375

Profit sharing (solo 401k) = 14,561.3375 \* 0.2 = $2912.2675 

Taxable income = $14,561.3375 - $2912.2675 = $11649.07 

 I would combine $11,649.07 with my W2 gross income and use table to get estimated federal taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say $50,000 + $11,649.07.   So that would be 12% bracket. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then my W2 has already paid in $7000.  So if my math says $8000 owed, I would just pay in $1000 for estimated taxes?

personalfinance,Advice for 130K student debt,"Sorry for formatting. On my phone. 

I graduated from a public university in May and just started working at a 60K salary job for a large defense contractor with over 85,000 employees. I have a degree in Supply Chain Management and Information Systems.

I have about 30k in loans in my name under a direct unsubsidized loan. 4 different groups with interest rates between 4-6%. 

I also have about 90k in loans under my stepdads name under a direct parent PLUS loan. I am responsible for paying this off ( i have access to his account on the loan servicer ). Interest rates for this one are a bit higher ranging from 6-7.6%. 

I am currently renting a room out of a friends house for $550 per month and grocery/food wise I am pretty stingy besides the occasional date night with my girlfriend. 

I understand the concept of paying off the highest interest rate loans first to ensure the least amount of interest paid.

stocks,To what degree is stock market manipulation real on smaller exchanges?,"I'm curious about how rampant stock manipulation is, specifically on smaller exchanges like the OTC and CSE.

Many people know [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/), but I was hoping to get a more unbiased opinion here. Stock like GTII (GTBIF:OTC) just reported earnings, and they were arguably very strong. They have a \~$1.7 billion US market cap, and just reported $44.7 million US revenue on their latest Q, an increase of 228% YoY and 60% QoQ. Gross margins improved to 52% from 46%, good balance sheet, and there was nothing said on the Conference call that would be interpreted as negative. (Earnings Report [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/28/1908014/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Triples-Revenue-to-44-7-Million-and-Reports-5-0-Million-in-Adjusted-Operating-EBITDA-in-Second-Quarter-2019.html) if you'd like to see the numbers).

Despite the good earnings, and their strong growth potential as more US states open up to Recreational use, the stock went down the day of earnings, and continues to fall today. Down about 65% from their all time high despite consistent QoQ growth and execution from strong management. The US market is expected to be $50+ billion by 2025, so there's definitely growth potential.

On [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/) people say that the stocks are heavily manipulated on these exchanges like the CSE and OTC, and that's why even when they report good earnings, they go down. Now, you could argue they are all massively overvalued, but compared to the Canadian LP's, the US MSO's (Multi State Operators) are much better value, especially if you believe the US will eventually legalize on a federal level.

So my question is, are these stocks actually manipulated by aggressive short selling, or is it truly a question of valuation, and both US/Canadian MJ stocks are over valued?

investing,Data on who is buying negative yielding bonds,"Most commentators I've listened to say buying negative yielding bonds doesn't make any sense (or even very low yielding long-term US bonds). What I haven't heard from is the people who are actually buying these bonds and the reasons they are doing so. Is there good data on who is buying these bonds? If we can answer the ""who"" question, then maybe we can answer the ""why"" question.

EDIT: This article comes up with 4 possibilities, 

1)  Bagholders

Investors who scoop up negative-yielding bonds are betting on the value of the securities to keep rising, in effect, wagering that there are other ‚Äúbagholders.‚Äù

a.k.a speculation or greater fool theory

2)  Safe assets

Market participants say there are a few bolt-holes that are capable of weathering the deterioration of the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions. When risk assets sell off, the issue of negative yields on government bonds may be overshadowed by their proven ability to rally during times of market distress.

a.k.a ""flight to quality""; meaning they expect everything else to perform worse

3)  Cross-currency hedging

Negative yields don‚Äôt mean negative income for some.

Unlike European and Japanese investors, U.S. investors are often paid to hedge against fluctuations of foreign currencies because U.S. interest rates are much higher than in other developed markets like Europe and Japan.

a.k.a speculative trading involving bonds and currencies

4)  Roll down

Another way investors can make money even in a backdrop of subzero interest rates is to take advantage of the yield curve‚Äôs slope, which still can be steep even for negative-yielding bond markets in Germany and Japan.

The yield curve represents the gap between shorter-term yields and longer-term yields, with a steep curve indicating a large difference.

This is not a direct attack at any community of said games!!!   

It really irks me that no game has found a way to help/levy teams that lose a player in a **competitive** game type due to leaving or throwing. I cannot even express how many games of Overwatch/League of Legends I've lost due to someone leaving after 5 minutes and then the match is basically over, barring extra ordinary consequences. And the flip side, it's boring to just sit and let your team mates spawn-camp the remaining players in the game.

Ironically in my experiences, Halo/CoD are 50/50 **better** when you lose a team mate in **TDM** due to the ability for less kills to take place against your team. 

***There is no real ""solution"" for this***, but here are some possibly terrible ideas:

1. BACKFILL, with extra XP/Skill Rating if you win, minor if you lose
2. Change spawn timers to ""even"" things 
3. Reduce ""rank loss"" - slippery slope as you don't see groups in *some* games at high ELO 
4. Driving games are kind of a lose/lose because the guy taking everyone out doesnt care to win anyway.
5. BACKFILL 5-10% (de)buff to CDR

Yes they are penalties for the leaver: being banned \*SO SPOOKY, but majority of the people who intentionally throw just go on another acc and do it again. 

OW specifically: even if you manage a 60% win rate with your hero, you are ""out"" for like 45-1hr of game time due to just get back to your original rank(if you win the next one) due to someone who you have never met/not even in your team, leaving. My leave/quit rate ""has to be"" super low as I do not leave games, barring internet failure(SW Florida sucks).Open role lock if someone quits. 

LoL specifically: wish I had a dime for every Shen/Zed I have throwing their smurf from Diamond to Gold and intentionally feeding the other team and then sit AFK in spawn and just flood the chat with trash. Which once a hero is fed, is a team effort to kill 5v5, and even then, GL.

personalfinance,What kind of interest program is this; felt like I got scammed? (Toyota Auto Loan),"I just took a Toyota Auto loan yesterday for about $22,500 at a 6.01% APR rate. They knocked down the OTD price of the vehicle if I opted to finance (and wait 90 days before paying off the loan) instead of pay by cash.

&amp;#x200B;

The finance manager at the dealership explained to me that the interest is computed against the remaining loan amount or principal. So if I paid off 20,000 today, my interest until the next payment is going to only be computed against the $2,500 remaining. I told him that I'll make a 20,000 payment immediately, and pay off the remainder in the next 2 payments. And he ran some calculations that put my total interest paid at under $100. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I just called the 1-800 Toyota auto loan number and I was told that their interest is computed only once every 12 months. So they told me that I will be paying the \~$3.60 daily interest rate for the next 12 months, regardless of the principal left on my loan for the next 12 months. They told me if I paid off the entire loan today, I would no longer accumulate interest. I could pay off the entire loan today, but I told the dealership that I'd wait 90 days, but either I was lied to or the finance manager at the dealership or the representative at the 1-800 number is wrong. If the 1-800 number person is right and I wait 90 days to pay off the entire loan, then that means I'm going to end up losing about $324 due to interest regardless of how much I pay off.

personalfinance,"24, need words of wisdom","Long story short: I did not grow up in a healthy household. Parents jerked me around to do medical school. I went to med school. I dropped out after getting my student loan. I spent my student loan to buy a $15,000 Lexus and I have no money left at all. I got my parents to pay off my loan in full, so I'm officially debt-free with a Lexus in my name as well as a $15,000 Toyota I fooled them to buy for me (long story, basically I told them my old car broke down, and I went and got a Toyota off them and bought a Lexus for myself). Tl;dr, I am debt-free, job-free, and own 2 cars worth about $23 to $28k combined.

Anyway, I'm letting my mother drive my Toyota for now. I'm driving my Lexus. I do have a plan for my life. I am currently working at Domino's and making pretty much minimum wage. I am also attending community college and taking math courses to get my butt into engineering school. I plan on going to a local state university, graduating with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in about 2-3 years (I already have most of the prereqs done), and hopefully landing a entry-level ME job in a low-to-medium CoA city. As a fresh-out-of-college ME, I could probably expect to make $50,000-$60,000 yearly.

My goal is to live a independent (no more freaking mooching off the Bank of Mom n' Dad, like I've been doing) and relatively comfortable life. What should I do in pursuit of this goal? Sell the Lexus? Sell both the Lexus and Toyota, pocket the $$, and finish college with that money?

To be honest, my plan is to:

1. Finish CC, go to state university, take out federal student loans, and finish my engineering degree.

2. Land an entry-level job, pay down the loan, and keep maintaining and driving the Lexus, until it's finally too old and expensive to maintain. It's a 2012 with 100k miles on it, and I expect it to last at least to 180-200k miles without few if any issues, based on my past experience with the brand, my previous job as a automotive repair tech, and the fact that all my parents Toyotas have lasted 20+ years and 200k miles with maybe $500 of repairs total.

I know an alternative could be:
1. Sell the Lexus.

2. Use that money to buy a beater and to minimize student loans.

3. Land entry-level job.

Or even:

1. Sell both the Lexus and Toyota.

2. Use that money to pay for pretty much 100% of college and finish my engineering degree debt-free.

However, my parents would probably be pretty pissed if I took away the Toyota (even though the title has only my name on it) and they have threatened to cut me out their will before. They own 5 rental properties across several states and are pretty well-off. As much as I resent them, I'd love to get a piece of the pie when they finally bite the dust!

Your thoughts, please? I'm really inclined to go with option 1 (finish college and keep the Lexus well into my career). I mean, it's a nice car to drive, duh, but the flip side is that I'll have to incur about 2-3 years worth of state university tuition debt ($30k-45k). It's not an insane figure, but it's not something to be taken lightly. My car is a very rare model too (only like 4000 total in the US, so I could probably sell it for much of my original purchase price when I finish college?) But anyway, please don't lambaste me too hard, I do realize already that I'm dumb af but the flip side is that I've actually been taking my issues seriously (going to therapy, developing a plan to move out, working jobs, etc.) I could just be sitting on my ass at home doing nothing and continue living off Mom n' Dad welfare (seriously, they would actually prefer that) but I got plans for my life and I'm done with pleasing anybody except myself :).",finance
personalfinance,I think I fell for a student loans scam,"Throwaway because I typically am the type of person who recognizes immediately when something is too good to be true. I'm truly embarrassed that it got as far as it did without me seeing all the red flags.

Background: I have approximately $45k in student debt, all through a mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized government loans, none of them private. Since I graduated a little over three years ago I've been struggling with pretty serious depression and anxiety that I'm only now really beginning to get on top of after getting help. I also recently got fairly low-paying, but steady income through a $25k/year job. One of the more serious symptoms of my mental illness is hardcore avoidance of the things that give me anxiety, and one of those is my student debt. Where I stand now is near default, and consequently pretty desperate for some solution that allows me to get back on top of payments and building my credit back up.


A few days ago I received an official looking letter with ""FINAL NOTICE"" written on the outside. The official looking letter lets me know that I may be eligible to convert my current high-interest loan into a federally-backed consolidation with a lower rate. The process started with making sure I had an account at nslds.ed.gov, and then calling the toll free number. ""It's time to **finally** take control of your student loan debt."" I thought it was a little weird that the office hours were posted were listed in PST, but I foolishly disregarded that red flag. It referenced the U.S. Department of Education, had the exact loan amount, and used the government website and that was enough to assuage my concern. I won't mention all the numerous other red flags in the letter that I completely missed, or probably ignored out of desperation. 


I saw that the account was already there from back when I was in school, and then called the number. The answering service put me on the line with a human right away. He asked for the ID# on the letter, my income, and my family size. I gave him the info and he told me I qualified for consolidation and lowered payments. The plan I would be on would put me at payments of $39/mo for 240 months. He said that there would be three payments before that term starts of $333 for the consolidation process. Because the first three payments had to be electronic, he needed my bank account and routing number, and I obliged. 


The last step on the call was to sign the agreement electronically. I scrolled through the document and signed the boxes, thinking I wish I had the time to read through this. I went through the process and the call was done. I had a brief few seconds of relief that I'd reached a solution, then had the thought ""is this really legit?"" Convenient time to have that thought after I'd just given my bank info and signed everything.


I went back and read through the document I signed. Nowhere did it say this was an agreement with the Department of Education, but rather with a company called Freedom DocPrep. I read on and it seems like they simply are the middle man, charging $999 to set up the consolidation. If that's really all it is, then I'm not opposed to that. But then I did the math and 240 months of $39 is only $9360. Did I really just get off the hook for $35k? Now I'm really starting to get suspicious. I googled the company name, but that didn't really turn anything up other than a bunch of articles about student loan scams, and that at best they're just charging their up-front fee and that the rest is legit. 


My questions:

1. Is there any chance that this $39 for 240 months is actually the legit deal if I'd actually done this myself?

2. Is there any way to block the payments from going out even though I already gave them my account info?

3. What are the chances they are going to be charging more money than these terms, even though everything is laid out in the document that I signed? ($333 x3, then $39 for 240 months.)

4. I know I fucked up. Not just with falling into this scam, but also not paying my bills over the past few years and even getting this far into debt to begin with. Is there any reasonable course of action from here?


Edit for more questions:

5. How am I so stupid? I went to college for fucks sake.

I contacted a couple of places and by far the best rate came from a company (company B) who offered 30-year @ 3.375%, no fees (I have to pre-pay interest for september and fund my Escrow, but neither are a fee - I'll get my old Escrow back and I was paying interest either way).  I'm happy with that offer. I worked with this mortgage company before because they gave me my original mortgage and later sold it to my current lender.

My current lender contacted me and offered to refinance.  He said somewhere between 3.375% and 3.6% but said he couldn't give me a number without doing a hard credit pull.  Their original offer letter said 3.8%, but he called and gave me this number.  I then told him I already have an offer for 3.375%.  He said if I gave them the offer letter from company B, he could match or beat it.  

I already verbally committed to company B. They asked I wanted to ""lock in my rate"" and I said yes. I have not signed anything but would feel a bit guilty switching - they have treated me well and gave me a competitive offer upfront.

Anyway, my question is - am I being an idiot for not trying to have a little bidding war and get a slightly better mortgage? I'm at a stressful place at work and my preference would be to sign the 3.375% and get it over with. But, if people think I'm being stupid then I'd like to hear it. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,First Time Credit Builder,"Hello. I'm in my mid-twenties, unemployed (but receive a bit each month that I can use towards the limit), and looking for a good balanced CC for my first-time CC.

I've found a few that 'pop out' to me, and I'd probably have my limit at around $200-300 or so at most per month for the line. *Preferably a SECURED Credit Card!*

Are any of these a good choice? My main account, Charles Schwab, doesn't seem to offer a secure card of their own.

* Primor Visa (Low Fixed 9.99 Interest Rate)
* First Progress Select MasterCard Secured Credit Card
* OpenSky Secured Visa *(TheBigCrapple does not recommend)*
* American Express Everyday Credit Card
* Discover It Cash Back

I am not in any fashion of schooling, so I don't know if I could even qualify for one of those, haha.

Preferably low to no annual fee, if possible, but if it helps me get to building my initial line of credit, the lower, the better for my financial situation. I make only around 6-7k per year.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to make long-ish term plans and need advice,"I‚Äôm currently 23 years old, and I just graduated from college with my undergrad in social work.

I transferred out to a community college and then finished at a state school. But, I now have to pay the consequences and have roughly $63,000 in private loans with an insanely high interest rate and $20,000 in federal. It makes me sick to even think about it. 

Right now I‚Äôm living at home, and my parents said I‚Äôm welcome to stay as long as I want. They don‚Äôt mind me staying rent free since they weren‚Äôt able to help with college costs at all. I‚Äôm super thankful to live for free, but my home life is not so great, and without getting into details, it‚Äôs making my mental health suffer. I keep debating whether or not to move out

I just landed a promotion at work with will let me make about $2300 net/month. I really want to knock out my student loans as fast as possible, but I‚Äôm also trying to consider how to do that while also looking at grad school in the future. I‚Äôve been toying with refinancing the private loans down to a 5 year plan, which would be $1200/month, but I figure if I live at home, I can do that. The only other bills I have are my car and insurance, which comes to $350/mo and my credit card payment, which I‚Äôm slowly paying down at a 0% interest. My other idea is to extend the repayment on the student loans and just throw extra money onto it while at home and then not feel like I‚Äôm drowning when I go back to school.

TLDR: Need help figuring out what to do with my $63,000 private student loans in terms of refinancing, but also considering whether I should move out now because my mental health is tanking or wait until I finish grad school in the next 2 years or so

personalfinance,Should I buy my first NYC condo?,"# 

Long time lurker and first-time poster (made a new account for this :-) I've learned a lot from everyone here and would love to hear what you think about my next potential big financial step. I've been looking to buy my first home in NYC for the last year and recently came across a condo that I love. I'm seriously considering putting in an offer but am wondering if it makes financial sense or if I'm about to step into it. Number are as follows:

\-Condo is listed at around 700k. It's in an area that I think will hold, and likely appreciate, in value. It is a new construction so hoping maintenance will be low for at least the first year or two.

\-Non-mortgage expenses will be around 600 (with HOA + monthly taxes)

\-I plan on putting 10% down so I know I'll probably have to pay PMI (I've heard it's about 300 a month?), with a rate of around 3.85%.

\-With homeowners insurance + everything else, I estimate that my monthly payments will be between 3800-4000.

A little about me:

\-I am a 29 year old woman, unmarried and unattached at the moment.  I have no plans to leave the city.

\-I make 200k a year in a stable job. I plan on staying there for at least another 2-3 years, with yearly salary increases of around 10-15k. I also receive an annual bonus (low 5 figures) but I don't want to include that in my calculations for the purposes of figuring out what I can afford. I already live in the city so my taxes are very high.

\-I don't have any credit card debt and I don't have a car. I borrowed money from relatives for grad school (fully acknowledging how lucky/privileged I am) and pay them back about 1500 a month-- they have been very kind and there is no set timeline or even amount for my loan repayments. I have been paying them 1500 a month for the last 3 years, however.

\-Take home after taxes, insurance, 401k etc. is approximately 9500 a month. 2400 goes to rent, 1500 to relatives for loan. I'm saving about 4500 a month currently. I'm generally pretty frugal though I'm sure I can cut back my expenses by another 200 if I tried harder.

\-401k/retirement savings = 110k; investment account with vanguard (VTSAX) = 120k; cash savings = 48k (high yield interest rate account). I should have enough cash savings by the end of the year to put down a 10% downpayment for a 700k condo.

My question is-does it make financial sense to put 10% down and pay PMI, or wait until I have a bigger downpayment (so another 1.5 years, since I will have to renew my lease)? I should be able to save enough, even with the higher housing payments of 4000, to put in another 10% equity into the place by the end of 2020, so theoretically I could stop paying PMI after one year (that would bring my monthly payments down to a very manageable 3200 for me). I've been poking around the internet though and it seems like a lot of PMI lenders require you to pay for a designated period of time.

My reason for only putting 10% down is because I don't want to tie up too much of my money (especially if it means selling my VTSAX in this volatile market) in an illiquid asset. Is it worth making the higher monthly payments+PMI just so I could avoid selling my VTSAX holdings?

I plan on paying for closing costs with my annual bonus this year...I have not put in an offer on this place yet so there is a possibility I could get it for a little less (or my offer could also be rejected, lol).

Would appreciate your advice!",finance
personalfinance,Engineering student struggling with car loan,I'm 21 year old that made the biggest mistake: Car Loan. I financed a 2016 Volkswagen  Jetta for $13.5k plus an interest rate of 8.5% APR.

personalfinance,Lots of savings + Considerable debt... What to do?,"26 years old/homeowner. Wondering if I should just pay off our debt and leverage a higher monthly income that is *not* being allocated to debt. Really unsure if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù answer here. I am most interested in saving + investing for our future‚Äîthis is our number one priority. So get rid of this debt ASAP or hang onto it and just keep piling up savings (which would be funneled into a variety of investment vehicles soon)?

Info:

$33,000 in a savings account

$40,000 total debt costing $700/month at an average interest rate of 5%:
- two cars (15K and 10K, both two years old) and 
- student loans (15K left from 23K, two years old)

Debt does not include home. Purchased and built new in late 2017. Put down 15% and am OK with monthly mortgage payment at 3.85% interest for 30 years. Not interested in paying off home early with that interest rate and fact that it‚Äôs a brand new house.

401K/403b combined: $40,000 (three years working thus far)

$5700 combined monthly income (after taxes):

$2000/month saved 
$2700 to bills and debt
$1000 for our shared credit (paid off in full each month, so $500/each discretionary)

So without our debt, we would effectively have $2700/month allocated to saving/investing. But is it worth letting go of $40K to get rid of debt that has an average interest rate of 5%? 

I sort of just want to get rid of the debt now and be done with it, and focus on saving from here on out (and never, ever finance a car again).  My wife and I plan to never be in debt after this, unless there‚Äôs some horrific medical emergency, etc.

We won‚Äôt be having kids any time soon (early-mid thirties, or we‚Äôll adopt/foster).

Talking to a bankruptcy attorney next week but want to bounce ideas off in here as well.

I've worked in the games industry for almost a decade. It's super volatile and mentally taxing. Went on FMLA beginning of this year for major depression due to new boss/work environment. Got ""laid off"" when I came back (already in the middle of a lawsuit with them, this isn't the reason of the post).

Financial summary:

Been living off rental income and credit cards, paying mortgages with credit cards sometimes. After the income loss on FMLA I did not scale down my expenses as I expected to continue work after FMLA and then after the job loss, expected to find work again quickly. Have not gotten any job offers and have been willing to take a lesser position (which is a death sentence because of how awful gaming industry pays). Volatile industry, no hope in sight for my niche type of work. All 3 of my houses have had to have major repairs needed on them this year... Just my luck. New HVAC $6k, flooding problem $5k, replace a shower $1k, etc. etc.  ontop of that during my job search I have been trying to work on my own product and hire contractors. At the end of the day I'm at $85k in credit card debt from this year and I have $20k in private student loans left, no more federal.

I was on unemployment and now I do dog sitting to bring in some extra money. It brings in about $1500 a month if I do good but it can also become very stressful due to how many dogs I have to take in to make that and it stresses my wife out even more (we love animals, it's just a lot ontop of our own dogs). It's also not entirely reliable. So it's a bandaid for now.

Financial breakdown:

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/2zbEe0W](https://imgur.com/2zbEe0W))

All of my credit cards are 0% APR currently until mid next year. Once that happens due to having $85k in CC, that's about $1000-1500 a month in interest to pay. I have not missed any bills this past year, all are current. I hover around $10k cash in bank but all that goes straight to the mortgages each month and then refilled by rental payments. I don't think selling the car is a good idea because I got a killer deal on it and it won't have repair issues anytime soon and it has about $3k worth of equity in it, 3 more years to pay off I think. My wife makes almost minimum wage (passion job) and has her own bills to pay.

Mortgage #1 rental, $100k worth of equity

Mortgage #2 rental, $20k worth of equity

Mortgage #3 residence, just bought in November of last year, so break even. We have 1 roommate to bring in the $700

Utilities are high because I pay utilities on rental #1 and #2, because they are boarder homes. So it fluctuates.

**I do not have health insurance currently** (so that will bring me even more into the red if I get it)

My thought right now is to move back into mortgage #1 as residence, file for chapter 7 bankruptcy so that way all my homes can be protected as #2 and #3 don't have any equity to pay towards the debts. Convert #3 into a rental to get back the original income from #1. If I do this I wipe out all my credit/student debt, and then I will be back in the green can start saving several hundred bucks a month until I can make the industry switch. I honestly have no idea how this will pan out, maybe have to go back to school. Selling the houses isn't an option I think because I wouldn't make anything off #2 or #3 and if I sell #1, I lose most of my only way to generate income which puts me even worse than hemorrhaging the $400 a month.

I am not trying to desperately cling onto the properties, even tho it would be nice. It just seems like the best financial decision to try and retain them due to not having a personal income and especially after doing all the repairs this year.

**I do not care about poor credit later.** I know how the credit game works (I have over 20 credit cards from the past sevearl years(churner)) I have never missed a payment on my credit so bankruptcy won't be something I can't bounce back from in a few years.

We will also be doing end to end testing via cypress since we don't have php unit tests. So he recommended using something like rest-assured.

*****
&gt; Stock market investors may be glad to see August go, but September might not be any better, unless there are some positive developments in the trade war.
*****
&gt; Markets enter September, anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut mid-month and worrying the chilling in the global economy will reach the U.S. There appears to be no progress in the trade war between the U.S. and China, and investors are watching to see if it will begin to hit key data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell about 2% for the month, its worst performance since May. August was a month of rising recession worries and trade headlines moved the market in both directions, starting with the Aug. 1 declaration by President Donald Trump that he would put tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf history repeats itself we could see a selloff in September and then we have some sort of capitulation,‚Äù said Samuel Stovall, chief market strategist CFRA. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of what I call a pullback. The line in the sand is really 2,800. If we break meaningfully through that we could end up having a sharp and swift decline.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The first week of September includes some important reports, including the August employment report on Friday and the ISM manufacturing survey on Tuesday. The auto industry releases monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for news on whether face-to-face negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials can take place in September, as expected after the last round of talks.
*****
&gt; For the stock market, September is historically a worse month than August, in terms of losses. ‚ÄúIf you thought August was bad, history says September can be worse because not only is it the month with the largest average decline, but is the only month to fall more frequently than it rises,‚Äù said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Since World War II, the average move for the S&amp;P for all months is a gain of 0.69%, but the average September move is negative 0.54%. The market has been down 55% of the time in September, making it the worst month of the year, but October, which is up 61% of the time, is a more volatile month with historically steeper losses.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching interest rates, which have been in a steep decline in August. In one month, the 30-year bond has lost 60 basis points, to a level under 2%. The widely watched yield curve, between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield inverted. That is a recession warning and means the 10-year yield has gotten lower than the 2-year yield, or investors are demanding more yield for shorter term investments.
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching to see how the incoming data affects the bond market and most importantly, the Fed. The Fed meets Sept. 17 and 18, and it is expected to cut rates by a quarter point though some bond strategists say it could cut by a half percentage point if the economy softens or markets are highly volatile.
*****
&gt; Next week could provide some clues on future monetary policy with Chairman Jerome Powell set to speak next Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is also set to speak Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWithout offering judgment on Powell‚Äôs performance heretofore, investors will be seeking clarity on if 2019 will mirror the 1990s (75 bp of aggregate rate cuts) or if the fallout from the trade war has done more damage to the global economy and therefore warrants even greater accommodation,‚Äù said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 155,000 jobs were added in August, down from 164,000 in July, according to Refinitiv. They expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and average hourly earnings to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said he is watching the ADP private sector payroll report Thursday, ahead of the government‚Äôs report Friday, since it includes details on small business hiring. The sector has shown weakness in the ADP data.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúMay and June showed declines. That was the only time since 2010 that ADP showed declines for small employers over the course of the recovery. July was really weak too,‚Äù he said. Tilley said it‚Äôs unclear why that sector of the job market is showing softening, but since it is the first time since the recovery, it bears watching.
*****
&gt; Tilley said job growth appears to be at its weakest of the cycle. The government‚Äôs Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised its job data to show 501,000 fewer jobs from March 2018 to March 2019. Tilley said he looked at the adjustment by spreading the reductions over the period, and it shows job growth was reduced by 41,750 in each of those months.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt means job growth was never as strong in 2018 as we thought, and the slowness is of concern,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, if total wages and total GDP are unchanged, then the slower job growth came with higher average wages and higher productivity than previously thought.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The strength of the labor market is key, since it‚Äôs been helping fuel the consumer, responsible for about two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for the recovery to keep going, and if you‚Äôre looking at this to be pushing it and consumer spending, this would be a red flag,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he is also watching the ISM manufacturing survey, particularly after Markit PMI data, another series of manufacturing data, showed a contraction. ISM is expected at 51.4, up slightly from 51.2 last month. A reading above 50 shows expansion.

# Day after Labor Day Bullish for Small Caps

&gt; In the last 21 years, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have all registered average gains of exceeding 0.2% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last seven years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all declined on the day in 2017 and 2018. On Wednesday the market‚Äôs performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.12%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 38.1% of the time with an average loss of 0.005%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/66d0e165de0d5099b7b8b4f3ad896b90/99822dfcc2c80238-01/s500x750/4f9276207bcd30da1ad67856d0ef0a5a08d48b3b.jpg))**

# Typical September Trading: Choppy Early Gains Fade Late

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d316c9fcecc63780352f570022c024/502fb4ed37d42dd3-a1/s500x750/c3d1c6969f2f4deb7ac0e36e54cd6643dc73f2ec.jpg))**

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small-caps, measured by the Russell 1000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However, after mid-month gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month‚Äôs end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

# Down Friday/Down Monday Levels Not Reclaimed Yet

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e4c044d3d67395aa8ed45109ab5394f/dacebc880c3c9347-ff/s500x750/d19682be7ae94930d29057dffb20f87f0af34de7.jpg))**

&gt; Technically speaking, the market has settled into a range between 2815 and 2945 on the S&amp;P 500. S&amp;P 2815 is a support level we have been tracking for some time now that sits at the intraday high back on November 7, 2018 where the market failed last fall before the 20% correction ran its course to the Christmas Eve low. The good news is the 2815 has held here this time unlike the ~2700 level last fall. 

&gt; The bad news or at least the technical case for no new highs is that the S&amp;P has yet to clear the 2945 level, which was the intraday high on Friday August 2 that was the beginning of two back-to-back Down Friday/Down Mondays, which has a negative indication if not quickly reclaimed.

&gt; Fund Flows Still Feeble

&gt; Below is an update of fund flows data from the Investment Company Institute including mutual funds and ETFs. In the tables below, we show dollar fund flows for total mutual funds plus ETFs along with ETFs alone. Obviously, mutual fund flows have been persistently negative for a long time now, but ETF flows are making up for that in many ways. The combined data only goes back to 2013, but over that period total ETF flows are in the 99th percentile for all ETFs...and that includes a string of drawdowns in domestic equity ETF flows over the last few weeks. Combined, ETF plus mutual fund flows are a better measure of total sentiment than mutual funds alone. While ETF fund inflows are only just off record highs, combined mutual fund and ETF fund flows are down across the past week, month, three months, and year for all equity funds, domestic only equity funds, and global equity funds. On the other hand, bond funds have seen the same torrid inflows that have been picked up in mutual fund flows for a long time now: since 2013, total bond inflows to ETFs are near the 97th percentile for all periods. For ETFs plus mutual funds, recent inflows are less dramatic but still very, very large; that‚Äôs especially true for the municipal bond space. We also note commodity funds have seen a pickup in net flows of late.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/083019-Flows.png))**

&gt; To provide further context, below we show rolling 13 week fund flows for the total equity space as well as domestic funds only. While ETFs have seen material inflows, combined mutual and ETF flows are still materially negative, with total equity mutual fund plus ETF flows at a record size.

&gt; B.I.G. Tips - Years Like 2019: August Edition

&gt; We‚Äôve highlighted the chart below comparing 2019 to 1998 a number of times over the last several weeks, and the similarities between the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year has continued right up through the end of August. While the pullback from the highs this Summer hasn‚Äôt been as severe as it was in 1998, the timing of both and the subsequent periods of backing and filling has been striking. A continuation of the similar patters certainly wouldn‚Äôt be a positive in the short term, but the silver lining is that Q4 1998 was exceptionally strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chartwebsite1998.png))**

&gt; As we do throughout the year, in our most recent B.I.G. Tips report we compared the S&amp;P 500's trading pattern this year to all other years in order to see which ones were the most similar. With those similar years, we then analyzed how the S&amp;P 500 performed for the remainder of the year in order to help come up with a framework for what to expect for the rest of this year. It shouldn't surprise anyone that 1998 made the list, but a number of other notable years also had strong similarities to the pattern of 1998 with very different outcomes as well.

&gt; Russell 2000 (IWM) Testing Support

&gt; Unlike large-cap major indices like the Dow or S&amp;P 500 which managed to reach record highs earlier this year, so far in 2019, the small-cap focused Russell 2000 never managed to so much as retest the highs from around this time last year. In fact, in the past year, other than the final leg down to December lows and the subsequent rally back up to previous levels in early 2019, the Russell has been in a range between support and resistance from last fall. This support and resistance can actually be traced back even further to the highs and lows of late 2017 and early 2018. This year has seen more tests of these support levels after May declines and once again this month.

&gt; At the beginning of August, the Russell collapsed through flat 50 and 200-DMAs finding relief at the bottom of this range. Since then, the index has been bouncing between this support and the 200-day with the most recent failed test of its 200-DMA coming just last week. Over the past few sessions, while it has not closed significantly below, intraday the index has breached these critical support levels. Fortunately, today the index is seeing some mean reversion from its extreme oversold levels as it is up rather than breaking out of the range to the downside.

# What's Driven the S&amp;P 500?

&gt; In last night's Closer, we showed the biggest contributors to the S&amp;P 500's gain so far in 2019 as well as the stocks that have weighed on the index the most. Given the S&amp;P's 14% YTD gain, it's probably not surprising to hear that only one stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 has weighed on the total index performance by at least 20 bps: Pfizer (PFE). On the other hand, 11 different stocks have added at least 20 bps to total index performance in 2019. We show the 10 best and worst-performing stocks this year by the overall contribution to the S&amp;P 500's performance in the table below. As shown, mega-cap Tech like Microsoft (MSFT) and four of the five FAANG names have been the biggest contributors. When you add them all up, they've accounted for roughly 26% of the S&amp;P's gain this year. Two credit card companies -- Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), and two retailers -- Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) -- have also been big contributors to gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive1.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, health care stocks related to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, and Life Sciences are one of only two industry groups to weigh on S&amp;P 500 performance this year. Energy is the other standout with a 4% decline. Software &amp; Services is the best performer, driving 3.3 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 14% gain this year. Media &amp; Entertainment, Retail which includes Amazon (AMZN), and tech Hardware are the only other groups that have added at least 1% to the total 14.46% gain for the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive2.png))**

&gt; While YTD numbers look really great, things are not so hot versus this time last year; the S&amp;P 500 is actually slightly lower year-over-year. As a result, the gap between the contribution of gainers and those of decliners is much narrower. Only four stocks drove a gain of at least 20 bps for the headline index over the past year: Microsoft (MSFT), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V).

&gt; We note that the top ten gainers are almost exclusively very blue-chip stocks: large tech companies, credit card networks, and some consumer names. Only the cell phone tower REIT American Tower (AMT) is unusual in this list of big-cap, well-known stocks. Losers are concentrated in Health Care, Banks, and Tech.

&gt; While Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) aren't down drastically versus last summer, their market caps are big enough to have cost a lot of performance for the S&amp;P 500's overall performance. Smaller cap stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), DuPont (DD), AbbVie (ABBV), and Schlumberger (SLB) are a verry different story.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive3.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, there have been more decliners than gainers, though only Energy and Banks have cost the index more than 80 bps; on the flip side only Software has been a greater than 80 bps gainer. Defensive industry groups like Utilities, Household &amp; Personal Products, and Real Estate have all driven the S&amp;P 500 higher while cyclical industry groups like Capital Goods and Tech Hardware have weighed.

# This Isn't Normal

&gt; Being long bonds these days probably feels like being long tech stocks in the late 1990s. Every day you look at your portfolio, you expect it to be higher than the last time. This month through yesterday, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index is up over 10% and that doesn't even include the rally we are seeing today. If the gains we have seen so far hold up into month-end, it will go down as just the 5th month since 1978 that long-term treasuries gained more than 10% in a single month. The last time we saw this large of a move in the long-term Treasury market was more than 10 years ago in November 2008, and before that you have to go all the way back to February 1986. In other words, this kind of move isn't normal.

&gt; Besides the fact that long-term Treasuries are up over 10% this month, August marks the fourth straight month of gains for the asset class, and while that may not sound like much, the last time we saw a streak of four or more months of gains was in January 2015. With all these gains, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year Treasury Index is up over 22% YTD. 22%!

# Consumer Confidence Defies Pessimism

&gt; U.S. consumers are feeling especially empowered these days, despite growing pessimism about the economic outlook.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Consumer Confidence Pushes Through Trade Uncertainty, the Conference Board‚Äôs Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.1 in August. Still, that‚Äôs the fifth-highest reading of the economic cycle, an impressive feat given trade tensions and other global headwinds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zAlOT8M.jpg))**

&gt; August‚Äôs strong consumer confidence reading was driven by a 19-year high in consumers‚Äô views of present economic conditions. That‚Äôs no surprise to us, as steady gains in wages and jobs typically support consumer spending. Fiscal stimulus implemented in 2018 provided an extra boost of income through lower tax rates and added tax credits, and lower oil prices have allowed consumers to allot more income to discretionary spending.

&gt; ‚ÄúConsumer spending has been one of the most encouraging trends in the economy lately, thanks to a solid U.S. labor market,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to see a near-term economic downturn with such a strong undercurrent from the U.S. consumer.‚Äù

&gt; A U.S. economy carried by the consumer isn‚Äôt a bad situation to be in. After all, consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, so healthy consumer activity could carry the expansion on its own.

&gt; However, U.S. businesses need to transition into leadership at this point in the cycle. As we mentioned in Tuesday‚Äôs blog, capital expenditures (capex) need to rebound as the cycle matures to help sustain the expansion. Unfortunately, trade uncertainty has increasingly weighed on corporate sentiment, so a resurgence in capex may not be possible without a U.S.-China trade resolution.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful 3-day weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Best way of paying off $15k of debt all at once.,"My spouse is receiving about $40,000 from a parents life insurance policy payout. We want to get every bit of debt we have taken care of so we can up our savings rate and have an emergency fund.
  
  We currently have 4 credit cards which total around $8,000. Whats the best way to pay these off? Should I also ask for a lower interest rate or a credit increase to help my credit score (around 600)? I figured I may as well try to get some kind of perk, just not sure how to go about it or what the best practice is.

  We also have about $7,000 in past due collections. Some are recent and some are fairly old. Should we just pay all of them or pick and choose? If we don‚Äôt pay some and they stay on our credit report will they be erased after the statute of limitations is up?

  Our main goal is to get back to where we were being financially steady, saving more money and raising our credit scores up, I appreciate any help. Thank you.

personalfinance,Student loans or nah,"My wife and I are about 10k in debt with stupid debt (6.5k credit card, 1200 her engagement ring) and also 1200 from a surgery. We are also expecting our first kid this December. What we're trying to do is find a way to get rid of as much debt as possible (consolidate if need be) before the baby is here because there's a lot of bs costs with having a kid (meaning hospital costs).

What we're struggling to decide is should we just take out the full amount of loans available (for me $10k, for her $10k; we'd only take out mine) and pay off as much as possible (would leave a couple thousand in the credit card)? Or find a consolidation loan through our bank?

The reason we're looking at using a student loan for this is the low interest rate and the fact we wont need to pay on it for a few more years (2 years for each of us before graduating) and by the time we graduate it's almost guaranteed that we'll both have a much higher paying job (I'm in IT, shes in finance for a hospital)

we have a stupid high mortgage that we can't lower the monthly cost on for probably another year.

at this point in time if I take out the full $10k for loans ($3300 for classes this year the rest for me) then that'll leave me with barely enough loans to cover the remainder of my classes. We've also thought about her taking out an extra 3k and me too so we're still getting some but that way we don't run the risk of running out of money before we graduate.

We currently have $3k in a savings fund that'll probably be used for either a down payment or to buy a cheaper car because my car is almost certainly not going to make it another year due to mechanical issues.

&amp;#x200B;

expenses:

I make: \~$37500/yr

She makes: \~$33000/yr

Income Total: \~$4100/mo

\-----------------------------------

Mortgage: $1390 (will be 1300 by the end of the year)

Savings: add $200 every paycheck ($400/mo)

expenses: $3345

So yes we have a leftover \~$750; currently that is being used to get ready for the baby

&amp;#x200B;

This has been our finances for about 2 months so obviously things can change and probably will.

thoughts or advice?

Also not sure it matters but we're 23 years old

personalfinance,Trying to lower monthly expenses,"Wife and I are planning on moving to a better school district by the time my daughter starts school (2yrs). There are some things we need to do to the house before we sell and we also want to start putting our daughter into extracurricular activities to help build and gauge her interest. 

We currently pay almost $700/month for my truck and have paid it down to ~$17.6k (interest rate is 3.99%) and will have it paid off in about 3 years. We are thinking that with these new expenses we are going to incur, due to daughter's activities and fixing up the house, that trading in the truck for something that just gets me to/from work makes sense (wife has a family vehicle that is pretty reliable).  I got an offer to trade in my truck that will leave me with about $7500 to put towards whatever car I get. One I found would mean I need to finance about $4k and I'd likely get about 4% interest. 

In my mind it makes sense to do it, but I wanted to see if anyone out there can see something I don't or why I shouldn't do it.

personalfinance,"My bank said instead of keeping my money in a CD, she suggests I should put it in a money market. Should I?","Since high school, I've been saving money from part time jobs mostly. During middle of college I put a good portion of my savings into a CD. At the time it seem like a good idea for someone still in school. Now it's been a good number of years since I graduated. My CD was in a 9 month period and it would just renew automatically every 9 months because it seemed easier as I deal with schooling and internships.

I have a few more weeks until my 9 month CD ends. Then my bank adviser was suggesting a money market.

Any tips or suggestions?

As of right now, the adviser said the current interest rate is like less than 0.25% while the money market is around 1.5%.",finance

stocks,Bank Stocks,"If bank stocks go down when the Fed cuts rates due to the impact on interest earnings and bank stock go down (along with the entire market) when the Fed raises rates, as everyone flees to find risk free yield.

On top of that millennials are not buying houses and potentially not buying cars when autonomous subscription based services take over. These trends would dramatically reduce car loans and mortgages.
