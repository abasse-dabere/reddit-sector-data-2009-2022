personalfinance,Credit card and investment basics?,"I recently got a professional degree, and after five years of making \~30k retail wage, I'm suddenly making considerably more. I know how to budget my student loans and living expenses, but what I'm completely clueless on is something much broader: what the hell to do with what's left. 

Here are my financials: I have a checking account and savings account with a local bank in a city I no longer live in. My bank balance is about one paycheck. I have a Target card. That's it. I've only ever had one credit card with a paltry limit, which I recently closed, and my credit is fair.

When I go to open a new bank account, is there anything I should be looking out for, like tiers or types of account? Should I be investing? What kind of bite out of your income does 'investing' take? Does it matter if my assets aren't liquid? I haven't signed up for my Roth yet because my firm doesn't match, so is it even worth it? I assume I should probably get a credit card, but I don't even know what makes a card good or bad, besides interest rates. Should I visit a financial planner? Could they answer these kinds of questions reliably?

Mostly my problem is that I've lived on working class wage all my life and just relied on standard checking and savings accounts. Time to act my age, I guess, but some advice on where to even *begin* would be so helpful.",finance

personalfinance,Financial Advice for a College Student Getting Little Real Help from Parents,"So basically I’m 18 and I’ve just started college and am trying to navigate adult life on my own.  I’m working on my English degree and I work part time making about ~$700 a month. I don’t have a credit card or any debt other than my student loans. I’m most worried about my unsubsidized loan which is only $1,000 for this semester with a 4.5% interest rate.

I’m quite frankly pretty bad at budgeting and don’t know what I should be doing to set up a good financial future for myself.  My interest rate is very low but I don’t know how much I should be dedicating to savings and putting towards my loan.

Another thing I’m worried about is trying to find an apartment. My parents are willing to spend $500 on my rent which I’m very grateful for, but I’ll likely still have to spend about $200 on rent on my own and will probably try to work more hours to compensate for this. Obviously this would be more comfortable but idk if it’s a financially smart move. Especially since my mom said she might use some 529 plan money for the rent money she said she could give me.  My mom seems not very worried about finances (very nonchalant about debt and loans I will take out) and often gets frustrated with my worrying. That being said despite the fact my parents are willing to help give me money I feel like I get little real financial advice. 

Also would getting a credit card be a good idea? I don’t even know where to start thinking about that. This is all so overwhelming to me.",finance

personalfinance,"[US] Windfall, taxes, investment etc.","So I am 30/M living in IA. I will be getting a somewhat significant windfall next week. It will be on the order of $170k before taxes. I have some ideas on what to do with it and some questions. Here's a summary of my finances:

Salary: $120k -- on track for $130k this year due to some bonuses.

##Budget: 

I get around $6.7k per month after tax/insurance/401k etc.

Rent: $1100  
Utilities (Electric + heat): ~$100-$120  
Phone: $35  
Subscriptions: $40  
Groceries + eating out: ~$350  
Misc (Hobbies and such): ~$100-$1.5k. Varies. I budget for it and spend out of the ""envelope"". Stuff not spent stays in the pot until it gets spent later. 
Car payment: ~$940. Paying down at ~$1100 per month.   
Insurance for cars + renter's: ~$75 per month paid every six months.  

I also budget some amounts towards upcoming big expenses like vacations, larger purchases etc. Rest of the money goes into taxable brokerage accounts, maxing out my IRA, HSA etc. I also have been contributing 5% to my 401k with no match, but my employer will be starting to match it next month.
  
##Assets:  
High Yield Savings (1.9%): $18k. This includes some categories budgeted out into the future + ""Emergency fund"" of about 12k. Can be combined into one emergency fund in case something bad comes up (I use YNAB4 for budgeting).  

401k: $4k in index funds  
HSA: ~$1500 in FZROX  
Trad IRA, non deductible: $7k (couple of stocks and rest in index funds)  
Roth IRA: $5k. (Index funds)  
Taxable account 1: $3.5k (mostly index funds)   
Taxable account 2: $16k (mostly stocks)    

##Loans:  
Auto loan: $47k remaining at 3.24%.  

##Goals

I have some sort of an FI in mind but not really retire early. Hoping to get there before 40. We don't have plans to buy a house anytime soon as we may not stay in this area long term (probably 3-4 years is the current plan). Spending 30k-40k on a downpayment seems pointless.

## So here are my questions:

1. I recently got engaged to my long time SO, and we are seriously considering getting married before the end of the year and having the ceremony later. SO makes around 30k pre-tax. Some rough math shows that the tax savings from federal+state would be around 16k or so. That could pay for a big chunk of the wedding if not all of it!  Am I not seeing something here? 

2. I am planning on spreading out the money across some high-yield accounts, churning some signup bonuses. Then dollar cost averaging it across taxable accounts into index funds over the span of next year (possibly 90/10 in stocks/bonds). I will also be maxing out my 401k. Is there anything else that I am missing?

3. Is there any point in paying off the auto loan right now partly or fully, given the low interest rate?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Reducing monthly payments vs. reducing debt,"I've been debt-free (minus the house) before.  After some circumstances including a divorce where I re-fi'ed and kept the house (a great financial decision), I'm almost there again.  I'm to the point where one of the considerations I've got around paying off the remaining debt is ""how does this payment affect the minimum monthly required payments"" vs. ""what's the highest interest debt?""  I'm going to use model/approximate numbers below.

Assume I have:

* Credit card w/ $6,000 balance, monthly minimum is $170, interest rate is compound interest @ 15% APR
* Consumer loan w/ $12,000 payoff balance, monthly minimum is $800, interest rate is simple interest @ 8% APR with 18 months left on a 24 month term

I could pay $3,000 and ""free up"" $85/month by lowering the credit card minimum or I could reduce $200/month off the consumer loan.  In either case the entire debt is paid off in 6 months, but paying down the consumer loan feels safer as it reduces the minimum monthly payment required just in case something happened in the next few months (not expecting anything, just looking at risk vs. reward).  The same amount of money would still go towards debt each month - the reduction in minimums would change how much I paid, just how much I'd have to be ABLE to pay if something happened.

Even though I'm paying more interest on the credit card, I'm inclined to pay off the consumer loan first, especially since it's simple interest.  Am I overthinking this?",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

investing,Could low interest rates be a counter-intuitive cause of low inflation?,"I read a theory here recently that piqued my interest (pun... intended). It went that inflation and inflation expectations are low partly *because* of low interest rates. Obviously this is counter-intuitive. The theory explained, however, that low inflation allows for easy corporate borrowing, and that corporations are simply taking advantage of that nearly-free money rather than passing cost increases along to consumers. This theory makes sense to me, especially in today's investing environment where investors seem to prioritize market share over margins when deciding which companies to invest in. Does this theory pass the smell test? If so, what are the implications? Could this dynamic lead to stagflation if rates start rising? Could this be why the Fed reversed course earlier this year?'",finance

investing,What indicators do you use to time the market for long term investments?,"I've tried to navigate through posts on this sub, and found that people have wildly different opinions about everything. Lots of people claiming that there is doom coming within the next year or so. Lot of others claiming that the ""bull market of the past 10 years is unstoppable"". I feel way too much emotion is involved in such arguments without significant amount of empirical data to back up predictions.

The only marker I have been able to directly observe historical evidence for *predicting* a recession has been yield curve inversion.

However that is just one marker, and is quite imprecise in predicting when an actual event will occur, ranging in *years*. This is partly because it's difficult to tell the difference between how hard the recession will hit everyone vs how long the recession will last.

Yet that has been the only indicator I've seen that predicts anything relatively reliably. There are a whole bunch of indicators online, that provide me with very little useful information.

As an example: Federal Interest Rate. This is a big one that everyone talks about. If the fed raises interest rates too quickly, the idea is that people get scared and pull money out of the market and save it. If the fed lowers interest rates, then that's supposed to make stocks go up, due to investments, inflation et al. However from what I've seen, it's difficult to make heads or tails of this data in an algorithmic fashion.

If currently the interest rate is 1%, and the fed decides to raise it to 1.05%, what does that tell you? I've seen the effects of the interest rate significantly depends on which country its in, and how people feel about the economy as a whole. Finally: Simply the news that the interest rate will change, seems to be enough to update the market. People overreacting to hearsay.

I like how yield curve inversion hasn't caused people to run around like crazy, selling everything immediately, like they usually would do with higher interest rates. Possibly this because the prediction is in years, and not in weeks.
I also love how the yield curve continues to provide the same information for many months at a time, providing a very clear signal about what's going on, instead of changing every day to wildly different values.

Do you know of any other testable indicators? Specifically something were you can get a true or false *prediction* about how an index will perform some time in the future. An algorithmic prediction. Not some ""that looks too high"" subjective quality.",finance

personalfinance,How to intepret points on mortgage rates,"So comparing these two rates on a 20 year loan

A) 3.25% with .875% points

B) 3.125% with 1.000 points

At first glance I'd think pretty much the same rate but one forces you to buy a bit more of a point right?  But i think this is a mistake because one is an interest rate and one is a percent of mortgage added to closing costs, so they shouldnt be added.

They're both from the same lender, a week apart.  Which is considered higher, like if the market moved from A to B would this be considered a 'drop'?

Generally this lender sells .25% off the nominal rate for 1% of the amount financed, at that 'exchange' rate A is basically 3.46% and rate B is 3.375.

personalfinance,Almost $20K in credit card debt BUT getting lump sum from stolen car. Advice? This is my one chance to get out of this debt.,"Hi all,

Longtime reader but first time posting. My car (which was paid off) was recently stolen and the insurance company just let me know that the settlement is going to be just over $17K in cash. I live in the city and I don't really need the car, so I wasn't planning on replacing it. Instead, I wanted to use it to get out of the crippling credit card debt I've been living with for 4-5 years.

The accounts are broken down like this:

Citi - $932  
Chase - $4,518  
Suntrust - $4,249  
Capital One - $9,877 (the highest interest rate at almost 20%)

For some more background, I'm a 27F young professional that makes around $82K annually. I got into this debt from moving into the city and outspending my income. Now though, my living expenses are all very manageable and once this debt is gone, I'm living off cash — no more credit cards. But these credit card payments have been eating up around $700+ a month in payments and my credit score has taken a hit because of it — I'm at 581 right now and not proud of it.

**My question**: is it advised to take that lump sum and just pay down all the debt I can? Is there anything I should be aware of before doing this? Any advice would be super helpful, as I feel like this is my one and only chance to get out of this debt in one fell swoop.

MachineLearning,[Discussion] A Questionable SIGIR 2019 Paper,"I recently read the paper ""Adversarial Training for Review-Based Recommendations"" published on the SIGIR 2019 conference. I noticed that this paper is almost exactly the same as the paper ""Why I like it: Multi-task Learning for Recommendation and Explanation"" published on the RecSys 2018 conference.

At first, I thought it is just a coincidence. It is likely for researchers to have similar ideas. Therefore it is possible that two research groups independently working on the same problem come up with the same solution. However, after thoroughly reading and comparing the two papers, now I believe that the SIGIR 2019 paper is plagiarizing the RecSys 2018 paper.

The model proposed in the SIGIR 2019 paper is almost a replicate of the model in the RecSys 2018 paper. (1) Both papers used an adversarial sequence-to-sequence learning model on top of the matrix factorization framework. (2) For the generator and discriminator part, both papers use GRU for generator and CNN for discriminator. (3) The optimization methodology is the same, i.e. alternating optimization between two parts. (4) The evaluations are the same, i.e. evaluating MSE for recommendation performance and evaluating the accuracy for discriminator to show that the generator has learned to generate relevant reviews. (5) The notations and also the formulas that have been used by the two papers look extremely similar.

While ideas can be similar given that adversarial training has been prevalent in the literature for a while, it is suspicious for the SIGIR 2019 paper to have large amount of text overlaps with the RecSys 2018 paper.

Consider the following two sentences:

(1) ""The Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""Deep Cooperative Neural Network (DeepCoNN) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in Section 2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

I think this is the most obvious sign of plagiarism. If you search Google for this sentence using ""exact match"", you will find that this sentence is only used by these two papers. It is hard to believe that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper could come up with the exact same sentence without reading the RecSys 2018 paper.

As another example:

(1) ""The decoder employs a single GRU that iteratively produces reviews word by word. In particular, at time step $t$ the GRU first maps the output representation $z\_{ut-1}$ of the previous time step into a $k$-dimensional vector $y\_{ut-1}$ and concatenates it with $\\bar{U\_{u}}$ to generate a new vector $y\_{ut}$. Finally, $y\_{ut}$ is fed to the GRU to obtain the hidden representation $h\_{t}$, and then $h\_{t}$ is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary of the document to represent the probability of each word. The output word $z\_{ut}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 2.1 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""The user review decoder utilizes a single decoder GRU that iteratively generates reviews word by word. At time step $t$, the decoder GRU first embeds the output word $y\_{i, t-1}$ at the previous time step into the corresponding word vector $x\_{i, t-1} \\in \\mathcal{R}\^{k}$, and then concatenate it with the user textual feature vector $\\widetilde{U\_{i}}$. The concatenated vector is provided as input into the decoder GRU to obtain the hidden activation $h\_{t}$. Then the hidden activation is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary to represent the probability of each word given the current context. The output word $y\_{i, t}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in Section 3.1.1 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

In this example, the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper has replaced some of the phrases in the writing so that the two texts are not exactly the same. However, I believe the similarity of the two texts still shows that the authors of the SIGIR 2019 paper must have read the RecSys 2018 paper before writing their own paper.

I do not intend to go through all the text overlaps between the two papers, but let us see a final example:

(1) ""Each word of the review $r$ is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector. Notice that the user-specific vectors are learned together with the parameters of the discriminator $D\_{\\theta}$ in the adversarial training of Section 2.3. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected projection layer. The final output of the CNN is a sigmoid function which normalizes the probability into the interval of $\[0, 1\]$"", expressing the probability that the candidate review $r$ is written by user $u$."" in Section 2.2 of the SIGIR 2019 paper.

(2) ""To begin with, each word in the review is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector that identifies user information. The user-specific vectors are learned together with other parameters during training. The concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. The final output unit is a sigmoid non-linearity, which squashes the probability into the $\[0, 1\]$ interval."" in Section 3.1.2 of the RecSys 2018 paper.

There is one sentence (""The concatenated vector representations are ...... a fully-connected projection layer."") that is exactly the same in the two papers. Also, I think concatenating the user-specific vectors to every word vector in the review is a very unintuitive idea. I do not think ideas from different research groups can be the same in that granularity of detail. If I were the authors, I will just concatenate the user-specific vectors to the layer before the final projection layer, as it saves computational cost and should lead to better generalization.

As a newbie in information retrieval, I am not sure if such case should be considered as plagiarism. However, as my professor told me that the SIGIR conference is the premier conference in the IR community, I believe that this paper definitely should not be published at a top conference such as SIGIR.

What makes me feel worse is that the two authors of this paper, Dimitrios Rafailidis from Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands and Fabio Crestani from Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland, are both professors. They should be aware that plagiarism is a big deal in academia.

personalfinance,Where to leave Down Payment on House while searching,"Hello,

I am looking for a house/apartment/condo off and on. I will likely continue to do this until I see something that meets my needs and price range.

I have 25k\~ in my checking account. Most of this is pretty recent, as I have been reducing investments elsewhere like my 401k, ESPP, etc. For my city, this is still barely 5% and is towards the very bottom of the housing market here.

The money has piled up a bit quicker than I am searching and I need a wise home for it. I was thinking of putting it in a high yield (and quickly liquid) savings account with Allied, however some family members think that I should instead put it into one of Vanguard's Total Bond options. I am unsure just how liquid and risky these are. From what I understand, the value only fluctuates as interest rates changes and these are currently in a good position to earn money.

My only real requirement is that if I do find a place that I like, the money is liquid enough to proceed with putting an offer in and eventually the down. I searched through some other threads and the FAQs, but I didn't see any real good comparisons against these options.

tldr; I am looking to keep a growing 25k+ liquid and earn as much as possible on it while I search for a house that could be in a few months or a few years. I am pretty saavy when it comes to long term investments, but not short term or liquid investments.",finance

personalfinance,How to decide which refinance rate/cost scenario is the best?,"Hi PF community. I am looking to refinance my 30 yr morgage and have the following 3 options. I am trying to understand what scenario is the best. 

I am thinking that the lower rate/highest cost option is worth it if I play to stay in the home long term, and the higher rate/lower cost option is better if I think I will be in the house for a shorter term. My best guess would be we stay in this house for 7 years. Minimum would be 2-3 years if I had to relocate for work, and maximum would be 15 years.

My current mortgage is 4.25% rate with $2146 monthly payment.

If interest rates continue to go down, then option 3 has the least investment so I could refinance again. However, I do not think I should do a refinance with a future refinance in mind.

I am 25, Cybersecurity Analyst, married, make around $50,000-$60,000 a year, $1,000 in savings currently (thanks to this awesome SubReddit we are working on Emergency Fund!) and I have zero student loan debt. I have a low interest credit card and I pay that bad boy off every month easy if I even use it. Never have carried a balance in my two years of having it. 
We live within our means and always are true to what we budget for.

My wife however is in year 3 of Med School and we had to take full loans out for her first 3 semesters. VERY expensive, but obviously incredibly proud she is pursuing her dream as a Pediatric Surgeon. All in all, the interest rates will be 6%-8% and above when we start aggressively paying these loans off once she completes med school and goes into residency. I expect her income to be between $35,000-$50,000 and expect student loan debt between $150-$200k in the hole here (YIKES!). I have managed to cover ALL expenses outside of just accepting the loan amount for her tuition. We have given over $20k back each semester since her first 3. Do you guys have any tips for how I can be proactive now in order to aggressively go after our student loan debt when she graduates?

We are eager to take this debt by the reigns and OWN it with a plan. Thanks so much for your support guys!",finance

personalfinance,First time with substantial savings (~$10k.) How can I best manage or invest?,"For the first time in my life, it looks like I might have a decent amount of extra money at the end of this year. It’s hard to know exactly, but I think I should comfortably have $10,000 that I’d like to invest or save smartly.

* Student loans: ~$6,000 at 6.25% interest
* Used car loan: ~$2,800 at 5.04% interest
* Credit cards: I have two cards with zero balance at the moment
* Credit score: ~800

I’m 33, self-employed, and bill somewhere between $55k and $65k a year. However, on paper, I make almost nothing with the deductions and right-offs I claim each year. What other info do you all need to know to help inform your advice?

I don’t have any sort of retirement account. Retiring is not a priority for me. I love what I do for a living more than anything else in the world and know that I will do it until the day I die or I physically am unable to. But, I know that it might still be something I should consider for the inevitable time I get too old to work or I get sick, etc.

I have also considered investing in a house. I would most likely buy a house to rent out in a city that is extremely affordable and one in which I work often. The idea here is maybe I could keep a room or a small apartment in the house that I can stay in when working there, but it would primarily be a rental property. I would continue to rent in my current city. I realize if I do this I most likely would have to spend all of my savings for a down payment and closing costs, etc., leaving me with no savings or emergency funds.

I could pay off my existing debt, which would feel fantastic, but I also feel like I have pretty low-interest rates, so maybe there is no need to rush in paying those off?

Should I just keep the $10k as my emergency and savings account? Where should I put it if so?

Any other ways I should consider investing this money?

Thanks for any insight you have.",finance

personalfinance,To those in the military/ANG who joined solely to pay for schooling; was it worth it?,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post....I'm genuinely not sure, haha. Will probably cross-post to the ANG subreddit, as well.


So I'm currently a sophomore in a rather expensive private art college, one that can easily top out at around 60k per year. My mother is approaching her 20 years, most of it in the Air Force and the last few in the Air National Guard, and she split her Post 9/11 GI Bill between myself and my 2 siblings--that means 12 months of school payments. I'm using up my last few months for this third semester, which means after this it's a hefty chunk of federal + private loans to make up for 2.5 more years of schooling.

My mother is pushing hard for me to take on a 6-year contract, go through basic and tech school, then temp in the summer while doing drill every month. It'd net me way more money than I could possibly make on my own, and it definitely seems like the best option as far as paying off my debt quickly and without taking out huge loans.

My problem is that I really, really don't think I'd enjoy it whatsoever. Kind of whiny and immature-sounding, I know, but hear me out. All four of my parents (divorced + remarried, you know how it goes) are or were part of the military--Mom's a Lt. Colonel, Dad used to fly C-17s and is now a contractor on-base, Stepmother is a civilian also on-base who used to work on jets doing maintenance, Stepdad recently retired after he hit Major and got his 20 in Logistics. I have such high respect and admiration for all of them, but that is *not* my style in the slightest. I like to draw cartoon animals and animate to silly soundbites and tell stories. My attention span is that of a cricket. I don't want to join the military, however brief the stint is, solely to pay for schooling because I honestly think I'll be completely miserable and difficult for me, and I don't know if it's worth it to subject myself to that *just* to reduce my debt. Even my father, who I genuinely believe knows me better than I know myself, doesn't recommend it and says he think I'm not fit for the military--not that I'd fail, per se, but just that it'd be a strain on me and make me miserable. I'd much rather have a hard financial life and be truly enjoying what I do than have financial security and dread drill + summer temping for six years.

I've heard conflicting answers from folks in the ANG who I've asked, and I honestly just don't know anymore. The best time to make a decision is before January, as timing-wise I'd want to get basic + tech out of the way during summer before school starts again.


TL;DR: Mother wants me to join ANG on a 6-year contract to help pay off expensive school debt. It's a huge life decision to make when I'm barely hitting 20, and I'm scared of making the wrong choice and have no idea what to do. I don't see any other options than just piles of loans. If you joined the ANG just to pay off debts, was it worth it? Please offer any advice you have, and thanks in advance to anybody who comments.",finance
personalfinance,Negative interest rates and the impact of them on your life,"Hi! I just watched this very interesting segment from CNBC on YouTube regarding interest rates in the US going negative and was wondering, if you are a person who earns a modest income in any of the countries that already have negative interest rates (Sweden, Japan, EU bank, or Germany, etc.) how do you deal with being charged monthly to keep your savings account? How much are you charged to keep a savings account in the bank? Or do you even have a savings accout? Personally, the idea of the US switching to negative interest rates is a little unsettling to me as I am quite conservative with my money and enjoy having a savings account, also I don't make much so being charged a monthly fee to keep a savings account seems ludicrous. I also thought about how the US has worse crime rates than any of these countries, so if poor people don't want to be charged to have a savings wouldn't the alternative ( hoarding money away in your home) be scary/ potentially even dangerous? I feel like crime would increase as people would try to rob each other for their stowed away cash. Just thought I'd ask my fellow redditors to explain how they deal with the situation personally to better understand negative interest rate. Thanks! [Video](https://youtu.be/FiYTmTHFa9E)",finance
personalfinance,Stressing: Should I take out debt or pay in cash?,"My wife and I are closing on our first house. While we were conditionally approved for a loan we also just had an unexpected liquidity event and can now purchase the house in cash. I am not sure what to do and want your r/personalfinances advice.  

On one hand we explicitly chose a house that would be self sufficient as part of the property is a detached rentable unit we can use to cover mortgage payments, if we pay up front we can use that cash to cover repairs and taxes to make the house truly cash neutral which would be quite a weight off our back emotionally. This is doubly true if we ever lost our jobs.

On the other hand, we have a loan at around a ~3% fixed interest rate approved. Over the past ten years of investing we have grown our savings well over 600% and we would love to see money continue to grow like that. Tieing up about a third of our net worth in an asset which is almost sure to depreciate in value instead of keeping it liquid seems like a missed opportunity. Like we are closing doors to our future. (My wife and I are in the VC and PE industry so we get a lot of private deal flow - it is not like we would just dump the cash in an ETF or something.) Also, to do this we are cleaning out our personal liquid savings accounts including the one set aside for child care, the one for fertility, and the one for personal VC opportunities, (though we won't be touching money set aside for taxes or medical emergencies) - this feels really irresponsible and I have never done something like this before. 

Our default plan right now is to just pay up front. Our thinking is that we should expect a market slowdown in the next few years so taking out debt, even with just a 3% interest, to invest it is a bad decision. But my brother is telling me I am being an idiot and that through thinking so defensively I am dooming myself to mediocrity - I also feel deeply personally uncomfortable with this decision, it feels like giving up - but logically it seems sound and my wife is pushing for it.",finance

personalfinance,I've found myself drowning in debt and I don't know what to do.,"A little background info, I am not usually one to post much of anything anywhere, so I'm sorry if this gets rambly or seems a little all over the place but there's a lot that's adding up.

I'm 26, trans, and one of my worst side effects of my mixture of ADHD, depression, and anxiety is ignoring problems until they bite me in the ass which is where I find myself now. I'm currently living in Colorado but my financial downfall started in Wyoming/Texas.

In 2011 I took out a $5500 unsubsidized loan in financial aid, with an interest rate of roughly 6% iirc with the intention that if I spent the summer following my freshman year that I could apply for in-state residency and drop my tuition rate from $25/k to $3k. I left school after the fall semester of 2012 and after the 6 months I began monthly payments of $70. As of now I haven't made a payment since 2/9/17 and have recently been sent the letter that it's been defaulted on.

In 2013 I came out and began taking the steps of beginning transition (mtf). I get my health insurance through my employer and for the first year or so my lab costs were covered, but since probably 2016 my lab costs were not fully covered after switching providers and I was left with anything ranging from $80-$180ish depending on what was done, I'm still working on tracking down how many I have out and who owns my debt. 

In 2015 I was living in the Houston area and had spiraled into depression and felt like I was ready to throw in the towel, and after breaking down and texting my brother he convinced me to talk to my mom and step dad and that night we went to the ER (which ended up being a bigger waste of time than anything else looking back now), and even though my insurance card said ER visits were $100 I was still left with a bill for something like $300 (literally all I did was sit in a room for 5 hours, and then they sent me home). I set up a payment plan and after paying about $100 I stopped paying it because of other financial obligations (at this time phone, car note, gas, while having reduced hours just for my own mental wellbeing).

In 2016 (just a few months after the ER visit), my car broke down on the interstate and due to essentially needing a new engine my car was totaled. I had no clue what I was doing and got ripped off by a pushy car salesman and my mom co-signed on a 2016 Kia Forte for $500 down, then $355/month/72 months or something like that.

In 2017 my mom and I swapped cars (hers was paid off and she began making the payments on the purchased car)

Cue to the present day and I have my defaulted student loans (owing a total of $5300 including interest atm), some miscellaneous bills in collections, and might have accidentally missed the cut off for getting my paperwork into my leasing office for affordable housing (Colorado) by a day and with my current monthly bills I'm feeling like I'm in much deeper than I realized. What are my next steps and how do I get myself back on track??

TL;DR: defaulted on student loans and have some miscellaneous bills in collections and might have to emergency move with shit credit... Help!",finance

Bad things to come in the long term with this unprecedented monetary policy garbage.,"QE4 has already started. In fact, the federal reserve is expanding its balance sheet at twice the rate that it did during 2008. Our supposed, “greatest economy of all time” is nothing but a farce. The massive injection of stimulus at all time market highs is laughable. 250 billion in 7 weeks. Including Trillion year deficits for the past 3 years; which yes, will exponentially grow. It’s embarrassing that they will be robbing our savings through tanking our purchasing power with the dollar. Central banks around the world have continued to grow their positions in gold, one of the newer buyers has been Germany. The main two being Russia and China as they continue to offload US treasuries for gold. The decade long global currency war (devaluation of fiat currencies against each other) doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The fed still has a little bit of wiggle room before the stock market starts tanking; we’re probably about a year out, maybe a year and a half if we’re lucky. If you’re in the US stock market, God forbid Elizabeth warren wins and imposes her plan to tax every trade you make. As well as the paper gains wealth tax she wants to push through  (owned stock that has risen in value, but has not been sold yet. Yes she wants to tax fucking paper gains which is absurd). If she wins the upcoming election sell sell sell. We can’t forget about the push for the flat out wealth tax on total net worth of the rich; which is highly unconstitutional, then again so was the income tax. Originally we only had tariffs to run the government. Then the income tax was introduced, which was supposed to be only for the rich, but of course no one actually paid those taxes because you used to actually be able to write things off. They sold the income tax to the public as a way to take the burden off the common man because everybody pays for tariffs. Obviously years later, we all pay the income tax; that’s why the founding fathers purposely made it unconstitutional. Same shit will happen with a wealth tax if such garbage is actually passed.",finance

financialindependence,Survival FI (Milestone 1 of 4),"Note: I made this post a few days ago, before accidentally deleting it 20 minutes later because BaconReader's UI is annoying. Just wanted to repost it, so there would be a record of part 1 before I post parts 2, 3, and 4 in the future.

**TL;DR: From Spendypants to Survival FI in 2.5 years, on track for fat FIRE in another 4.**

## The Background

As I try to prevent myself from discussing FI topics with my friends, I'd like to share a series of four posts with the community over time. I plan to make these posts every time I hit a big milestone. It's a bit of show and tell, but also a log of what I was thinking at each snapshot in time.

Just for the record, I am aware that I come from a position of extreme privilege. I am a relatively-young, extremely quantitative, high-income Asian male working in the finance industry. I probably underweight the role that luck has influenced my journey. That being said, my path since college has been one of single-minded, relentless optimization to maximize my income. Since discovering FIRE, the objective function has evolved to maximize savings instead of just income. Nearly every decision made along my journey has been one that has been evaluated against my objective function, for better or for worse. That said, this is my journey so far.

When I first started on the FIRE path, I set our four critical levels, based on levels of estimated expenditure:

- Survival FI 
  - I would have a roof over my head, food, internet and a cellphone, but little else
- Lean FI 
  - I would have the basic necessities of life, a replacement used car every 5 years or so, a modest vacation a year.
- FIRE 
  - The first level I would be comfortable leaving the workforce. This includes $10k for vacations every year, a larger car budget, etc.
- Fat FIRE 
  - My ideal number before working the workforce. I doubled my car, food, housing and vacation budget.

From my estimates of expenditure, I found the level of productive assets necessary to sustain the required income (using the 4% rule), then added the value of non-productive assets I have (equity value of my intended primary residence that my sister currently lives at) to form the net worth required. For added margin of safety, I added on the value of my locked in retirement fund assets to form safe net worth (They would form a buffer in case the safe withdrawal rate is lower than anticipated). These calculations resulted in four levels that can be seen from chart below.

I've been lucky enough to dig through all my tax returns since I turned 18, which gave me reasonable estimates of my income and expenses all through college until now. From that and various bank statements, I was able to get an idea of my net worth over time. You can see big inflection points in the growth of my net worth when I leave college and enter the workforce, then more recently when I decided to take FI more seriously.

## It's FI Way or the Highway

On New Years Day 2017, I started keeping much better track of my income and expenses, and created the first version of my budgeting worksheet. This led me to realize that despite my many pay raises, I was barely saving anything. I went ham on cost cutting and desperately looked to increase income. This was a very stressful year for multiple reasons:

- To cut costs to the bone, I moved into a tiny dorm room
- I tried investing in a lot of alternative investments to try to boost my investment returns
  - Remote student rental startup (We ended up making a bit of money, but it wasn't worth the stress and effort involved. I now know how much I value uninterrupted sleep. We unwound that a year later.)
  - Private REIT (Still illiquid and still stuck in, although the returns have been impressive.)
  - Crypto mining (Made my money back over the next two years, but it wasn't worth the stress and effort involved.)

Frustrated with my situation, I knew I was significantly underpaid for my role and experience. I started interviewing for similar roles all across the street. It was an eight month drought, but when it rains, it pours. All of a sudden, with multiple job offers in hand, a three way bidding war developed, and I was able to double my base compensation, more than double my bonus, and move out of an investing role into a more fulfilling and less stressful role.

My conclusion at the end of 2017 was twofold:

1. I'm an absolutely terrible active investor for my own PA, and it causes me too much stress. (Odd, as I was in a career professionally managing external capital). Going forward, no more funky stuff - no more crypto, no more private investments, no more rental properties (Although I still had another preconstruction in the works to be delivered in 2019). The lesson learned was to set up a passive asset allocation and HODL.
1. It wasn't worth the time and effort to develop a side-gig, particularly when my main gig is very well remunerated. 

Moving into 2018, my sanity was starting to crack after living in a a room smaller than an standard American prison cell for most of a year, and I ended up moving into a slightly larger, but still tiny coliving (dorm room-like) space. It was inconveniently located with a fairly long commute, but there was a bunk bed, space for a desk, and my own washroom. What else could I want? Until the black mould started growing all over the walls and ceiling, it was paradise. Eventually, my health started to suffer, and completely fed up, I moved into a nice, new apartment costing almost three times as much. This slammed my savings rate, but the quality of life increased significantly.

Life has been relatively quiet since then. I've manage to maintain discipline better this year, with less volatility in my savings rate. As of the first of the month (Nov 2019), I've hit my first milestone: Survival FI. Based on my countdown to FI, I estimate about 17 months until my next milestone at my current income and expenditure rates.

## So You Hit Survival FI. Now What?
Head down, breathing focused and counting down to my next dopamine hit. I expect to hit Lean FI in 17 months. In the meantime:

- I'm trying to pay less attention to FI - it'll be fine. Most decisions are inconsequential at this point and move FI forward or back by a month or two. I find that I spent endless time working on my budgeting spreadsheet, or obsessing about money I spend. I hope that as I get closer and cross these FI levels, this mental anguish will fade into the background.
- I'm trying to pay less attention to the news. There are little genuinely interesting or enlightening news. Most of news is people talking about other people talking or tweeting and is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Bloomberg started detecting incognito mode and I don't have a good way around their paywall anymore. I've also learned that not reading Bloomberg has negligible impact on my life.
- I'm trying to go to the gym every day. The last few years have taken a toll on my health, and I'm not getting any younger. I can't slam weights like I used to, but I hope to get some yoga or cardio in every day. I really hate the lead-up to yoga, and I hate the yoga class itself, but I never regret going afterwards.
- I've deleted almost all social media. I got rid of Facebook over a year ago. I got rid of Instagram recently. The only thing I have left is LinkedIn, and once I reach FIRE, I expect that I'll delete that too. I have no regrets - I still hang out with my friends, and there's more for them to update me on now. I'm sure I missed some party invites on Facebook, and missed some details on which high school person married whom, but I figure that if my only contact to someone was through Facebook or Instagram, and I wouldn't reach out to them for a coffee or drink when I travel through town, they probably weren't that close a friend anyways. 
- I'm struggling to figure out what to do after FIRE. Right now, I've moved halfway around the world, relentlessly optimizing to minimize my time to FIRE. I'm going to have a lot of time on my hands, if I'm not working a full-time job, and most of my social circle has a day job. In the ideal places for me to live, there is a much higher tax rate, and a much lower prevailing wage. This doesn't make full time employment an attractive option. I think I can do remote or part-time work, but that still leaves a lot of time on my hands. I've given some thought to board work, but not sure how to get started (If anyone knows good resources to look into, I'd be very interested in learning more). I'd like to spend more time snowboarding and chasing powder, but I imagine there's only so many days a year that I can hit the slopes. It would be easy for me to travel the world almost continuously solo, but I feel like a lot of these experiences are shallow and not meaningful when there's nobody to share them with.
- I've spent a lot of time reflecting on the things that are important to me, and the sacrifices that I'm choosing to make. I feel like questions around lifelong commitments have hit me really hard in the past little while. I've made really big sacrifices to move up my FI date and while I don't regret the decisions I've made, I've accepted that some life experiences will be inevitably delayed (like partnership and marriage) or extremely difficult without compromising on FI (children). On one hand, I see some of my friends getting married, having children, and I envy them, knowing that they can raise their children while they're still young and active and in the peak of health. On the other hand, I believe that raising children while not having to work full-time, without money stress, and having all the time in the world to spend with them also has its merits.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
&gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
&gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
&gt; # Top months ahead for stocks
&gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
&gt; “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
&gt; “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
&gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
&gt; “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
&gt; “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
&gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
&gt; “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
&gt; Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
&gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
&gt; “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
&gt; # What are bonds saying?
&gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
&gt; However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%.
*****
&gt; “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

&gt; November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

&gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

&gt; The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

&gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

&gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

&gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

&gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

&gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**

&gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

&gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

&gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

&gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

&gt; Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

&gt; GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

&gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

&gt; “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

&gt; Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt - Personal Loan Question?,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on chipping away at some credit card debt.

I'm 24, just recently graduated college and I'm working full-time at the job I've had for the last 5 years. (Recently got promoted to a better position, so I'm making a little more money, my takehome is about $2k a month) 

I went to college on my own expense. Which I don't need to explain how much college is and living on your own, etc etc. So I've accumulated a bit of credit card debt for paying for odds and ends, etc etc. I'm currently at $7k in credit card debt. I've slowly been able to chip away at it. But it's the interest rates that kill me.

I've been wondering if I should take out a personal loan to put my credit card debt in one place and at a much lower rate??? But I have no idea where to start with that.

Anyone have experience with this or any recommendations? Any advice would be great! Thank you! 😊",finance
financialindependence,Is my FIRE journey being delegitimized?,"I’m frugal, not to an extreme, but I don’t buy things just to have things. 

My family doesn’t accept that and typically will buy me things, despite me not needing it.

One example would be, “oh you don’t have a lamp in your living room, so I bought you one!” Whereas, I was quite happy and doing well without one.

At what point does my FIRE journey become delegitimized because others are helping me without being prompted?


Edit: to clarify, I’m not of the appearance of a charity case or anything. I have nice things, but I own specifically what I need. I have a dining room with a table &amp; chairs. I don’t have a dining room with a multi leafed table and chandelier, and a China case. If that makes sense? I have an overbearing family",finance

personalfinance,Can someone please help me determine the most efficient way to pay off my student loans?,"Hi everyone, I'd really appreciate some help because my limited math skills make it hard for me to calculate how to best allocate the extra (over the minimum due) payment to my student loan company. Here is my current scenario: 

I have 10 loans all serviced by FedLoan at a variety of interest rates. My minimum monthly payment due is $433, however I pay an extra $170 per month making it $603 total across the loans below. I can allocate the extra payment across any of the loans below. The root of my question is this... What is the most cost efficient way to pay these off considering the extra payment I'm making.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto as a Global Reserve Currency,"This is all ridiculously hypothetical; and is probably best ignored. Bust, having had the thought, I can’t stop thinking about it. So if you are in to detailed descriptions of low probability events, please enjoy the rabbit hole. 

I know people like the idea of a gold standard, but it is unpalatable. Having worked in mining, there is a tail risk a deposit can be found which devalues existing assets. It is pegging your finances to the unknown, and it was abandoned for a reason. 


This is why, since  World War II, the USD has been a global reserve currency. And it kept this role after it abandoned the gold standard in the 1970’s. This has remained the case for a number of reasons:

1) The US has been a surprisingly large chunk of global GDP: in the post WWI world under the Bretton Woods system, the US at one point represented 50% of GDP, crucially at a time when other countries were getting their financial house in order. US treasuries, particularly when the dollar was still backed by gold, were one of the safest investments. A reminder that US debt isn’t just about profligacy, but also about long-term yields. 

2) This created a built-in house wins effect - when the US removed the gold standard, countries stayed with the USD because it was still so stable compared to other options - and they were already heavily invested. As a fiat, the US can run higher deficits because other counties hand it cash for their own stability stability (you can almost think of US debt like tribute to a dominant political power, or protection money to the mafia).

3) No competitors. I understand the skepticism about fiat in this community - but if you had to choose a fiat, what would be the alternative to the USD? The Renminbi’s value is manipulated by Chine. The Euro lacks a body like the US federal reserve to intervene in the event of inflation, and the block is increasingly unstable. 

The US government has supported its currency as the global reserve currency because it vastly strengthens its hand in international diplomacy. US sanctions against countries like Iran are effective because the US can enforce financial penalties via soft power through other countries banking systems. This is why there is increasing pressure from countries like Russia and China to find another reserve currency. 

But it is bad for the US economy to be the reserve currency. Think about manufacturing. If your currency goes through inflation, then your exports cheapen relative to other markets. This is why the Chinese government tries to peg the Renminbi at a little over 8 yuan to the USD. Thus they can Incentivize manufacturing to move to their county. The US cannot play the same game - because it is the denominator for other countries financial systems, it is guaranteed to be on the losing side of the equation every time. Thus despite its strong post-war economy, manufacturing was always doomed to leave, which has introduced instability in the US political system. Allowing the USD to inflate (as all fiats want to do) relative to a global currency would incentivize manufacturing to return. Or, at minimum, stem the bleeding. That said, there would be significant disruption from the higher deficits the US has run for decades. 

**Crypto As The Global Reserve**

For a global reserve currency, the following conditions must be met (there are others, but this is the minimum):

- Must remain stable (I can hear the eyes rolling, but hang in with me here)
- (politically) Must convince other nations that it is at greater risk of deflation than inflation (e.g. value more likely to go up than down over the long term). 
- (politically) Must have a secure transaction system that cannot be manipulated to benefit one country over another (e.g. satisfy concerns of China, Russia, and others). 

Crypto, despite its short life, is capable of achieving these. The system designed by Satoshi and adopted by others is as strongly counter-inflationary as possible. From the viewpoint of a global reserve currency, this structurally removes the need for a body like the US federal reserve. The deflation side of the coin would potentially convince the US government to let go of its global financial role for the sake of economic growth. 

The big negatives of using crypto as a global reserve are its current volatility and its slow transaction times. The latter is a technological problem that can be solved either by speeding up times or guaranteeing value at time of transaction. The first I suspect may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once a currency is the global reserve denominating debts, confidence would follow out of political and financial necessity. Power resides where people think power resides. This would be a long term road for Crypto if it continues for the next two decades.

Ideally; a slowly deflating world reserve would provide inflationary benefits to all counties. It would also potentially stabilize fiat currencies barring government manipulation. But in that case, government manipulation would be more obvious and less an us-vs-them scenario given the current financial system. 

Any such transition, should it happen, would taken one of two form. Either a) a significant economic crisis forces the US to accept a shock on its high deficits or b) the transition to crypto occurs slowly enough over decades to allow a battleship-style course realignment. 

The biggest obstacle I see to crypto is climate change. Most countries take it very seriously (imho, as they should), and crypto has a high energy cost, thus a high carbon cost.  Most countries are bound by diplomatic and treaty agreements to hit certain targets. A crypto system would need to resolve this to have a chance at being the global reserve. Or, renewable energy infrastructure would be built fast enough so that a given crypto is at least carbon neutral. 

Lastly, it is possible that this transition could happen after mining is no longer profitable. If Bitcoin, for example, exists in 2050 and is still undergoing slow deflation while block rewards are infinitesimally small, it may behave in ways that satisfy concerns about stability. 

tl;dr: Structural deflation in crypto could satisfy political and economic needs for a global reserve currency in a multi-polar world.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"""The only asset that cannot be bailed out by printing more money is money itself.""","A comment from /u/Ilogy clarifies the situations at hand.

&gt;The first question is: what is the actual problem? And then, secondarily, what does the Fed think is the problem? (Or perhaps more precisely, what does the Fed want us to believe is the problem?)

&gt;In my opinion, the problem is that some of the collateral in the repo markets is in trouble. The repo markets don't just use Treasuries as collateral, they also use less reliable forms of collateral like MBSs (mortgage backed securities), corporate bonds, CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), and even equities, simply because there aren't enough Treasuries for the system to remain liquid.

&gt;All of the collateral used by the banks is itself rehypothecated (think fractional reserve), which means that 1 real bond may get used seven or eight times as collateral on a single day. So if there is a problem with, say, corporate debt---and we are recently learning that there are, in fact, problems in corporate debt at the lower end of the credit spectrum---then suddenly the banks become reluctant to accept this debt as collateral. But, more importantly, depending on how bad the situation becomes, they can also become nervous about the solvency of a borrower if that borrower is carrying a heavy balance sheet of this risky debt.

&gt;The last time we saw the repo market act this way was prior to 2008. The same thing happened, the market heavily relied on mortgaged backed securities, and when those became questionable the repo market began to have liquidity issues. It was actually a warning of what was to come, but no one at the time interpreted it that way.

&gt;So, in my opinion the problem is with the collateral, probably corporate bonds. We know there has been a bubble in corporate debt similar to the housing market bubble, and the signs point to the weaker end of that spectrum now being in trouble (reminders of how subprime led the housing market collapse).

&gt;Now, the second question, what is the Fed telling us they think is the problem?

&gt;According to the Fed, the problem is that banks are unable to lend effectively due to shortages in reserves caused by quantitative tightening which removed a lot of reserves from circulation. They don't have enough money to feel comfortable lending it out, in other words.

&gt;The Fed's solution was initially---you have to remember, this problem with the repo markets started way back in April---to lower the amount of interest they paid banks to park money at the Fed, under the theory that this would inspire banks to lend more via the repo markets in order to get a better return. Yet despite doing this, it made no difference and the tension in the repo markets only got worse.

&gt;What we are now talking about is their latest solution of injected liquidity by buying Treasuries under the hope that by increasing reserves they can encourage banks to lend more.

&gt;However, if the problem is actually with the quality of the collateral, the CLOs or corporate bonds, and not reserves, then what the Fed is doing will make no real difference. The huge spike that drew everyone's attention was initially blamed on tax payment deadlines and a recent government bond auction, but those sorts of days happen every year. The reason the effect was so dramatic this year was because of the underlying problems in the repo market that that particular day just made worse. If it had really just been a temporary liquidity problem by a weird convergence of events, and nothing more, the dramatic steps the Fed has taken since wouldn't have been required. No, something is seriously wrong.

&gt;The narrative the Fed is giving us is now acknowledging that something is wrong, but it isn't that bad because it is something they can easily fix. Now even this narrative has many people worried because it implies the system can't actually handle any degree of tightening, which means QEternity.

&gt;But the problem may be worse if its a problem with the collateral and not actually reserve liquidity. In that case, we are facing GFC 2.0. And the only solution to that would be for the Fed to add all of that bad debt to its balance sheet.

&gt;The problem we are facing is that no one is willing to face the pain of a real recession, and so they keep using money printing and other tactics to artificially keep up asset prices. In the housing market they have managed to keep up prices by printing money to prop up MBSs and by letting the majority of delinquent home owners remain on their property without foreclosing. This time around, we may be facing a situation where they allow all of these zombie companies to survive indefinitely by guaranteeing their debt. How long can this party continue before it explodes? And when it explodes, is it going to express itself primarily in the collapse of the monetary system?

&gt;It is the monetary system that is primarily using its power to artificially prop everything up. If it continues to do so, and there is no way for prices to come down naturally, the only place the system could implode is with the monetary system itself, the only asset that cannot be bailed out by printing more money is money itself.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans,"Currently I have $75k in student loans, in 9 loans from Sallie Mae, at an (astronomical) average interest rate of about 10%.  I'm paying about a $1100/month, and have a repayment period of 10 years. Recently I graduated and started a job with a salary of $79k (before taxes).

I've calculated that I need about $26k a year to live comfortably (rent, utilities, groceries, gas, etc.), and I've built up a savings account with $10k in it. My employer also matches student loan payments (up to a percentage) in 401(k) for those who can't contribute into their 401(k)s on account of student loan debt, so I won't be putting anything into my 401(k) while I still have student loans.

Now I'd like to aggressively pay off my student loans. I've been approved for a loan refinancing from Earnest, with the following repayment term/interest rate options:

\- 5 year repayment term with 4.30% interest rate, monthly payments of $1395.

\- 7 year repayment term with 4.35% interest rate, monthly payments of $1040.

\- 7 year 5 month repayment term with 4.37% interest rate, monthly payments of $1000.

\- 10 year repayment term with 4.42% interest rate, monthly payments of $775. 

\- 15 year repayment term with 4.75% interest rate, monthly payments of $585.

\- 20 year repayment term with 5.51% interest rate, monthly payments of $500.

As I mentioned, I want to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible, but I also want to keep a safety margin should circumstances change or an unexpected financial burden arise. For this reason, I was leaning more towards the 7 year or 7 year 5 month options (I can always pay more per month without penalty if I want to). Once I accept my loan term, I plan to set up a  biweekly autopay to cut down on accruing interest.

My mom seems to think we are spreading ourselves too thin.  She reckons we defer buying a home and that I use my savings for school so that I don’t need to take out student loans.  We fear that would mean we won’t be buying a home for another 4+ years (school will be 2-3 years) at which point, housing prices are likely to be much greater.  For reference, houses have increased 300-500k over the last 5 years.  It’s impossible to know what the market will look like in 5 years, whereas the interest rate on 100-150k of student loans is a certainty.

I am starting a website where I place puzzles and give a little bitcoin as a reward. There is no registration; no stupid bs.  [http://www.thebitcoinbounties.com/](http://www.thebitcoinbounties.com/) 

**How it actually works:**

Some little bitcoin is sent to an address with private key protected by a password (BIP38 encrypted). Anyone can get the password by solving a puzzle, swipe it and send it to his own wallet, therefore claiming the reward. Technically, it is a paper wallet, so it really must be spent completely. I have written down two ways how to claim it: [https://www.thebitcoinbounties.com/claim-your-reward/](https://www.thebitcoinbounties.com/claim-your-reward/). So there is a hint for those how are not that bitcoin savvy.

**Ethics and Verifiability.**

Anyone can just visit the site, solve the puzzle and get the reward. This way there are no limitations on age, race, county of origin, if you are a human or bot... Like it should be in the bitcoin world.

However, the true is, this is mainly for those who cannot go to exchange and buy some. I hope that these small amounts can change people’s lives in the future.

Even if the bounty was claimed, you could always verify your guesses and that bitcoins are not recycled for next bounties.

**Last words:**

I do not have a strict budget, time schedule or clean plan we it will go. There is still the first puzzle sitting and nobody has taken the bounty. We will see if this post can kick it a bit 😊.

personalfinance,Mortgage paid off earlier Vs retirement fund?,"I'm 34 and about to take on a mortgage for my first house I've ever owned (building rather than buying) and will have around 50% of its value already paid off once it's built, or if I add my retirement savings in it will be about 60% paid off, and I'm hoping to pay off the rest within 10 or at most 15 years.

personalfinance,Question and some advice needed regarding taking out a loan to renovate our home,"My wife and I have been in our home about a year now. We're thinking about starting a family soon and would really like to have a few projects taken care of before that happens. Namely, we want to redo our kitchen, two bathrooms, basement and our office. My father, who is a professional contractor and would be doing the work, quoted me about $35K for the work, but advised that I be prepared for surprises by taking out another $5K or $10K if we can.

My wife and I have been debating the best way to go about it. We have been considering doing a home equity loan but I don't think our bank offers those, and I don't think we have enough equity to cover what we need. We also read about cash-out refinance but I don't think we want to have to have to pay another closing cost.

So it looks like we might need to go the personal loan route. The problem is that we can really compare what our interest rates will be because any company will require a hard pull and we obviously don't want to do a bunch of hard pulls to compare rates. We have good credit, my wife is over 800 on her FICO and I'm a little over 700 last I checked. We would be able to afford the payments on the amount we need to borrow, assuming we'd get on the lower end of the ranges we're seeing online.

worldpolitics,Ukraine helps to conceal the crimes of the Crimean Tatars,"&amp;#x200B;

The interaction of Kiev with radical groups existing as public organizations has reached a new level.

After a long period of inaction by the Ukrainian authorities regarding the Crimean Tatars in their country, Ukrainian politicians began to interact with the Crimean Tatar groups. Among them: “Kırym Birigli”, businessman and politician’s Asker battalion of Lenur Islyamov, and “Noman Celebidzhikhan Battalion”.

Since the beginning of the crisis, Ukraine has been trying in every way to ""please"" its allies. Apparently, It deliberately defends the image of the “Crimean Tatar human rights defenders”. Among the local population of Kherson, rumors have repeatedly circulated about the unpunished criminal actions of the representatives of these organizations, in particular their struggle for the criminal world between each other. In addition, all this is accompanied by the silence of the power structures of Ukraine, which usually try to “hush up” this.

Recently, bandits of the Asker battalion looted one of the family enterprises of Seytumer Nimetullaev, the leader of the Kyrym Birligi. None of the law agencies responded. Moreover, It\`snot the first case when the actions of the Kherson group are not punished in any way. The local population claims the precedents of ""protection"" and racketeering of criminal business in the regions bordering with Crimea executed by members of Crimean Tatar nationalist organizations. Under the auspices of their “curator” Mustafa Dzhemilev and the new Ukrainian authorities, members of criminal groups who have appointed themselves “representatives of the occupied peninsula” are trying to establish control over the border territories and, if it\`s possible, organize their “republic in exile” there, tax all transportation and form their ""power structures"". They not only collected “tribute”, but also engaged in racketeering of entrepreneurs and farmers. Representatives of these nationalist groups openly declare their interaction with the SSU against local businessmen on far-fetched charges.

Such lawlessness acts of the Crimean Tatar gangs cannot and shouldn\`t be hushed up by state organizations of Ukraine. That\`s why many Crimean Tatars come back to Crimea. One of the main reasons for this relocation is precisely the pressure of supporters of radical extremist organizations in Ukraine.

It turns out that this group, in addition to fulfilling its criminal interests, also serves the SSU. In particular, by organizing intimidation of Crimean Tatars living in the Crimea, and even trying to organize terrorist attacks and sabotage acts on the territory of the Russian Federation. One example is the set on fire of Emirali Ablaev, the head of the muftiate of Crimea and Sevastopol. Crimes of the Crimean Tatar groups must be condemned by the law agencies of Ukraine, otherwise the ""lawlessness"" will continue.",finance
hardware,"Part 2 - An Architectural Deep-dive into TeraScale, GCN &amp; RDNA","*This post has been split into a two-part series to work around Reddit’s per-post character limit. Please find Part 1 in the preceding post: Overviewing AMD’s GPU Architectures over here:*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/dr59gg/part\_1\_an\_overview\_of\_amds\_gpu\_architectures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/dr59gg/part_1_an_overview_of_amds_gpu_architectures/)

*Having overviewed AMD’s GPUs and gone over background and pre-requisite material, it’s time to delve into TeraScale, GCN and RDNA’s architectural depths…*

# TeraScale

Let’s start within TeraScale’s core and build our way out:

A processor is a complex ensemble of fetch, decode &amp; execute logic coupled with storage registers and cache all working in tandem to carry out whatever number-crunching is required, and these execution blocks are themselves built-up of simpler foundational blocks.

With TeraScale, as with all of AMD’s GPUs today, this most fundamental execution block is the **Stream Processor or SP**. An SP is what AMD chooses to call an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) in the context of their GPUs; ALUs, as their name suggests, specialize in executing mathematical operations.

In TeraScale, several SPs and a branch control unit along with storage registers all come together to make up a **single Stream Processing Unit, or SPU**.

📷Further up, several SPUs along with more control units and storage registers together make up a single **SIMD core**. Several SIMD cores and even more control hardware ultimately come together to make a complete TeraScale GPU.

Of course, a pictorial representation will do a far better job of getting all this across:

*Several Stream Processors along with registers &amp; control logic comprise a single Stream Processing Unit (SPU), while several SPUs along with more control hardware &amp; registers comprise a single SIMD core…*

[*https://imgur.com/k8Y6p2n*](https://imgur.com/k8Y6p2n)

&amp;#x200B;

*…And several SIMD cores together with additional logic &amp; cache build a complete TeraScale chip!*

*Above we see 10 SIMD cores coming together to make a RV770, or Radeon HD 4870 GPU*

It goes without saying that the complete GPU is more complex than what’s seen here, but this gives you a fair idea as well as a glimpse into the heart of this now defunct beast.

Let’s now see how it all comes together to process those vectors we spoke of earlier:

## A VLIW Heart

TeraScale happens to be what’s called a VLIW chip.

VLIW stands for Very Long Instruction Word and is another ***type*** of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Recall from earlier that an ISA comprises the set of instructions that a chip can understand and therefore act on, and that ISAs can be of different types: x86-64 is a CISC type ISA while ARM is a RISC type ISA. Similarly, AMD’s TeraScale GPUs were a VLIW-type ISA.

Simply put, VLIW is another attempt at speeding up chips. While the obvious approaches involve simply building faster cores that churn through more instructions per clock cycle, another is to simply do more stuff at once. This latter approach necessitates multiple processing cores in a single system which explains the many-core CPUs of today with even cellphones now boasting of 8-core CPUs.

Having multiple cores is one thing, utilizing them effectively is quite another. When you run a program, it creates a system process (visible in the task manager) which in-turn spawns one or more “threads”. A thread is a self-sufficient bunch of instructions awaiting the CPU’s attention for execution (self-sufficient as they contain all the data and state information necessary for their execution). A thread is thus the smallest sequence of instructions that can be scheduled for execution by a scheduler.

A simple approach to utilizing more cores then would be to have them execute several independent threads in parallel. Indeed, this approach is used by CPUs and is called Thread Level Parallelism (TLP).

Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) is an alternate take on parallel processing: with ILP several threads from a process are packed into a single, large thread giving us what’s called a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW). This VLIW thread is then sent off to the processor, where it’s unpacked at execution time and the resulting threads executed by available processing cores.

Both ILP and TLP approaches share a common critical requirement though: operations executing in parallel must be independent of each other, be they disparate threads or the instructions from within a VLIW thread. This makes sense: if an operation relies on the output of another it’ll simply have to await those results before it can itself execute.

Consider a very simple example:

*A + B = C*

*X + Y = Z*

*C \* Z = R*

While the first two are entirely independent of the other instructions, the third relies on the preceding two and will thus have to await their execution.

This might appear as a subtle difference but raises a very important question, that of whose job is it to identify such independent data for parallel execution? With TLP, that burden is shared by the application programmer and the hardware: while the programmer is responsible for writing thread-aware code takes advantage of multiple processing cores, the processor itself ultimately schedules threads for parallel execution at run-time, maximizing utilization. TLP thus follows a dynamic, run-time approach to scheduling wherein the processor itself acts as the scheduler.

With an ILP approach things are not as simple: the calling process must itself identify independent threads to be packaged into a single VLIW thread. This leaves the entire burden of scheduling on the software and more specifically, on the compiler. In software parlance, a compiler is a special program that converts code written in a near-English (and thus high-level) language such as Java or C/C++ into low-level machine code based on the processor’s ISA, thus acting as an intermediary translator.

While the compiler gets the advantage of a full view of the program and could therefore be expected to schedule intelligently, there are conditions the compiler remains blind to as some outcomes remain unknown until actual execution time. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that scheduling set by the compiler cannot be altered at run-time by the processor leaving us with a static, compile-time approach to scheduling in stark contrast to TLP.

So ILP is a static scheduling approach that complicates the design of the compiler and leaves compute resources inevitably idle at times, why ever use it then? Because graphics is a highly parallelizable application domain that can utilize an ILP approach arguably well. Further, when combined with TLP as done on TeraScale (surprise!) ILP can lead to some very impressive performance figures.

So how did AMD utilize ILP and further combine it with TLP on their VLIW-based TeraScale architecture? Let’s look down the compute lane:

## TeraScale at Work: TLP + VLIW ILP on a SIMD Core

Recall that a GPU fetches several datapoints or pixels at once in a grouping called a “vector” along with a corresponding instruction in accordance with its SIMD nature. AMD likes to refer to these vectors as “wavefronts” and with TeraScale, 64 VLIW threads of pixel values or datapoints are grouped into a wavefront and dispatched to a SIMD core for processing. With 16 SPUs per SIMD core, the full 64-wide wavefront is executed in four cycles.

With the 16 SPUs of a SIMD core each processing a VLIW thread every clock cycle, we see thread level parallelism or TLP in action as 16 VLIW threads are processed at any given time.

Instruction level parallelism (ILP) comes in next as each VLIW thread is dissected for its constituent datapoints which are then executed individually by the stream processors within the SPU.

And with 16 VLIW thread executing against the same instruction at any given time, a SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture is in play throughout.

Utilization remains a big concern though, for both the SPUs and the SPs within them: not only must the compiler do its best to identify 5 independent datapoints for each VLIW thread, but so must 64 VLIW threads be packed together within each wavefront. Further, the 64 items in a wavefront should all execute against the same instruction; imagine a scenario wherein one thread executes against an entirely different instruction from the other 63! Opportunities for additional clock cycles &amp; poor utilization thus abound and the compiler must do it’s best to schedule around them.

📷With 5 SPs in each SPU, attaining 100% utilization necessitates five datapoints per VLIW thread. That’s the best case; in the worst case an entire thread is comprised of just a single datapoint resulting in an abysmal 20% utilization as 4 SPs simply engage in idle chit-chat. Extremities aside, AMD noted an average utilization of 68% or 3.4 SPs per clock cycle. A diagram from AnandTech’s GCN preview article depicts this scenario, and it’s a good time to borrow it here:

[https://imgur.com/HTs1gbV](https://imgur.com/HTs1gbV)

&amp;#x200B;

*Some cycles see 100% utilization of the SPs as others see just 20% utilization with only one SP engaged. On average, AMD notes 68% utilization per cycle, or 3.4 SPs.*

## TeraScale over Three Generations: Optimizing ILP until the End

TeraScale evolved three generations over its lifetime starting with Gen1 on the Radeon HD 2xxx series and finally culminating with the Gen3 based Radeon HD 69xx series. Three primary enhancements sum up the changes over this period: more SIMD cores, smaller process nodes and a more optimized SPU.

The Radeon HD 2900 XT served as TeraScale’s debut flagship: manufactured on TSMC’s 80nm process with just 4 SIMD cores, it puts into perspective how far we’ve come today!

The HD3000 series followed with similar specs albeit on TSMC’s newer 55nm process and like its predecessor, proved underwhelming against Nvidia’s offerings at the time. Things really did turn in AMD’s favor with the HD4000 series as the flagship HD 4870 dramatically upped SIMD core count straight up to ten in addition to adopting newer GDDR5 VRAM netting 1.5x gains in memory bandwidth.

While the HD 4000 series were good, the HD 5000 series would usher in TeraScale’s heyday: debuting the TeraScale2 architecture on a brand new 40nm process, the Radeon HD 5000 family of GPUs remain arguably AMD’s best to date and are in-fact so well regarded that AMD’s newest RDNA-based RX 5000 of cards are named in honor of this GPU family! With the HD 5870, AMD once again doubled the number of SIMD cores now on the flagship Radeon HD 5870 GPU along with the L2 cache &amp; VRAM.

TeraScale 3 would feature only on the Radeon HD 6900 series with a significant change: reducing the number of stream processors per SPU from five to four. This was AMD responding to their observation of SP utilization averaging around 3.4 SPs per SPU every clock cycle. This reduction would aid utilization &amp; efficiency as well as leave silicon for additional SIMD cores. Indeed, the flagship Radeon HD 6970 GPU modestly increased SIMD core count to 24.

The HD 6900 series would serve as the last of the flagship TeraScale GPUs, even as TeraScale based cards continued to release until October of 2013. As compute applications began to take center-stage for GPU acceleration, games too evolved. The next generation of graphics API’s such as DirectX 10 brought along complex shaders that made the VLIW-centric design of TeraScale ever more inefficient and impractically difficult to schedule for. The Radeon HD 7000 series would accordingly usher in the GCN architecture, TeraScale’s inevitable successor that would abandon VLIW and ILP entirely and in doing so cement AMD’s focus on GPU compute going forward.

# GCN – Graphics Core Next

With a mission to end Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU compute space, GCN set out with big goals. To do so would require AMD to free their GPUs of VLIW’s shackles &amp; its accompanying instruction-centric approach to parallelism, building a new GPU architecture from the ground-up. New architectures are never easy, and with this transition necessitating major changes &amp; complete overhauls, it would be no mean feat.

Why though? Why go through all this fuss? Simply put, because AMD really had no choice in the matter:

You see, the enterprise &amp; high-performance compute (HPC) space are some of the highest margin customers hardware companies appeal to and the compute potential of GPUs happens to be of great value to these folk, a target audience who’s potential Nvidia had recognized first and addressed with Fermi, their first-ever compute-centric architecture. Nvidia complimented Fermi’s development with heavy investments in the surrounding software ecosystem resulting in the creation of the CUDA ecosystem, which continues to dominate the GPU compute space even today.

If you’re wondering what’s the point here, it’s all in the numbers: Fermi released in October of 2010 and by the third quarter of 2011, Nvidia was already enjoying the spoils: Q3’11 saw Nvidia declare a net income of $146M from a total $644M in gaming revenue while during the same period, profits from the professional market amounted to $95M from a total revenue of just $230M: that’s equivalent to 65% of the gaming profit from just 35% of the sales revenue; talk about healthy, healthy margins!

And so with both finances and the evolving software &amp; gaming ecosystem demanding it and nearly two years late, GCN was to be AMD’s Fermi moment boldly announcing their arrival on the GPU compute playground. What changed &amp; how did AMD’s take on a thread parallel GPU shape up? Let’s dive right in:

Recall that with TeraScale, the stream processor (SP) forms the foundational compute execution block. “Stream Processor” is another term for an ALU and TeraScale houses five SPs (four with TeraScale 3) in a single Stream Processing Unit (SPU) with 16 SPUs coming together to make a single SIMD core, several of which build a complete chip.

In the case of GCN this layering is shifted up a stage: individual stream processors still form the foundational blocks, but now 16 of them come together directly to build a single SIMD core. Further, four SIMD cores together build a single **Compute Unit, or CU** with several CUs finally coming together to build a single GCN chip.

Diagrams once again:

[https://imgur.com/PoVi25P](https://imgur.com/PoVi25P)

&amp;#x200B;

*A SIMD core in GCN comprises of sixteen Stream Processors (SPs) rather than sixteen Stream Processing Units (SPUs) which themselves each comprise of five or four SPs*

[*https://imgur.com/4RiLzQ4*](https://imgur.com/4RiLzQ4)

&amp;#x200B;

*And four SIMD cores now come together in a single Compute Unit (CU), which a GCN GPU contains several of. Also illustrated above are the Scalar ALU, the branch &amp; fetch/decode logic and the registers/cache that form part of the CU.*

Let’s look at work distribution in GCN:

With VLIW and ILP out the window, GCN is a pure SIMD architecture: wavefronts are no longer comprised of VLIW threads but rather of 64 individual datapoints which are executed by the 16 SPs within SIMD cores. Wavefronts remain 64-wide, necessitating the same four cycles to churn through. Further, each compute unit contains four SIMD cores &amp; each of these may work on separate wavefronts so at any time, a CU may be processing up-to four different wavefronts.

All this brings along a massive benefit: that of the software no longer having to identify and schedule independent data into VLIW threads, greatly simplifying the design of compilers. Independent threads are instead dynamically scheduled by the hardware at runtime resulting in a much simpler approach to scheduling. All this lends itself very favorably to compute applications as well as to modern games.

New to GCN &amp; specifically for the scheduling of compute workloads across CUs are the **Asynchronous Compute Engines, or ACE** which preside over resource allocation, context switching &amp; task priorities. As GCN is built to concurrently work on multiple tasks, ACEs independently schedule wavefronts across CUs. A GCN GPU may carry multiple ACEs.

The **Graphics Command Processor (GCP)** serves as the graphics counterpart to the ACE &amp; makes a return from TeraScale. The GCP works to schedule activities across the graphics subsystem, primarily involving scheduling across the “primitive” pipelines: complex surfaces &amp; objects in games are built up of simpler geometrical shapes, called primitives, bunched together in large numbers. Triangles are the dominant choice here as their position in 3D-space can be entirely determined by just three points. This process of building up complex objects, shapes &amp; surfaces from simpler data is referred to as **Tessellation**. The primitive pipelines are responsible for this tessellation in addition to other geometry &amp; high-order surface processing &amp; the GCP is responsible for scheduling work over these pipelines.

Do notice the **Scalar ALU** within the CU: this is a special ALU dedicated to any “one-off” mathematical and transcendental (i.e. logarithmic, sin/cosine etc.) operations. The very meaning of a SIMD core implies vector processing and that involves applying an instruction to a group of values (a vector) rather than to a single value (a scalar). A scalar or a one-off operation disrupts this flow, and a separate Scalar ALU alleviates this by keeping these operations out of the SIMD cores.

So where was this with TeraScale? Unfortunately, within the SPUs: in the case of the TeraScale Gen1 &amp; 2 the 5th SP in each SPU served as the **Special Function Unit, or SFU**. Gen3 bunched 3 of the 4 SPs within a SPU together for this. This resulted in a severe latency for scalar operations as they had to be scheduled within a wavefront: the HD 6900 series had a nasty 44-cycle latency for scalar operations. With the separation of the Scalar ALU from the SIMD core entirely, GCN brings this down to one cycle.

## GCN Through the Years &amp; Today

The first GPUs featuring GCN debuted on the 9th January 2012 with the Radeon HD 7950 &amp; HD 7970 GPUs. On the 7th of January 2019, AMD announced the Radeon VII: the last GCN GPU. That’s a good seven years, practically eons in the compute world. GCN wasn’t a stagnant architecture over this duration, instead evolving with a mix of typical incremental upgrades in addition to other, more significant enhancements. Let’s peek at GCN’s journey:

## First &amp; Second Generation GCN:

While Gen1 GCN entirely abandoned VLIW in favor of a pure SIMD architecture, Gen2 brought along incremental upgrades with **more functional units, higher memory bandwidth &amp; better power management.** New compute centric instructions in GCN’s ISA accompanied these, along with support for a **greater number of ACEs** with the R9 290X flagship sporting 8 where Gen1 had a hard limit of 2.

**Bridgeless Crossfire** was introduced here as well: Crossfire enables the use of multiple Radeon GPUs in a system &amp; previously necessitated a hardware bridge to connect these GPUs. Bandwidth limitations over the bridge would require the CPU to mediate exchange over the PCIe bus, invoking a frametime penalty. Dedicated hardware in the form of the **XDMA Crossfire** **engine** would now control this &amp; the much higher bandwidth of the PCIe bus meant a dedicated bridge was no longer necessary.

In terms of raw numbers, the Gen2 flagship R9 290X came baring 44 CUs, up from 32 CUs on the Gen1 HD 7970 &amp; R9 280X, along with a wider memory bus (512-bit vs 384-bit) &amp; an additional gig of VRAM.

## Third Generation GCN:

Debuting in the September of 2014, Gen3 GCN bought along two major features to the compute side: **GPU pre-emption** &amp; **support for FP16 arithmetic.** Pre-emption is the act of interrupting the execution of a task for another higher-priority task, without its consent with the intention of resuming it later. This is a big deal as GPUs have always been poor at context switching.

WRT FP16 ops, GPUs deal almost explicitly with floating point numbers (non-integer decimals/fractions) which typically occupy 32-bits in computer memory and are thus referred to as FP32 numbers, or single-precision numbers. Not every application requires as much precision with many compute applications adequately addressed by half-precision numbers which occupy half the space in memory with just 16-bits. These are referred to as FP16 numbers &amp; lead to significant memory savings.

On the graphics side AMD introduced **lossless delta color compression** for the transfer of large textures. The use of compression for textures is not new, though with this AMD claimed a massive 40% gain in memory bandwidth efficiency.

Lastly, **FreeSync** &amp; **HBM** were introduced here as well. **FreeSync** is AMD’s implementation of adaptive refresh-rate technology, allowing the monitor to change its refresh rate on-the-fly to match the frame output rate of the GPU, eliminating stutter when the framerate falls below the refresh rate and screen tearing conversely. **HBM** or **High Bandwidth Memory** is a memory standard that places the VRAM and GPU core on the same large slice of silicon, dubbed an ‘interposer’, as opposed to soldering memory chips separately onto the PCB. HBM allows for much higher bandwidth, lower latency as well as reduced power consumption. The trade off? Much higher cost.

The flagship Fury X increased CU count to 64 while HBM enabled a colossal 8-fold increase in memory bus width to 4096-bits from 512-bits on the R9 290X, resulting in a 60% increase in memory bandwidth to 512GB/s from 320GB/s. The Fury cards were the first GPUs to use HBM, which makes a comeback on GCN Gen5 which uses HBM2 exclusively.

## Fourth Generation GCN: Polaris

Gen4 GCN debuted on the Polaris RX 400 series of GPUs in the June of 2016. With the flagship RX 480 squarely a mid-tier card with just 36 CUs, Polaris represented a big shift in AMD’s GPU strategy as they set out to the mainstream market first, differing the launch of high-end GPUs to a hitherto-undisclosed date. This speaks volumes of the extent of GCN’s success, or lack thereof, in the high-end space but we’ll differ that discussion for a while, instead maintaining focus on new features Gen4 GCN brought along.

Polaris aimed to make big improvements in the domain of **power consumption**, an area where GCN had fared poorly so far with several flagships running hot &amp; loud while happily chugging on the power lines.

In addition, Polaris brings along support for **instruction pre-fetching,** a predictive process wherein processors guess the instructions they’ll be executing next based on the current execution state &amp; then fetch those instructions. Correct pre-fetching leads to significant performance gains as the processor need not wait for data to be read in from memory, which is magnitudes slower. Incorrectly pre-fetched instructions are discarded, degrading efficiency though pre-fetching techniques are constantly refined to minimize this. Either ways, GCN Gen4 GPUs could now pre-fetch instructions, something prior GCN GPUs simply could not do. A **larger instruction buffer** obviously accompanies this.

On the graphics side, AMD added the **Primitive Discard Accelerator**. As surfaces &amp; complex shapes are ‘tessellated’, i.e. made up of many smaller &amp; simpler polygons (typically triangles), the primitive discard accelerator culls visually insignificant triangles (hidden or too small) for increased performance.

The RX 500 series launched a year later, bringing improvements to clockspeeds &amp; reductions in power consumption. While the RX400 series were AMD’s first cards on the 14nm process, the RX 590 launched on a more refined 12nm process mildly improving clockspeeds &amp; power efficiency.

GCN Gen4 remains the only GPU family from AMD lacking a high-end flagship member.

## Fifth Generation GCN: Vega

While an entire article can be written on Vega’s release shenanigans, we’ll refrain from going down that path here. Baring a little context, we’ll retain focus on the notable new features Vega brought along.

Vega launched on Monday the 14th of August 2017 as the Vega 56 and Vega 64 GPUs, with those numbers denoting the number of compute units in those respective GPUs. The high CU count marked AMD’s return to the high-end space after a two-year absence. AMD’s recently launched Ryzen CPUs had delivered on value &amp; performance far beyond expectations, cementing hopes for Vega to do the same in the GPU space. This would prove to be flawed chain-reasoning causing expectations &amp; excitement to spiral out of control prior to launch: at one-point enthusiasts were offering to privately fund the overseas travel of knowledgeable YouTubers such as Buildzoid to have them analyze AMD’s Vega events! Though I really blame AMD’s mix of dramatic &amp; drip-feed marketing for this, I’ll refrain from talking further about it here.

The GPU landscape wasn’t favorable for AMD either: they barely held 25% of desktop GPU market share at this point so it would be very hard to get game developers to support any new Vega-centric gaming features as they’d benefit very few. Further exacerbating this situation was Nvidia’s dominance of the entire GPU landscape with their Pascal architecture, one of their best ever architectures now legendry for refinement, efficiency &amp; raw performance.

Regardless, AMD’s engineers did consider Vega to be their largest architectural overhaul in five years even actively distancing themselves from the GCN tag &amp; referring to this as the ‘Vega’ architecture instead. This is still very much GCN though, so naming conventions aside let’s peek into the changes:

This biggest change comes to **GCN’s FP16 compute** **capabilities:** while Gen3 introduced FP16, the operations themselves didn’t execute any faster as each individual stream processors could still handle only one operation at a time, be it FP16 or FP32. Vega changes that significantly: **each SP can now handle two FP16 operations** in place of a single FP32 op, a feature AMD dubbed ‘**Rapid Packed Math**’.

The next big change comes to the memory subsystem with the adoption of **HBM2** and the introduction of the **High Bandwidth Cache Controller**. More relevant as a compute feature, **HBCC** extends the GPU VRAM’s reach to the system RAM &amp; secondary storage device for datasets too large for the VRAM alone.

Next are improvements to the graphics engines with the introduction of **primitive shaders** which allow for high-speed discarding of primitives, i.e. visually insignificant polygons (hidden or very small triangles) along with the **Draw Stream Binning Rasterizer** to further aid in this regard. This continued emphasis on culling helps prevent the clogging of render pipelines &amp; frees the GPU of useless work, reducing memory access and saving memory bandwidth while reducing power consumption.

Lastly, we have **better load balancing across the geometry/shader engines** resulting in a 2x speedup in geometry throughput. While geometry performance hadn’t been poor on GCN, this helps squeeze out any potential bottlenecks.

Built on the 14nm process, the Vega 56 &amp; 64 GPUs packed 8GB of HBM2 each. While HBM2 was to double the bandwidth over HBM1, it missed that target by a bit affording Vega 484GB/s in bandwidth over its 2048-bit wide bus, where the Fury cards enjoyed 512GB/s over their 4096-bit wide bus.

The Radeon VII would rectify that: released on the 7th of February 2019, the “world’s first 7nm gaming GPU” and the last GCN GPU carries 60CUs and a whooping 16GB of HBM2 memory over a full 4096-bit wide bus unleashing a mindboggling 1TB/s in memory bandwidth! Slightly anti-climatically though, it cost and performed nearly the same as the mighty GTX 1080 Ti, the then two-year older Pascal flagship which also carried a 45W lower TDP.

Overall, the Vega cards lacked appeal against Nvidia’s highly refined &amp; efficient Pascal-based GTX 10x series which not only offered similar performance at similar price points but had also been on the shelfs for a while already. The use of expensive HBM2 memory also hindered AMD’s ability to price the cards more aggressively, and these factors together sadly crippled Vega’s success as a gaming architecture.

## GCN: Conclusion

While AMD did lose significant GPU market share with their GCN architecture at the helm, GCN did have its moments: the HD 7970 and R9 290X are remembered as formidable flagships that held the performance crown in their day, GCN did see AMD make inroads into the compute space, Vega gave us some great Ryzen APUs &amp; cards like the RX470 and Vega 56 have done well for AMD. GCN is also in all the consoles, from the PlayStation 4 to the Xbox and even on the Nintendo Wii U.

Notably, GCN did well in the low-power envelopes of mid-range and embedded graphics products such as the consoles and APUs while it did suffer at the high-end: the R9 290X ran hot and loud, the R9 Fury cards still cause their past owners to break into random bouts of sweating and worse of all, the Vega cards consumed the power equivalent of Nvidia GPUs from a tier above. Indeed, it appeared that the flagship cards worsened in respects to power draw and efficiency as GCN matured and clearly, something needed to change.

RDNA seems set to rectify all that GCN did wrong, especially in the domain of power consumption and efficiency. While it’s barely out the door and therefore too early to judge, it’s enjoyed some large wins in the enterprise space spanning the cloud, supercomputer and low-power envelope spaces. Indeed, RDNA seems set to answer every enthusiast’s call for a new GPU architecture from AMD, but does it ultimately fare well and what does it change? Let’s dig in.

# RDNA: Radeon Re-defined

RDNA arrives to make significant changes to the core of GCN, or as AMD prefers to put it more organically: to the very DNA of the Radeon architecture. While not as major a redesign as the move away from VLIW, RDNA does bring along a complete reworking of AMD’s approach to thread level parallelism on its GPUs. Accordingly, we get three major changes manifesting as updates to the compute units (CUs), the addition of a new caching layer and accompanying improvements to power efficiency.

Beginning at the heart of the matter, **the fundamental SIMD cores see a major change once again, now beefing up to twice the size of GCN’s SIMD cores**, doubling the number of steam processors (SPs) &amp; the register space:

[https://imgur.com/3wbiUDw](https://imgur.com/3wbiUDw)

&amp;#x200B;

*TeraScale ushered in the 16-wide SIMD design, which GCN followed despite the move away from VLIW by simply replacing TeraScale’s 16 SPUs (each of which housed 4 or 5 SPs) with the fundamental stream processors themselves. RDNA continues shaking things up for the SIMD core.*

This in turn alters the compute unit itself:

[https://imgur.com/JDwIlAa](https://imgur.com/JDwIlAa)

&amp;#x200B;

As we see, significant changes to the compute unit abound with RDNA. Most notably, the **four SIMD cores of GCN are now merged into two**, each twice as wide doubling both the number of SPs as well as the register space. **Each SIMD core now also gets its own scheduler**, as opposed to GCN’s approach of deploying a single scheduler across the entire CU.

Further on we see that while GCN equips it’s CUs with a single scalar unit\*\*, RDNA’s carries two Scalar ALUs in a CU, one per SIMD core\*\*. Recall that the SALU is dedicated to one-off operations which would otherwise bog down the SIMD cores, wasting their parallel compute capabilities.

Further changes alter resource sharing across CUs: **RDNA pairs two CUs into a single Work Group Processor**, or WGP with the **scalar data &amp; instruction cache shared across the WGP along with the Local Data Share (LDS)**. GCN on the other hand shared its scalar cache across four adjacent CUs while maintaining a dedicated LDS per CU.

While such merging of SIMD cores and changes to sharing across CUs may appear as trivial changes, they’re anything but and have far reaching implications on how work is distributed and executed by the GPU: recall that work is distributed to the CUs in a fundamental grouping called a wavefront, with 64 pixels or datapoints in each wavefront. Ideally, these datapoints hold no inter-dependencies and await execution against the same instruction making them ideal for parallel execution via the SIMD cores which had been 16-wide with both GCN &amp; TeraScale, thus processing a wavefront every 4 cycles.

RDNA changes this four-cycle execution model entirely: with the SIMD cores doubled up to 32 SPs, the **wavefronts too are slashed in half to 32 elements per wavefront**. The implication is obvious: **a wavefront is executed every cycle** resulting in a **4x speedup in wavefront execution** times!

The reduction in wavefront size helps tremendously: identifying 64 independent datapoints for each wavefront can prove challenging even for highly parallelizable applications like graphics and GPU compute tasks. This challenge often necessitates additional cycles where some datapoints execute against different instructions from the others, also resulting in poor utilization. With just half the datapoints required per wavefront, this situation is greatly eased.

So RDNA’s Compute Units can execute wavefronts four times faster than their predecessor, this necessitates keeping the CUs well fed with data: a **new caching layer** is thus introduced. Notice the CU block diagram above wherein GCNs’ local L1 cache is changed in nomenclature to the ‘L0’ cache. But that’s all that it is: a change in nomenclature. The real change comes at the next step: RDNA now adds a new L1 layer that’s shared across 10 Compute Units (5 GCPs) which in-turn interacts with the L2 cache by the memory controllers. On the other hand, the L1 cache in the CUs of GCN interacts directly with this L2 cache, with no intermediate caching layer.

Caching layers have a significant impact on performance, lowering execution times &amp; upping efficiency further: when data isn’t found in the caching layers there’s no choice but to look for it in the VRAM, which isn’t just many magnitudes slower (on the scale of thousands of times slower as compared to the caches close to the cores), it’s also significantly more energy intensive.

All put together, that’s a 4x speedup in wavefront execution times coupled with smaller wavefronts and additional caching, improving both performance &amp; efficiency. The results reflect this: RDNA’s mid-range 5700XT GPU performs in the same ballpark as the Radeon VII GPU, which represents the very best of GCN. Built on the same 7nm process, the R7 carries 3840 SPs and a 295W TDP. For RDNA to match that with 33% fewer SPs and a 25% lower TDP is very good progress indeed: the 5700XT carries 2560 SPs and a 225W TDP with the most impressive reduction being the $400 USD price tag against the Radeon VII’s $700 USD MSRP!

One thing is clear: AMD has made significant strides with RDNA, and that’s great news for the GPU market. Hopefully, RDNA signals AMD’s long overdue return to competitiveness in the GPU space.

## RDNA: Additional New Features

Two significant enhancements accompany the design reworks described above, chief among them being the shift to **GDDR6 memory**. First introduced on Nvidia’s RTX 2000 GPUs in 2018, GDDR6 brings along a 1.75x speedup over GDDR5, affording the 5700XT with 448GB/s in memory bandwidth over the same 256-bit wide bus as the RX 580, which merely enjoys 256GB/s.

Next up is the shift to the **PCIe Gen4 standard** with 32GB/s in bandwidth over 16 PCIe lanes, doubling bandwidth over Gen3’s 16GB/s. Though GPUs today struggle to saturate Gen3’s bandwidth, the move to Gen4 aids with the exploding popularity of NVMe SSDs, which utilize PCIe’s much higher bandwidth to attain read/write speeds unattainable by typical drives over SATA. Since a GPU can now be adequately fed over 8 Gen4 lanes, more lanes remain available for these SSDs.

## RDNA: Looking Forward

For now, the best we have with RDNA is the 5700XT and with 40 CUs, 4 Asynchronous Compute Engines and a 256-bit wide memory bus, it’s clearly a mid-range part. “Big Navi” remains due at an undisclosed date, with rumors of AMD referring to this part as the “Nvidia killer” internally. It would be nice for this rumor to be true: Team Green’s domination over the past few years has been absolute, resulting in their complete stagnation on price/performance improvements, so a shakedown is definitely overdue.

One thing is for certain: efficiency will play a major role in dictating RDNA’s success much more than raw performance alone. While the 5700XT seems to be doing okay, if Big Navi pops out sporting maxed out voltages and bursting along the clock speed limits like Vega did, then all hope is truly lost for a formidable AMD challenger.

Things with RDNA do look very promising for now though many definitive products remain due: beyond just high-end enthusiast class graphics cards, it’s the APUs, console SoCs and compute GPUs that RDNA spawns that’ll ultimately dictate its success. For now, I dare say it would be safe to remain cautiously optimistic!

# Conclusion &amp; Looking Forward

Over the course of this article, we’ve looked at AMD’s GPUs and observed the constant &amp; significant transformation they’ve undergone over the past 13 years, from aggressively scaling up and optimizing VLIW to abandoning it entirely for a more compute-centric architectural layout. While TeraScale made significant impact on the gaming market, GCN has made in-roads into the GPU computing and heterogenous system landscape over the past decade. Today, RDNA arrives to take over with significant changes aggressively rectifying GCN’s shortcomings in a focused effort to dominate the GPU landscape. Indeed, RDNA’s many early wins firmly lay out this path.

With just three new cards out for now, it’s clear that RDNA’s story has just begun. While AMD seems to have big plans for RDNA and are already enjoying several large wins across the spectrum, a few more generations will be necessary to effectively gauge RDNA’s impact. This sure seems like the architecture that restores AMD’s technology lead while cementing their mindshare, though. Indeed, only time (and a few more releases) will tell the complete tale.

personalfinance,Own my house. Want to take cash out to pay off accumulated debt. What’s the best way to do this?,"As the title says. 

I’m lucky enough to own my house outright. It (and our land) is worth 275-300K. 

Unfortunately, due to some unexpected extreme medical expenses, accompanying legal battle, and unexpected home repair costs (collapsed retainer wall and busted foundation that had to be reset), we racked up over 40K in credit card debt and completely wiped out our 1-year savings we had. 

I was planning on paying this all off and restoring our emergency savings with proceeds from the legal battle as it seemed we were close to settlement, but it has now turned into a long term court battle that, while still paying what we expected it too, will take 8-9 months to get paid out at minimum. 

I was thinking about taking equity from my home, paying off this high interest debt, and also completing all of the needed repairs (driveway needs to be repoured now as well). I would then take the legal payout and pay back off this equity loan. 

Worst case scenario, I end up with a low balance mortgage, at a much lower interest rate than credit cards, and can pay that off quickly with double payments after we build back our savings. 

A couple questions: 

How would I go about getting my cash out of the house? I keep reading about cash out refinances, but I don’t have a current mortgage so I don’t think that applies. 

Is there a better option or game-plan for this that I haven’t considered? 

Are there other risks or downsides to this plan that I don’t seem to have considered?

Both jobs are federal jobs w/ a Pension based on high-3 salary, and have identical health, vision, dental, retirement savings accounts (5% Match). The formula for the pension is a huge benefit of the prospective job.

I'm thinking about turning down the offer for the OR job for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. OR state tax will effectively be 7-8% (progressive rates, but enters the 9.9% rate quite quickly), in conjunction to FICA and Federal Taxes equals about 17K/21K (starting pay and certified pay), or 5K more in taxes, assuming no 401K contributions/tax advantaged benefits.
2. A similarly configured home in OR is about 200K to 250K MORE. This is anywhere from 700 to 1500 more each month. That's 8400 to 18000 a year more than I'm currently paying.
3. These two items quickly hack off most of the pay difference, leaving me in a similar net income.
4. I'd have to pay for the move out of pocket. I haven't called for a quote, but we bought our home this year. Though there's no significant appreciation/depreciation, we'd lose on closing costs/inspections/prep/listing.

So... there's that.

For duties, the gist of it is the same. At my current job, I have a lot of freedom. I can manage my schedule, which is awesome when you have a family and obligations. I don't work holidays and have a relatively low stress environment. I'm kinda bored at times, but it's a great balance. I'm able to max my R-IRA contributions in addition to 20% of my salary to the 401K. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the offered job, I will have little to no say in my schedule for a while. It's all based on seniority and I'll be the low man on the totem pole. I'll work weekends and holidays and can be forced to work overtime. This means I'll probably miss some important dates like anniversaries and birthdays and appointments, but the pay is good. The work will be more engaging and challenging, but the scale tips towards work-life more than personal life.

They repeated over and over that without correcting the typo and redoing the report that I could not be helped.

I have hard evidence of a credit pull on both me and my wife's credit. I am still locked out of my Rocket Mortgage account. I am not going to allow them to pull my credit again when I already saw briefly a terrible offer of a 5% interest rate. Is there any kind of way I can salvage my credit or at least, file some kind of formal complaint against Quicken? This almost feels like fraud to me in that they can take my SSN, mess with that information, and then prevent me access to information that should be rightfully mine to peruse.",finance
personalfinance,about to become parents 7 months from now. Looking for advice on the next steps to take finanacially.,"My fiance and I have been saving up for awhile now to get a house, but we recently discovered that she is pregnant. I thought we would have a little bit more time for saving but I guess that's how these sort of things go: You're never ready for a kid even when you think you are. So here's the breakdown of our current situation:

together, we both bring in about $5,200 a month

Minus rent, our bills together are currently about $2,000, with $3,200 leftover per month at the moment.

together, we have about $14,000 in savings.

We both currently have car payments, but I have just enough saved up, separate from the savings i mentioned above, to pay off either one car or the other in full, but not both. We are planning to use the savings to buy a house, but right now we are not sure if buying a house or just renting a home would be the best choice to make.

Our current thought is this: My fiance has a lower credit score than i do, but she is working on it. I thought it would make better sense to pay off her car loan and that doing so might help her credit even more. Ive already got the lowest interest rate on my car. both cars have about the same amount left on them to pay off. With a baby on the way though, my fiance's car is starting to look too small to drive around with, so eventually we might need to get a larger car, like an suv or van. Thinking on this, I'm wondering if it would make more sense to pay off my car loan, and then look into possibly trading her current car in towards a different vehicle?

We spoke to a lender about buying a home, and it looks like financially we should be able to afford a $1500/mnth mortgage payment, but i am thinking of trying to find something a bit cheaper if i can to settle with for now, with the intent of eventually buying a larger home in the future, maybe 5-10 years from now? So not sure if we need a 3 bedroom 2 bath type home right now, but the fiance seems to think we do, though she is fine with settling for a 2 bed 1 bath for now.

Currently we have very little to our name when it comes to furnishing, appliances, etc. the biggest things we have are a bed and tv. plus like i mentioned we have a kid on the way so thats something we dont even know how to consider for yet. not counting the child costs, if we WERE to get a place at about $1500 and only one car payment, I calculated us to have about $3,300 in bills, with about $1800 leftover per month. Any advice would be helpful. Also please feel free to ask any questions if you need anymore info. Thanks.

EDIT: Lots of responses already, wow! Thanks for the congratulations and I will respond as soon as I can but I see I forgot to mention that we are currently living in a small space from someone. It already was too small for 2 people and will definitely be too small for a little one to run around. So we will either need an apartment or rent a home or purchase. People I know around me suggest owning vs rent because at least in our area, renting seems to be about as much as mortgage anyway.",finance

Currently I rent and I would be a first time homeowner, is this possible/recommendable?","As stated in the title, I'd like to buy a property and rent it out for passive income. My current situation is as follows, and I'm asking here to see if it's recommendable and/or possible to pursue this:

- Live in a HCOL area in the northeast USA, salary of 75-80k and rent is $3,000/mo (split in half with my SO, so effectively I'm paying $1,500/mo)
- Student loan debt payments but should be finished with these in a few months, will have an extra $700-800
- Never bought a home before, maybe I would qualify for good interest rates since I also have a very good credit score
- Approximate money saved: $10k in emergency fund, $10k in Roth IRA, $10k in 401K, $8k in stocks, $5k in other savings

personalfinance,Parents Looking to Buy Me a House. Best Way to Complete the Transaction Without Paying Tax?,"All,

I am a long time redditor on my main account, but I wanted to post this under my throwaway for obvious reasons. FWIW, this scenario is applicable in my home state of Texas, and I am not married. No dependents at the time as well.

I need some quick insight from some folks on the way to buy a home through my parents while limiting tax consequences. There are a couple options we are looking at, but I could use some insight from some folks here on whether or not I am missing anything, or if I am off base and making the wrong decision. Long story short, my parents are starting the wealth transfer process, and they are looking to purchase a home for me. Right now, they are looking to limit the tax consequences for obvious reasons. The home we are currently looking at is right at $500K, and the most attractive options we are looking at right now are as follows. What is the best option, or am I missing one that is even more attractive?

1) Via seller financing (I.E the parents are the financiers) of the house. Annually, they would gift me the federal gift limit per year, and I would use that to pay a large portion of the mortgage until the house is paid off.

2) Placing the House in a Trust. The drawback here is the funds will always have to stay in the trust in the event of a sale.

3) Gift the home outright. Drawback here is if the property appreciates, I am on the hook for the taxes upon the sale net the cost basis.

Lastly, is there a preferred strategy at time of closing? Considering the above, those are all options if the parents are purchasing the home. Is there a better option if I am the purchaser?

personalfinance,Most efficient way to pay off multiple loans?,"The general rule of thumb I hear is that any payment in excess of the minimum should be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate. That makes sense, cause then you're shortening the lifespan of the fastest accruing interest rate loan.

But wouldn't it be better if the excess payment was applied to the loan that has the highest total interest amount due? If a loan has a lower interest rate but a higher principal, then the total interest amount due will be higher than that of a loan with a higher rate but a lower principal.

Am I right in thinking this?

I think by doing this all the loans will eventually cascade onto the same total interest due each month, regardless of rate or principal. Then the excess payment would be split over all the loans.",finance

$135k student loans (90% federal student loans)

$13k principal balance left on a bought-new Subaru Forester that has 40,000 miles on it. The payments are currently made by my parents while I’m in school, but once I graduate I will be responsible for it.

Having a $311 car payment month to month sounds like a large line item to pay, so I was thinking of buying a used car outright and ridding of the monthly payment so I can start focusing on my student loan debt first. Is this a good idea? Is the $13k left on the car too small of a balance left and should I just bite the bullet to finish out the monthly payments?

I really want to aim for a high paying job in a place with lower cost of living like in the South or Midwest. Is there anything else I should be considering?

Should I refinance my car, and/or student loans? I know refinancing student loans will mean the loans will become private and that will exclude me from federal repayment programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

personalfinance,First Car Loan 8% Interest,"Hello people of reddit. So long story short a few weeks ago my cars transmission got fucked and I was kind of forced into getting a car in a hurry due to work. I did quite a bit of homework on finance interesest rates and getting a car etc. I was opting at first at getting a used card but was convinced to get a new one by my parents.Now let me give you a bit of background on my credit history I got my first credit card last year around this time, and got some quick installment loans and payed them off quickly and the dealer acknowledged my credit as 630.

This is what I ended up with

25k Car Loan 72 Months (Includes Gap Insurance, 7 Year/100k Extended Warranty $0 Deductible) 8% Interest.

Ive been reading a lot and im starting to think that I might have lucked out kind of on my interest rate a bit but im not exactly sure. The finance guy from the dealership told me that I should wait 1 year and refinance for a better term and interest rate in about year and that I should go back to them. They claim they had gotten me some kind of special first time car loan program. Which is why I accepted the 8% but not exactly sure how good it actually is due to my lack of credit history.

Ive been wondering if I should try to pay off the car faster or actually refinance later or earlier I would like some advice from you guys and what kind of plan I should be putting into action. Thanks",finance

&gt;The increased financial strength of the banking sector reflects more than a decade of efforts by banks and regulators to improve the capital position and deleverage the sector. But the comparatively weak position among the median non-financial firms, particularly outside of the United States, is cause for concern. These alarming results are bound to reignite the debate about financial prudence and the optimum capital structure.

I am graduating in December with my MBA and am currently carrying out my job search (have had 4 interviews, expecting a couple offers in the next week or two).

I currently have 10k in student loans (taken within the last year) and 3k in car loans (this is in my parents name - I was able to get a very low interest rate due to my dads credit and pay them monthly). 

I do not have a credit card and therefore no credit card debt.

As I am preparing for the transition to the workforce, I discovered I have an extremely low credit score (~550) and am not sure how it got so bad.

I found one I liked but the dealership told me I needed in-state insurance after I had already signed paperwork. I ended up backing out of the sale, but the dealership still ran a credit check 5 times against my name. I am
worried this may have had an adverse effect on my score.

As I transition to full time work, what can I do to raise my credit quickly? I am very adverse to debt and am seeking to pay off my outstanding in the first year.

btc,DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIAT AND CRYPTO,"•   Fiat Currency is backed by Governments/Countries itself. What determines the value of a currency is the economic health, demand, growth, political stability to name a few, of the respective country. Before 1930, most fiat currencies were backed by gold and silver.  


•   Since 1971, U.S. citizens have been able to utilize Federal Reserve Notes as the only form of money that for the first time had no currency with any gold or silver backing. This is where you get the saying that U.S. dollars are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government - quoted in google.com.  


•   What backs crypto value is purely supply and demand. The demand creation of a crypto is its sole objective. To create demand, the crypto has to have a purpose. And most purpose commonly promoted is utility. The number of ways you can utilize the said crypto. The more utilization factors the more demand there is for it.  


•   There are other ways to substantiate value of a crypto and that is to back the crypto with a 1 to 1 ratio in assets or in USD. Then the question is, how 3,000 crypto currencies in circulation be monetary eco sustainable? Can anyone imagine walking into McDonald and view a chart of 3,000 different pricing? Which also means the crypto is a payment gateway pegging against USD instead of bearing any true characteristic of a currency.  


•   A country’s currency is in its own legit form of legal tender, the only currency acceptable under financial sovereigns of a country. People in the world must be made to understand that. Retailers in Thailand cannot put up products price tags in EUROS/USD, it is illegal. It has to be in Thai Baht.  


•   It is hardly imaginable for everyone in the world to retail with a Crypto-Currencies at a rate of 7 transactions per second. When mining nodes are reduced due to non-performing mining ratio, mining blocks in the Blockchain will significantly be limited too, rendering delays in transactions while usage increases.  


•   In time to come, as trends of crypto picks up, Thailand can issue BAHT COIN or UK the STERLING COIN, exactly what China wishes to do. Digital RMB, but would such crypto currencies be fully decentralized? We all have our answers. Absurd to even think of producing Thai Baht, Pound Sterling or Chinese Yuan at the cost of electricity. It is currencies in digital forms.  


KRATSCOIN is not meant for that purpose. In some opinion, apart from utilization, a crypto can be for safekeeping, an entity for keeping money while allowing easy liquidation, at a click of a mobile button, not to mention sending or transferring without the trouble of going to banks, which was the original purpose of Bitcoin to begin with. Therefore, KRATSCOIN would be better termed as Crypto Commodity, sharing similarities as Metal Commodities.  


An individual cannot use gold to make a purchase, neither can one eat gold. It can only be kept or invest in for appreciative value over time. Gold is being exampled for its scarcity which reasons for its higher value over its cousin, silver or bronze. Who or what determines the value of gold? Just like any other crypto, demand by humanity. As in all other commodities, it must also be placed in checks by governments. To put in checks, serial numbers are introduced to protect a country’s commodities outflows or illegal exports.  


Humanity made Bitcoin a reality. Acceptance by the majority members of the public made Bitcoin to what is it today with the trust they entrusted it with, or is the majority public hopping on the band wagon to make a few quick extra bucks? Whatever the reasons are, the characteristics of Crypto Currencies are only matched by the behavior of Commodities.  


SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PUBLIC:  
Every currency has its own remarkable name, design and colors. Dollars, Euros, Pound, Tugrik, Peso, Rupee, Rupiah, Dina, Ringgit, Baht and the list carries on. One thing every currency have in common - Serial Numbers.  


In any crime, investigators will firstly establish motives and mode of operation, both of which are very likely related to money. So following the money trial is a natural thing to do for investigators/authorities and it has become a common practice. Crimes require funding ie robbers need money to buy guns to carry out its robbing activities. Cutting off financing will reduce criminal activities. That’s the approach governments of the WORLD have adopted for crime fighting.  


Perhaps people do not realize this while most do not feel the pinch. Humanity tends to take life for granted until apocalypse happens. Take a minute to visualize the tallest tower in your homeland collapse into a pile of dust with thousands of casualties effecting everything else that comes to mind. Imagine a family member, just 1 is enough, is among those casualties.  


• Imagine if monetary system is not in place and drug dealers, among many, roam the earth freely distributing what can be death threatening substance to your kids. What if you are mugged of your inheritance \[items left to you by your father\] that is beyond retrieval? As for crypto enthusiast, what if your wallet gets hacked as even the mighty Pentagon gets hacked. All the above can go away if the crypto system leaves a trail for hound dogs to sniff out. Money Trail or Serial Codes Trail to be exact.  


• Citizens rely on governments and their countries to do what is best for them to lead their daily lives, flourish, advance, improve and strive but at the same time, citizens want to take away the single most important thing deemed crucial in the hierarchy of humanity from governments with additional boastful remarks such as “I transferred $400 million from one corner of the earth to another corner in a single transaction and no governments can do anything about it”.  


• In-short, to boast unregulated financial movement is to arrogantly promote crime without realizing it while challenging the world’s monetary authority. Oldest advice in the book teaches us never to pick a fight we can’t win.  


• Serial Coded Coins does not take away the financial movement freedom nor does it take away your privacy. It merely provides Authorities the necessary means needed for crime prevention and fighting. It only re-inforce security and safety.  
SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR GOVERNMENTS:  
• Governments are relentlessly trying to find new ways to keep track of crypto transactions. Crypto Currency Exchanges, just like all other Financial Institutions and Banks, are required to practice the most stringent Know Your Customer (widely known as KYC) process. The KYC is designed to provide governing agencies and authorities with information pertaining to crypto ownerships.  


• But no governments can have information on Peer-to-Peer (also known as P2P) transactions unless the government in question launch a full scale Federal Investigation on certain suspected individuals seeking Wallet Developers to unveil the ownership of certain wallet addresses. Do not forget, National and Global Security trumps Privacy Act. Refusal to co-operate under the pretext of Global or National Security will only result in an out-right ban, which is exactly what happened to Blackberry.  


• Questions to Governments – What if Wallet Developers or Crypto Exchanges shuts down which can happen for various reasons be it foul-play, sinister or forcefully under threat? What if servers are damaged and ruined? An EMP strike or a simple magnet can make it happen. Information/identities of suspected customers of such addresses shall be lost forever and along with it the Money Trial.  


• The most probable way of evading Authorities with crypto assets are developing an e-wallet for own illicit purpose. Since the cost of developing an e-wallet is relatively low in considerable cost to hiding, what can governments do to flush out these ants from the vast networks of tunnels?  


• With Serialized Coded Crypto Assets, it doesn’t matter if servers of Exchanges or Wallets are destroyed. The Serial Codes of each token/coin enables governments of every participating country to track both origin and destination by identifying records of each token/coin in wallet address. It can disappear into a cold wallet but emerging some place later yet Authorities can still detail which particular token/coin has at one moment of time been into which wallet, on what day and date.  


• If the battle of financial crimes can be resolved with a simple Serialize Coded Crypto Asset, the eradication of corruptions, money laundering, unlawful proceeds and terrorism financing will be made possible. Criminals can no longer exploit the genius creation of Sathoshi – Blockchain and Crypto-Currencies.  


• Global Security, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Money Laundering could just be excuses granting government agencies the need to have access to financial information in the Monetary System. Nonetheless, it is in the interest of every nation that capital outflow is controlled. Capital Outflow is most frequent when the economy of a country is deteriorating. In the face of an economy meltdown, monetary flow is most needed and yet citizens tend to transfer monies further away illegally from their own country in an act of selfishness. This would not be tolerated by any country. Serial Coded Coin shall prove this attempt futile.  


• In most part of Asian Countries, many crypto-currency mining operations are carried out illegally. The legality sits on thin fine line where Authorities can pin only stealing of electricity as a major concern to the respective country. Since most Power Companies belongs to the Country in one way or another, it is financially damaging to Power Producers and Utility Suppliers. Serial Codes can determine if the KRATSCOIN is mined legally or illegally making it difficult for miners or mining farms to mine crypto while avoiding making electricity payments. Will this deterrent disrupt the chain of KRATSCOIN supply? That’s not how Blockchain Tech works.  
TAXATIONS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENTS:  
• Taxation cannot be imposed on “Illegal &amp; Unlawful Proceeds” instead confiscation is enforced in many countries. Origins or proceeds of Serialized Coded Crypto Assets can be easily identified by the Serial Codes in-conjunction with the Blockchain. This exercise can evidently proof the legitimacy of the aforesaid token/coin. By “Illegal &amp; Unlawful Proceeds” also refers to crypto coins obtained via illegal mining operations.  


• Taxation on Crypto Assets are calculated on profits deriving from the sale/disposal of the crypto Assets. If we are small crypto believers, the amount of taxation rendered by Inland Revenue will be insignificant. Why risk Freedom of Life over Freedom of Small Monies. If we are big crypto believers, taxation on Serialized Coded Coins can be considered added security to your assets protection.  


• By adopting Serialized Crypto Assets, declaration is made easily possible via proof of token/coin origin via the Blockchain. If the Authorities can know where our crypto assets come from, the Authorities will know where it will disappear to. It is taxation cum insurance in one tiny sum. This added security with freedom feature will encourage self-declarations of crypto assets to Authorities and Agencies.  
PRIVACY &amp; ANONIMITY:  
• Many may be skeptical of their wealth being tracked and monitored. But in this era of technological advance society, everything we touches has our signature. Banks, iPhones, Samsung Mobiles, Google, Facebook, Whatsapp, WeChat, LINE, Viber, Facebook, Properties, Utilities. Almost everything. It is to this fact that there is a need for Privacy Protection Act.  


• As explained before, Crypto Currency Exchange KYC procedures is designed to expose the identity of Crypto Assets ownership. The Blockchain is supposed to serve as a transparent information platform. The question of privacy over Serialized Coded Coins does not exist, it does not make Serialized Coded Coins ownership any less private.  


• Ownership of wallet addresses shall always remain anonymous while the only way Authorities can get to it is through Wallet Developers by virtue of Global/National Security Threats or by a Court Order as per the Privacy Protection Act.  
SAFETY &amp; SECURITY (CODED CRYPTO VS FIAT + COMMODITIES):  
• No human mind can memorize the millions of serial numbers printed on fiat currencies. The records of Serialized Coded Coins will forever be in the Blockchain embedded within each transaction from wallet to wallet.  


• Serialized Commodities such as gold can be melted down. Diamonds recrafted. Fiat double printed. But not Serialized Coded Crypto Assets.  


• Should an accessory system be added into the KRATSCOIN Blockchain, allowing reports on criminal activity be made within the Blockchain, notifying all ledgers of certain stolen Serial Coded Coins, enabling WARNINGS and forbidding next transaction of that particular Serial Coded Coin, wouldn’t this function enhance protection. A theft deterrent function which can never be achieved with physical gold, diamonds or fiat.  
KRATSCOIN SUMMARY:  
• Most crypto currencies have not reach a level of security alert for governments. This could be the only reason why a possible ban has not been discussed. China and India has begun efforts to control or ban crypto currencies in their quest to combat capital outflow, writer’s personal opinion. The EU has stopped Libra from implementation. “A company cannot be allowed Authoring Power for issuance of currencies” quoted the governments. KRATSCOIN is fully decentralized with no ownership nor control by any country, company or individual. Once again, the beauty of Bitcoin decentralization concept prevails.  


• “There is no such thing as a world currency. However, since World War II, the dominant or reserve currency of the world has been the U.S. dollar” quoted in google.com.  


• Most countries have “Foreign Reserves” as backing to a country’s fiat currency. It is a mean of “back up” attempt should all factors above mentioned leading to the value of their currencies collapse. Then what will happen if the Country of the Foreign Reserves collapse?  


• Serial Coded KRATSCOIN belongs to no one, no country, no company and therefore theoretically shall not be effected by politics, war or global economy meltdown yet everyone, every country and every government is able to benefit from KRATSCOIN.

personalfinance,Saving in Roth IRAs to lower EFC,"Hi there. I've only begun learning about finances in the past six months and now I want to clean up my mess and I'm looking for advice. In March I put $700 in a standard Vanguard account but I didn't realize I was then suppose to choose investments. Last week I figured out how to do that and invested in ETFs. This account has earned $14.63. Is it correct that I can sell everything in this account, close it, and only pay income tax on the $14.63, and that is done when filing taxes? No other selling fees or penalties for trading so suddenly?

I opened a spousal Roth IRA with Fidelity two months ago which has $200. I set this up for automatic transfers and investments. I plan to open my husband a Roth IRA with Fidelity as well. Side question: I know the Roth IRAs have to be individual but can they be linked so I can see them at once on the website and move funds easily between either and our credit union account or possibly the Fidelity Money Mangement account if that's more convenient?

We cannot afford to max out both Roth IRAs permanently with other savings goals for the next two years. My thought is to use my husband's Roth IRA as a savings fund for his final year of college (2020/2021) since this fund will not count as an asset on the FAFSA. Previously we took student loans (total about 15k) which will be in deferment until around January 2022. We can save $1000/month total and currently I have $500/month going into our HYSA for a home maintenance project (plus EF and other longer term home maintenance needs) tentatively scheduled for this coming summer. Should I perhaps move that $5k from the HYSA temporarily into my Roth IRA before he files the FAFSA in February to lower his EFC? I know I will only be able to withdraw the contributions and not the earnings. The other $500/month (sometimes more) I have been putting as extra principle payments on our car loan which is currently $2,100 at 1.5% interest rate. This $500 is what I would start saving for his final year tuition and to repay student loans before the deferment period ends.  

After these next two years we should be able to max both Roth IRAs permanently. So does it make sense to temporarily use them as short term savings in this situation? Any potential pitfalls doing it this way? In the past we've not had a savings so I'm unsure how much his EFC will be affected. I know my questions are all over the place and thanks so much for any advice.",finance
Bitcoin,DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIAT AND CRYPTO,"•   Fiat Currency is backed by Governments/Countries itself. What determines the value of a currency is the economic health, demand, growth, political stability to name a few, of the respective country. Before 1930, most fiat currencies were backed by gold and silver.  


•   Since 1971, U.S. citizens have been able to utilize Federal Reserve Notes as the only form of money that for the first time had no currency with any gold or silver backing. This is where you get the saying that U.S. dollars are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government - quoted in google.com.  


•   What backs crypto value is purely supply and demand. The demand creation of a crypto is its sole objective. To create demand, the crypto has to have a purpose. And most purpose commonly promoted is utility. The number of ways you can utilize the said crypto. The more utilization factors the more demand there is for it.  


•   There are other ways to substantiate value of a crypto and that is to back the crypto with a 1 to 1 ratio in assets or in USD. Then the question is, how 3,000 crypto currencies in circulation be monetary eco sustainable? Can anyone imagine walking into McDonald and view a chart of 3,000 different pricing? Which also means the crypto is a payment gateway pegging against USD instead of bearing any true characteristic of a currency.  


•   A country’s currency is in its own legit form of legal tender, the only currency acceptable under financial sovereigns of a country. People in the world must be made to understand that. Retailers in Thailand cannot put up products price tags in EUROS/USD, it is illegal. It has to be in Thai Baht.  


•   It is hardly imaginable for everyone in the world to retail with a Crypto-Currencies at a rate of 7 transactions per second. When mining nodes are reduced due to non-performing mining ratio, mining blocks in the Blockchain will significantly be limited too, rendering delays in transactions while usage increases.  


•   In time to come, as trends of crypto picks up, Thailand can issue BAHT COIN or UK the STERLING COIN, exactly what China wishes to do. Digital RMB, but would such crypto currencies be fully decentralized? We all have our answers. Absurd to even think of producing Thai Baht, Pound Sterling or Chinese Yuan at the cost of electricity. It is currencies in digital forms.  


KRATSCOIN is not meant for that purpose. In some opinion, apart from utilization, a crypto can be for safekeeping, an entity for keeping money while allowing easy liquidation, at a click of a mobile button, not to mention sending or transferring without the trouble of going to banks, which was the original purpose of Bitcoin to begin with. Therefore, KRATSCOIN would be better termed as Crypto Commodity, sharing similarities as Metal Commodities.  


An individual cannot use gold to make a purchase, neither can one eat gold. It can only be kept or invest in for appreciative value over time. Gold is being exampled for its scarcity which reasons for its higher value over its cousin, silver or bronze. Who or what determines the value of gold? Just like any other crypto, demand by humanity. As in all other commodities, it must also be placed in checks by governments. To put in checks, serial numbers are introduced to protect a country’s commodities outflows or illegal exports.  


Humanity made Bitcoin a reality. Acceptance by the majority members of the public made Bitcoin to what is it today with the trust they entrusted it with, or is the majority public hopping on the band wagon to make a few quick extra bucks? Whatever the reasons are, the characteristics of Crypto Currencies are only matched by the behavior of Commodities.  


SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PUBLIC:  
Every currency has its own remarkable name, design and colors. Dollars, Euros, Pound, Tugrik, Peso, Rupee, Rupiah, Dina, Ringgit, Baht and the list carries on. One thing every currency have in common - Serial Numbers.  


In any crime, investigators will firstly establish motives and mode of operation, both of which are very likely related to money. So following the money trial is a natural thing to do for investigators/authorities and it has become a common practice. Crimes require funding ie robbers need money to buy guns to carry out its robbing activities. Cutting off financing will reduce criminal activities. That’s the approach governments of the WORLD have adopted for crime fighting.  


Perhaps people do not realize this while most do not feel the pinch. Humanity tends to take life for granted until apocalypse happens. Take a minute to visualize the tallest tower in your homeland collapse into a pile of dust with thousands of casualties effecting everything else that comes to mind. Imagine a family member, just 1 is enough, is among those casualties.  


• Imagine if monetary system is not in place and drug dealers, among many, roam the earth freely distributing what can be death threatening substance to your kids. What if you are mugged of your inheritance \[items left to you by your father\] that is beyond retrieval? As for crypto enthusiast, what if your wallet gets hacked as even the mighty Pentagon gets hacked. All the above can go away if the crypto system leaves a trail for hound dogs to sniff out. Money Trail or Serial Codes Trail to be exact.  


• Citizens rely on governments and their countries to do what is best for them to lead their daily lives, flourish, advance, improve and strive but at the same time, citizens want to take away the single most important thing deemed crucial in the hierarchy of humanity from governments with additional boastful remarks such as “I transferred $400 million from one corner of the earth to another corner in a single transaction and no governments can do anything about it”.  


• In-short, to boast unregulated financial movement is to arrogantly promote crime without realizing it while challenging the world’s monetary authority. Oldest advice in the book teaches us never to pick a fight we can’t win.  


• Serial Coded Coins does not take away the financial movement freedom nor does it take away your privacy. It merely provides Authorities the necessary means needed for crime prevention and fighting. It only re-inforce security and safety.  
SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR GOVERNMENTS:  
• Governments are relentlessly trying to find new ways to keep track of crypto transactions. Crypto Currency Exchanges, just like all other Financial Institutions and Banks, are required to practice the most stringent Know Your Customer (widely known as KYC) process. The KYC is designed to provide governing agencies and authorities with information pertaining to crypto ownerships.  


• But no governments can have information on Peer-to-Peer (also known as P2P) transactions unless the government in question launch a full scale Federal Investigation on certain suspected individuals seeking Wallet Developers to unveil the ownership of certain wallet addresses. Do not forget, National and Global Security trumps Privacy Act. Refusal to co-operate under the pretext of Global or National Security will only result in an out-right ban, which is exactly what happened to Blackberry.  


• Questions to Governments – What if Wallet Developers or Crypto Exchanges shuts down which can happen for various reasons be it foul-play, sinister or forcefully under threat? What if servers are damaged and ruined? An EMP strike or a simple magnet can make it happen. Information/identities of suspected customers of such addresses shall be lost forever and along with it the Money Trial.  


• The most probable way of evading Authorities with crypto assets are developing an e-wallet for own illicit purpose. Since the cost of developing an e-wallet is relatively low in considerable cost to hiding, what can governments do to flush out these ants from the vast networks of tunnels?  


• With Serialized Coded Crypto Assets, it doesn’t matter if servers of Exchanges or Wallets are destroyed. The Serial Codes of each token/coin enables governments of every participating country to track both origin and destination by identifying records of each token/coin in wallet address. It can disappear into a cold wallet but emerging some place later yet Authorities can still detail which particular token/coin has at one moment of time been into which wallet, on what day and date.

personalfinance,Financial Planning Resources - Taxes and Inheritance,"Hey all, wondering if anyone has come across good resources for financial planning with regard to taxes mid-career, taxes in retirement, and inheritance (coming to me, and on my death)? I know that a financial adviser is key for evaluating certain situations and products, but are there any basic primers that are worth someone's time?

At this point, I have a plan of what I expect my investments to look like over the course of my career and retirement, but am not considering taxes. I have money going into a 401k with company match, a ESOP program with company match, and I've been throwing post-tax cash into a taxable account that will hopefully get used for the down payment on a condo soon (if something comes up that I like). Also, for the condo purchase, looking for a resource to model cash flows given different scenarios of down payment values and interest rates. I've built a basic tool for this, but I'd like to use something created and managed by someone who actually knows what they're doing.",finance

politics,Megathread: Appeals Court Agrees President Trump Tax Returns Can Be Turned Over,"""A federal appeals court in New York says President Donald Trump's tax returns can be turned over to state criminal investigators.

The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came Monday. It is certain to be further appealed to the Supreme Court.

The decision upholds a lower-court ruling rejecting Trump's lawsuit seeking to block his accountant from letting a grand jury see his tax records from 2011.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. sought the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women who claim they had affairs with the president before the 2016 presidential election.

The full text of the ruling can be found [here](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-3204/19-3204-2019-11-04.pdf?ts=1572883205).

Bitcoin,Coinbase named in article about companies sharing our data to create secret consumer scores,"There was an article in the NYT about companies tracking customer activity outside of traditional consumer and credit agencies. The author claims that Coinbase is sharing information about their customers, including every time they log into the app.

Not that anyone really expected privacy when using Coinbase, but this really shines a light on some of the realities of what that actually entails.

Full text of the article:

&gt;**I Got Access to My Secret Consumer Score. Now You Can Get Yours, Too.**

&gt;*By Kashmir HillNov. 1, 2019*

&gt;As consumers, we all have “secret scores”: hidden ratings that determine how long each of us waits on hold when calling a business, whether we can return items at a store, and what type of service we receive. A low score sends you to the back of the queue; high scores get you elite treatment.

&gt;Every so often, journalists lament these systems’ inaccessibility. They’re “largely invisible to the public,” The New York Times wrote in 2012. “Most people have no inkling they even exist,” The Wall Street Journal said in 2018. Most recently, in April, The Journal’s Christopher Mims looked at a company called Sift, whose proprietary scoring system tracks 16,000 factors for companies like Airbnb and OkCupid. “Sift judges whether or not you can be trusted,” he wrote, “yet there’s no file with your name that it can produce upon request.”

&gt;As of this summer, though, Sift does have a file on you, which it can produce upon request. I got mine, and I found it shocking: More than 400 pages long, it contained all the messages I’d ever sent to hosts on Airbnb; years of Yelp delivery orders; a log of every time I’d opened the Coinbase app on my iPhone. Many entries included detailed information about the device I used to do these things, including my IP address at the time.

&gt;Sift knew, for example, that I’d used my iPhone to order chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosas and garlic naan on a Saturday night in April three years ago. It knew I used my Apple laptop to sign into Coinbase in January 2017 to change my password. Sift knew about a nightmare Thanksgiving I had in California’s wine country, as captured in my messages to the Airbnb host of a rental called “Cloud 9.”

&gt;“The heater in the room with the big couch has been running since we got here and we’re not sure how to turn it off,” I wrote on Wednesday afternoon.

&gt;“The air in the main house is really musty, like maybe there’s a mildew or mold issue,” I wrote on Thursday, then added apologetically, “Sorry to be bothering you on Thanksgiving!”

&gt;“The bathroom flooded during the rainstorm. The carpet outside the bathroom is very wet,” I wrote on Friday. “Ants are coming in from the interior wall of the house.”

&gt;This may sound somewhat comical, but the companies gathering and paying for this data find it extremely valuable for rooting out fraud and increasing the revenue they can collect from big spenders. Sift has this data because the company has been hired by Airbnb, Yelp, and Coinbase to identify stolen credit cards and help spot identity thieves and abusive behavior. Still, the fact that obscure companies are accumulating information about years of our online and offline behavior is unsettling, and at a minimum it creates the potential for abuse or discrimination — particularly when those companies decide we don’t stack up.

&gt;**How to get your data**

&gt;There are many companies in the business of scoring consumers. The challenge is to identify them. Once you do, the instructions on getting your data will probably be buried in their privacy policies. Ctrl-F “request” is a good way to find it. Most of these companies will also require you to send a photo of your driver’s license to verify your identity. Here are five that say they’ll share the data they have on you.

&gt;Sift, which determines consumer trustworthiness, asks you to email privacy@sift.com. You’ll then have to fill out a Google form.

&gt;Zeta Global, which identifies people with a lot of money to spend, lets you request your data via an online form.

&gt;Retail Equation, which helps companies such as Best Buy and Sephora decide whether to accept or reject a product return, will send you a report if you email returnactivityreport@theretailequation.com.

&gt;Riskified, which develops fraud scores, will tell you what data it has gathered on your possible crookedness if you contact privacy@riskified.com.

&gt;Kustomer, a database company that provides what it calls “unprecedented insight into a customer’s past experiences and current sentiment,” tells people to email privacy@kustomer.com.

&gt;Just because the companies say they’ll provide your data doesn’t mean they actually will.

&gt;Kustomer, for example, gave me the runaround. When I first contacted the company from my personal email address, a representative wrote back that I would have the report by the end of the week. After a couple of weeks passed, I emailed again and was told the company was “instituting a new process” and had “hit a few snags.” I never got the report. When I contacted a company spokeswoman, I was told that I would need to get my data instead from the companies that used Kustomer to analyze me.

&gt;**Thanks, California**

&gt;Most of the companies only recently started honoring these requests in response to the California Consumer Privacy Act. Set to go into effect in 2020, the law will grant Californians the right to see what data a company holds on them. It follows a 2018 European privacy law, called General Data Protection Regulation, that lets Europeans gain access to and delete their online data. Some companies have decided to honor the laws’ transparency requirements even for those of us who are not lucky enough to live in Europe or the Golden State.

&gt;“We expect these are the first of many laws,” said Jason Tan, the chief executive of Sift. The company, founded in 2011, started making files available to “all end users” this June, even where not legally required to do so — such as in New York, where I live. “We’re trying to be more privacy conscious. We want to be good citizens and stewards of the internet. That includes transparency.”

&gt;I was inspired to chase down my data files by a June report from the Consumer Education Foundation, which wants the Federal Trade Commission to investigate secret surveillance scores “generated by a shadowy group of privacy-busting firms that operate in the dark recesses of the American marketplace.” The report named 11 firms that rate shoppers, potential renters and prospective employees. I pursued data from the firms most likely to have information on me.

&gt;One of the co-authors of the report was Laura Antonini, the policy director at the Consumer Education Foundation. At my suggestion, she sought out her own data. She got a voluminous report from Sift, and like me, had several companies come up empty-handed despite their claims to have information on hundreds of millions of people. Retail Equation, the company that helps decide whether customers should be allowed to make a return, had nothing on me and one entry for Ms. Antonini: a return of three items worth $78 to Victoria’s Secret in 2009.

&gt;“I don’t really care that these data analytics companies know I made a return to Victoria’s Secret in 2009, or that I had chicken kebabs delivered to my apartment, but how is this information being used against me when you generate scores for your clients?” Ms. Antonini said. “That is what consumers deserve to know. The lack of the information I received back is the most alarming part of this.”

&gt;In other words, most of these companies are just showing you the data they used to make decisions about you, not how they analyzed that data or what their decision was.

&gt;‘It’s incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone’

&gt;My Sift file didn’t come with a credit-score-type number at the top, but many of the entries included a percentage rating as to whether the behavior was “abuse” or “not abuse,” “normal” or “fraud” or “account takeover” versus “not account takeover.”

&gt;When I told Mr. Tan that I was alarmed to see my Airbnb messages and Yelp orders in the hands of a company I’d never heard of before, he responded by saying that Sift doesn’t sell or share any of the data it has with third parties.

&gt;“We are in the business of predicting risks for particular events at particular times, for particular fraud,” he said. Sift is looking at all my online activity to make sure it’s me, and not someone trying to impersonate or hack me.

&gt;“Behind the scenes, we’re trying to create connections between fraudulent accounts,” Mr. Tan said. To score risk, the more data Sift has, the better. It’s able to use what it knows across the accounts of all its clients, so if a certain device has been used to make an order on Yelp with a stolen credit card, Sift can flag that device when it shows up on Airbnb.

&gt;“We’re not looking at the data. It’s just machines and algorithms doing this work,” said Mr. Tan. “But it’s incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone.”

&gt;I asked Mr. Tan how many people had requested their data from Sift since the company introduced the option to get it.

&gt;“Honestly, we haven’t seen much of a response,” he said.

&gt;A spokeswoman from Zeta Global, which created a portal for data requests in August, told me that 10 people have requested their data so far. “There was only data on two people,” she said. (I was one of them; the company had a record of all the comments I had made on a blog a decade ago.)

&gt;This may be because most people have no idea Sift, Zeta and the other secret scorers exist. But now you do, and you know how you can get your files.

&gt;If you submit a request to any of these companies and get back something weird, please share your experience with me at kashmir.hill@nytimes.com.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Merge 401Ks, move to IRA, or Leave As Is","Morning folks,

Over the last few years, I've started to tighten down on saving and spending habits.  I've also started to look more to the future and utilized 401K benefits offered by different employers.  I recently started a Federal job with TSP, but this job is horrendous and I am already looking to go back to DoD contracting.

I have two different 401K accounts from different employers.  Combined total is just under $20k.  I prefer consolidation, and Fidelity has overall performed better than John Hancock.  What would be the best route to take?  Move JH 401K funds to Fidelity, transfer both accounts to an IRA (Roth or traditional), or leave the accounts as is?  

Shameful I know, but I do not have an IRA account yet, but this is on my list of things to do.  Recommendations on IRA ""banks"" or whatnot is welcome as well.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Quit Job to do Grad School Full Time?,"Hi All,

X-posting to cscareerquestions and personalfinance for a range of perspectives

Background:

\- M, 26

\- Undergrad: Mechanical Engineering class of 2016. 

o GPA: 3.0

\- Started career as an IT consultant after graduation, been moving up the ladder but still in the same role

\- TCC start: $70k, now $96k after 3 years

\- Currently enrolled in an online Master’s in Computer Science program- completing the prerequisite courses this year

o GPA is a 4.0, but small data set (2 classes).

o Option to go in person or online

\- Considering going all in and completing my Master’s in order to grow technical skills and adjust my career trajectory

&amp;#x200B;

Motivation:

\- I travel a LOT for work. Which while it is ok for now (I love the points/ CC churning aspects), I do want to move to a career with no (or minimal) travel when I get married (in 1 year or so- just recently proposed) and have children (in 4-5 years at the earliest).

\- Moved from East Coast to California for work- looking to move back to be closer to friends and family.

\- Within my current role I am not as specialized as I would like to be (which is on me)- I would like to move to a role that involved technical problem-solving elements as part of the day to day work.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial Thoughts:

\- Program is 10 classes in total, with the prereqs completed (which will be the case by end of the year)

\- Continue part-time model through 2020, completing 1 course/ semester, reducing workload to 8 courses for 2021

o 4 courses in Spring 2021, Summer job/ internship, 4 courses in Fall 2021

Finances:

\- I lurk on personalfinance regularly and like to think I am in good shape

\- Debt: $0

\- Cash savings: $17k (5k in CD, 12k in High Yield savings)

\- Max 401k match + Roth  (about 55k saved between both)

\- Personal investments: 24k in Vanguard mutual funds

\- Income (after tax): about $4k/ month, $1k in stock options

\- Expenses now: fairly minimal- I travel for work during the week so do not have to work about food or transportation (I do not own a car)

o  Rent: $1k / month

o Utilities: about $100/ month

o Misc.: $2-300 / month (travel, gifts for family, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

\- Assuming I am doing Grad school in 2021 full time, what is the best way to prepare financially? Should I open a 529 for short term investments? (maybe bonds)

\- How do I begin with applying to scholarships, loans, etc? 

\- Should I double down on savings and pay for the programs in full, in cash? Since interest rates are on the decline, would it make more financial sense to leverage my money?

&amp;#x200B;

Main Concern:

\- If I look for another job now (while I am gainfully employed) I am coming from a position of leverage. Applying from grad school I may have more technical skills but will be lacking that leverage.

\- How do I leave my current company amicably, so my current manager (and prior manager, who is also like a mentor) still think highly of me and may be references if I reapply within the same company?

\- My finances now are fairly minimal (phone is paid for by company, no car, I pay for food only on weekends). How do I best prepare to manage these expenses in the future? Is part time driving for Uber/ Lyft a reasonable way to make income part time while in class?

&amp;#x200B;

Questions to Reddit:

\- Is there anything I am missing/ overlooking? Is this plan feasible, and if so, is it a good idea? Or are there alternative paths worth pursuing?

\- Has anyone here quit to do school full time for a year? If so, what has been your experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance high interest auto loan or sell and take out personal loan for balance?,"I got myself into a post bankruptcy 20% interest car loan about 18 months ago. It is a 2015 Nissan Altima with a current balance of $14,775. My fiancee and I are doing the debt snowball to get out of debt. She has 8 more payments and her Mazda CX-5 will be paid off. Our question is would we be better off to refinance the Altima to a lower interest rate and after her car is paid off double up on the Altima Payment to knock it out quicker or sell it, take out a personal loan for the difference of what we owe? We would probably be looking at around 6k to cover the difference. I do have another vehicle, a 98 Wrangler, that is paid off that I could drive but it needs about $800 worth of work to be a daily driver. Including the Altima we have about $48k in total debt between us to pay off. I'm leaning towards selling the car but my fiancee is not sure. What do you think?",finance
personalfinance,"Employer offers stock options, is it a good idea?","Employer is offering a stock program. I must buy in by the 18th this month if i want to do it.

I can buy stock at 30% discount of the current price. My employer will match everything i buy up to 1000 euros. 

Stock cannot be sold for four years. 

Ill have to pay a ton of income tax for the matched stocks and income tax on the 30% stock discount for shares i purchase. Federal, state, and social security. 33.2% total tax rate.

But 100% employer matching is really good, right? Problem is, money's a bit tight. We have only a 3 month emergency fund. If it's a good idea I could swing it by skipping on rain gutters (a maybe anyways) and ski touring gear. But i dunno if it is a good idea.

Is this program worth it? 

**Example:**

I purchase 19 shares for 1106.75 usd.

They calculate i need to pay tax on the 30% discount, so i must pay 166.56 tax, in addition for the purchased shares.

They match those 19 shares up to 1000 euro value based on the discount rate.

They calculate i need to pay tax on their full value, so i must pay 548.37 in tax for matched shares.

So i get 38 total shares that cannot be sold for four years.

I must pay 1106.75 at the end of november.

I must also pay 714.93 for tax in mid december.

I don't know how to calculate how valuable i should expect the stock to be in 4 years, or how taxes would be calculated then.",finance

personalfinance,Tax Withholdings for Job I started halfway through the year?,"Update on my last post: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dp6xz9/feedbacktips_for_intermediatenoob/)

I've made sure that my withholdings are set to 1, but I got to thinking; if I've been claiming 0 since I started at this job in July, maybe I can bump it up even more? I used the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator and received the result that I've already met my expected tax obligation, and in fact, have exceeded it by $6K.

The result is that my expected tax obligation is \~$4,027... This is puzzling to me because I assumed it would be closer to 20% for federal taxes...According to the calculator, in order to get close to zero refund, I should claim **24** on my W-4 and submit that ASAP... is this reasonable? lol

personalfinance,$20k in credit card debt - options?,"I'm trying to help my SO get a hold on her finances. I've always paid my card in full each month, nor have I taken out debt for literally anything.

Summary:

* $45k gross income, about $38k net.
* $20k on an American Express card, currently still being used for expenses and also paid on regularly. Probably around 20% or more interest.
* $20k in student loans. Unknown interest rates, some federal, some private.
* Between $3-5k on a 2015 model year car, bought new, 0% interest.

My main concern is the credit card. If it's at 20% interest, that's \~$4-5k/year just to keep it at a balance of $20k. **Would it be best to take out a personal loan for the $20k (her bank offers them at 6% and up to 20%, but she has a 750ish credit score), get the card to zero, then hammer payments on the personal loan?** Or just pay on it at 20%+ interest rate for 2-3 years?

The car will be paid off by March 2020 on it's current path. Then once the CC debt is out of the way, put all the payments from the car and CC to the student loans and finally get this taken care of.

I don't know her expenses or where her income is going at this point. I know we need to dive in there and stop the bleeding too. I have approximately $20-25k/year in expenses, so I'm projecting she could get this all paid off in 2-3 years.

Any other advice advice?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off 5.99% (amortized) home equity loan vs 10.74% personal loan,"I can't get my head around the math here, and I don't want to make an instinct or emotional decision.


I'm trying to make the smartest financial decision and want to know which of these to focus on first. I just learned (yes I should have known a long time ago) that my home equity loan is amortized the same way a mortgage is, which means that the $80,000 5.99% home equity loan I took out over three years ago is only down to $75,000 right now, which feels like a punch in the gut and means I'm paying a significant portion in interest each month on the $573 monthly payment.


On the other hand I have $10,000 personal loan at 10.74% that has a large $987 monthly payment.


I know traditionally it's advised to pay off the higher interest rate debt first, but in this case with the HEL being amortized I'm paying so much in interest per month since the loan is only three years old.


What's the best debt to focus on and pay down first? Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,[MN] I want to help a friend who has fallen on hard times but make sure I protect myself as well.,"A friend of mine has around 30k in debt and poor credit (some life plan that went awry). She works retail, no rent since she moved back with her parents. She has been turned down from debt consolidation agencies or have been given worse deals than what she already has. Even though she can pay the monthly minimums, she is bogged down by the enormous interest rate.

I want to help her out by reducing the interest rate. Can I legally lend her money with a low interest rate and also make sure she can pay me out over time? I think I would need to employ a lot of trust from my end and it can go south, turning in a complete loss for me. I know her well and I do have the means to help out. What are your suggestions on this?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your perspective and being real. I will try and take a more objective stance on this. I think I got what I need from the post.",finance

personalfinance,helping a family member get a better interest rate,"Hi guys - I have a family member who got into trouble with money - (currently attending a 12 step program for it) - one of the issues was a credit card with a balance of about 18k.   (BOA)  


I am not going to pay it - (mistake I've made before - these things have to be self-accountable) - but when she closed the account they locked her into a 15% APR rate - I feel like I can help her do a little better without taking over the payments - 401k loan isn't an option right now - I was wondering if anyone had any ideas as far as if we can negotiate better with the Credit card companies - (I also have an account I could threaten to close I guess) - otherwise it might be a personal finance loan or something out of home equity.  


I'm going to browse thru some threads - I'm not happy about the state of our personal finances - I was an incredible saver and dramatically reduced my debt before marriage but been struggling since. - multiple moves, medical, and spending issues/impulse control issues by others have left me in a bit of a tight spot, including using those pre-mentioned 401k loans  


also I've discussed some of those non-profit credit counselors - and she tried one, and they wanted freaking everything infowise, and she doesn't want to give them all that   


just thought I'd throw this out there - in fact it's something I told her I'd do to try and help her come up with some ideas

personalfinance,Pay down my starter home (going to be a rental in the future) or save for my down payment on second home?,Hi everyone. I currently owe 130k on my first home and plan on using it as a rental once my family outgrows it which will be in around 5 years. I currently make 65k and have a stay at home wife and 2 children. The interest rate on my current home is 4.25%. Would it be wise to funnel my additional money into paying off my house and then renting it out to pay it the rest of the way off or should I save towards a down payment on my future home? I will be debt free other than my mortgage payment in half a year which is when I really plan to kick it up a notch. I heard a similar situation on The Dave Ramsay show and he said to pay your home off and then sell it and use the equity to put towards your new home but I don’t see how putting the money into the mortgage would be any better if I’m just going to sell it.

personalfinance,[Debt] General advice for loan repayment options.,"Hello everyone. I'm looking for a bit of advice on some ideas I have for student loan repayment. My situation:

* I make 130,000 per year

* Recently married. She has no debt (except recent car purchase) and makes 115,000 per year. 

* I owe 128,000 in federal student loans at 6.65(?)%. My payment is just above 1,000 because it was extended (was formerly engaged and budgeted for 2 incomes and she left. Extended loan term to get by. Poor planning on my part)

* I owe about 57,000 at 8% interest in my dad's name (loans he took out for my college that I am currently paying on). 

* All other payments (house, utilities, etc) will be paid with my wife's income so I can focus on debt. 

I've definitely made some financial mistakes in the past, especially in regards to not being prepared to be a single income household. I hope to be on track now. Our plan going forward is to live off of my wife's income (easily done) and use the majority of my income to make huge loan payments every month. 

I have other small debts (small amount remaining on car payment, some money in a HELOC, and a couple of 0% interest things that are almost paid off). 

I'm just wondering if there is anything I can do to take advantage of the huge payments I am going to be making. For example, could I get a fairly high limit credit card and make the payments on there, and immediately pay it off to earn mileage/cash back? If so, what is the best card for something like that? 

I'm really looking for general advice on my situation. It's been pretty stressful for me and I am excited to finally be able to make real progress towards paying off my debt. *Any* advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"How to make the most out of liquid funds; banking, high yield savings, and credit cards.","Hello all,

I’ve got a multilevel question I was hoping some of you with expertise could help answer. For some background, I’m a 23 year old soon to be college graduate majoring in finance. I recently left a full time sales job for a low paying internship with a large finance firm. I’m expecting a full time offer from my current firm come graduation in 6 months. I am currently paying for my living expenses from my “emergency fund” where I have about 10 months worth of living expenses remaining split between a low yield retail bank checking and savings account. I carry no debt, have a credit score of 760, with three open credit cards and no installment loans on my credit history. I also have a Roth IRA I’m currently making zero contributions to, invested in zero fee index funds.

My question is how to optimize yields on my liquid funds and while preparing for a mortgage/auto loan in the near future. My current plan is to switch from my current retail bank to an online bank such as Discover (who I already have a credit card with) or Ally for their higher yields on saving accounts and large atm network for checking accounts. My confusion sets in when I consider the following alternative options: 

1. Utilizing a money market account with Fidelity, who hosts my Roth IRA, for my emergency fund. The yields on money market accounts seem to be lower than the online bank savings account. The money market account is commonly liked for its ability to have a debt card, but it seems as if transfers from an online savings to online checking account are easy and free. I just want to ensure I’m not missing something.

2. Opening accounts with a local credit union, with the unbacked assumption that business history with them will offer me better rates come time to get an auto loan and/or a mortgage. Online loans from sources like LightStream seem to offer even better rates for car loans, but again, I want to ensure I’m not missing something. My large emergency fund will be reduced to 4-6 months of living expenses come graduation when I have a stable income source. The remainder of my emergency fund and additional income will be invested in my current Roth IRA or employer 401k once it is offered to me. At that point, the returns on my savings account will not be as important as the savings will be smaller, and a better interest rate on loans will be a larger factor financially. 

3. If it makes sense to consider opening an additional credit card such as Amex Blue Cash Preferred for better rewards than the “building credit” cards I opened years ago. The idea here is utilizing it for all of my living expenses to get the added benefit of cash back and rewards points, and then pay it off in full every month from my potential high yield savings account, double dipping on returns.

4. Do nothing and wait for my professional career to begin before making any changes to my current situation.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans - Snowball method or Avalanche method,"I have two loans, both with a 6.875% interest rate (set by the government on federal student loans so I don't think it can be lowered). I'm trying to figure out the best (cheapest and quickest) way to pay these off. Both loans have accrued interest that needs to be paid off before the principal can be paid off. Right now I'm able to determine however much I want to pay since I'm already ahead of my loan payments, which I would like to continue doing as quickly as possible. I'm comfortable making payments of $700 a month for the foreseeable future. I'm having difficulty determining which method I should use, and want to make sure my math is right.

Loan A has an unpaid principal of $14,320.47 with $4,825.65 in accrued interest.

Loan B has an unpaid principal of $20,108.44 with $6,775.86 in accrued interest.

Looking at the snowball method, I'd be making the minimum payments each month on Loan B (about $116 a month) and would put the remainder towards Loan A (roughly $584 a month). Assuming my math is correct, by July of 2020, I will already be able to start having my payments eat down that principal, and after October of 2022, that entire loan will be paid off. Which then means the full $700 can then go towards Loan B. By October of 2023, I will have finished paying off the accrued interest on that loan and will have paid off the remaining balance by June of 2026 after having paid a total of $55,396.70.

If using the avalanche method, each month I'd be paying the minimum towards Loan A (about $82) and the remainder towards Loan B (about $618). In so doing, I would have paid off the accrued interest by December of 2020, and the balance by December 2023. It would then take me until June of 2026 to finish paying off Loan A. This method would run me nearly the same amount, but would be $55,538.19 ($141.49 more).

Based on the above, it seems like the snowball method makes the most sense for me, but I've often read that the avalanche method makes the most sense for student loans. Does it not matter as much since the interest rates are the same for each loan? Am I missing anything? Did I not calculate things correctly?",finance
personalfinance,Move back into my slightly too small house or sell and get a better sized house.,"Here is the scenario:
I bought a house back in 2008 (3 bedroom 2 bath) when I was single. I moved out of the state in 2010 and have rented it since then to family at a loss of about 350 per month vs the mortgage payment. I've been on the fence about either selling or refinancing it for a while, but always convinced myself I'd move back and pay it down quickly. The current interest rate is very high, 6.75%. I still owe about 86k, but Zillow and a couple relators think the house would sell in the range of 150-160. fast forward and I now have a wife and two kids. My wife was just diagnosed with a disease which typically has a periodic disability where she'll need help doing normal mom stuff. We've decided to move back so we can get help from family when she's out of action or the 6-8 times per year when I need to travel for work. I've had a good job (200k base + 200k bonus annually) but due to Bay area cost of living and frankly frivolous spending by both my wife and I we only have about 30k cash right now. My employer doesn't care where I live, but I need a dedicated quiet room at home or to rent private office space to work from. My sister in law has the same disease and has been living in my house with her husband and two kids for a few years. 

Here is my question, only part of this is financial butt I'd like advise on both parts if possible
Should I:

Move back into my house? It would be fairly small vs what we're used to at about 50% the square footage of where we are now. I could pretty easily pay the house off by early 2020 without really changing our current spending. This would leave my sister-in-law who occasionally misses or is late with rent moving into a much smaller appartment. I know this is the best financial move, but it would be super optimal in every other way. I would need to spend around 550 per month to rent an office as there wouldn't be room at home for me to work.

Keep the house and keep my sister-in-law where she is. I could buy a reasonable house in the area for between 200-220 and still not change our budget vs renting where we are.

Sell the house, use the proceeds for the down payment and buy a more suitable house.

personalfinance,Tough Homebuying Decisions,"So I have some mobility to move to a new location (contingent on having an open position to transfer to - federal job), and live in the Pacific Northwest.

My average salary is around 56k, and this year I am at 65k pushing towards 70k for the year. The extra amount I have been making has been mostly put into savings to try and get a better down payment on a house. 7k has been put in savings over the last few months from good paychecks. I don't seen this ending too soon. 

My partner currently doesn't have a big income, but has some savings from pulling out their retirement after leaving their job, not the best decision but just something that happened in the moment due to immediate health issues that came up from that job. She works from home and does freelance gigs that bring in sporadic income (basically building a business.) She is open to picking up part-time work to supplement/looking.

We viewed a condo that would cost 190k in an area that has a much higher median value for both condos and houses.  
The down payment would be 20k (2% interest) down which would be mostly covered by a small long term loan against my TSP, which currently sits at 40k. The monthly payment would be just around 1500 - that includes HOA fee and PMI.  

Buying a SFH would cost 275 - 300k+, with the average prices here being 400k+

Rent is currently about 1200 a month for a 3 bedroom 1 bath with terrible neighbors that fight all the time. Management doesn't keep up on much at all. Renting another place would push us into the range of what buying would be (1400 - 1800 on average, with a hard time finding rentals that allow our cat.)

Cost of living for us isn't too high right now. We've got a good 740 credit score. No CC debt, no student loans, and my job is steady through retirement.

Should we just push through living next to terrible neighbors for a while, and save up for a 20% down payment on a place? How about moving to a smaller town where costs aren't as high and can live better off one income? We're about 4 hours from most family members, and can move towards them. But don't necessarily want to leave the comfort of where we've been for close to 10 years. We also worry about moving toward a place with less work opportunities for my wife (she is an artist and sells work at events - there's a lot of events like this in the city we're at now.)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"My student loan grace period ends this month. I'm living in Europe for 10 months. I'm not currently making money, but have some saved. Should I begin paying or apply for deferment?","I need some advice on whether or not I should begin paying my loans.

I have an unsubsidized loan with a \~6% interest rate. It started at $9,200, and currently is around $9,600. My grace period ends this month, and I will have to make my first payment in December. I have been told my monthly payments for a 10-year repayment are about $60/month. By the time my grant ends in June, I will have paid \~$420 on my loans.

I have \~$7,000 saved. I have grant money that I am living with while I am in Europe, so my U.S. money is mostly staying untouched (with the exception of Spotify $10/mo and maybe another $20-30 for trips where my grant money doesn't work).

My problem is I am unsure if I should begin repaying my loans. I understand that the earlier I begin paying them, the sooner I will be out of debt. I also know that defering my loans will only add to the amount I owe and make me end up paying for a longer period of time.  


However, it makes me nervous to begin paying my loans because I am not actively making income. I also want to keep my U.S. money as a ""just in case"" fund if I need the money. I am also not 100% certain of when or what my employment will be after my grant ends (I don't know how important this point is since I will look for a job once I return home and I do not anticipate it being a problem. Just thought this was important to note).

MachineLearning,[R] Implementing an idea.,"Text Modulation Audio book(TMA)

​

Many people don't enjoy the traditional reading style to know the story of a book; and have replaced this monotonous style with audio books. Actors and Authors have to take out a lot of time to make an audio book. This consumes a lot of time which could be used for other fruitful activities. Some people have tried to use the text to speech tool, but that bland, robotic sound is equivalent to the reading method. TMA will not only convert text into speech, but with the help of AI it will detect the genre and accordingly add appropriate voice modulation and also some background music. It will detect the genre through some key words, for e.g if the program finds 'crime', 'murder', 'evidence' etc. in the text, it will take it as a thriller genre and if it finds the author as 'Agatha Christie' then it will know the mystery genre through the data fed into the program. This will not only save time, but will also allow readers to read books consisting of 1000+ pages(e.g Mein Kampf, IT, etc.). This will help in the field of education, by attracting more and more students towards books and help them by building their vocabulary, IQ and EQ. This will change the current scenario and make reading books a lot more interesting.",technology

I made a test transaction on Sept 6 and noticed the full $5.00 went straight to interest. But the payment after that still appeared to have charged me the full interest. I stopped over-paying my payments since I just paid more towards interest than to my balance. This is Connexus Credit Union - never heard of them until I got the loan through them. 

Is this normal? In the past, my auto loan payments paid towards the principal, not extra towards the interest. I'm not sure how to figure out if they are just ""keeping"" extra payments. If I continued to make large payments does that mean I'd end up paying more interest? I plan on paying this off in February so it's not that big of a deal. 

Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Did a Streamline refinance and old lender reported 30 days late,"So I did a streamline refinance on my FHA mortgage to get a lower interest rate.  The loan was finalized in September.  My broker said I could skip the September payment because the loan would be paid off before the end of the month.  I signed the papers with the notary on September 25th.  On September 30th my broker emailed me and told me the loan had been funded and the deed had been recorded with the county finalizing the transaction.  Then in early October I got a credit monitoring report saying my old lender reported me 30 days late for September on Sept. 30th.  

I contacted my broker who told me this was probably an error and he sent me a copy of the recorded deed with the county dated Sept. 30th and said this should be sufficient proof to submit to the old lender that the loan was satisfied before 30 days.  I contact the old lender and provide them with this document and they respond that they did not get the wire transfer for the pay off until October 1st and are not responsible for any delay by the new lender's title company and therefore it was 30 days late and would not reverse the credit report.  I have done the same refinance with the same broker in the past with no issues.  

I reached out to my broker to see if he can offer some help, but I am doubtful he can do much.  It seems the title company dragged their feet in sending the wire.  Do I have any recourse on fixing this.  I haven't disputed the report with the credit bureaus- I am waiting until I've talked to my broker and also hopefully get some advice here.  According to Transunions dispute FAQs, ""No change will be made if the creditor verifies its accuracy"".  So it seems if the old lender just says that I'm wrong and they are right, they will rule in favor of the Lender.  Thanks for any help or advice.

personalfinance,Should I target specific student loans or just pay the monthly balance?,"Graduated in May 2019 with $31,000 in a mix of federal subsidized and federal unsubsidized loans (no personal). Average interest rate of 4.4%, total accrued interest so far of $1544 ($32,544 overall debt). Currently work full time and generally make between $600-$700 a week after taxes, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more (restaurant work).

When I go into the MyFedLoan portal, it gives me the option to just pay the general balance or to target specific loans. With my current plan, it would be about $338 a month and if I were to follow it to a T, I would eventually have repaid about $40,000. Here is the breakdown of the loans

August 2015; $2,000/$4,000 (unsubsidized) $3,500 (subsidized) all at 4.29%

August 2016; $2,000 (unsubsidized) $4,500 (subsidized) all at 3.76%

August 2017; $2,000 (unsubsidized) $5,500 (subsidized) all at 4.45%

August 2018; $2,000 (unsubsidized) $5,500 (subsidized) at 5.05%

Forex,TIL: The US has been in an Economic Recession once every ten years,"I believe (at least since the notorious Great Depression of 1929-1933, not counting before) the US has fallen into recession which either took place in the within a single decade (e.g. *~~Great Depression~~* **Economic Recession** of 2007) or by spanning between two decades (i.e. Great Depression of 1929).

Some of the (notable) recessions I picked out are:

***1953*** \- where the Fed had to reassert their independence and combat inflation through tighter monetary policies in order to avoid a bubble (if only they knew what would happen later...) and more budget towards national security; it also occurred just after the Korean War (a common trait in some of the other recessions - US engaged in war plus tightened monetary spending).

***1973*** \- oil crisis plus all the niceties it brought about - especially shock to all who relied on oil from the Middle East (prices were apparently increased almost four times valued price, making this one of the highest price levels oil has been at (possibly rivaling the levels seen during the peak of US recession in 2008 with a high +$140).

***1981*** \- caused by the Iranian Revolution and fluctuations of oil prices in the 70s (particularly 1973, 1979) especially due to the incumbent Iranian regime manipulating prices and exporting far less than the world's demand.

***1990*** \- once again oil prices shock the market into Reverse gear despite head-ways been made, against other negative components influencing the economy, but at least the 90s generally turned out to be good for the economy (til 2000-2001 where a milder recession hit again, special thanks to the Dot-Com bubble going \*pop\*).

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to add that should the US survive November and December without triggering a recession, this will be the FIRST decade since at least the Recession of 1929 to NOT have any recession occur in it: why this is may be debated but at least the actions taken by the previous Administration seem to be a big factor for this prolonged delay of another recession before 2019 like was mostly believed earlier on by speculators.

personalfinance,Advice on best appraches to building wealth and paying debt off!,"I love this thread and wanted to post on here to get some advice and make sure I'm approaching this the right way. 

I'm a 28-year-old who is just moving back from being abroad for the past 4 years. I was in the Peace Corps and Graduate School abroad. I'm about to start a job in the Federal Government at the end of the month and make sure I have the best approach to paying down debt and setting up my finances. I have a lot of student debt and haven't really generated and personal wealth so any information or advice would be amazing!

**Income**: I will start at 57,000 a year, next year I will have a raise to 69,000 then 99,000 the following year. I have good career stability and benefits working for the government. I also will have 5% matching on retirement which I will max out. I do rover on the side but don't make much from this- more just enjoy seeing the dogs!  

**Costs**: Rent is 750 a month including utilities. Between food and transport, I spend maybe 600-700 a month. Still, need to take out renters insurance. Once I start working I will know this more. I don't drink or eat meat, buy most stuff second hand. Overall pretty low cost of living. 

**Savings:** Currently 2,500 in savings and want to use this as the start of my emergency fund of 3,000 

**Debt:** Between my undergrad and masters I'm about 90,000 in debt. This is a lot but hopefully manageable. 

1. Federal: $30,243 at 6% 
2. Sallie Mae: $21,506 at 8% (does not go into repayment until April of 2020 
3. First Mark services: 40,139 breakdown of loans below:

* a. $6,728.75 at 5.3% variable 
* b. $1,563.42 at 6.6% variable 
* c. $13,508.38 at 6.1% variable 
* d. $10,072.24 at 5.3% variable
* e. $2,893.49 at 8.7% fixed 
* f. $5,372.93 at 6.6% variable 

**Plan:** I plan on doing public loan forgiveness with my federal loans and then pouring most of my resources into paying off my private loans. I was going to use the avalanche method and work by the highest rate. 

My initial thought was to refinance private loans. But sofi and earnest only gave me rates of 7%. Maybe I can call and see if I get a better rate. Also, my masters was aborad at a private school so it doesn't qualify me for some other refinance options. Currently, the loans are at a better rate then I would get at the refinance. 

I'm a little at loss what to do about the private loans and how to proceed with refinancing or pay at the rates currently. The rates seem high to me but they didn't qualify me any better. (I also have a 690 credit score) 

I plan on living lean and pouring the extra money from my raises into paying off the debt. Ideally, I will be done with my private loans in 3 years. My first year I will be able to pay at lease a 1,000 a month towards debt, if not closer to 1,300. 

My thought was to refinance the First Mark loans to a lower monthly payment and then pay off the Sallie Mae as quickly as possible? Any advice or different approaches is appreciated. 

**Questions:** 

1. Is this the right path overall- should I be working harder to refinance? 
2. If the public service loan forgiveness the best method for federal loans? 
3. I've heard saving and buy a house can be a better financial approach but i'm not positive. 
4. I believe moving away from variable loans will be better in the end? not sure about this. 
5. Any advice on best banks in the USA I'm currently still with my local credit union but looking at setting up an account on ally and then getting a credit card through Chase for the travel benefits. 
6. I am also considering talking to a financial advisor- any advice on the best way to find one/ is it useful?",finance

investing,Ready to Boost Stocks: Investors’ Multitrillion Cash Hoard (The Wall Street Journal),"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/ready-to-boost-stocks-investors-multitrillion-cash-hoard-11572958800?mod=hp\_lead\_pos4](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ready-to-boost-stocks-investors-multitrillion-cash-hoard-11572958800?mod=hp_lead_pos4) 

 

Nervous investors have socked $3.4 trillion away in cash. But stocks are rising and their nerves are calming, leading bulls to view the huge cash pile as fuel that could drive markets higher still.

Assets in money-market funds have grown by $1 trillion over the last three years to their highest level in around a decade, according to Lipper data. A variety of factors are fueling the flows, from higher money-market rates to concerns over the health of the 10-year economic expansion and an aging [bull market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-did-this-bull-market-come-from-anyway-11564766200?mod=article_inline).

 

Yet some analysts say the heap of cash shows that investors haven’t grown excessively exuberant despite markets’ double-digit gains this year, and have plenty of money available to buy when lower prices prevail. That is a comforting message to those concerned about an economic slowdown yet wary of betting against a market that has punished doubters during its 10-year run.

“Cash always makes me feel good, both having it and seeing it on the sidelines,” said Michael Farr, president of the money-management firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, which is holding twice as much cash as usual. “It keeps things a little bit safer.”

Investors said the rising cash reserves reflect several worries that have become prevalent among money managers over recent months, as flare-ups in the [trade war with China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-u-s-and-china-looking-for-new-site-to-sign-trade-deal-11572530346?mod=article_inline) and uneven U.S. data sparked [bouts of volatility](https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-volatility-wagers-hit-markets-11569427758?mod=article_inline) in markets.

Many are concerned that stock prices have climbed to unsustainable levels relative to companies’ earnings at a time when the [U.S. economy is slowing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-grew-at-1-9-rate-in-third-quarter-11572438761?mod=article_inline). A popular metric pioneered by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller shows that valuations remain near two-decade highs, though they have retreated from their heights of early 2018.

 

Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at the $2 billion Villere Balanced Fund, is keeping 17% of his portfolio as cash, up from the usual 10%. Mr. Villere believes valuations have become stretched and prefers to wait for another dip before jumping in again.

“We don’t have to swing at every pitch,” said Mr. Villere, who added two new stockholdings to his portfolio when markets slid last December. “Right now, we’re struggling to find high quality at reasonable prices.”

Rising yields in money markets have been another key factor. Money-market funds through October offered an average annual return of around 1.6% this year, up from 0.02% in 2011, according to Crane Data. Sweep accounts at brokerages, the main reservoir where these firms hold clients’ cash, paid about 0.2% on average through September.

 

When interest rates fell in the years after the financial crisis, bank deposits gained market share from money-market funds because the gap between the yields on both had narrowed so much, said Peter Crane, president and publisher of Crane Data.

Money-market rates rose in response to the Fed’s nine interest rate increases since 2015 and have declined in recent months to reflect the central bank’s [rate reductions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-cuts-rates-by-quarter-point-11572458556?mod=article_inline) this year.

Higher rates, together with a comparatively high degree of liquidity, has increased money markets’ allure for investors looking to park their cash for a comparatively short period.

Some fund managers have warned investors against being overly cautious in a market that has shrugged off a range of economic and geopolitical worries over the past decade and continues to edge higher. A UBS Global Wealth Management survey of 4,600 wealthy entrepreneurs and investors showed that more than a third raised their cash allocations in the past quarter in response to flaring trade worries.

 

In total, cash holdings rose a percentage point to 27% of survey respondents’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter from the previous quarter, even as a growing number said they were increasingly optimistic on the global economy and stock performance. The cash allocation is much higher than the percentage recommended by the firm.

“There is a dichotomy in sentiment—investors are holding large cash balances in a wait-and-see mode, even though nearly 50% anticipate higher stock market returns in the next six months,” said Paula Polito, UBS Global Wealth Management’s client strategy officer, in a recent report.

The difference between combined flows into cash and bond funds relative to stocks over the past year is the greatest since 2012, after adjusting for assets under management, according to Goldman Sachs.

 

In a historical context, however, stock allocations remain large. The firm estimates that investors have about 12% of their portfolios in cash, ranking in just the fifth percentile going back to 1990. By contrast, stock allocations are at roughly 44%—equivalent to the 81st percentile going back the past three decades.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, see the cash pile as an indication that markets have plenty of fuel for more gains.

The bank’s proprietary Cash Rule Indicator, which gives a buy signal on stocks when investors’ cash balances are above their long-term averages, has been in bullish territory for the last 20 months. Fund managers polled in the bank’s latest survey said they are holding an average of 5% of their portfolios in cash. That compares with a 10-year average of 4.6%.

“We take it as an incredibly positive sign on a contrarian basis,” said Jared Woodard, investment strategist at the bank.",finance

personalfinance,Getting out from car debt,"So prior to us dating, my girlfriend purchased a car in anticipation of traveling for a new job. She's travels at least two hours a day so she is putting significant miles on it. Unfortunately, she didn't do her research and paid above value for it. Not having the greatest credit, she got a crappy interest rate (6.5%) and quickly she's become upside down on the whole deal. At this point, she owes $10,600 with a payment of $246 a month. I'm fairly positive they have gap insurance being applied so that is part of the payment. Doing the math, if she stays the current path, she has 54 months left on the loan meaning she will be paying $2706 in excess of the principle. 

With the amount of miles she is putting on the car, I'm doubting it will last another 4 years without some type of significant issue. It currently has 94,000 miles and given her staying with this job, she would average adding 32,000 more a year. The kbb personal sale value of the car is between $7000 and $9500 currently.

I'm the kind of person who gets stressed out thinking about debt itself. I've got everything paid off except my house and have followed all the rules in the Prime Directive. I know the consensus on here is to never mix money prior to marriage, so no need to hit me over the head with that. She hasn't ever asked for help and she works really hard for everything she has. 

I'm looking for any ideas about how to best handle getting her in a better situation. I've even debated paying the vehicle off myself and having her make the same payments to me for part of the rest of the duration of the loan. I see her being my future, and if that were the best option, it wouldn't drain my emergency fund to make that call. I could also live with the life lesson if things ended up not working. Refinancing could be an option with me co-signing but I'm not sure that it would get her out from being upside down on it.

Any ideas/help would be greatly appreciated!",finance

I have about 24K in CC debt across 5 cards (yeah I know don't lecture me)

Yes, I feel responsible enough to open another cc and do a balance transfer purpose only but my fear is not being approved enough and also the increase in my student loan repayment for 2020 and the increase in my discover that is about to happen this month. taking out a loan to consolidate my cc debt keeps me almost at the same interest rate and monthly payment

income is about $1250 every 2 weeks after taxes and everything else

rent is about $870

cell bills $181 2 lines includes the financing of 2 phones ($500 left on each phone) will switch to another provider to bring down to $44/month with taxes when phones are paid off.

TBH I dont like eating much so I spend about 13.44 a week on food

So my plan is the following

continue with my snowball plan to lower interest

continue with my mini multiple payments during the cycle before due date to lower interest

go into forbearance apply my $275 to lowest balance account

does this sound like a good plan? please only helpful and realistic options

TL;DR

eliminating cc debt student loan forbearance is my consideration expenses are above and below. does this sound like a good plan? No unrealistic tips on trying to eliminate this debt.

personalfinance,Advice - Rent or Buy,"So I'm in a blessed but interesting situation, and would appreciate any advice on this matter. My wife and I have been married \~2 years and have our first baby on the way . She's in the healthcare industry and I'm a CPA. We rented very cheaply until the beginning of last year, where we moved in with family rent-free. The goal of the move was to save money for a house in the bay area.

Originally, we were going to stay with family for a few more years and save up for a substantial down payment / buy a house outright. Now with the baby on the way, we are looking to move sooner. So we are confronted with the rent or buy question. Our current financials are as follows:

Cash - $330,000

401K - $180,000

My income - $140,000 base salaried, \~25% in bonuses a year

Wife's expected income once we have the child (going part time) - \~$75,000

Debts (monthly credit cards paid in full) - \~$2,000

Credit Score - Excellent (pre-approved for 3.5% interest rate for a 30 year loan and a 3% interest rate for a 15 year loan)

Average rent of a 2 bed 2 bath in my town - $2,700

Purchase price for a 2 bed 2 bath condo ($500 HOA) - $500,000

A lot of people are advising for us to buy the $800K house or $700K townhouse, due to our down payment and income. However, I come from a very poor background and am nervous about taking on a $400,000 - $500,000 loan (what if someone gets sick, if my salary goes down, etc.). Even though the mortgage on the house would be about 1/4 of our take home pay (mortgage is about $3.3K with taxes and insurance, our take home is about $11K after fully contributing to our 401Ks) and a little less than half of my take-home pay, I worry that the economy is really hot right now and my salary won't be this high forever.

My wife and I are leaning towards the condo for security, but am curious if I'm over-exaggerating the risk of the house payment in my head. Appreciate your opinions.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans - Best Strategy,"I have to begin paying my student loans off next month and am unsure what my best attack strategy should be for my federal loans

I have a loan of around 30,000 and a few options to pay:

Standard which is about a $290 payment to start

Graduated which starts at $191 and goes up

Income driven, which is somewhere in between those two, I haven't really looked at it.

My original plan was to pay the higher standard rate in hoping to pay less in the long run, I have a monthly salary of around $3600 so even tho I am trying to save every penny I can afford it.

My biggest concern is I am planning on going to grad school next fall, so I will be deferring my loans for a three year period. Which makes me think I need to focus on getting my principal balance as low as possible so I accrue the minimum amount of interest during school. As someone who is new to learning the areas of personal finance, I did not know if there was a better strategy out there. Like taking the lower graduated payment option but still pay $290 a month and have the excess target certain loan balances?

personalfinance,23yo - Requesting advice on my current/future money,"Throwaway because don’t want to have this information on my main.

**About Me:**  
23-year-old college senior graduating in May 2020 – planning on returning full-time to a company I interned with previously. I have no debt – including student debt, CC, etc. I have been fortunate enough to have interned with a few companies and have saved up the following:

**Schwab Checking:** \~$32,300  
**Roth IRA:** \~$6,400 (Grew from my initial $5,500 contribution last year)  
**Backup Checking Account:** \~$800

**Future Breakdown: (Yearly)**  
**Salary:** $63,000  
**401K:** \-$2,560 (6% - Company matches 5%)  
**HSA:** \-$3,500 (They provide \~$1,000 in credits)  
**Housing Cost:** \-$14,400 (unfortunately)  
**Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance:** \-$1,045  
**Taxes (Fed/State):** \-$12,700  
**Food Budget (@$75/week):** \-$3600  
*This doesn't take into account car insurance and smaller expenses because I am unsure of them right now.*

**Future “Disposable” Income (Based on the above breakdown):** \~$25,000/year or $2,100/month

***Side-note:*** *Company funds pension @ 11% of salary (\~$7300)*

**My Questions:**

1. **What should I do with the money in my checking account right now?** *My Schwab only makes between $5-$10 every month so I feel at the very least I should move most of this somewhere to maximize my gains, I have considered depositing this year’s maximum into my Roth which would leave me with about $27,000 in my checking. I am planning to do a little bit of traveling after graduation which may eat up another few thousand. Many of the forums I have read through have said to have both a savings and an emergency fund prepared so I’m not sure if I should just hold off on the Roth this year so I can have both of those.*
2. **What do you suggest I do with my future disposable income?**  *I am likely to have other reoccurring monthly expenses (internet, phone, etc) so I really don't think I'll be able to contribute much to my Roth next year. I want to be able to have fun and spend some money but I’m not sure if I further save a portion of this income. Are the contributions I’d be making to my 401K and HSA (I know this isn’t a traditional retirement account, but I plan on treating it like one) enough for retirement? (taking pension into account as well)*

The thought of contributing another $6,000 to my Roth next year scares me because that’s three months’ worth of income which is why I’m slightly tempted to do it this year. Everything I’ve learned about finances has been from the internet so I’m hoping I can get some solid advice here!",finance

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage or save for college (or neither?),"Greetings personalfinanciers, I have had the good fortune to come into some money, and I'm debating what to do with it.

My wife and I are both working and have good jobs. Our retirement is adequately funded and our 401k annual contributions will be maxed out. There is some uncertainty around my wife's job as her company is being acquired. She would not have too much difficulty finding something else but it may take a while as she's somewhat specialized. 

We have 2 children, 14 and 16, but unfortunately we do not have a lot saved for college.

Our only debt is our mortgage, which has 7 years left to run at an interest rate of 2.99%.

The windfall is employment related and I have set aside enough to pay taxes on it (in a high yield savings account). 

I'm considering paying off the mortgage. This could be done if we use all of the after-tax windfall and dip into our emergency fund. This would deplete the fund by about 50% (leaving 3 months of expenses instead of the 6 we have now). However, as we would no longer have a mortgage, this could be replenished relatively quickly (and the overall amount needed would go down due to reduced monthly expenses). The thought of being debt free is very, very appealing to me.

Alternatively, I could put the money in a relatively safe short term investment and earmark it to help pay for my kids college. It would be about 2 years tuition for each of them or 4 years for one of them if the other one pisses me off too much (joking!). Depending on where they go, of course. Of course, if we didn't have a mortgage, we'd be better able to help pay tuition when the times comes also.

Opinions welcome please. I'm aware this is a nice problem to have, I am very fortunate.",finance
personalfinance,Discover Card has refused to give me back my deposit for over a year. What are my options?,"Okay. So on the brilliant advice of this very subreddit, two years ago to improve my credit I applied for a Discover card of the secured variety. Gave them a $200 deposit. I used the card dutifully, small purchases, paid off, improved my credit score, all things good.

Last year, in September 2018, I got a letter informing me that because I'd been such a good customer with the card, they were refunding my $200 deposit and raising my credit limit to $500 (from $200). I was ecstatic. 

Two months passed. I did not receive my deposit. I called them in November; oh, how odd you didn't get your check, they said. Weird. They have to take a couple of weeks (!!) to double-check I didn't deposit the check and was scamming them but expect a new check in about three weeks. Fine.

Nothing. For two more months. I call again in January. Same deal. Oh, we have to check it's not a scam, wait three weeks or so. Fine.

I had the same conversation every two months until it hit *September 2019*, of this year, at which point I was fed up. I am an extremely patient person who believes in not yelling at call center employees, but a *year*!? I finally demanded a manager and told them this whole story. I got someone quite high up. 

She said, to my surprise, that I am not the only person who has not received their deposit check. That part of this whole thing is the weirdest part to me, by the way - I get paper statements from them at my address, every single month. My address in their system is clearly correct, so not receiving the deposit check is ludicrous. And apparently is a *known* issue, one they're...not fixing?! 

Anyway. She wanted to send me out *yet another* check, which I adamantly refused. We went back and forth - ""that's just the way it's done"", etc - I was adamant, these checks are clearly not getting to me and I no longer care why. Just either put the money directly into my accoutn - which is linked with the Discover card already for payments - or put it towards my balance. During that year I'd had some hardships and had hit the credit limit of $500, which is sad for my credit score, but shit happens. I had already planned to put the unexpected $200 windfall towards my debt as it is. 

So this lady speaks to *her* managers and reassures me that they've made special arrangements to deposit the money directly into my bank account, that it's a special circumstance, they're really going out of their way. Woohoo yay.

That was in SEPTEMBER. If you'll notice, it's November 2019 now and I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED MY MONEY.

I'm kind of at my wit's end. I can certainly call back again and yell more, or something, if that would help, but my main point in posting here is that when I do call back I want to have all the information possible. So: 

What are my options here? Because at this point I want to demand that they cancel my entire debt. I have *never* been late on a payment through all this debacle, never stopped paying at least the minimum if not more each month. What are my options? I want to know, when I call back, what I can say are my legal avenues. I want my goddamn $200. It has been over a year. That is a ludicrous amount of time for this to go on, and frankly I shouldn't have to keep following up on this. 

So. What are my options? What should I say during the phone call, and quite frankly what can I threaten them with, in terms of legal avenues?

Forex,Question For Fundamental Traders,"This may sound silly, but I don’t know where to get historic interest rate data to go back far enough to check this - thus I bring this to you. 

Typically a rate hike will signal strength, and vice Versa. Well, that being said if there is an interest rate differential, ie usd being stronger/higher than the EUR, than would that not typically be enough to drive the weekly/monthly  trends? I know news can thrust the market in various ways, but if it is more profitable (from an interest/swap basis) to hold one currency over another, wouldn’t that be enough for the banks to choose which direction to trade?

Again, seems to simple of a question, but I do know there are many traders on hourly/daily charts that will ONLY trade in the direction of swap. 

Just interested to see what the sub thinks!",finance

personalfinance,Looking to improve credit score / home loan,So my credit score is ranging in the upper 600's.

I was able to secure two fair-apr auto loans and have been paying those on time monthly but I had such trouble finding a new credit card to approve me.

Banking,Bank diverted unreleased estate funds into closed account because beneficiary owed money to them,"This concerns my Great Uncle's estate, in which my older sister and I are beneficiaries. The estate is still open and we have not received any money or property yet. We first had tons of issues getting super old war bonds (his deceased brother was the original beneficiary on the bonds) redeemed. We finally got the Gold Medallion signature and sent them to the Treasury, which all took months getting it sorted out. Our executor and law clerk had filled out the redemption forms with \*only\* the estate account number on them. The executor was told to keep an eye on the estate account and let our lawyer know when the Treasury sent the funds from the bonds. She waited and waited and never saw any deposit. So, the law clerk called the Treasury and they confirmed the sent the deposit in September. Then they gave the executor the account number in which the bonds were deposited. It was not the estate account. At first, it was believed it was a typo and the funds went into some random person's account. And then the bank was contacted. The funds were deposited into a closed account of my older sister's. She hadn't used this account for 2 years. The bank also took the money she owed them for overdraft fees (it was $400) out of the deposit. The bank explained they ran our social security numbers when they received the deposit. And since my sister had a debt to them, they diverted the funds into her closed account so they could offset the debt. My sister immediately went to the bank and transferred the remaining funds into the estate account. Everyone but the bank was bewildered by this. My sister was not contacted, nor our lawyer.

We were wondering if this is standard practice, as the money has not been released to us at all and still legally belongs to the estate. The bank already told us they are not giving the $400 back. Obviously, we have a lawyer already, so I don't need any legal advice but it just seemed insane to me that a bank would do this. Is this worthy of filing a Federal Reserve complaint? The $400 isn't a huge deal but we lost 2 months of time and now we will owe more money to our lawyer for the extra work they had to do.",finance
personalfinance,Short term refinance of high interest auto loan or wait?,"A year ago I had to purchase a new car quickly because my old was failing and couldn't be fixed quickly or cheaply. I attempted to purchase a Tesla model 3. My finances could easily handle it, but a 9 year old bankruptcy was still showing on my credit report, I had just closed on my house, and I had no history of a large fixed loan (only revolving balances). So I was denied. 

The new mortgage and multiple inquiries had a short term negative effect on my credit to point of when I have up on the electric car my score dropped about 40-50 points causing a high interest rate for the cheap car I bought. I only bought the cheap car out of immediate need and as a placeholder until my credit rebounds.

Current loan; 61 months remaining, $14,700 left, 11.09%. some time in the next year I plan on trading in the car on an electric. Currently upside-down on the loan by 4-5k. Planning on paying extra on loan so as not to be upside-down when trading in.

Would refinancing for the short term for a lower interest rate be worth the hot to the credit score for extra inquiries and shorter agree of credit? Or are the potential interest savings worth it?",finance

personalfinance,"Should I sell my car, or just pay it off?","Hello!
I know this question has been asked a lot on this sub, so I'm sorry if this is super repetitive.

I'm having a really rough time trying to figure out if I should sell my car or just keep it and pay it off.
I'm really interested in financial Independence, but I feel like my car payment in my car insurance is holding me back in the sense that I could be saving more if I sold it off to buy a different car.

I have a 2016 Hyundai Veloster, Base 3D coupe. I bought it for around $16,000. All equipment is base, no mods. 
Has about 55 to 60,000 miles on it.
Very good condition, reliable, but it's a bit impractical mostly because of the three doors instead of four, and in the winter it's really hard to drive because of snow.

It also has a dual transmission, which I do not use.

My payment is 265.00, 3% interest rate.
Insurance is $130 a month.

I have about $11,600 left on the loan, Kelley blue book estimates that my private party value is $10,000 to $12,000 roughly, but trades in at only $8000 to $9000... So my car is upside down if I decided to trade it in, so I would most likely go private sale.

Would it be worth it to sell it and get something more practical? I'm interested in a hybrid or electric car. Or something more basic like a Honda. 
Also, this is super dumb probably, but I hate the credit union I have my loan with, they suck. The process of paying down my loan every month is a big hassle, because they're not the most technologically adapted it is just super inconvenient.

Or should I just stick it out and pay off the loan? I've gotten mixed advice, so I'm turning to the internet.

investing,"401(k) contribution limit increases to $19,500 for 2020; catch-up limit rises to $6,500","IR-2019-179, November 6, 2019

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced that employees in 401(k) plans will be able to contribute up to $19,500 next year.

The IRS announced this and other changes in Notice 2019-59 (PDF), posted today on IRS.gov. This guidance provides cost‑of‑living adjustments affecting dollar limitations for pension plans and other retirement-related items for tax year 2020.

Highlights of changes for 2020
The contribution limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan is increased from $19,000 to $19,500.

The catch-up contribution limit for employees aged 50 and over who participate in these plans is increased from $6,000 to $6,500.

The limitation regarding SIMPLE retirement accounts for 2020 is increased to $13,500, up from $13,000 for 2019.

The income ranges for determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), to contribute to Roth IRAs and to claim the Saver's Credit all increased for 2020.

Taxpayers can deduct contributions to a traditional IRA if they meet certain conditions. If during the year either the taxpayer or his or her spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, the deduction may be reduced, or phased out, until it is eliminated, depending on filing status and income. (If neither the taxpayer nor his or her spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-outs of the deduction do not apply.) Here are the phase-out ranges for 2020:

 

For single taxpayers covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $65,000 to $75,000, up from $64,000 to $74,000.
For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $104,000 to $124,000, up from $103,000 to $123,000.
For an IRA contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the couple's income is between $196,000 and $206,000, up from $193,000 and $203,000.
For a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.
 

The income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA is $124,000 to $139,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $122,000 to $137,000. For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $196,000 to $206,000, up from $193,000 to $203,000. The phase-out range for a married individual filing a separate return who makes contributions to a Roth IRA is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

The income limit for the Saver's Credit (also known as the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit) for low- and moderate-income workers is $65,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $64,000; $48,750 for heads of household, up from $48,000; and $32,500 for singles and married individuals filing separately, up from $32,000.
Key limit remains unchanged
 

The limit on annual contributions to an IRA remains unchanged at $6,000. The additional catch-up contribution limit for individuals aged 50 and over is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $1,000.

Details on these and other retirement-related cost-of-living adjustments for 2020 are in Notice 2019-59 (PDF), available on IRS.gov.

personalfinance,Adult student trying to figure out financing nursing school + daycare,"After years of working in the medical field for barely above minimum wage, I finally have all my ducks in a row to start  nursing school in January. I have chosen an inexpensive local hospital program, and received advanced placement so I will finish with my ADN in 18 months (May 2021). I got my financial aid package today and the federal loans that I'm eligible for will barely cover tuition and books (much less fees, uniform, other expenses etc.). I know that this is subject to change next year, but I am going on the assumption that the award for FASFA year 2020-2021 will be similar. We are making ends meet with my husbands income alone right now, but barely. 

My biggest concern, however, is how to pay for childcare. My son is in Kindergarten and I think we can manage our schedules so that we won't need before/after care for him. But my 3 year old daughter will need to be in full-time daycare during this time. We are in a city with no family nearby. The cheapest daycare I can find for her is through the YMCA and is $220/week (we are in NY, childcare is not cheap). Assuming we don't use it during the summer, that's around 65 weeks of care or $14,300.

I'm going to preface this next part by saying that we are EXTREMELY RESPONSIBLE with credit. We never carry a balance, pay in full each month, and have several credit cards that we churn for points/cash back. I know there are some Dave Ramsey followers in here that are anti-card. We are not against them because we use them properly and budget every dollar. Just wanted to put that out there so people didn't think I'm planning on falling down a slippery slope here. I have a  NFCU credit card, $24,700 limit, 7.99% APR.  As i'm looking into financing private loans for the childcare piece, the rates on everything i'm seeing starts at higher than that. Would it be reasonable for me to put our childcare expenses on credit while I'm in school with the intention of using it like a private loan? 

 Job placement for the school is historically 100% and nurses are in high demand in our area. I will be able to put a large portion of every paycheck towards the card as soon as I start working, as we can continue to live off my husband's income. The low end of average salary in my area is in the $50k+/year range so I should be able to pay it off well within a year of completion. 

Thoughts? Are there other financing avenues that I'm not considering? I know I'm not the first adult student that has had to go through this.",finance

investing,Has China's relentless housing boom finally peaked? Tier 1 cities starting to show a decline in prices and people are furious.,"**TL;DR: Bad debt coupled with an economic slowdown is starting to crack China's relentless housing boom.**

I was prompted by [this article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-housing-market-is-finally-cooling-some-homeowners-are-furious-11572949806)
___
A lot of this post is going to be plagiarized from /u/cbus20122 who did the real DD on China's insane private debt load, but I wanted to add a little bit to it and also get some discussion started.

___

For those unfamiliar I thought I'd lay this out starting with how the current housing market came to be and layout the events that appear to be leading to some potential issues for China's housing market.


**Want to be treated as an adult? You need a house**

Rapid urbanization through relocation of farmers and other rural Chinese combined with incredible social pressure to purchase a home has fed the incredible real estate boom China has experience over the past several years. 

**Speculative investing leads to empty houses and poor construction**

Additionally due to monetary controls by the Chinese government and the housing boom real estate has been by far the best and biggest investment for Chinese. This has led to explosive construction and also [The highest vacancy rate in the world at 22%](https://www.statista.com/chart/16137/home-vacancy-rate/) as people by second, third and fourth homes in speculation. Additionally this rapid growth decreased the already lax oversight on construction quality and materials leading to dangerous shortcuts and an unknown number of buildings being [constructed using sea sand concrete, which could cause buildings to collapse in a few decades](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1191896/shenzhen-construction-hold-after-alert-over-cheap-sand-concrete)

**""Prices only go up, so insane prices are okay""**

Because of the social pressure to buy a house and a belief that the longer you wait, the more you'll pay has led to many Chinese to pay prices that would be inconceivable anywhere else in the world (relative to their income). Many Chinese are spending over half of their gross income on mortgage payments and scraping together downpayments from friends, family and online financing. Housing in the [largest Chinese cities has reached 23x price to income ratio](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2181808/why-chinas-housing-market-bubble-wont-burst-any-time-soon) or over twice as high compared to cities like NYC and Tokyo.

**Private debt levels have reached scary proportions**

This is where I'll leave it to /u/cbus20122 and [their detailed explanation on Chinese debt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b74o1y/china_has_had_the_fourth_largest_credit_bubble_of/ejpgas0/) The TL;DR version however is China is reporting that total credit to the non-financial sector is 32.58 trillion dollars (USD) but there is also 37.78 trillion USD of credit in ""shadow banking"" (I'm assuming these are the private loans) for a grand total of 70.35 trillion in debt. Given their reported (likely inflated) GDP of 12.238 trillion this gives a debt to GDP ratio of 574%. /u/cbus20122 suspects that this is a conservative estimate though and the real number is closer to 800%. it is also pointed out that this debt bubble is multiple times larger than anything seen in history including the great depression (230% debt to GDP ratio).

**Bad debt, and defaults are becoming a problem**

[Almost 5% of all lending in China is in default, and bad debt has climbed 10% over the past 6 months.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-s-mountain-of-bad-debt-climbs-10-in-6-months) China has had to nationalize several smaller banks due to no other banks wanting to buy the bad debt. The Chinese government is urging major banks to dispose of bad debt, ""Yet bad debt continues to rise as loans go sour faster than banks can dispose of them. Defaults on corporate debt topped 80 billion yuan by late August, on track to beat the full-year record of more than 120 billion yuan set just last year.""
While China is trying to get rid of bad debt, they are also trying to fight a slowing economy and [have cut the required reserve ratios in order to free up money for additional loans](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-rrr-cut/china-cuts-banks-reserve-ratios-frees-up-126-billion-for-loans-as-economy-slows-idUSKCN1VR13X)

**Turns out, housing can go down**

...and people's reaction shows utter disbelief. Just this week the WSJ reported that [housing prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou have all been dropping month-over-moth for the past three months.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-housing-market-is-finally-cooling-some-homeowners-are-furious-11572949806) some people suddenly have found themselves underwater on houses that haven't been constructed and they are outraged (in China houses are typically sold during the planning phase). 

**Outside pressure is increasing**

Between Hong Kong, the trade war, and a slowing global economy China is feeling a lot of pressure. That said China is unlike any other market and they have been able to maintain this far longer than most have speculated so it is impossible to say if this is the beginning of a larger bubble burst or if it is just a minor speed bump.

*The main questions that come to my mind now are if prices continue to drop and more people find themselves underwater how will the public react?

personalfinance,Should I contribute to a Traditional IRA instead of Roth?,"I've been trying to follow the flow chart, but the flow chart says to evaluate the merits of contributing to a traditional vs Roth IRA based on my financial situation.

I'm going to earn about $85200 in wages, bonuses, and bank interest in 2019. From what I can understand, IRA income limits are based on MAGI, which can be lowered with 403b and HSA contributions. So, if I contribute $19k to my 403b pre-tax and $3k to my HSA, does this effectively reduce my MAGI to $63200, thus making me eligible for the full $6000 deduction for a traditional IRA since the MAGI limit is $64k?

This sub seems to always recommend Roth, but in my case, should I go with traditional to save 22% of $6k in Federal taxes? I figure that it'd be pretty hard to get to 22% effective tax rate in retirement, plus I could always convert some to Roth if I ever retire early or lose my job.

personalfinance,Should I roll over traditional 401k plans to roth IRA?,"Hello,

My question is:  Should i rollover my ex companies traditional 401k plans into my roth IRA?

Backstory:

Thanks to this lovely subreddit, I'm starting to get my finance in order for retirement.  I'm 35 yo and  in the 22% federal income tax bracket.   I just got a new job recently and I'm still in the 22% but towards the upper limits now.  I have a few traditional 401k's from my previous companies laying around (&gt;!\~30k or so!&lt;) and just opened a Roth IRA this year (which I've maxed out already and wish i started when i was 25yo).  Should I take the tax hit now on the traditional 401k's and roll them over to my Roth IRA as I'll be moving to higher tax bracket later in a couple of years.  Or is there any other suggestion?  Consulate all my traditional 401ks?  Move all my traditional 401ks to IRA 401ks?  Or is there something i'm not seeing or thinking about.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my Federal and Private student loans?,"Sorry if this isn't enough info to paint a picture of my current situation. I'm about $44K in student debt making about $70K a year. About half of that debt is through Discover at 8.5% interest rate and the rest are smaller federal loans with an average interest rate of 4%. I've been looking into debt consolidation and through earnest I could get a variable APR of 5.59%, extending the terms of the loans to 20 years and the monthly payments would go from around $630 to $300 a month.

personalfinance,Owner of my place is offering to sell me the place with him as the bank financing me.,"My regular account is a name that is too easy to figure out my real identity and I don't need people knowing my business.  


So I've been living in a small apartment that's part of 4 apartments in one house situation. I live in a very popular tourist destination and I work closely in that industry so the location is very helpful for my job.  


The owner of the building doesn't live in the same state (USA) (FL) but he comes here for about a month or two a year to take care of the property and enjoy FL. One of the tenants royal f'ed his apartment so the owner had to spend the last 3 weeks redoing the entire apartment but he's done with this absentee rental thing. He decided to sell the property and he already has some interest in it before even getting a price, but he should have a solid one tomorrow. He said it's likely to be around 500k. He told me he would love for me to be the person to buy the property and he said if I came up with 20% he would hold the title and I'd make payments for 20 years, just like a regular mortgage, except through him, so cheaper than a bank and he wouldn't go through all my stuff, he knows me and he knows the rentals can take care of the payment and then some. 

The problem is I've only got about 5k cash in hand, and I can sell my magic cards to a shop for at least another 5k (rip, I'd get more like 10k if I sold them individually on ebay. Side question: Anyone know how that kind of income works? I've been saving as best I can for a long time, I'm not making some 100k a year. I've just had my collection for a long time while adding a couple of opened packs here and there.) One tenant is related to me and he said he would be willing to pay a years rent in advance to help me purchase the place (10k). I'm still not close to the possible 100k (I can probably safely assume it will be less since we are taking the regular real estate agent fees off the top in my favor since it would be all decided between us (yes I'll get a lawyer for the actual purchase and such).  


I went to wells fargo and they told me since I couldn't put  a lien on the house I couldn't get a mortgage and I can't use the rental income as reported income to get a loan with that. The cheapest place in this area listed is 1k/month. My income is mostly cash, I promise everyone who assumes I don't pay my taxes, I do. Every time I say that it's the first thing people say, just cutting it off there. The problem is I don't make a very livable amount, I live with my girlfriend, we live frugally and I make a decent amount helping people move or other side jobs. The problem here though is I don't have a company logo to prove my income, it's all written by hand in a notebook. Either way, I may be able to quality for the personal loan but I'm at 764 credit score, if I apply for too much and get denied I could fall from excellent to good.  


I have only gone to one bank but some people said I should try some smaller banks. I don't know exactly what I need to know, mostly does anybody have any ideas for types of loans that would work? Where to look? Who to ask? This kind of opportunity doesn't happen often and I know a bank wouldn't give me a mortgage for 500k because they won't let me count the rental income as being enough.  


I don't expect to make much money on this until it's paid off in 20 years but it should at least let my rent payments go to myself in a way, as opposed to anywhere else I'd go and rent.",finance

personalfinance,Balance transfer credit cards,"Hello everyone!

So I just got married this past June and I made some not so smart decisions and charged way to much on my 2 credit cards. Also... amazon! Ugh. 

A little more backstory: I had refinanced my federal student loans through a company 5 years ago and recently found out that I was pretty much scammed. I had agreed to refinance with them (stated that they were from the department of education) because they told me that all my payments would go towards the principal and the interest would be forgiven after 10 years of payments. This was a lie. They ended up being a third party company that did actually pay my loans (interest only) and kept a $35 service fee every month. Here’s where things went really south. I recently got a letter from my loan company (didn’t even know this company had my loans) that stated that my loan was about to go into default because it hadn’t been paid since October of last year. They worked with me and I am now paying them directly and also now owe $1,000 more than I refinanced 5 years ago. This destroyed my credit. I went from having a high 700 credit score down to 600. Because of this my 2 credit cards raised my interest rates through the roof!!! At the time I was making purchases for the wedding I had no idea this was going on.  The loan company worked with me and they put my loans into deferment dated back to October. This brought my credit score up to about 660 and I’m an now almost at 700. 

I want to figure out away to get these credit cards paid off (haven’t charged to them since) but with the interest rates being so high I can only afford the minimum payments. (Especially since I’m now stuck paying the full balance of my student loans that I had thought were being paid). I pay almost $500 a month on student loans alone. I want to get these credit cards paid off quickly so I can focus more on the student loans. 

What would be the best route to take? A balance transfer card offering no interest for a year or more or getting a loan from the bank?

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science this May and I am turning 23 next week so I'm trying to regroup and figure out how to approach my finances with my student loan grace period ending. My credit score is above 700 and my financial situation is as follows.

\- Expenses: Rent $825, Utilities $150 (I live in a 4 bedroom house and our bills have been this high for 2 months in a row), Internet $11.25, Monthly bus pass $41.25, Groceries/Ent/Shopping $300ish, and I might have to start paying my phone bill $50. I have a cat and buy a $15 bag of food and a $15 box of litter which lasts about 2 1/2 months.

\- Health Insurance: Weekly deduction $48.81, about $200 a month. I can go more into detail of my coverage if anyone wants to know.

\- Net Income: Weekly pay $522 (after HI and taxes)

Monthly Expenses: $1,380 or $1,430 with phone (rounded up), Monthly Net Income (4 paychecks): $2,088

This is my debt:

\- $31,717 Federal Loans (avg 4.5% interest), I applied for an IDR plan but don't know my min payment yet. Hopefully it will be $109 to start. I've applied to consolidate these to make the payments simpler.

\- $10,744 Perkins Loan (5% interest) with a min monthly payment of $131 which can't be brought down even due to ""financial hardship."" My first payment is due April 1st, 2020.

\- $520.08 Credit Card (22.74 % APR) I've had this card since 2016 and it was maxed out since November 2018 at $1,300. I was making the min payment of \~$35 but started paying $150 a month when I got a better job to pay it off faster, I just made this month's payment.

I have an entry-level job and have been there for almost 6 months and will be eligible for a 401k. However, I do not plan to stay with this company for long term as the pay is not enough and I'm looking for better opportunities.

36 years old, recently converted from contractor to federal employee (ultimate job stability, and with a group not subject to furlough!), $100K gross salary, very low health insurance costs, car paid off and in good shape, $200K total in retirement funds, $250K in bank or liquid investments, no debt, credit card usually just $600-800 a month and paid in full each month.

The main constraint I have is that I work downtown and driving isn't really a viable option, so I want to be close to the local public transit. I also don't want a high-rise building, and a townhouse would be ideal. I'm single currently, but don't like to live by myself, so I have been considering getting a 2-3 bedroom place that would both allow me to have tenant roommates who could pay a good portion of the mortgage (and yes, I'm aware that would be taxable income, aside from some business expense deductions) and to be a place for if/when I do settle down.

Places that meet those needs seem to be going for around $600K in the areas I would want to live, which I know I can afford, but I don't know if I would be stretching myself too thin. I can get a great rate on a 15/15 ARM through my job (basically the same rate as a 15 year for the first 15 years) that makes it even better, under 2.9%.

Cash price for car 1: $22,800 all in (significantly cheaper than any other dealer in the area)

3 years at 1.9% OR 5 years at 2.9%

Option 2:
Car 2 (slightly more of an upgrade than car 1): 
Cash price: $23750 all in

My MAGI for 2019 will be around 60k, so I could benefit from avoiding 22% federal taxes now.

I should do a Roth IRA instead so that at least my earnings are tax free right?

Debt: 

\~185K in debt all subsidized/unsub loans from undergrad and medical school with the highest interest rate of 6%. 

 \- Rent $700/month

\- Car Loan $400/month - will be done in the next year

\- 403(b) reaching the max percentage, need to put in 4% for the hospital to max 2%

\- Saving $200/month towards emergency fund 

\- No CC debt, paid off full every month. Including food, gas, etc

At the end of the day, I am able to put $1,000 towards my student loans every month. They are currently in grace-period and so I am putting all $1k towards my highest interest loan while the remaining loans accrue interest. When its time for repayment I will be under the REPAYE program and will have a min payment of \~$400, the remaining $600 will go towards the highest interest loan. 

At this point, I feel like my total loan amount is comparatively less than my co-interns or other residents/physicians in the field that it is reasonable to try and pay it off before the 10 years for PSLF. 

If I do plan on paying it off, should I just refinance my loans then for a lower interest rate and when should I do that ?

personalfinance,HYSA vs Vanguard MMF,"Hi everyone,

Hoping y'all can help clarify a few things for me. I currently have \~30k in savings in a brick and mortar bank account. After doing a bit of poking around here, it's clear I should be moving this somewhere that has better interest rates. I currently have a Roth IRA through Vanguard and am reading I can open a general investing account through them and invest in VMMXX that has 1.85% compound yield. Alternatively, I could open an online savings account with a bank such as Ally and get a 1.8% yield. From what I understand these are pretty similar in liquidity and return. Wondering if there are any big advantages / disadvantages of going with one over another? My plan is to use this account as a savings for a house 5-10 years down the line.

I'm 26 making \~50k/year if that makes any difference. Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Builder Credit vs Lower mortgage interest rate?,"First time homebuyer here purchasing a new build in a masterplanned community.

The builder’s preferred lender is offering $6.5k towards closing with an interest rate of 3.875%

I talked to a broker and he says he can match the preferred lender OR offer 3.5% with no credit.

The loan amount is 376k. Looking at mortgage calculators, that comes out to $28k over the life of the loan. The monthly payment with the lower rate is $80 less, so that makes it about 7 years to break even with the credit? Are there other things that I’m not seeing?

What are the pros/cons of taking the credit vs a lower interest rate? Assuming that we will stay in the house for at least 10 years. Would it be better to take the lower interest rate? If it’s sensible to do so, we’ll probably make extra payments on the mortgage and pay it off before 30 years.

Thank you for any advice!",finance

Ive been suffocating in working just to break even at $3k/month (not even enough leftover to pay income taxes) and eventually stopped paying debt bills after being told by a financial advisor that it would take me 37 years to pay off my debt if I continued. But to top things off a drunk driver hit my car 2 weeks ago and I lost my job shortly after. This was my wakeup call to consider filing chapter 7 bankruptcy.

My situation:
I have no valuable assets other than my car that I finally paid off recently and luckily is still in my lienholders name until I get it updated at a local title office.

Need advice/help:
Ive never filed bankruptcy before, and really in the need for help/advice/tips from someone that has gone through this process before. Ive done research on how to go about the process and gotten quotes from bankruptcy attorneys ranging from $5k to $7k but they told me even if I were to pay the legal fees, theres no guarantee Id even get approved.

If you don’t have a degree, government work is even better! 

Those that only have a high school diploma or less will make 53% more total compensation then the private sector on average! That’s 34% more in wages and a whopping 93% more in benefits.

The myth that you make more in the private sector is straight up wrong. In aggregate federal workers make 17% more compensation than comparable private sector workers on average.

The finance guy from the dealership told me that I should wait 1 year and refinance for a better term and interest rate in about year and that I should go back to them. 

They claim they had gotten me some kind of special first time car loan program. Which is why I accepted the 8% but not exactly sure how good it actually is due to my lack of credit history.

I've been wondering if I should try to pay off the car faster or actually refinance later or earlier I would like some advice from you guys and what kind of plan I should be putting into action. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans while living abroad,"US citizen. I'm about to take out student loans for a foreign graduate program that should (a) allow me to live and work abroad after graduation, and (b) provide me a job with \~$100k salary (in USD). It is a very good program and I am not worried about finding a job or using the degree.

I was planning on taking US federal loans or Sallie Mae, and then refinancing after graduation. Sallie Mae is more attractive because there aren't origination fees, and because federal loans do not allow any exchange programs or any internships in the US. Although I don't plan on doing a US internship, I would like that as a backup plan. Sallie Mae interest rates are \~8% and federal rates are \~7%.

However, it looks as though refi companies require a US address and/or US income. 

Questions:   
\-- Are there are companies that will allow US student loans to be refinanced while living and working abroad?  
\-- If not, would you recommend taking the federal loan, with its limitations, for the lower interest rate?

It's also possible I will come back to the US and refinancing will be fine. Or, I'll live abroad a while, take the foreign earned income exclusion for a while, make loan payments if/when I move back to the US, and pay taxes on the amount of loan forgiven after 25 years.",finance

Some background information about me:

* I'm from Michigan if that matters on change in cost of living.
* After graduation, I will probably have around $10,000 in federal loans to pay off.
* I am single and I will want to live alone.

With some background info to go with, here are my two choices:

Job 1
 
* Base salary is 60k
* Located right in the heart of Chicago
* 5k sign-in bonus and 2k relocation package
* 4% company match for 401k
* Career wise, this is an FP&amp;A position, but the work I will be doing isn't clear except for your typical forecasting and excel modeling
* Other perks include free standby travel and discounts on hotels, flight tickets, etc.
* 10 starting vacation days, able to buy vacation days

Job 2

* Base salary is 70k
* Located in Cincinnati
* No sign-in bonus, relocation package is TBD depending on individual needs
* Company doesn't match 401k contribution, but they offer stocks for every year you work at the company
* This position is marketing and strategy, described as like an ""internal, marketing consulting role""
* 15 starting vacation days 
* No other perks 

Career wise, I will definitely not stick with either company for long (think 2-5 years) and I want to make a lateral move towards tech at some point in the early parts of my career.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I have $3k in checking, $8,500 in a parent joint savings account @ my local bank (the interest rate on it is more or less nonexistent) Below are a couple of steps that I would like to take to tackle financial independence for when I turn 18 in December.

1.) I want to open up a HYSA solely in my name. I am yet to talk to my parents but I am sure they will understand. After doing some research, I am planning to open up a savings account with American Express. More or less the rate is around 1.90 which is generally average for online accounts as I have learned—-the only major downside to AMEX that I have heard is generally their shitty UI. (I guess they give better web formatting//app accessibility to the credit card side of their operations? It is separate)

2.) Open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard. After countless hours of research I think Vanguard fits best for me. I would be looking to bundle the ~12k I will have by December. Max out ($6,000) the Vanguard Roth, allocating as a (2060?) retirement target date fund—-but I am still researching exact allocations as the more streamlined has higher fees I heard. That leaves me with around $4,000 to deposit in savings and with money to wiggle around with to use for (Robinhood?—minimally), and daily/monthly expenses. 

3.) Probably not RIGHT as I turn 18, but I’d also like to set up a credit card early on. I think I’m responsible enough and could pay off payments immediately. After some research, I think just for the quick accessibility as a “starter card”, the new Apple Card is my go-to just due to the ease of access//organization at my finger tips. The only issue is that I heard people have been denied for “insufficient credit history”. I figure that I’ll apply and if I get that due to not having any credit history, I could possibly check with (AMEX would be go to) another company that has fair starter cards. I would use it minimally in hopes of building credit score early on but I think I need to look into it more.

That mainly sums up my near future plans. I live with my parents and looking to attend community college (paid for) next winter. I graduate in at the end of May 2020 and want to work full time @ $15 an hour which is achievable. If I can’t get $15, I would still look to work full time. Car is paid off and the only major major expense I would have for self enjoyment would be a summer 2021 getaway trip for around two weeks. 

Any advice on what I’m planning to do? Am I hitting the target dummy somewhat or did I miss him entirely?",finance

I currently am evaluating the two whole life policies that I have..

personalfinance,Thinking about refinancing my 1yo FHA Mortgage to a lower rate; Is it worth it or should I wait?,"I have a 1 year old 30-year fixed FHA mortgage at 4.375% for about $329k. I have about $323k remaining, with a $1,642 monthly payment (though I'm paying almost as much in escrow). I've been looking into refinancing, primarily to get out from under the FHA penalties, but it doesn't look like I'll be able to, mainly because of equity.

On a whim I decided to look around and was quoted for a new loan at around 3.25-3.5%, still FHA 30-year fixed. The lender is suggesting to roll costs into the remainder of the mortgage, that out of pocket expenses would be about $500, and that saving would probably be around $150-250 depending on the rate.

My main conflict is, is it worth jumping on a lower interest rate now even though it's still FHA, or should I wait a year or two and hopefully build enough equity to be able to get a conventional? Would I the worth refinancing even if it was only for 2-4 years? Will I see a rate this low again, and is that worth it even if it is an FHA loan?

Saving an additional \~$200 a month would be nice, or we could always use that to make additional payments towards the principal, meager as they are.

I've tried to do plenty of research, but unfortunately this is just an area I'm not very comfortable with, so any suggestions or advice would be very much appreciated.

personalfinance,Mortgage advice to wait or not,"Hello,

Looking for a little advice here on the best way to proceed here in TX.

I had a foreclosure from a divorce that should be falling off my credit report early next year (may is just past the 7 year mark)   


We are running into scenarios that with the interest rates keep going down and the housing pricing keep going up here we are trying to figure out will it make a big difference of going for a home now vs waiting until after the foreclosure falls off. I know the risk is that interest rates may go up in the near future but given the environment I doubt they will go up more then .25-50%  


Keep in mind due to housing pricing saving for the full 20% down is a much harder since the houses we were looking at that we did have 20% down so most likely it would be 10-15% down on a home that's 350-400k home.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take advantage of loan forgiveness?,"I'm graduating college at the end of this year and will begin working around March.

Working at a non profit hospital I will be eligible for loan forgiveness in 10 years. I don't know what my monthly payment will be right now on a loan forgiveness plan. I will still be living with my parents for a bit so my monthly costs will be very low. Since my debt is not too bad is it even worth paying it for the next 10 years? I guess my question is, when is loan forgiveness not a good thing?

I also would like to plan for going to graduate school in 3-5 years, which I will not be able to work throughout. This will cost about $80k-$110k not including living expenses and increase my income to about $150k+/year. My worries were having a monthly loan payment during that time.

I'm a 26 year old guy with a pretty average amount of student loan debts (approximately $50,000) spread over 7 loans with a 5.31% average interest rate.

For the past few months or so I've been paying as much as possible when doing student loan repayments. My thinking being that the interest was high enough to make paying back these loans my top priority.

However, I have next to nothing in savings, and I'm worrying about my current job security. I feel like I should attempt to balance loan repayments and savings, but the interest I'd get from my savings is minuscule in comparison to the loans' interest... I'm just worried that as of now I don't have a safety net if my company goes south.

One idea could be to just make the monthly minimum payments for a while. And honestly, with some people vouching for student loan cancellations couldn't I just make the minimum until all my loans are canceled? I really need someone to tell me why this isn't a good idea because it's seriously tempting me!

personalfinance,Paying off a 401k loan with a Roth IRA,"A few years ago I was dumb and took out a loan against my 401K. I'm paying off all my debts using the snowball and this $6,000 loan is the next one on the list. I have about $30,000 in a Roth IRA with more than enough in contributions to pay off this loan in one fell swoop. Those contributions can obviously be taken out tax and penalty free and doing this will free up about $268 a month that I currently spend on the 401K. 

Pros:   
\- more cash flow each month without the loan, a big goal of mine

\- One more debt gone, with only a mortgage and car to go.

Cons  
\- The IRA does a little better in terms of return than does the 401k, but not if if you factor in the 5% interest rate I'm paying myself.

\- I'd be moving money from a more flexible account to a less flexible account.

I would never consider taking money from the IRA for any other debt, but ultimately this is just moving money from one retirement account to another in a tax-free manner. This isn't a situation that I've seen under consideration elsewhere so I thought I'd ask.

personalfinance,Pay Down HELOC or Maintain Savings?,"Just curious about what others may do in this scenario.

I'm married and 53.  My wife and I both have secure jobs, and we are fine with our retirement and HSA savings.  Our second daughter is a junior in college, and we currently have enough cash in savings to pay our portion of her tuition for the remainder of her semesters.  However, we really have just enough at this point.  She is getting married in May of 2021, so we have that expense upcoming as well (budget is $15K).

We have a HELOC with a balance of $51.6K and an interest rate of 4.74% (balance on first mortgage is $111K at 2.875% and a little under 8 years left to pay).  We have no credit card debt.  Interest on the HELOC is around $200 per month.  Currently I have been stashing a little over $1,000 per month into a money market to cover future tuition, wedding, and emergency savings.  I also pay the HELOC down around $900 each month.  

This plan is working well for us, but I keep debating whether to cut way back on saving cash each month in favor of throwing more money at the HELOC to more rapidly reduce the balance and interest we're paying.  Of course, this would reduce the amount of emergency cash and wedding savings we have, since we would need almost all of our cash reserves to pay tuition.  However, the more we pay down the HELOC, the more the available credit grows ($75K line and just opened this year), and that could be used to cover unanticipated emergencies.  I also have a 457 deferred compensation retirement account at work, from which we could withdraw money without a penalty in the event of something really catastrophic.  

Another part of the debate is that if I thrown money at the HELOC right now, then that's more money we'll have to put back on it for my daughter's wedding.  However, with my daughter off the payroll, we'll be able to rapidly pay down any wedding costs on the HELOC at that point.

financialindependence,"Planning, Investing, and My Experience Seeking Financial Independence While On Disability","Disability hits people unexpectedly. At age 27 in a sedentary job as a former Bay Area Tech CTO I never pictured myself filing for disability much less being found permanently disabled with no cure, no treatment, no effective medications. I had a sudden unexpected onset of a very rare severe neurological disorder that had no warning signs. Today I'm going to talk about how it's changed my FI/RE plans, things that no one expects going out on disability, and how it affects my financial investments going forward. 

*Note: For the sake of brevity in various examples I'm rounding numbers to two or three digits of precision. All investment rates assume a very risky equity asset allocation with a 7% real after inflation return and a 2% qualified dividend yield. All numbers are in today's dollars assuming 2018 tax rates/policies and assuming no future tax changes. I'm also assuming the reader has a base level of understanding of disability insurance. If you don't then both the Bogleheads and White Coat Investor website are a great resource to start reading up on this valuable coverage.*

# Pre-Disability Income &amp; Assets &amp; Expenses    
    
* $350k total comp ($211k after tax take home pay)
* $200k taxable account
* $100k roth IRA account
* $100k 401k 

#Expenses     
        
* $60k annual expenses including vacations/etc

#Investing   
   
* Investing $120k/year to be really FI.

# Disability income    

* $130k non-taxable LTD (mix of multiple IDI carriers and non-taxable group contributory ""buy-up"" insurance)
* $20k taxable group LTD (after SSDI offsets)
* $15k/total a month 
* All to age 65. IDI policies are true own occ, group is an any occ policy after two years.
* $30k SSDI
* **85% of former take home pay covered by disability**

# Why I'm still saving aggressively even though I now have a secure income stream   
    
Even though I'm found permanently disabled, you can never be certain the insurance company(s) will play nice in the future. Medical advances can be made for my condition (new drugs are being researched) and who knows what treatments look like in 5-10-15 years. If I just wildly spend this income I'll be in a poor position in the future if disability companies deny payments or I recover. My insurance company already played really nasty once (see below) and they could certainly try again! It just takes one out of context private investigator video taping you being ""normal"" for a few minutes for them to then hope to show a sympathetic judge. 

# My investing plan   
My FI goal is $2.5m which I picture I'll achieve within 11 years. I'd be ok financially if my disability policies stopped paying/refused to pay at that point. I'd like to live a bit more relaxed than I have been living at that point.
  
Unfortunately tax-advantaged investment options are really limited for disabled people. There are ABLE accounts for those with an onset of disability on/before age 26, but mine onset shortly after. (There is a bill to extend it to age 46.) The only tax-advantage space I now have access to is roth/traditional IRAs. IRA contributions are only available from taxable insurance policies that report income on Box 1 W-2. 

I'm planning on saving $120k a year into taxable and expect to hit $1m in taxable accounts in 4-5 years, $2.5m total across accounts in 11 years. I'm guessing I'd have $14m-$24m in taxable at age 65 (probably lower as I'll let off on the gas somewhat), $2.0m in my roth (before roth laddering), and $1.6m in pre-tax 401k/t-ira accounts (should I decide to not ladder). $2.2m pre-tax accounts at age 70.5 with RMDs of 3.64% being $80k/year.

Receiving SSDI plays hell with marginal rates while saving for retirement. With $20k group taxable income and $30k of SSDI, roughly $25k of roth conversions/future estimated qualified dividends from taxable investments in a year/etc will make 85% of the SSDI subject to tax, a marginal rate of **50%.** With this factor it makes roth conversions very expensive until you have uncontrollable dividend income that makes SSDI fully (85%) taxable. After this ""hump"" my federal marginal rate appears to be around 23%. Realistically I won't get past this hump until 5 years on disability at my current savings rate.

On SSDI you have no choice to delay Social Security retirement until age 70.5. You transition over automatically to full retirement age. I don't know if there are any legal loopholes around that. (Ie could one legally stop SSDI in their 60s before full retirement age (perhaps make substantial gainful income), wait, then delay? I can't find any answers on that. Actuarial speaking it's better to keep SSDI as disabled people have shorter life spans than the expected age of death SSDI uses.). 

In retirement I'm looking at $250k+ in qualified dividends alone. That makes my marginal tax rate (using taxcaster to make a sample 2018 return) in retirement 31% thanks to the net investment tax.  

Tax effective wise I'm looking at roth contributions until 4 years in ($1m taxable account), then t-IRA contributions for 7 years (years 5-12) as a $6,000 t-ira at 40-50% marginal rate gives a $2,700-$3,000 tax refund as it reduces BOTH the taxable group insurance and the amount of taxable SSDI, then past 12 years back to roth contributions. I'd save an extra $21k with the 7 years of the planned t-ira contributions. I'll likely ladder my pre-tax account into my roth IRA at this point as I'd rather not deal with RMDs and 23% current marginal tax vs an expected 31% at retirement is a pretty huge savings. 

There isn't much other insight I can offer as obviously trying to optimize a future expected  $2m pre-tax account for age 65 when I'd expecting to have a 10-20m taxable account at age 65 won't realistically move the needle. 

I'm looking into using a 529 plan for myself as while interest earned is tax deferred (earnings come out as ordinary income rates), withdrawals for totally and permanently disabled is an exception to the withdrawal penalties. I'd need to consult a CPA on it, but it may be a good way to shelter my bond/REITs allocation in taxable that mostly throw off ordinary income. Of course it won't be good for stocks as long term capital gains are very efficiently tax deferred already. 

If the ABLE account age extension becomes law then I'll definitely max that out.

# Things that went well     

*  I planned really well with getting robust insurance policies and amounts.   
    
* I established a good group policy at the startup I was involved with. We covered the first 50k of premiums pre-tax so people can have some taxable income to be able to make IRA contributions (the insurance reports it on W2 box 1), then had mandatory post-tax deductions for the buy-up insurance making sure everyone is covered.  


* Glad to have two IDI carriers and a third separate group carrier. I was a huge target just being 27 years old but had all $15k been at one insurer instead of $5k split per carrier I'd be the giant claims target of the century. 

* Had a lot saved with a huge emergency fund to deal with my unexpected disability.   

* No loss of income as I met my elimination period while working still.

* I'm really glad I hired professional legal help with my insurance claims.
    

# Unexpected things about disability      

* I had a lot more medical expenses than expected. I hit my out of pocket max. The insurance company has paid $70k after discounts to my medical providers. My current medication for my neurological disorder is $15,000 a month.

* Costs being disabled can skyrocket. I'm completely restricted from driving due to my disability. Uber costs for doctors appointments/treatments/testing/etc exceeded $1k a month a few times living in the Bay Area (Rush hour, specialists outside the city, etc.) It's hard for me to cook with my disability too - I had skyrocketing costs of food delivery/etc. 
      
*   I had a 90 day elimination period with the IDI carrier I depended on the most. I filed my claim when I met the elimination period. It took them six months to approve it (with six months backpay.) I understood that it takes a while to approve a claim but when I took out a 90 day elimination period I did not expect to front six months of back pay. 

* The insurance company played nasty despite being formally represented with a legal team. They started to establish a bad pattern of bad faith by trying to delay the claim as much as possible. When my claim was submitted my legal team submitted everything they felt was appropriate as proof. Two months of silence passed and the insurance company suddenly stated we never sent in a medical records release (we absolutely did.) Immediately my legal team faxed them the signed authorization, another month of silence, then it was ""unusable"" - a supposed bad fax, while at the same time my doctors have been getting the records request! Unfortunately after that my legal team ended up sending everything overnight, signature required. No more easy faxes. That stopped that bullshit. 

* After that they then delayed an additional two months wanting the past three years of tax returns with the Bay Area startup I was formerly employed with as I was over a 5% equity owner. Of course the company, founders, and venture capitalists that funded us protested and it sat on a huge legal fight. This wasn't a personal business - this was a startup done at ""arms lengths"" with others. I'm really glad my co-founders worked with me and released the business returns they weren't obligated to... it was starting to head into unprecedented waters as a new case law that neither my attorney or I were excited to litigate on. This was unheard of in my attorney's career. The company was really grasping at straws to not pay a 27 year old disability to age 65.

* They requested the previous 10 years of medical records going to age 17 fishing for pre-existing conditions as a post-claim underwriting practice as the claim was filed within the contestability period of the policy. Normally my attorney would push hard on limiting it to the pre-existing condition period (1-2 years depending on the policy.) but we are both confident that there is absolutely no pre-existing conditions or sign of this disability and so it'd be a red flag to push to limit the investigation. However trying to recall 10 years of doctor visits is ludicrous so we did not disclose anything before the pre-existing condition period. Making a disability insurance claim is like talking to the police - no need to assist the police or them in their investigation. You're not legally required to assist in their investigation other than what the contract stipulates.   

* Unlike group(ERISA) policies, IDI policies have no clauses in the contract stating how long an insurance company can investigate. My attorney advises me that most claims take 45-90 days to investigate after a claim is submitted, so if you have a 90 day elimination period you better budget at least 180 days of expecting no payments from the date of disability.

* While you can sue on a IDI policy after 60 days after you provided all proof of loss and your requirements as an insured if the IDI company doesn't pay. *In practice* that's not recommended at all. My attorney recommended keeping things polite and cordial, silently document all the delays, then use it as ammo if they deny, or the delays go past a year, or cause actual damages (foreclosures/late fees/etc.) It's a lot cheaper too... litigation is expensive and uncertain. You have to keep in mind it's not personal ; it's business. The insurance is a cold hearted calculated business. 

* I didn't have a final diagnosis until 3 months of accumulated benefits (6 months past onset of disability). When I made my claim I had a good enough diagnosis with objective evidence which my legal team felt was good enough to proceed. Looking back on a pure ""human"" basis it may have been better to file when my diagnosis was certain, not subject to change, etc. In real life it's not ideal to have the insurance company not know what exactly is going wrong. It's hard to say though if things would have been different had I waited.

* Unless you have an accident or a clear cut disability (heart attack/stroke/etc), medical stuff moves *slow.* In reality most disabilities are chronic and worsen over time. On day one of your onset of disability you're probably thinking this won't last for weeks, or months. You probably won't want to make a claim on your policy until you've unquestionably satisfied the elimination period either or know you'll satisfy it in the future. After I had learned it's probably best until your diagnosis is very concrete, and not just probable (if you can swing it financially of course). 

* Ironically I had a good experience with the group contract. They don't want to lose my employer's future business (we're paying premiums close to an IDI contract would too, so they're getting a ton of money over a normal group contract.) They had a six month elimination period though and by that time my claim file was well built. They waived pre-existing conditions for the initial employees when we bought the policy, so not having a pre-existing investigation smoothed out the claim process a ton. As a normal employee though I would expect the claims process to be worse with group insurance than what I experienced with my IDI policies.

* Going out on disability with a large benefit at age 27 will make *everyone* suspicious, especially with the policy amounts involved (learned that quickly - the guy I ended up going with I didn't disclose the amount involved until the retainer was signed.). I've ran through *five* attorneys that flat out told me ""you're 27, you can't be disabled!"" I found it incredibly hard as a young professional to find the legal help I needed. A few lawyers were like ""come back when you're denied."" I almost contemplated handling the claim on my own until I found an attorney that had handled my exact neurological condition before and other related neurological conditions with disability companies. 

# My advice     
    
* **Get a good individual disability insurance (IDI) policy from one of the big 5 carriers as soon as possible.** Don't wait - the littlest of health conditions can give you worse premiums, limited coverage (5-10 years instead of to age 65/67), exclusions, or outright declines. I'm too young to have experienced pre-ACA health insurance underwriting but my legal team tells me disability insurance underwriting is 10x worse than pre-ACA health insurance underwriting ever was.    
    
* Bogleheads and White Coat Investor websites are excellent resources for disability insurance information.
    
* Get a policy from one of the ""Big 5"" companies - The Standard, Guardian/Berkshire, Principal, Ameritas/Union Central and Mass Mutual (+/- Ohio National.).   

* Get an independent agent. Any independent agent is fine if you have no health issues. If you have a host of health issues I recommend someone who has a ton of experience working with physicians who apply for IDI as they're more knowledgeable how to paint pre-existing conditions in the best light. 
    
* **Group coverage isn't worth the paper it's printed on.** Even with my IDI experience group insurance is that much worse. The benefit can end as early as 2 years when it switches over to the ""any occupation"" phase. Depending on state if you can be a Walmart greeter you get kicked off (some states like CA limit any occupation to be gainful - 80% of your pre-disability earnings.) ERISA gives discretionary authority to the insurance company on what the contract means. The TL;DR is a group contract is between the employer and the insurance company, NOT you and the insurance company. The employer signs away their rights to contest the policy and give *""discretionary authority""* to the insurance company to also manage the administration. ERISA derives from trust law so essentially the insurance company is also the ""trustee"" of the disability ""plan"" and has tremendous ""discretion."" Technically your group ""insurance"" is actually a ""benefit plan"" and technically a ""trust"" in the eyes of the law. You as a lowly employee are simply a beneficiary. Only if the trustee acts *""Arbitrary and Capricious""* will the courts act and intervene. This is a huge standard to overcome! Only 22 states so far have outlawed discretionary language and actually held these insurance companies for what they are - insurance! (Note: if your employer's plan is truly *self funded* then you're completely hosed. Self funded plans are incredibly hard to take to court vs a third party insurance company.)     
    
* **Max out coverage.** Look, I'll be biased here as I made a claim and it helped me tremendously. Insuring just your current expenses isn't enough. For most disabilities you will likely reach your out of pocket max for your health insurance for a few years. What about cobra premiums? What about ACA premiums if you don't get SSDI/medicare in 24 months from your disability? What about if the company denies your claim in the future? What about at age 65/67 when the benefits stop? What about stuff health insurance doesn't cover? Home modifications? **The only time you don't need coverage is when you're FI.** You can possibly reduce coverage if you have built up substantial assets and 2-4% SWR on those assets will make up the rest. You can always reduce coverage in the future for less premiums.      

* **You'll be glad to have maxed out the coverage if you became disabled, especially if you have to litigate.**
    
* The most cost effective for possible benefits received is to age 65 and 90 day elimination period. For an exec/sedentary position with all the optional riders it'll cost about 2-3% of gross income a year. IMO age 67 isn't worth the cost as it's really pricey as the insurance has to account both additional risk of being disabled if you're working at age 67 and the two extra years of payments (especially if a COLA rider is involved and inflation goes past the cap every year.)    
    
* Absolutely be sure to get true own-occupation coverage to age 65, residual riders (they even let you satisfy the elimination period early with sick days, I had a zero loss of income as the sick days I took satisfied the elimination period under the residual rider.) recovery benefits to age 65 (still get paid if you're no longer disabled but haven't been able to be rehired yet, what happens if you go out at age 27 but recover at age 55? Probably unemployable!), COLA if under age 45, and future purchase options.      
     
* If your career has a high income potential - software engineer, lawyer, doctor, executive, etc., then buy two policies at $5k/mo/each with $10k future option purchase pools. That will let in the future max both policies to $15k/mo each. Most insurance companies have a $30k ""participation limit"" where you can't have more than $30k/ di insurance on you. Another advantage of having multiple insurance companies is it greatly de-risks your claim. You'll face a lot more risk management if you ever make a claim on a $10k/mo policy than two $5k/mo policies at two different insurance companies. Should your insurance company go bankrupt you're a general creditor to the insurance company and should we have another AIG/Lehman Brothers, most states will only insure up to $300k of insurance reserves per policy but only if you're on claim and receiving benefits. Don't have benefits and your insurance company goes bankrupt? Well, now you gotta apply for a new policy with a new company at new rates and possibly face pre-existing conditions!

* There is ""DI Retirement"" protection policies with Guardian and Principal. It insures the actual retirement contributions you have a history of making (401k, IRA, deferred comp plans), the policy is owned and paid into a trust you can't access to age 65/67 so it doesn't have to be disclosed to other IDI carriers as it's technically not a policy you own, and it will get most people to 100+% take home pay coverage up to the $150k-$200k salary range. (Note: Principal recently updated guidelines to not issue policies to people who they deem are ""over-insured"" so it's recommended to apply with them first, then apply 31 days to other carriers or apply once it's in force, per your agent.)

* You can ""double dip"" on a group policy. If you have the above $30k/mo IDI policies in force and join an employer that provides you with $20k/mo group insurance you'd have $50k/mo of total coverage. Group policies only reduce for other group polices (including professional association policies) but purposely keep IDI coverage untouched.

* Buy IDI insurance even if you're covered by a group. At the very least they'll issue a ""supplemental"" amount of coverage to cover the taxes you'd pay on the group insurance. Establishing a future purchase option on the contract is huge so you can get more coverage should you switch employers later on. (Note: if you have an offer in-hand and the new employer has group disability coverage, if you go 31 days of unemployed between your old job and the new job, you can contractually exercise the FPO and get full coverage based on the job offer and not have it reduced because of any potential group insurance Enjoy a nice break between jobs and get fully protected. That's the recommended way for people who have no inclination of joining startups or self employment where there are no disability benefits.)

* Don't downsize your emergency fund because you have a disability policy. I was surprised my claim built up 6 months of benefits before being approved.     
       
* If you ever make a claim never ever talk to them on the phone. Always do it in writing.   
     
* If you ever make a claim hire a professional experienced legal team. A $10k/mo claim is worth $3 million at 4% SWR. *Would you represent yourself over a contract claim worth millions of dollars?*

personalfinance,Credit and buying a home?,"(24F) I am looking to buy a house hopefully at the beginning of 2021 when my lease expires. But I have a few questions...


1. Is it true you need three open lines of credit to apply for a mortgage?


I have one student loan ~4K and have the money to pay it off at any moment but it as a very low interest rate so I’m not sure if I should keep it at a low amount since it is very much helping my credit score. 


If I do eliminate it I’m down to two credit cards with an average age of like a year. I also am an authorized user on one of my dads but I’ve heard that doesn’t always count. 


2. Is there a point where PMI is worth it?


The market here is insane and I’m afraid if I don’t buy something soon I may never be able to. For perspective a family members condo has appreciated almost 200k in 6 years. 


At the rate things are moving and how much things cost I would need between 50-70k for a down payment to hit 20% but I’m afraid in the 4 or so years it will take me to get there I will be back to where I am today. Some calculators tell me that PMI with ~10% down only costs 2-5k over the course of the loan. 


3.  Would you ever recommend buying something that you didn’t plan on keeping too long? 


Would it be silly to maybe buy a condo for 3-5 years and grow equity and save while paying less in housing expenses only to turn around to sell. 


When I intend to buy I should have about a 25k down payment plus an emergency fund. 


Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Parents in a ton of debt,"My mother recently was given the option of cashing out an old pension plan with a lump sum (about 48k) option. I told her to let me look at it and see what would be the best option for her. I came to the conclusion that it was better to keep the pension (360 a month at retirement which would be ~4 years away) and not take the lump sum. 

She started freaking out saying she needs to take it to pay all her bills. long story short and much arguing later, this led to a huge revelation which is that my parents currently have about 40k in credit card debt, with minimum payments of ~1250 a month, and all averaging about 25% with some up to 29% interest rates!

This was a huge shock for me and I am not entirely sure what they should even do. They own their small home outright (~200k according to zillow), and bring in about 2700 a month takehome.

My parents have no other retirement saved up besides social security.

They have living expenses that total about 1450 a month. This includes the following; car lease 337, internet/cable 191, car ins 150, phone 138, gas 120, grocery 120, home insurance 118, gas for house 100, electric 85, water 80, separate health insurance 37.

I am fairly well off (relative to this) and just getting my family set up on our own financial footing so I don't know much about how to solve this particular issue. I have heard of options like consolidating debt or taking out a mortgage on the house, but I don't know much beyond that. Is there anything I am missing or something that could help them?

personalfinance,"29 - Need advice on next steps (invest, buy home, or ??)","I am 29, have a decent paying job for my area ($75k annual before tax), median home cost is about $160k, the ones I like are $200-250k in the neighborhoods I'd like to be. Stayed living with my parents paying $400 a month rent as well as alternating with them paying for dinner/groceries to help out but did this to pay off all my student debt. I have paid all of that debt off, I have a fairly nice newer car which is paid off - I'm a car person so I'm very happy with my car and no desire to downgrade to have more cash. Not sure if it matters for the consideration here, but the current book on it is $36k. I had a second car that I just sold, so I now have $70k in the bank. All credit cards paid off monthly, I have no outstanding debt or loans. There is a chance I may be promoted in the next few months to a position that should average $90-100k, but I do not want to bank on it as of yet.

I realize I should have been investing and have been losing money out by not (yes, all I have is a savings account at my bank with a very low interest rate), so fully understand that and want to correct it now before I give any more potential earnings up. I don't mind living with my parents, so I don't have that ""I gotta get out of here"" going on but I am really not fond of apartments so the next step I feel like would be a home. Thinking I have enough for a good down payment on the kind of home I'd like in my area, but I'd like to invest first so I don't have so much liquid cash that isn't doing anything for me or before really getting into the home owner world.

Given the amount I have, what would be the best investment path combined with leaving the ability in the next few years (or sooner) to buy a home? I want to get this started so I will have plenty of cash later on while I have low monthly expenses now and know homes can be a more risky investment especially since I plan to live there not just buy to flip (I wouldn't be opposed, I just don't know enough about any of that). I have a decent amount in my Charles Schwab managed retirement trust through my workplace ($60k) and I do have the contribution maxed out. I assume that CS is my 401k? Unsure how to tell.

Looking for advice on what my next steps should be. I have limited knowledge about investing or particular goals besides eventually a house, other than to just have my money work for me (early retirement, additional income, etc.). Well, there is a car I would like to have but do not ""have"" to have that's $75k. Already know I broke the rule on car cost per income, but I really like my car so this is entirely an optional goal.",finance

CryptoCurrency,I built a generic framework for crypto. Please go through the post to understand the effort put in.,"Fed up with my job, I decided to build my own generic framework that can be used to build products on top of it, like an exchange, a payment gateway etc.

1. **What does it do**: 
   1. It offers you set of API's that you will need to build any of your crypto-based product. 
   2. The API's offer you to generate a crypto address, that is completely monitored by my framework.
   3. Any activity that happens on these addresses will be notified to you via multiple notifications ways. There is persistent notification API, socket stream, SQS queue endpoint, Lamba trigger and telegram notification just for your visual look and feel.
   4. You can withdraw them any time to your personal wallets, using withdrawal API's
2. **Features**:
   1. The load is a very unique feature. You can generate even a million addresses. The system is load-independent.
   2. Keys are generated in run time. Even if the database, code and machines get compromised, crypto private keys won't because it is nowhere. 
   3. Instant reconciliation: Whenever any deposit is done, the amounts are safely transported to a hardware wallet. Hence, you can completely discard the existing keys and move on to new ones in case you need so.
   4. To reduce the fee, especially in ethereum ERC20 tokens, I have created special kind of contracts that help you store any kind of tokens and help deposit and withdraw many at one time. For example, *you can withdraw USDT, BAT, 0X all tokens in one and only one transaction.*
3. **Supported and Future Plans**:
   1. I currently support BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH and ERC20 tokens on ethereum.
   2. I keep adding new crypto every month. XRP will be added next. 
   3. Any specific ERC20 token that you wish to add, let me know in DM
   4. NFT support like ERC721 on Ethereum, SLP-BCH will be added. 

*Note: I am the only developer who has completely build it from running nodes, building frameworks, writing down wrappers and solving the DevOps challenges that I came across. Hence, a lot of things are in pipeline. Your* ***advice*** *and* ***support*** *are highly recommended especially in terms of selling the product. All of them will be considered and taken.*

[This](https://testnet.cryptocurrency.ee/) is my product link. I am not a good UI developer, hence please don't judge me by my landing page. Instead, I would recommend you to visit my [swagger docs page](https://testnet.cryptocurrency.ee/api-docs/) and check the features. Also, do share with relevant people/groups.

personalfinance,Withdrawing from retirement account in order to save money on health insurance while unemployed?,"I live in a state without medicare expansion. This year I paid $3000 for crappy catastrophic insurance: $8000 deductible, 3 doctor visits for the year in a tiny network (my doctor wasn't in it).

I don't have a job. I don't want a job next year. I'm semi-retired for the time being. I'm living off of savings, and I don't need any money to live for the next year, but I will need it soon after if I don't go back to work. 

I have a bunch of money in my 401k. Here's the idea: I withdraw $12,000 next year, or whatever the feds consider the current poverty level. This will count as ""income"", yeah? You need to make the federal poverty level in income in order to qualify for subsidized health care. The subsidized health care premiums are like $40/mo, and it's a real health plan. I wouldn't pay much tax on $12,000, and even if I have to pay a 10% penalty, that 10% *plus the tax* is still less than I'm paying now for this crap health insurance!

So, I'd be withdrawing money in order to have an income without working, just to meet the silly requirements for the ACA, and actually saving money in the process. The only downside is I will have taken money out of my 401k that can't be replaced right away.

Somewhat related question. I think the oldest money in my Roth IRA might be older than 5 years. Can I withdraw that principle now without penalty? That would reduce how much I need to withdraw from my 401k.

Edit:

There seems to be confusion about my proposal. Perhaps an illustration of my proposal would help.

Suppose I took out a loan of 10,000$ and it has, 1 year into my program, accrued 1,000$ of interest. If I were to pay the principal at the end of year 1, it would prevent any more interest from accruing, and I could also save that 1,000$ and invest it for the time being, since the interest has not yet capitalized.  If this weren't possible, I would have to put that 10,000 partially towards interest, and thus not completely pay off the loan, or pay the whole 11,000$, and not be able to put that 1,000$ on interest towards investment.",finance

I just started a new job this year making 70k annually + 18% ($12,600 annual bonus). I also receive 3k a year in CS.

* My job move is in the same field as my previous, same job title, but was a significant pay increase but I dont think that's a problem. My main concern is knowing most mortgage companies do not count bonuses unless you've received it for two years this can be huge for my DTI. My offer letter and salary information both say my pay is $82,600 annually, but not sure if this matters.

My current monthly bills: Car payment @ $445, Student Loans @ $96, and 2 credit cards with one with a $47 min payment and another with a $25 min payment. I have other credit cards but they don't have a balance. I could also pay off the card with the $47 min payment before the house is complete.

Credit Info: Current Credit score is 760 Transunion and 758 Equifax on CreditKarma ( I know this isnt the same score mortgages use so it may be a bit lower). I have no missed payment records or collections and open credit limit is 58k w/ 8% utilized.

I plan on putting 5% down using a conventional loan. Taxes here are \~1% home value and insurance \~1K a year.

With all that said without counting my bonus my DTI will be \~41% to 43% with the purchase of this home. What are my chances of getting approved for this loan? Any lenders you all recommend? Are there lenders that would consider using my annual bonus?

I would wait an additional year so my bonus can count but have to purchase a new home by August 2020. So I'm in a bit of a time crunch.

EDIT: I know this seems like a huge financial burden but trust me when I say I wont be house poor if I purchase this home. I'm currently a homeowner (my current mortgage is appx. $600 cheaper) , I just dont want my kid to going to this god awful school district we currently live in so I'm moving to a better school district before he starts school.

personalfinance,seeking refi advice,"Apparently, it's a hot commodity right now to refi with the current low rates. We already felt we had a low rate at 4.5%, but it's looking like we can drop a whole point or so. The reason we're really looking to refi is to cash out (~30k) so can complete required home improvements which have already been started. I was paying out of pocket cash for said improvements, but I've run out of funds. This process was my last resort, but I'm finding it may be the best option since we can lower our rate too. We've been current home owners for going on 6yrs and we currently almost have the mortgage paid off below the 100k mark. We decided we want to do another 30yr even though the 20yr loan was feasible and the 15yr was a tiny uncomfortable stretch. This way we can stay comfortable then throw extra cash with our payments without the stress.

That said, here's where I need the advice-
Among the 10 loan options: 
* Interest rates range from 3.125-4.250%, 
* APR ranges 3.522-4.351%,
* Points ranges 3.672-0%
* Cash out ranges 21,9-28,200.

None of the options get me to the 30k cash out, but that's okay since it was more than I really need, but I just gave myself cushion which anything leftover would've gone right back against mortgage.

Since I'm not savvy when it comes to the mortgage money market, I kind of need this spelled out for me as to what is my best interest. I meant to talk to the loan officer today, but I couldn't find a moment to call in and they're closed until Tuesday. I feel I need to lock in some rates since the market seems a little volatile. Yesterday they told me rates increased then today they dropped significantly down.

personalfinance,Social Security &amp; Medicare Taxes,"I recently started a new job where I am considered an employee but I work remotely. The business is located in Florida while I live and work from Kentucky. The employer decided it would be simplest if I handle the State Taxes on my own by submitting them quarterly with this form [https://revenue.ky.gov/Forms/2019%20740-ES%20fill%20in.pdf](https://revenue.ky.gov/Forms/2019%20740-ES%20fill%20in.pdf)

While Federal tax is being deducted on paychecks, Social Security and Medicare are not. Are these considered State Taxes that will just be included in my payment using the form above? If not, how do I calculate and pay these(what kind of IRS form do I need)? Should the employer be paying these even though the business is located in another state?

If there is another sub that I should post this question to that would be more suited since it's more of a tax than finance question, please let me know. Thanks!",finance
investing,Volatility and Fed Rate Cuts,"I'm holding a position of VXX and have traded it a few times over the last six or so months.  Prior to the three rate cuts, its movements were more noticeable, more drastic, and tended to be more volatile in its upward movements.  Since the rate cuts, the volatility has dampened considerably, and especially since talks of the trade war have gotten more positive along with the most recent rate cut, it has trended downward drastically.   

The Fed could be taking volatility out of the market with these cuts in order to counteract some of the trade war dialogue, but could it be part of a long game to help the markets weather an impending recession?  I realize Powell has reasserted that the Fed's position is it is not expecting a recession.  I think he may have said this after the most recent cut or along with it.  

Has anyone seen any updated recession predictions from reputable sources like credit ratings agencies or basically anyone other than Peter Schiff and other bears?  I think there was a consensus of one happening in the first part of 2020, but I haven't seen any updated takes.  

Personally, I think the election candidates will bring back some volatility, but more recession signals (manufacturing index, unemployment rising) would do more harm and require more cuts.",finance
investing,Does feds reducing rate have any affect on mortgage interest rate?,"Hi,  
I bought my first home few yrs ago. Have a mortgage on it. Interest rate is 4.1% with 30 yr fixed.  
I am looking to get a new home and sell current one next spring.   
I am wondering if feds reducing rates will reduce mortgage interest rates for 30yr fixed loan?

Also right now I have around $50K equity build up in my current home after minusing agent cost when i sell.

personalfinance,Paying Off Mortgage With Personal Loan?,"For a few years now, I've been periodically hearing people on real estate podcasts talking about accelerated mortgage payoff strategies in which they either use a personal loan to pay off their mortgage or somehow use a life insurance policy to do it. I've read a few e-books on it and watched some videos, but I can't wrap my head around it. Here's an example of one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCqOI6s3XA8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCqOI6s3XA8)   
I follow along with the numbers until like the half-way point and then I lose him. He argues that your mortgage (or car loan) interest rate isn't the effective rate and you're better off playing off a mortgage with credit cards and then paying the cards. That doesn't make sense to me, but there are people making videos and writing books about this. There must be something to it, right? But they're also selling financial products.

My gut tells me this is a sham, but it would be so powerful if it were real that I keep being drawn to investigate. The only accelerated payoff strategy I know of is putting extra money to principal, which is what I've been doing. Can I write this off as a sham and move on already or is there something here?",finance

personalfinance,Planning for retirement: which employer path should I select?,"I have noticed attend in civilian employers of eliminating pensions in favor of 401k account contributions. The federal government offers a 401k as well as a pension, similar to military retirement. My current goal is to pursue federal employment once I complete my degree to acquire a pension when I retire in addition to the 401k.

I am pursuing a degree in cyber security. This field has the potential for 6 figure earnings both in the federal and civilian sectors. However, earnings are higher as a civilian. This is countered by my general observation, they don't offer pensions. 

My question is it better to pursue a higher salary with the ability to contribute more to a 401k per year versus lower salary with a pension and 401k? Is there a way to quantify this or is there a rule or consensus as to one being better than the other?

personalfinance,Cash-out refinance vs home equity loan for down payment on new home.,"We've been in our current home for 5 years and are looking to upgrade. We have $163k left on a 30yr loan @ 4.25% fixed APR. We have roughly $180k in equity (neighborhood comps are $350k). 

We want to purchase a new home (as our primary residence) in the same market, keep our current house and convert it into a rental for $1,800/month (very doable in our area). We also want to leverage our equity to finance a down-payment of $85k. 

We understand that cash-out refinances come at a higher interest rate, especially if it's going to be an investment property. Our lender has indicated low 5%. 

Would we be better off doing a cash-out refinance of our remaining principal and pulling out the extra $85k @ 5%, or getting a home equity loan for just the $85k @ 6%?

Does it just come down to the math or are there other considerations as well (e.g. risk, taxes, etc)?

Finances: Gross income is $6,500/month. My wife doesn't currently work because we have young children, but we expect her to start working in 2 years. We would also have the $1,800/month from the rental. 
Debt: current mortgage, $3k remaining on car

My current job does not include benefits so I was considering opening an IRA at my bank and contributing up to $1,000 and take advantage of the savers credit.

personalfinance,"Should I payoff my car loan before seeking a mortgage, even though that would mean cutting into my savings for a down payment?","My wife and I finally sold our house. We would like to put the proceeds towards the down payment on a new house next year after our current lease is up. However, we have a car loan with about $18,500 and 48 months left on it at 5.19%. If we pay it off now, our monthly savings will increase by about $500, which means that if we want to buy a house in eight months, we'll have have about $14,500 less than we would otherwise to put towards a down payment on a mortgage.

Since we can reasonably expect a mortgage to have a lower interest rate than this auto loan, my first thought is to just pay off the car. However, because we will then have less for a down payment, our mortgage will have a higher interest rate and we'll probably get stuck with private mortgage insurance payments as well. Of course, if we keep the car loan we might not be as attractive to mortgage lenders. We have good credit scores: according to Equifax, mine is 785 and my wife's is 828. I'm not sure how it would shake out.

I suspect that the prudent answer is that we should just pay off the car and wait another year to buy a house, but paying rent sucks and we'd just really like to have a house and a yard for our baby. It might seem incongruous that I'm concerned about paying for a new house even though we just sold one, but essentially what's going on is that, because of job and life changes, we moved to a region where housing prices and property taxes are relatively higher.

devops,Reality of software developers having no guardrails,"My company is at a crucial point where the software development side of the business is fed up over the engineering side not providing more self-services platform (compute, networking) and infrastructure (databases, message queues, etc) causing efforts to take significantly longer and don’t invoke “developer joy”.  Everything becomes a ticket with the over-utilized, engineering support centers that have partly automated processes, who feel they aren’t brought in on new initiatives to understand priorities or account for capacity.   Lastly, there is always complaints when the business asks for anything seen as “undue” process: change management, security, SOX compliance, etc; like there is no justification for any of these things.

Because of this, the software development teams are complaining to leadership that AWS is the only way to solve everything.  Comments about having self-service PaaS/IaaS and being able to turn up resources without capacity planning delays have some weight, however most of our software developers are junior without much experience around system administration or operating production services.  Most dev managers give into whatever they or their teams think they need to solve problems individually with little thought to broader business or platform needs such that every service looks and operates differently.

Given all of this, I wonder what others in a DevOps / Platform engineering role have done when faced with this culture crisis.

personalfinance,To Buy or Wait: HCOL Area,"My husband and I are debating whether to buy a house in Oakland, or keep on renting until we have a higher downpayment. 

We are 30 and are currently we make around 540k combined through salary, stock, and bonuses.  We got married a couple years back and paid off some debt that we accumulated through graduate school, and are now saving a significant portion of our after tax / retirement income.  

Right now we have $140K saved in cash in a high yield savings account.  In addition to this, we are saving \~$7000/ month from our after tax income, all of our bonuses (which come twice a year) and amount to \~70-80k / year after tax and stock which is \~$40k after tax a year. All in, our estimated yearly savings is around 190K. 

We are currently spending a large amount of money to rent a house in Oakland.  Our in-laws stay with us so we need a bigger place and rent in the bay is not cheap.  Our rent is around $6000/month.  

We are already pre-approved for a loan with 5% down that would be split into a loan with around a 4.85% interest rate for $1.25M with the rest being financed through a piggy back loan (HELOC) $225,000 at a rate of 7% with interest only payments. The reason we can't do more that 5% is because we'd want to maintain an emergency fund and the bank requires around $80k in assets for jumbo loans on top of the down payment and closing costs etc. However, as we wait longer, we'd open the door to 10-15% down by March next year. 

We understand that the 7% piggy back loan rate is high, but with our current saving rate, and likely bumps in income in the next 4 months, we are pretty confident that we can pay back the piggy back loan in 1 year.  

After we pay off the piggy back loan, we'd essentially be in the same house we are renting for the same mortgage, taxes, interest that we are paying in rent. 

Does this sound like too big of a risk due to the piggy back loan?  Should we just wait another year until we have more to put down? 

The reason we are getting anxious to move is because we have been in difficult rental situations in the past where our landlord sold the property we were renting and we were forced to leave.

# **The market rally will soon be tested by a big Trump speech and testimony from the Fed chief  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/the-market-rally-will-soon-be-tested-by-a-big-trump-speech-and-testimony-from-the-fed-chief.html)**
*****
&gt; Progress in trade talks and a steady, but accomodative Fed policy have eased the way for the stock market’s rally to new highs, and both will be in the forefront when President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell speak at separate events in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Against a backdrop of a stabilizing global economy, stocks have hit new highs and bond yields have pushed higher, particularly in the past week with a 23 basis point surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year rose to end the week at 1.94%, its highest closing level since Aug. 1, the day Trump threatened another round of tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Trump speaks to the Economic Club of New York during a Tuesday luncheon, and investors are hoping for clarity on a possible trade deal. The Fed chairman speaks Wednesday to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and he also appears before the House Budget Committee Thursday.
*****
&gt; There are a few key economic reports, including CPI on Wednesday and retail sales and industrial production on Friday. Empire State manufacturing survey Friday could provide a fresh look at the manufacturing sector in the New York region. Just a few major earnings are expected in the week ahead, including Cisco Wednesday and Walmart and NVIDIA on Thursday.
*****
&gt; But trade is likely to remain the more important wild card for markets, as the calendar edges closer to Dec. 15, the date new tariffs on consumer goods from China would go into effect if there is no deal. The House of Representatives also hold impeachment hearings before the public for the first time in the coming week, but the markets have so far ignored the topic and see it unlikely that the Senate would convict the president.
*****
&gt; # Stock records
&gt; Stocks continued to rally to new highs this past week, and the major indices all ended the week at record levels, as bonds sold off hard. Stock market gains were limited part of the session Friday after Trump said that he has not agreed to the tariff rollbacks sought by China.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fifth week, up 0.9%, and is now up about 1.8% for November so far. The S&amp;P closed at 3,093 Friday.
*****
&gt; “President Trump is always unpredictable, so we’ll have to see what he says,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; Keon expects a trade agreement of some sort in the near future, and that should help risk markets to advance.
*****
&gt; “The way we’ve been interpreting this is it probably amounts to a truce. The United States has been using this rhetoric that it’s a phase one deal. China has not embraced the same rhetoric. So I don’t know if we’ll get major progress on the thornier issues in the first deal,” Keon said. “The other question is how hard does the president push in an election year to make further progress in the negotiations, given that China might dig in its heels? That’s unknowable. I have no insight into what the president is going to do.”
*****
&gt; Cowen policy strategist Chris Krueger said Trump’s address Tuesday could be important for the direction of a deal. “In our minds, the most critical sections will deal with trade and whether Trump is favoring the “phase one” deal with China and a scheduled rollback of the tariffs. This could well be a trial balloon to gauge the ferocity of expected pushback from influential China hawks. Trump will give remarks and then take questions from two moderators,” wrote Krueger.
*****
&gt; Powell’s testimony is not expected to have as much potential to rock markets, after the clear message he sent to markets following the Fed’s rate cut Oct. 30.
*****
&gt; “I would expect the chairman to continue the rhetoric he had at his last press conference. They’re probably on hold. It will depend on the data. If anything the data looks a little more promising on the margin. Certainly the consumer and service sector appear to be doing fine and with the GM strike ending, some of the things impacted by that should improve,” said Keon. “They think rates are appropriate for now, and if the economy weakens, they’ll be prepared to take further action.”
*****
&gt; The health of the global economy has been a topic of concern in markets for months, but with the global rise in yields and signs of improvement in global PMI data, investors have clearly become more optimistic.
*****
&gt; “I’ve been kind of skeptical most of the year, but I do think at the margin, the economic outlook has improved, especially outside the United States,” said Keon. “The recession talk that was pretty active just a month or two ago has really died down. The yield curve is dramatically uninverted. I feel a little better about the economic outlook.”
*****
&gt; When the yield curve becomes inverted, short term rates, like the 2-year note yield for instance, rise above the long end, or the 10-year yield. That is very often a recession warning, as investors bet that the economy will be weaker in the longer term than it is in the near term. But there’s been a sudden shift, and now those curves are getting steeper.
*****
&gt; Keon said the higher yields are a positive sign, and he is adding to stock holdings, but more in foreign names. “The sense Europe was heading into a recession has died off, and there are signs things are stabilizing,” he said. “This could all change in a minute but it looks like the overall outlook has significantly picked up in the last month or two.”
*****
&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he is still cautious about the improvement, though earnings were not as bad as expected, the Fed has cut rates and the trade situation appears to be improving. “That combined with green shoots on the macro front, the markets have really taken that and run with it,” he said, adding the move may have been too optimistic. “It’s out-sized relative to the significance of the data.”
*****
&gt; Suzuki said he needs to see more proof that U.S. manufacturing has stabilized, as many believe. ISM manufacturing was better in October than in September, but it is still in contraction. “Why is this definitely the bottom? The jury’s still out,” he said.
*****
&gt; “I think you have to answer the question—if this is the bottom and growth is going to rebound here, what’s going to be the catalyst for that?...I don’t see anything in the data that suggests there’s going to be a big rebound for any of those fronts. I see more headwinds to growth than I see tail winds,” he said. “On the investment side, it would be highly unusual to see a big rebo

# November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Best

&gt; DJIA has been up 10 of the last 15 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 13 of the last 17 years with an average gain of 0.45%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 16 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 15 and 14 times respectively over the past 25 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the usually bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

# S&amp;P 500 Price vs 50-DMA

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been on a seemingly uninterrupted run higher over the last several days, but by some measures, it may not be as extended as you would think. The chart below shows the historical percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500 and its 50-day moving average (DMA) over the last three years. Through Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 3.2% above its 50-DMA, which is relatively high but nowhere near an extreme. The red line in the chart below shows the current percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500's price and its 50-DMA. There have been a number of times since the 2016 election where this spread was higher with the most recent being back in July. In fact, 17% of all prior days in the last three years have seen the S&amp;P 500 close at a higher level relative to its 50-DMA than it is now. That doesn't mean the market isn't overbought, but it's not exactly at unprecedented levels either.

# Leaders and Laggards Since FOMC

&gt; We've now had nearly a full week of trading since last Wednesday's FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Powell suggested that the punch bowl isn't going to be taken away anytime soon. During that time, we've seen a real shift in leadership as defensive sectors have sold off while cyclical sectors have been on fire. Energy - yes, Energy - has been the top-performing sector with a gain of 3.5% while Industrials aren't far behind with a gain of 2.8%, Behind these two, Technology and Financials have also comfortably outperformed the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.2%. On the downside, Real Estate and Utilities, two of the market's most popular sectors for much of 2019 due to their dividend yields, have both dropped over 1% while Consumer Staples and Health Care have also sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC.png))**

&gt; Due to the fact that we are also in the thick of earnings season, it's a bit more difficult to see how the Fed's actions last week impacted individual stocks as some of the best and worst performances over the last week have been earnings-related. With that caveat, the tables below list the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the last week. Starting off with the winners, three S&amp;P 500 stocks are up over 20% in the last week, and all three were due to earnings reports. Overall, 12 stocks have rallied over 10%, while all 25 of the top performers are up over 7%. In terms of sector representation on the list, nearly a third (8) of the stocks on the list are from the Technology sector, while another five come from the Consumer Discretionary sector. The remaining 12 stocks on the list come from five different sectors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/110619-FOMC-Stocks.png))**

&gt; On the downside, 8 of the 25 worst performers since last week's FOMC meeting are down over 10% with Arista Networks (ANET) losing nearly a quarter of its value. Again, ANET's decline was tied to an earnings report as opposed to a reaction to the FOMC. In terms of overall sector representation, though, the underperformance of the Real Estate sector highlighted above is also evident on this list as eight of the companies listed come from that sector.

# The Few, the Lowly, the Laggards

&gt; With less than two months left to go in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on a gain of nearly 23% YTD, and all but two of the index's 24 industry groups are up by at least double-digit percentages. The two laggards are Energy (+4.5%) and Drugs and Biotechs (+5.5%), while the three strongest groups are all from the Technology sector (Tech Hardware: +44.8%, Semis: +37.7%, and Software: +32.8%). Surprisingly enough, Banks are even starting to move up the performance list as that group is up just a hair under 30% on the year putting it in fifth place on a YTD basis.

&gt; The table below lists where each of the S&amp;P 500's Industry Groups is currently trading with respect to its 50-DMA. While you would expect just about everything to be extended after the recent leg higher, that's not the case. The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is just 3% above its 50-DMA, and just five groups are more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. The two most extended groups are Tech Hardware (think Apple) and Banks. On the downside, there are actually as many Industry Groups trading below their 50-DMAs as there are groups trading more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. As shown at the bottom of the table, Consumer Services, Real Estate, Household &amp; Personal Products, Commercial Services, and Utilities are all currently below their 50-DMAs. These aren't groups that have been lagging the market all year. In fact, three of them are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, but in the majority of cases, these are defensive-oriented groups that have fallen out of favor as the market's sentiment has shifted and rates have risen.

# Seasonally Strong Period, But…

&gt; As I head to Las Vegas for my annual pilgrimage to @MoneyShows TradersEXPO I am both thrilled and shocked to hear everybody on Wall Street and the financial media talking about bullish yearend market seasonality and practically every one of them has used the phrase, “seasonally strong period.”

&gt; I’m thrilled because it validates what we already know and what I live and breathe: that there are clear evidence-based results of real, consistent, tradable and investable seasonal market patterns. I am shocked at how late many of them are to the party. We’ve been in bullish Best Six Months mode since our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 11.

&gt; Since our October 11 Buy Signal we have tactically maneuvered out of our defensive positions in Bonds, Cyclicals, Utilities and others and into the main U.S. equity index ETFs: DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM and the gamut of seasonally strong growth sectors over three weeks ago. We also put out a brand new Stock Basket of undervalued growth stocks under Wall Street’s radar.

&gt; Market seasonality is clearly firing on all pistons as it has been all year, but everyone’s is jumping on the seasonal bandwagon just a two regular seasonal soft patches are about to come around on the calendar. Now that our Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy is complete with some big market gains at the end of October and the beginning of November we are on the lookout for weakness ahead of Thanksgiving.

&gt; Next week is two weeks before Thanksgiving and we’ve shown in several recent posts, it is part of the mid-November soft patch. Then stocks usually pick up in anticipation of Thanksgiving and continue to rally through the end of November. After thanksgiving watch out, the first couple weeks of December are notoriously choppy and not especially bullish as tax-loss selling kicks into high gear.

&gt; With the market elevated and the news ever changing, stocks will be vulnerable to these perennial weak spots.

# Presidential Cycle Stars Align for Stocks in 2020

&gt; Despite all of the geopolitical events, things still look good for stocks next year with an incumbent running. The potential for a decent trade truce with China, along with an economy that’s still growing and accommodative interest rates add up to a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; With the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 coming off the press this week here’s a little preview of some our analysis and outlook that’s in the 53rd Annual Edition.

&gt; Presidential incumbency is a powerful phenomenon and the driving force behind the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle. This quadrennial quadrille is what has made the Pre-Election Year the best year of the cycle and Election Year second best. Since 1952 S&amp;P 500 is up 12.5% on average in election years when a sitting president is running for reelection vs. 6.7% in all election years and –1.5% in election years with an open field and no incumbent commander-in-chief running for a second term.

&gt; We are also arguably now experiencing some fiscal and monetary policy synchronicity. After several years of conflicting policy the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Federal government are finally getting in synch. Interest rates are historically low and the Fed has lowered rates again at the last three scheduled FOMC meetings at the same time as fiscal policy has been lowering taxes and increasing spending. These dual pro-growth policies should continue to propel the stock market higher.

&gt; Gains will of course not come without pause and correction. The world stage will continue to feature some challenging geopolitical, political, diplomatic, trade-related and economic storylines. U.S. presidential campaign politics will increasingly focus on domestic political disputes, standoffs and unfinished business – as well as impeachment proceedings. But when all is said and done, we expect 2020 to be a positive year based on the historical patterns and cycles and current favorable policies, healthy economics, and positive market behavior.

# Pre-Election Year Patterns: A November Market Pause

&gt; Now that we’ve survived Octoberphobia and the market has begun to strengthen again, breaking out above resistance and logging new highs on DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we are likely to experience a bit of consolidation here in November. Normally the top S&amp;P month of the year and #2 for DJIA, NASDAQ and the Russell 2000, November has been weaker in Pre-Election Years.

&gt; As you can see in the updated chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns overlaid with 2019 we have been tracking all year November tends to be flat in the Pre-Election Year with a pop around Thanksgiving. Then after the usual first half of December softness the market tends to push toward additional new highs near yearend. Considering the banner performance so far this year and the uncanny tracking of this historical seasonal pattern, we expect the stock to consolidate over the next few weeks and then resume its march higher.

# Bulls Stay in Motion

&gt; “An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.” Sir Isaac Newton

&gt; What a year it has been for the bulls. The S&amp;P 500 Index recently made four more new highs, and it’s up more than 20% for the year (as of Nov. 4). This leads to the big question: What could happen in the final two months of 2019? Well, we think the bulls might like it.

&gt; “A good year tends to see continued strong performance the final two months of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up 20% or more for the year heading into the usually bullish November, stocks have never dropped in November, while December also has tended to see a strong upward bias.”

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the day shows, going back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% heading into November, then the final two months were up an average of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year.

&gt; This phenomenon could be due to portfolio managers buying to play catch-up, or it could be that an object in motion stays in motion, as Newton noted more than 300 years ago.

Bitcoin,I've written a book that I want you know about,"Hi r/Bitcoin

I've written a short book where I propose a theory how cryptocurrency will impact the global economic system. It's not about Bitcoin in particular but abbout companys emitting cryptocurrencies instead of stocks.

If you are into cryptocurrencies in general it might by inspiring to you in terms of what to expect to happen in the next decades. The information will probably not be new to you but the conclusion might and if you know someone that you want to give a short introduction to what the benefit of cryptocurrency is, it might be a nice gift, since it's only 26 pages.

You can get the paper version at  [https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1706314205/ref=sr\_1\_2?\_\_mk\_de\_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=cryptp+paradise&amp;qid=1573393675&amp;sr=8-2-spell](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1706314205/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=cryptp+paradise&amp;qid=1573393675&amp;sr=8-2-spell) 

and the kindle version at  [https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0814P5F6K/ref=sr\_1\_1?\_\_mk\_de\_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=cryptp+paradise&amp;qid=1573393675&amp;sr=8-1-spell](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0814P5F6K/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=cryptp+paradise&amp;qid=1573393675&amp;sr=8-1-spell) 

I would love to get your opinion on my theory. Here is the introduction to the book  


*Cryptocurrency is the next big thing. People intuitively understand this but as of today, it doesn't seem obvious in what way cryptocurrency will influence society and the global financial system.*

*Bitcoin being the most popular example of a cryptocurrency is merely a proof of concept. Though there is a lot of interest in Bitcoin as a means of storing value, the mechanics of Bitcoin have so far failed to fully implement a replacement for government currencies.*

*Our global economy and our ability to finance gigantic projects as it has been done in the modern age are rooted in the way money is created in the current financial system namely by credit. Banks create money to give credit to businesses who pay them back after they have invested the money to create value and make a profit. These banks, on the other hand, rely on credit from central banks who are politically controlled instruments.* 

*The federal reserve, being the mother of all central banks isn't even a federal institution. It is owned by oligarchs and has since its founding had a very unhealthy relationship with politics.*

&amp;#x200B;

 *It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. — Henry Ford*

&amp;#x200B;

*Our current economy is in its core a planned economy that has little to do with a free market. It has become obvious how prone to abuse this system is in the financial crisis of 2008 where state power was abused to bail out failed businesses, who never faced the consequences of their bad investments. Many citizens who had absolutely no responsibility for the failure of these businesses paid for their loss. The fact that politics and the federal reserve were even able to pull this off, should make it obvious that a free market has up until today been nothing else than a theoretical concept but has not seen the light of day yet.*

*We are stuck in a situation, where we rely on our current financial system for credit yet we know this system is inefficient and involves a lot of corruption.* 

*Cryptocurrencies have the power to transform this system to where credit is actually given directly by consumers in a way that cannot be influenced by third parties for the wrong motives. No more need for central banks, moneylenders and blown up bureaucracies. Since the technology to achieve this already exists but we yet have to apply the right concept to it, this transformation will inevitably take place in the next few decades.*

*This book will explain how this transformation will take place and how the economy of the future will look like.*",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Health Insurance and Tax Question,"Hi, 

I am trying to figure out whether I should buy health insurance through my work or on the marketplace.  My problem is figuring out exactly what my tax benefit is for buying through work. 

Specifically, the insurance premium through work is pre-tax, but how do convert that to ""post-tax"" dollars?  I have my 2018 tax return, but I'm not sure what $ amounts to use to calculate my tax.  E.g., should I just use the ""effective tax rate"" from my federal return?  Should I calculate my tax rate based on my pre-tax salary?  My AGI?  My taxable income?  How should I work in the state number?  

If it helps to be more specific, my insurance premium from work is \~$1800/mo.  So what price do I need to hit on the marketplace in order to be ""breaking even"" on health insurance?  (Assuming the coverage is the same.)  Thank you all in advance!

Here are some fake numbers to play with to help out:

Salary: $100,000

**Federal**  
AGI: $90,000  
Taxable Income: $80,000  
Tax: $11,000  
Effective Tax Rate (from tax return): 12.2 %

**State**  
Taxable Income: $70,000  
State Tax: $3,000",finance
personalfinance,"It’s time to Re-sign my lease, and I just got laid off","Hey all, 

12 months ago I took a chance and moved halfway across the country from a low CoL to a high CoL for a job with Big Company. Salary was good enough and I leased an apartment that is more expensive than I’m used to. 

Gotta sign my lease for next year this week, as I’m passed the 60 day move out notice and was planning to stay, and Big Company suddenly decided to close their offices here and lay us all off. There may be an opportunity to relocate to Undesirable City but we won’t know for another five weeks or so, and even then I’m not sure if I would move. 

Without my salary at Big Company I cannot afford this apartment, it would exhaust my e fund on rent alone in less than six months (yes I know I should have beefed this up, e fund was based on old low CoL expenses). If I re-sign and have to break this lease, it’s about $4200. Or I can sign for a shorter term, like three months, to give myself time to find a cheaper place without a fee. Complication is that it’ll add several hundred to my rent for those months. I should be eligible for a short severance so that will help with this period until I can find somewhere else to live.

I’m pretty sure that the three month option is the way to go, but wanted to field some opinions from this sub as well. Thanks for reading all!

PS to add - job market is okay here, but I’m about to be competing with several hundred other folks in my same position who also don’t want to move to Undesirable City, so I may have to get used to a lower salary elsewhere, or even starting over in a new type of role.",finance
personalfinance,I have 75K in cash right now. What in your honest opinion is the best way to use it in terms of buying a place to live?,"I live in a smaller city with a cheaper real estate market. You could actually buy a nice smaller house for about 250-300, less if you're willing to look at fixers uppers. Logically, I have the 20% min down payment already, so I should buy a house.

But you can also buy a nice manufactured home for 100-125 and that has been tempting for me to  buy into. Pay the mortgage off quick and live cheap by just paying pad rent in one of the nicer trailer parks in town. I'm considering even asking my parents for a personal loan over a mortgage for that route, save even more on the interest rates.

One of the biggest factors right now is my job. I started working for the Government of Canada 7 months ago. I was hired on a 1 year term, but was recently extended by another year. You dont get a permanent position until you've done 5 years. Id like to say I'll make the cut, but I know I can't guarantee it.

 I take home 2900 net a month, so I could afford a full blown mortgage currently, but I could be in trouble if I committed to it and couldn't afford it in a year or two if I don't get permanent status. I also don't need that big a place either. I can guarantee that I will never marry or start a family.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on timing of selling a house,"Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I know folks on this sub have historically been very helpful, and I'm now faced with a situation with major financial implications if I screw it up. Apologies for bad formatting, I'm on my phone.

My wife and I are looking to move out of the city to the country on some family land. We could potentially sell our house now and use about half of the anticipated proceeds to pay off all debt and save the remainder, which would be about 10% of what we estimate building a house would cost. Doing this would remove $1k/month of debt. We could find a spot to rent until the house is built, which could be 1-3 years, but rent in our area is more than our current mortgage by a couple hundred bucks per month.

The benefit to hurry is mostly related to the fact that we are 20 years into a 25 year roof, so the closer to the end of that useful life, the less we will get in the sale of the house (if we don't replace), or the more we sink into the current house that we wont recoup in the sale. It's probably also worth considering the facts that it is a sellers market, houses in our area are going quickly, and interest rates are low currently, but who knows what will happen in the near future.

There are no long term cap gains implications related to the sale of our house and no early repayment penalty on my student loans or car debt.

investing,What would be the impact to housing if the fed starts to raise interest rates?,"I think common sense is telling me that it would trigger a decline in housing prices. In Southern California, I care less about the rates being low because it's caused people to borrow so much and drive up housing prices. This hurts people like me who have been saving for over 10 years (investing in equities mostly) to try to borrow as little as possible. It's been frustrating for me because (selfishly) I'd rather the housing prices go lower and loan rates go up. 

Do you think a rise in rates would cause this to be the case? Or would prices remain flat or go up due to things like inventory issues?",finance
personalfinance,Looking to conslidate CC and Student Loan Debt,"Hello,

I am looking to consolidate some CC and student loan debt that I've acquired. I make about 85k a year. My GF makes around 23k and helps with some expenses like rent, cars, cell phone, utilities. Rent is about $850/month, cars are $1k/month total after month payments/insurance.

CC debt as follows with payments:

* AmEx - $11k out of $14k - $350/month
* Amazon - $4,4k out of $11k -$350/month
* Chase - $1,7 out of $2k - $100/month
* Capitol One - $2k out of $3,75k - $200/month

Student Loans are a big more precarious. I used to pay about $800/month for these but I am taking classes at a community college atm that put them back into deferment (two classes @ ~$700 a semseter, 4-5 month period)

Sallie Mae:

* Loan #1 - $16,8k
* Loan #2 - $16,3k
* Loan #3 - $14,1k
* Loan #4 - $8,4k

FedLoans:

* Loan #1 - $1,8k
* Loan #2 -  $1,3k

I have setup an appointment with a financial planner in town but I've heard horror stories about unlicensed planners charging fees and am looking for multiple opinions.

I was looking at a personal loan to refinance all of the CC debt into a lower interest payment, its tempting because its less accounts for me to budget for and I feel like high interest APRs across multiple accounts is bleeding me. Is this advisable? some of the credit karma options look promising.

Student loans I've had trouble refinancing because I did not finish private college (engineering). I've never missed a payment but would like to get on top of them after the CC debt. Some idea about refinancing those would be helpful, they are also my oldest accounts and dont want to completely wipe them out first.

Currently about two months into YNAB as well, moved from a google spreadsheet. Main concern is worrying about making a bad decision now and shooting myself in the foot long-term. Thanks

personalfinance,Loans vs Investing,My question is about whether it is better to invest or clear out student loans quicker. My family has $31K in student loans with interest rates that range from 4.5% to 6.5%. We make payments such that it will be paid off in 5 years. At the same time I am putting as much money as I can into various stable investments that I've had for a long time and average a rate of return around 9%. I've always held to the logic that since the return on the investments was higher than the interest of the loans (net 2.5% or more) it was financially beneficial to continue putting more money into investments than the loans each month. However I've recently seen some advice that said you should stop all investing until all debts are paid. Can anyone explain to me why that would be the better option? I understand that investing has inherent risk but as I said earlier I've had my accounts for a long time and they've remained pretty consistent.,finance

personalfinance,Interest Only vs. 30yr fixed mortgages,"I’ve had this question has been on my mind for while.

If you have the option between a 7/1 ARM interest only with a lower rate (say, 3.5%) and a 30yr fixed with a higher rate (say, 4%), and your portfolio rate of return is &gt;3.5%, wouldn’t you always be better off taking the interest only loan?? The other key assumption is that you plan to sell the house in less than 7 years...

It seems that I/O loans have a bad reputation, but for most people buying a starter home in an ultra low interest rate environment, I don’t understand why the default position would be to lock in a 30yr rate that you have no intention of keeping for anywhere near 30yrs....

I’m sure there will be arguments around over extending yourself with lower payments, etc etc, so for the sake of the financial argument let’s assume you have  plenty of money in the bank, good cash flow, whatever..",finance

financialindependence,Let's talk inflation. Am I REALLY losing money to inflation?,"TLDR, I have a LOT of money in savings making 2%, and wondering if I'm really losing money to inflation or making dumb decisions given my personal situation.  Note that I am already maxing out IRA, HSA, and buying VTSAX monthly.  But my focus is on generating somewhat-passive income.  I am already somewhat FI as my passive income almost covers my expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, variety is the spice of life in all aspects: my hobbies, careers, my investments, etc.  As a result I have found myself in careers that have some inherent risks or volatility.  I do engineering consulting through my own LLC, I also got into rental properties before I found the FIRE group, and I have a 3rd side business selling a product on Amazon.  The point is that ALL of my sources of income could slow down or die off for periods of time.  Highly unlikely that they would all bottom out at the same time, but you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the sale of one of my rental houses, and profits from the rest of my work, I have a large amount of cash in a money market account drawing 2% interest.  This is a recent thing, hasn't been in there years or anything.  I don't think it's best to dump all that into VTSAX at this all-time high.  I also think you'll agree that I NEED a certain amount liquid (or in short-term investments) because of the volatility of my income sources.  I own 5 total homes (my own and 4 rentals) that could each need substantial amounts at any given time due to vacancies, damage that doesnt fall under home insurance, etc.  I could also see myself buying a few more rentals with this savings if I found great deals.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the market will likely return more than the 2% max savings account in the next year or two.  But maybe it won't.  The way I look at this, I am taking the profits from all of my work and adding another 2% to my returns.  And I have 3 mortgages with interest rates locked in, which are completely unaffected by inflation.  These mortgages combined are for more than what's in the savings account.  So the buying power of my saved $ will never worsen in that regard, meaning at any time I could spend it to pay down debt and not lose anything to inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

Does any of this make sense, or am I just trying to justify being ultra conservative with the savings?  What are your limits as to what you keep liquid, and your thoughts on inflation?",finance

investing,Why is everybody claiming that inflation is not picking up solely because money is being invested opposed to being spent?,"I feel that so many analysts and experts are making this argument, the last was [Ray Dalio just last week on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/)

I really can't figure out why is this the case, given that money invested ends up in either :

1) Other investors wallets as per every purchase there has to be a sale

2) Companies raising money with debt or equity

3) The federal or state governments raising money with bonds and T bills

It seems to me that in each and everyone of those scenarios the money actually arrives to spenders, or at least to people who are more likely to have a very high Spending/Investment ratio.

It seems to me that as long as the money remains in the US banking system it would eventually find its way to spenders, as even in the worse scenario of cash hoarding by institutions and high net worth individuals the mechanism of money creation by commercial banks would get the money in the hands of spenders via loans. The latter would then spend the money even if that's just at the end of the chain of events.",finance
personalfinance,How to choose what loan to pay the most on?,"I am looking for some advice on balancing out payments for my different loans and the smartest way to pay them down.  I track the interest rates on each loan, the remaining balance, and monthly payment.  Typically I put a few hundred ($2-300) extra towards the loan that has the highest interest rate to knock down the principal **and** pay 10% over the minimum towards principal on everything else.  Since the debts we have are always changing, I am looking for a tool, equation, or train of thought that I can use going forward.  I have an example of some loans below to play around with the numbers.

As a secondary question, if you had a sum of money come in say $3000 for discussion. If you want to use it all towards paying off debt how would you do it with the scenario below?

personalfinance,Refinancing a USDA loan with much higher valuation,"Five years ago, when I bought my home, I got a USDA loan that rolled what was essentially mortgage insurance into the life of the loan (it can never be dropped).

personalfinance,After Tax Contributions: 401K vs. IRA vs. Brokerage,"Okay; the car isn't part of the question.

I have been maxing out the Federal pre-tax contribution for about 15 years (there is an employer match to boot). Each year, it takes less (by percentage) to hit the federal maximum. As a result, I typically contribute to a brokerage account where I invest in a variety of index funds, stocks, ETFs, etc.

* I have NOT contributed after tax to my 401K.
* I have NOT contributed to an IRA.

My rationale, in addition to saving for my kids’ college in a 529 plan, the brokerage account is intended to fund any 529/college gaps as well as early retirement (I am on track to retiring at 55 vs. 59.5).

personalfinance,Which Index Fund should I pick? Need advice,"I am deciding between FFNOX (Four in One Index Fund) and FXNAX (U.S. Bond Index Fund). I already have money in FXAIX (S&amp;P 500 Index Fund), and I am looking to make an equal contribution in one of those 2 funds.

I am a 20 year old that has just started investing this year, using a Roth IRA.

FFNOX:

48% S&amp;P 500 index fund

12% Extended U.S. market

25% International equities

15% U.S. Bond Index fund

Overall, I feel that this fund is still heavily based on equities, and it would still move generally in the same direction as the S&amp;P 500 fund. However, it has provided great historic returns and is a 5-star on Morningstar.

FXNAX:

44% U.S. Treasury Bonds

1% U.S. Agency

4% Other U.S. Government

23% Corporate Bonds

25% MBS Pass-Through

2% CMBS

So this is bond fund, and I think it should be steady since I don't see any interest rate movements in the near future. Seems less risky, but of course lower returns.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance? Do these closing costs look right?,"I bought a house last year in December 2018 for 235,000 with three percent down at an interest rate of 4.875. My total amount paid every month is 1,754. I have recently contacted the company I took out my mortgage with and they have offered me a refinance down to a rate of 3.99. My current balance on my loan is 224,999.  By refinancing my payment would drop to 1,581, thus saving 174 dollars per month. The costs for this loan are as follows,

Processing Fee-570

Underwriting Fee-425

Appraisal Fee- 525  

Credit Report-100

Flood Certification-13

Title-Abstract or Title Search Fee-160

Title-Closing Protection Letter-150

Title-Courier Fee-30

Title-Lender's Title Insurance-1790

Title-Notary Fee-25

Title-Tax Status Research Fee-50

Title-Endorsement Fee-150

Title-Wire Transfer Fee-25

All this comes out to a total loan cost of 4,013.

On top of this there is also other costs/ my new escrow fund which are as follows-

Recording Fees and other Taxes-400

Prepaid interest (25.47 per day for 26 days at 3.99%)-662

Initial escrow payment at closing Homeowners 68.75 for two months-138 and property taxes 347.25 for 8 months-2778

Total Other Costs-3978

Total Closing Costs-7,991.  

This would be rolled on to my new loan which would bring my balance up to about 233,000. Per the loan officer, these costs are only estimates and the closing costs will ""most likely be lower"". I specifically asked about reducing the title insurance of 1790 as its within a year of my original mortgage and I was told they will most likely offer a discounted rate as it is within a year.  I was also told I will be getting my original escrow fund back which is about 1800 dollars.   If I go with this loan I wont be making my first mortgage payment until February 2019 which would give me two months without a mortgage. My thinking was that I would take the 1800 I would get back in my escrow refund from my previous loan as well as take my mortgage payments I would have paid for December and January- (1754X2)=3,508 and make a lump payment towards the principle of about 5300 plus my mortgage payment for Feb in order to bring my principle closer to its original balance. Then after that continue to make my original mortgage payment of 1754 which I am comfortable making on the refinanced mortgage thereby increasing my principle payment by 174 dollars a month.  At that rate I will break even in about 15 months or so and be back to what my principle balance is now.  My question is, does this make financial/fiscal sense? I plan to be in this house for the next 7-10 years.  Also, do the closing cost estimates and escrow charges seem reasonable? I am in PA if that makes a difference.

I'm starting to worry as it becomes time to think about life after college (jobs, where I want to live, etc.). I go to school 12 hours away from home (East Coast US), so most job opportunities are in the same area as the school (Midwest US) or further west. Obviously, living at home would be economical and it wouldn't require rent payments, only a $100-200 a month to contribute to food, internet, etc.

I've amassed around $70,000 in student loans. (\~$31,000 in federal and \~$39,000 in private through Sallie Mae). The starting rate for my ideal job (structural engineer/MEP engineer) is anywhere from $60-90k at most places I look. I don't have much savings (\~$1750 so far), about $1200 in a checking account for any expenses (gas, food, etc.) and have been working part-time (\~$400/month roughly, sometimes $500) during the school year and plan to until graduation in May.

Any advice on where to start regarding budget and getting everything on track for when graduation comes so I don't feel like I'm completely sinking. I know student loans are going to hit me hard, anything I can do to prepare?

I don't think I'll be able to gather 4-6 months of an emergency fund by May, but I have the savings which I don't plan to touch until then if need be.

personalfinance,Does financing a late-model vehicle make sense in our case?,"I know late model vehicles are typically a bad choice for financing, given the accelerated depreciation. As we're about to look into buying a second car, I'm trying to get a sense of what we should budget or plan for.

**Key Details on our Financial Picture:**  
Income: $320K (dual) + bonuses and RSUs that total another $25-30k/year  
House Payment: PITI is $7.5K (yowza) at 3.25%, 30yr fixed, and we have about 900K in owned equity at the moment.  
Car Payment #1: $262/mo (2.3% rate on a 2015 RAV4), bought 2 years ago, 1 more year left to pay  
Car Insurance: $70/mo for two people  
Utilities: Internet + phones paid by employers, electric + water tend to run another $50-100/mo

No other monthly obligations aside from that. We've got healthy retirement accounts for having spent much of our 20s in grad school (still building of course but \~$175K) and are planning on some home renovations (mostly DIY but will eat up a lot of our non e-fund savings).

We are ALSO are about to have a kid.  That will put a major cramp in our savings ability for the next 4-5 years, as daycare in our area tends to run $2.5k/mo per kid on the cheap end. 

We've been making do with 1 car so far -- the interest rate is low and when it's just the two of us, we can get by with a single car. Now that we're having a kid and I'll be on mat leave and then likely need some more flexibility than public transit will allow to make daycare pickups &amp; drop offs work, we're thinking it's time to get a second car. 

**What I prioritize in our next car:** Safety, reliability, money.  Besides that, tbh, I really don't care.  
**What my husband prioritizes in our next car:** Safety, money, cool features (e.g., moonroof, Android auto, nothing too crazy). He's less worried about reliability since he can do a lot of maintenance himself.

We tend to drive our cars into the ground -- we are definitely not ""trade up"" people. The only time I've ever actually traded in a car was for an 18 year old clunker where the trade in value was mostly for the scrap (even though it did still drive, just not reliably, and maintenance costs were getting out of hand).  We expect to keep our current car until it dies or costs more to maintain than it's worth. We're also expecting to pay a lot out of pocket in the next 2-3 years for home renovations.

I'm wondering, given the above, if it makes sense to go against the PF advice and finance a late model car. Two questions there:

**1) Is it worth it to buy a used car that's 2-3 years old, instead of a car thats 5-6 years old?**   
Definitely not planning on buying new (no interest in drive-it-off-the-lot depreciation) but looking around, seems doable to get a 2017 or 2018 sedan in the $15K range (e.g. Kia Optima or Hyundai Elantra). I'm torn because I know the most significant depreciation is in the first 3 years, but given that we are planning on keeping this car for the long term, perhaps we'll appreciate having the later model car and a few more years of use? Additionally, a later model might have more features that come standard that make my husband happy. 

**2) Is it worth it to finance this purchase instead of paying cash?**  
We have enough cash on hand to buy a \~$15K car outright but would prefer to put that money toward near-horizon renovations or otherwise keep it liquid in case of an unexpected and high-impact home repair. Our salaries could easily cover another car and insurance payment at the level we're paying now. Auto rates have gone up since we bought the RAV4, but we should be able to qualify for a prime rate and I can't imagine we'd be paying more than 4-5%.  We could definitely put down enough that I wouldn't worry about being underwater on the car, but I'm questioning whether it makes sense to pay cash entirely.",finance

personalfinance,"Closing debt accounts, unsure of where to allocate the extra money.","Hey all! 

A quick background on me: 32, extremely HCOL area, healthily employed. Have paid down about $15k in debt and saved/invested another $10k this year and am really proud of the progress. 

I graduated with a ton of debt, but have been making lots of progress in regards to paying stuff off, including multiple extra payments each month. I’ve also been able to put aside money to cover three month’s expenses in a separate savings account (vs. virtually nothing at the beginning of the year), and have been putting away about 10% of my take home into a Roth IRA (the current employer doesn’t have any sort of retirement program. I work as a bartender). 

In a month or so, I’ll be able to close on a couple loan accounts (most of them being student debt), which will give me around $300/month extra to allocate somewhere else that would’ve been going towards those payments. 

In my industry and location, November and December are months I could potentially double my yearly gross income since it’s super super busy, and I’ll have plenty more expendable money to play with. Since my income is determinate on tips, budgeting is a little different since it’s inconsistent (instead of having a consistent salary). I was also part of a class action settlement that’ll give me a check of around $2k coming any day now. 

I think the obvious answer is to (1.) use that to start aggressively paying off more debt at higher interest rates, but it’s also appealing to want to (2.) max out my Roth contributions for the year, and I’m creeping up towards (3.) having an emergency fund to cover six months.

My question is this: which of the three would you take priority over? Which should take priority?",finance
personalfinance,Does Penfed still do the 5/5 ARM Rate Reset offer?,"I have a 5/5 ARM mortgage with Penfed. It's due to reset in July 2020. Current rate is 3%. The max rate it can reset to is 5% (2% max increase per 5yr).  It will reset at ( [5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS5) \+ 2%)

If it reset today, the new rate would be 3.75%. But if it reset a week ago, it would be 3.3%. (which would be very nice). I remember hearing about Penfed offering the ability to lock in the new rate like 6\~9 months ahead of time the scheduled reset.

Does Penfed still do this? When/how should I expect the offer from Penfed? Do I need to do anything special to help this happening? Do I even want to preemptively lock in a rate ahead of the scheduled rate change? (This leads to larger discussion of if The Fed is planning any more rate cuts or increases between now and July. Is the 5 yr constant maturity treasury even linked to what The Fed does?).

personalfinance,Worried about moving in with boyfriend. What do I need to know regarding his financial situation?,"My boyfriend and I (both in our mid 20s) recently discussed moving in together but I have some concerns. I want to make sure I have all the information in order to make an informed decision. Neither of us have lived on our own before.



What information do I need before I make this move? I would like to know his income, his typical monthly spending, and his planned expenses for school. Is this reasonable?




My boyfriend told me that he does not know how much money he makes in a year. He told me that he does not have his W2 or last year’s tax return. He gives these documents to his father who does his taxes for him. He doesn’t seem to look at his pay stubs. For months he told me that he earned $12 or $13 per hour at a fast food place. We looked at the pay stub together recently and found out that he was actually earning $11 per hour. 




In July he began working at an internship earning $10 per hour for 37 hours per week in addition to working at the fast food place. He plans to quit the fast food job in December but doesn’t have another job lined up yet. He says that he wants to continue working at the internship for 3 years to get experience. 




He has a 529 plan from his parents to pay for college but hasn’t taken classes in a year. He said that the 529 “doesn’t cover everything” and he has to pay for some expenses out of pocket. He will be 26 in two months and doesn’t have plans for getting his own health insurance once he is no longer eligible to stay on his parents’ plan. His credit score is 547 and he is only able to get a secured credit card. He lives with his uncle and his uncle’s significant other. His uncle has asked him to move out by December 2019, but my boyfriend doesn’t have concrete plans for where he will live next. My boyfriend doesn’t track his spending. I have offered to help him make a budget several times, but he never follows up. He says that he has some savings, but my guess is that it is less than $2,000. As far as I know, he has no debt.




I lent him $900 for car repairs (engine) over the summer. I did this because he didn’t have the money and was about to sign up for a loan with a ridiculously high interest rate to cover the cost (I think it was 50% interest after three months, but I don't remember exactly). However, he now needs $2,000 to repair the air conditioning and he is not able to afford it.





I am very anxious about moving in with him. I like to plan ahead but I don’t have a clear picture of his financial situation at all so I don’t know what we could afford if we lived together. I have no clue how he will be able to afford rent, living expenses, insurance premiums, and college classes. I don’t know how he will manage classes and two jobs. It is possible that if he does not find a second job in January, he may end up only earning money from the internship. I worry that he doesn’t have an emergency fund large enough to cover things like medical emergencies or car repairs. I’m not even sure if he plans to get health insurance. 




A one-bedroom apartment in my area is at least $1,400 but it is much more common to see $1,600 or more. My boyfriend wants to move into a two-bedroom apartment.




I work full time and earn $50,000 gross at my current job. After taxes and deductions, my take home pay was $38,000 last year. However, I will be contributing $2,700 to my FSA for healthcare expenses in 2020 so my monthly take home will be lower. I currently live with relatives. I have a 12 month emergency fund, track all of my spending on an app, and have a FICO score of 796. 




What are some important things that I need to know before we agree to move in together? I worry that he can’t really afford to live on his own right now, even if I am paying half of the living expenses.",finance

personalfinance,Lab that my pain clinic uses billed me almost 4 months later for $1600+. What can I do?,"Hello!

First time ever posting but I'm really lost on what to do.
So just some backstory to understand this situation...

   I got into an accident in 2012 which resulted in a slap tear(labrum tear) to my left shoulder. After 2 surgeries and 3 years of physical therapy my shoulder was deemed as a permanent injury with having pain management to regulate the pain. I can't raise it above my chest nor do the hitch hiker motion(Arm out and in a 90 degree angle). The dull pain is about a 6 and when I move it it can create a sharp pain that's about a 8.

   Fast forward to today- I'm currently on pain medication twice a day just to have a good quality of life and being able to work. I live in Hawaiian and the island I'm on doesn't have too man pain clinics here. The first clinic I went to was a 1.5hr drive one way. 
 At the beginning of the year I decided to go to the pain clinic in town due to the head doctor changing(didn't like him). I talked to them quite extensively asking them about what urine tests they use because my insurance deductible is high. They assured me it was a simple drug screening that didn't cost that much. One of their rules was that they need to urine test EVERY visit due to federal rules. I know that was giant bullshit cause the testing can be once a year minimum, but in hawaii most clinics had that rule.
   I agreed to everything.

  On 9/6 I received a bill from the lab they used stating that I owe $1600+ for the urine tests. The urine tests in question date back to May to June, even though I gave urine test for every monthly visit.
Those tests were shown as:
Benzo Test
Heroin
Amphetamines
PCP
Synthetic Stimulants
Muscle Relaxants
Morphine
Zolpidem
Buprenorphine 
Oxycodone
Opioids and Opiate analogs;1 or 2
Alkaloids
Drug Tests Presumptive Qualitative.

   All of the individual tests were $36.55-38.08 and the Drug Tests Presumptive Qualitative was listed at $167.10.
 
   So I got those tests for 3 months which equated to $531 per lab result after some adjustments were made by my health insurance. 
  I called the pain clinic asking what the hell this bill was and I was told that this is the type of testing they do.
  I then called the labs and after stating my problem they told me that the Doctor is the only one that can retract the charges. 
So I end up going to the clinic to talk in person. After waiting a bit I talked to the main doctor there asking if she could help me by retracting some of these tests. She showed no remorse towards my problem. She stated that I'm responsible for those charges because I signed a waiver saying that they are allowed to drug test me. She also lied to my face by saying ""The lab is the one who picks what test to use"" because I know its the doctors who order the tests. I then asked her ""What about my pain medication?"", she says that she wont prescribe a prescription if I cant take a urine test. I walk out steaming.

   After that whole thing happened, I've been trying to call the doctor to get her to retract the charges but she hasn't responded back. I have called 3 times a week since then and now its 11/11.
 Also after I showed up in person I called the pain clinic office and lab office to tell them to not do any testing on my urine for the 8/27 visit(My last visit). They agreed, but two days ago (11/9) I received another bill from the lab showing that they tested the urine on 8/27 visit. So my current bill is now up to $1,888.

   I can't believe a single Doctor, who doesn't have a single concern about her patient, can mess up both their credit and quality of life.
Due to her cutting me off from my medications I went through withdrawals that almost sent me to the ER. 

  So I'm posting here trying to find guidance on what to do. So far I have reported her to RICO(Regulated Industries Complaints Office) and in the process of talking to my health insurance fraud division. I honestly don't want to pay for something I didn't agree too, especially after being treated like this. 
  I wish I could go to another pain clinic but that clinic is the only one on this side on the island. My previous clinic is filled and not taking any more patients.
   It's hard for me to work when I'm in pain. If I can't work then I can't pay bills. Life is just too hard at this point. Also, just in case someone says to use alternative pain management sources, I've tried them all. Everything under the rainbow, THC, CBD(1000+), yoga, etc.

I have money in savings, retirement, and in the stock market, none of which I would like to touch.  I am planning on refinancing my mortgage into a 15 year fixed rate, and I believe I should be able to get a much lower rate with the fed rate cuts.  

Would it be possible to refinance for an amount that is larger than the amount I currently owe on my mortgage?  Is it possible to refinance for an amount that would cover most if not all of my student loans?  Not sure what my options are here, or if it's even possible, I was just thinking could potentially make life much easier if I had the ability to do so.

Any advice is welcome.

Google is engaged with one of the country’s largest health-care systems to collect and crunch the detailed personal health information of millions of Americans across 21 states.

The initiative, code-named “Project Nightingale,” appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven’t yet struck deals of this scope.

Google began the effort in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the second-largest health system in the U.S., with the data sharing accelerating since summer, the documents show.

The data involved in Project Nightingale encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth.

Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents.

Some Ascension employees have raised questions about the way the data is being collected and shared, both from a technological and ethical perspective, according to the people familiar with the project. But privacy experts said it appeared to be permissible under federal law. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, generally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used “only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.”

Google in this case is using the data, in part, to design new software, underpinned by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, that zeroes in on individual patients to suggest changes to their care. Staffers across Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent, have access to the patient information, documents show, including some employees of Google Brain, a research science division credited with some of the company’s biggest breakthroughs.

In a press release issued after the Journal’s article was published, the companies said the project is compliant with federal health law and includes robust protections for patient data.

Tech giants like Amazon and Apple are expanding their businesses to include electronic health records -- which contain data on diagnoses, prescriptions and other medical information. That’s creating both opportunities and spurring privacy concerns. Here’s what to know. Photo Composite: Heather Seidel/ The Wall Street Journal

Google Cloud president Tariq Shaukat said in the release that the company’s goal in health care centers on “ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives.”

“As the healthcare environment continues to rapidly evolve, we must transform to better meet the needs and expectations of those we serve as well as our own caregivers and healthcare providers,” said Eduardo Conrado, an executive vice president at Ascension.

Google and nonprofit Ascension have parallel financial motives. Google has assigned dozens of engineers to Project Nightingale so far, without charging for the work, because it hopes to use the framework to sell similar products to other health systems. Its end goal is to create an omnibus search tool to aggregate disparate patient data and host it all in one place, documents show.

The project is being developed under Google’s cloud division, which trails rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in market share. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said repeatedly this year that finding new areas of growth for cloud is a priority.

Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, aims in part to improve patient care. It also hopes to mine data to identify additional tests that could be necessary or other ways in which the system could generate more revenue from patients, documents show. Ascension is also eager for a faster system than its existing decentralized electronic record-keeping network.

Google, like many of its Silicon Valley peers, has at times drawn criticism for not doing enough to protect user privacy. Its YouTube unit agreed in September to pay $170 million in fines and make changes to its practices in response to complaints that it illegally collected data on children to sell ads. YouTube neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google hid a flaw that exposed hundreds of thousands of birth dates, contact information and other personal data of subscribers in its now-defunct social-networking website Google Plus, in part because of fears that the incident could trigger regulatory scrutiny. Google said at the time it went beyond legal requirements in determining not to inform users.",finance

personalfinance,Having trouble deciding the best strategy for getting out of student debt,"Hi, I'm 22, employed full time as an Engineer for the New Jersey Department of Transportation (Graduated in May, Started in July).

My income is currently $58,700 per year and will be making around $61,000 by next July. My employer has a mandatory pension contribution of 7.5% pre-tax and requires 30 years of service for full pension benefits (haha). This won't happen as I plan to go into Aerospace after a year or two of engineering experience and will just transfer what I accumulated in my pension fund to my next employers 401k and do the maximum matching contribution. Also, since I still live at home (free food/rent) the expenses below are my only monthly expenses besides girlfriend and going out (which I try not to go too crazy with).

I am trying to formulate the optimal plan to get out of student debt as quickly as possible and begin building wealth. I currently have these liabilities:

    - $77,000 in student private student debt which I refinanced recently to a 20-year term at a 5.877% interest rate.    - $28,000 in federal student debt at a rate of about 4.5% (10-year repayment begins in January 2020).    - A $375 for 60mo car payment at 4.39% and $200 insurance payment. (I shopped around ALOT for insurance, it should go down by next March when I renew my premium but this is just because it's my first time having my own insurance.)    - $2641.68 in credit card debt that I'm currently NOT paying interest on. (and never will, it'll be paid off before the 0% intro APR ends)    - TOTAL LIABILITIES/month: $1447.39  

Assets:

    - 19 shares of $AMTD purchased at $38.66 currently worth $764.56   - 1 share of $SNAP purchased at $15.23 currently worth $14.38   - 20 shares of $EPD purchased at $26.31 currently worth $522.00   - 12 shares of $STOR purchased at $39.04 currently worth $471.24   - 48.445 shares of $BGSIX (Mutual Fund) purchased at $33.03 currently worth $1647.13   - $1689.49 in my checking account   - TOTAL ASSETS: $5108.8

financialindependence,Inflation is not a single number. Let's talk about it.,"I have been thinking a lot about inflation lately.  I think we all look at it way too simply.

The typical view of inflation is like some magic number.  We simply assume: inflation goes up 2-3% per year, so costs go up 2-3% per year.  This is mainly based on the Fed; the Fed targets 2% inflation per year and manipulates interest rates to achieve it.

But it's not nearly as simple as that.  Inflation is dramatically different in different categories. Really, 'inflation' is no one thing, but is based on a formula called CPI, that weighs a bunch of different cost categories together, tracks their inflation separately, and produces a weighed average number which we call total inflation (by CPI).


When you break it down...[here's a full chart by category](http://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pricechanges.png).  Inflation looks like *this*, and averages to around 2% per year.

Assuming the ""overall"" number is roughly 2%/year... Healthcare and childcare have skyrocketed way faster than ""2% inflation"", and housing has slightly beat it.  However, housing is highly localized, and I'd argue that housing *has* skyrocketed past inflation in in-demand markets and simply lost value in low-demand markets enough to drag down the average.

 But we had 2% inflation because cars, household furnishings, and clothing had *zero* inflation, and technology has had *negative* inflation, driving down the statistics.

[Planet Money/NPR did a good podcast episode on the String Quartet Theory](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/757257796/how-a-string-quartet-explains-healthcare-costs) of inflation, which is basically that since increasing productivity increases supply, inflation will be naturally much higher in an industry where efficiency/productivity increases are not logically possible at high rates.  For example, the cost of a String Quartet has increased much more than 2% a year.  Why?  Well, a violin player can't play more than one violin at once.  By this theory, it's perfectly logical that Education, Healthcare, and Housing go up faster than ""inflation"".  Teachers can't teach more students at the same time, Doctors can't see more patients at once, and you can't create more land (and zoning laws constrict building vertically). 

Inflation being ""2%"" is a composite average.  If tech has negative inflation (gets cheaper every year), food has 0% inflation (efficiency increases counteract wage increases), and housing/healthcare/education have 4-6% inflation, (making up simple numbers) the fed is technically hitting the 2% average.

By this logic...we might expect these items to inflate in price...at *higher* than inflation...indefinitely for the forseeable future.  While things like food might underperform inflation indefinitely.  And this is perfectly fine and consistent with ""2% annual inflation"".

-----------


How does this apply to FIRE?

A couple ways.


For one, I think that it adds weight to the argument towards buying a house.  A lot of people do rent vs buy analysis' and in many regions (especially HCOL areas) have terrible cost/benefit analysis (landlords make extremely small returns in those areas, as well), and owning also hurts your opportunity costs.  But...the inflation protection is huge.  It's a cost people don't account for.  If we can expect housing costs to grow at faster-than-inflation indefinitely- *or even at inflation*- there's a great argument towards homeownership.


Look at it this way; if you retire early, and own a house...you're exempt from most of the inflation categories.  [Look at the chart again.](http://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pricechanges.png)  You're not going to go to college again, so you can throw that part out.  If you have kids, you have time to not hire a sitter.  And your cost of housing is *locked*; even if you still have a loan, the 30-year mortgage won't grow in cost.  In ten years you're still paying the same for principal and interest.  The *2% inflation* figure is an average of all of those categories, but *several of them don't apply to you now...*


Which means that for someone who is FIRE *and owns a house*...the only thing that actually inflates is healthcare and food.  We always assume the current 2% inflation trend continues; what if we assume *the sub-trends* continue too?  Food and beverage inflate at 2% per year.  Cars inflate at 0% per year.  Almost *everything else you buy* has negative inflation.  *Excepting healthcare*, your *personal* rate of inflation would actually be *negative*; everything you buy *except food* would get cheaper every year, and food would only be at 2%.  Of course, healthcare eventually becomes a big expense.  But the reality is that since you don't experience many of the things factored into the CPI (education, childcare, housing)...

Your cost of living would almost certainly rise by *less* than 2% annually, if you own your house.  That means that if you are following the Trinity study- raising your estimated spending by 2% per year- you might actually be conservative.  Your expenses will probably grow by *less* than 2% per year.


But if you rent, you'll probably be experiencing inflation closer to 2%.



**tl;dr:** Everything inflates at different rates, 2% inflation is an average.  A person who is FIRE and owns a house actually skips *most* of the product categories that inflate faster than 2%, so 2% inflation might actually be quite conservative; we might see our money going further and further each year, if we own a house.",finance

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to just get rid of this car and finance a newer (but used) one? So many headaches...,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

I bought a 2001 legacy L back in June with 160k miles on it, since I started a new job as a consultant and I needed a car immediately the weekend before being staffed on a 'local' project a 45 min commute away (a majority of the people for my company travel by plane for projects, so I did not have a car when I moved in March because that is what I assumed...but oh well). Honestly, I wanted the most affordable and reliable option I could get, as soon as possible. I did not want to finance a car at the time since I had just graduated college and had some medical debt (but no student loans).

Overall, this car has been nothing but trouble. Between buying a new radiator, fixing the AC, fixing the fender liner, the headlights, getting an engine flush, corrosion on the battery, fixing the left turn signal, getting new snow tires,random check engine lights, and getting a nail stuck in the tire, I have already been fed up with it. I really like how the car itself drives and looks, but it has been so much hassle and stress. The final straw today was when it stalled out and died in the middle of a turning lane. The shift was stuck too, so I couldn't move the car out of traffic either. The police had to come help block off the lane so that the car did not get hit. Two hours later in the freezing cold, the tow truck finally came. And now I am back in my apartment and thinking about financing a more reliable, newer car.

I am just stuck on what to do. If it's just a dying battery or something then ok fine, but I am worried about this happening again, or something worse on my long commute. Is it even worth the hassle anymore? Should I just sell it on Craigslist and call it a day?

I purchased this for $3200 back in June, and have spent over $1k in repairs and maintenance since then. I make enough money where financing is an option, but I also don't want to go too crazy either.  I make $77,500 base per year before bonuses; pre-tax income of 91.5k. My biggest expense is rent at $1400, followed by healthcare as I have several autoimmune disorders. Credit score around 715 average; relatively new to credit with average account age of 2 years. Only debt I currently have is some medical debt, around $3k.  I appreciate any advice you can give.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin vs 8 little dudes (aka The Federal Reserve),"People always knock bitcoin about ""not being backed by anything"". Hardly anyone speaks of the current US dollar which is created by 8 little dudes out of thin air. What are these federal Reserve ""notes"" backed by? Silver? No. Gold? No. Anything physical? No. 


These notes printed out by these 8 little dudes are only backed by more ""I owe you"" notes.  When can they type out more I owe you notes? Whenever they damn well please. 

Are these 8 little dudes who control hundreds of banks bound to be loyal to the US? No. Have they taken an oath to do what is best for the US? No. Yet, these 8 little dudes create digital money that people die for. Will any of these 8 little dudes put themselves in harms way for their ""I owe You's""? Hell no. Why should they, when they can print out an unlimited amount?

Are these 8 little dudes transparent by openly sharing everything with the world? NO. Will they limit themselves to how much money they print out of thin air? No. 

This whole thing is a sham, a con, a gimmick, a trick, to gain mass power for these 8 little dudes. People are dying for what they create. People are killing for what they create. These 8 little dudes are laughing their asses off endlessly at us fools for letting them get away with such foolery since 1913. Why have we let these little dudes do this? Why are these do-nothings given so much power? Because we give it to them. 

These 8 little dudes are the deep state. These 8 little dudes are the reason why people are revolting. They may or may not know it though. People can't firmly put their finger on what is wrong in our society... it all points to these 8 little dudes aka the federal reserve 'backed by nothing' aka king of the US.

These 8 little dudes are parasites of humanity- draining real energy and resources from this planet- for their unbacked 'I owe you' notes. They have an infinite number of I owe you notes vs a finite number of resources here on earth.

Oil will run out before their I owe yous run out.

Trees will be destroyed before they stop printing I owe you notes.

You and I would have worked our entire lives before they stop printing I owe You notes.

Every fish in the ocean will die before they stop printing notes.

It is infinite vs finite. Infinite never runs out while finite will. Infinite ability to print will never die-- It is time to Dead The Fed. 

Does the federal reserve help the poor? No. They give money to themselves, then the banks, then corporations who then buy back their own stock, keeping the cycle going endlessly. 

Vote in congressmen who will get rid of this parasite called the Federal Reserve. Many men have attempted to get rid of it, but have failed. The time is now.

These 8 little dudes have a monopoly over the creation of I owe you notes. There are many better ways this can be done, and to leave it up to 8 little dudes is a HUGE mistake. 

#DeadTheFed and make congress do their damn job or vote in people who want to. 

And of course, bitcoin is a much better option than the 8 little dudes. Hell, I'll take any cryptocurrency over these stupid 8 little dudes who back their I owe you notes with more I owe you notes... think about how silly that sounds.",cryptocurrency

btc,Shower thought: US DOLLAR is actually quite similar to the Ripple/XRP premined token.,"Recent stats indicate that around a third of domestic USD transactions are done in cash. This means that two thirds of USD payments in the USA are made via **electronic payment systems**. Furthermore, this means that no paper money changes hands, the paper money to ""back"" and settle those transactions **likely does not exist**. And when the USA Federal Reserve ""prints"" money via quantatitive easing, they're really just adding to the electronic fiat supply.

If and when cash is made illegal, or cash accounts for such a small percentage of total financial movements as to be insignificant, USA citizens will be using only a **Fed version of Ripple** (which, as most here know, is basically a premined corporate electronic Funbux token). And they're already trusting this ""Fripple"" shitcoin as if it's real money, when the supply can theoretically be inflated infinitely, without warning. Not to mention everyone's balances, full transaction history, and personal data are completely compromised, and their ""money"" can be frozen at any time for any reason. 

What remains to be seen is how long it will take people to see the difference between Fripple and real cryptocurrencies, which allow permissionless payment, without the arbitrary inflation and seizure risks.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,401k loan to pay off high interest CC?,"Hi Reddit.

Over the last few years of my life, I've been bad with money. Bad spending habits, bad new car purchase, living in a high cost of living area for the past 4 years. Binge shopping to make myself feel better. The lot. It's been bad. But now, I'm taking steps to correct it. I've moved in with mum, cut out all unnecessary purchasing, and have been at it for 2 months now. I've freed up $1200/mo that used to go to rent/utilities, which is helping me get my debt under control.

Here's the debt summary:

* **Credit Card 1:** 25.15% | $8,728 balance
* **Credit Card 2:** 25.24% | $176 balance
* **Credit Card 3:** 27.24% | $778 balance
* **Credit Card 4:** 0.00% until 08/2020 | $949 balance
* **Car Loan:** 6.55% | $9,512 | $481/mo payment.
* **Student Loan (subsidized):** 6.55% | $640.74 | $52.22/mo payment.

Total Debt: $20,784

After living expenses (phone, gas, rent, $200 for food, etc) I have about $1,500/mo to devote to these 6 things above. Obviously the car and student loan are set at a fixed amount for now, but there's no penalty for me paying more for them. CC 4 has an intro rate of 0% until August.

So far, I've been dumping all my extra income into CC's 1-3 and have nearly paid off CC 2 and 3. In December, #3 and #2 will be fully paid off and I'll transition to devoting everything I can into CC 1. But as you can see, it has a very high balance and a very high interest rate (I know, I'm stupid, but it cost a LOT to move states and it all went on that card).

Balance transfers, loan consolidation, etc is pretty much out of the question as I won't qualify for anything that would save me money.

**My Question:**

If I stay on track, I'll have CCs 1-3 paid off by July 2020 just by dumping all my spare $ into them, in time to pay off CC 4 before the interest kicks in. But I have the option to borrow $8000 from my 401k at a 5.75% interest rate and fully pay off that CC 1 in January, leaving me just with CC4, and the 2 loans. This will result in \~$632/mo payments for 12 months, and I'll end up paying $241 in interest + $54 in fees. But compared to the monthly $200 interest that CC1 is accruing, this seems worth it.

Is this a smart thing to do?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans or House Downpayment?,"I’ve been building my savings account since graduating college 2 years ago and ready to put my hard work earnings to a good cause. 

What’s a better option long term wise, pay off a large portion of student loans or save for a downpayment on a house? 

Income: 100k

Federal loans: 50k (not extremely worried about these bc rate is roughly 4%).

Consolidated private loans: 20k (5.36% rate, started at 38k. Most of this has been paid off in the last year.)

Savings: 40k

I’m also getting married in 18 months and will be paying 8-10k out of pocket. Majority of this will not have to be paid for at least a year.

If I keep saving for a downpayment while continuing current loan payments, I’ll have an additional $26k in savings in a years time. Or save $32.5k in a year, if I pay off the consolidated loans immediately.

I’m not extremely worried with the federal loans, at this moment, since they have a low interest rate. My main concern is the consolidated private loans, then start focusing on the lower interest loans.

I live in Austin, TX, and was looking at houses around $260-300k, so would need my savings basically doubled to be able to afford a 20% downpayment (might consider 15% +pmi) plus closing costs. Currently looking at housing developments that are being built, to get more energy efficient for lower utility costs. Newly built wouldn’t cost much more than what an older house would that would most likely need upgrades. The soonest I’d be looking at putting any money down for a house would be 10-12 months from now. The other benefit to buying a house to build is that not all of the downpayment would be due up front and would give about 20 months to save before final costs.

Biggest reason to consider saving for down payment over paying off loans is the price of housing increasing. The area I’ve been looking at has increased about $8k this year and will continue to rise. Would also be losing a year or two of payments on a house by paying for rent that would add up to roughly $31k.

I created a budget for if I did get the house and continued to pay off the loans and would be comfortable doing so if this is the best option. At this point, I’d increase the loan payments to get them to 0 as soon as financially responsibly possible.",finance

I'm new to PF, so if I'm not doing this right, please let me know.

I'm (24) married and my husband (23) and I both work pretty okay jobs. I'm military and my husband is a contractor. Together we bring home about $110k. 

I put 30% of my base pay into a Thrift Savings Plan which is a little more than $900 a month and it's almost to $20k.

My husband hasn't been so fortunate but is maxing out his 401k now, and has contributed about $2k to it. He wants to open a Roth IRA and max it out every year and we have the funds to do so.

We have an emergency fund for $20k.

We recently bought a home for $250k with an interest of 3.325%. So this is where we're getting differing on where to put extra funds. I want to pay extra on the mortgage to pay off the house faster, but the husband wants to invest the ""extra payment"" into something like a money market because we'd make more money off it compared to paying off the house faster.

My argument is that we'd make money off of paying the mortgage off faster (estimated 10-15 years faster) and not only would the house be paid off faster, we'd have extra 10-15 years to invest into whatever while essentially reducing the amount of interest we owe for the mortgage. It also provides me a sense of security. Owing that kind of money to bank makes me uncomfortable.

His argument is that if we invested the money into anything with a higher interest rate than the mortgage, we'd make more money for retirement or whatever else we would want the invested money for, for the life of the mortgage or retirement.

In Need For Speed Heat, EA tried to solve a problem from previous games. Cops chasing you in NFS 2015 and Payback weren't very hard so they ramped up the difficulty of the cops for Heat. Now just about everyone is complaining about them being too hard.

personalfinance,How much should we contribute towards re-casting our loan?,"My wife and I are in a conundrum. We recently moved and used a Bridge loan in the process. Long story short, we had to use our savings to cover the closing costs of the new house while our old house sold. 

Now that our old house sold, we have an extra $44k that we can decide what to do with. Our mortgage company said we can re-cast our mortgage with any amount over $5k. Our current mortgage is $250k with a 3.39% rate on a 30 year fixed.

We have a lot of future goals. We'd like to pay in full for our next vehicle. We want to leave the option open to send our two boys to private schools. Also, the new house has its original roof as well as 2 AC units and 2 furnace units that are original. So all of those will likely need to be replaced at some point soon too. We'd like to replenish our savings/emergency fund. Plus, ultimately, we'd like to pay extra on our mortgage payments and pay the house off early. We were targeting the 10-15 range to pay it off.

Originally, we wanted to put a lot of money towards the re-casting since that directly drops the principal amount. But now we are thinking that we should put a smaller amount towards the re-casting since the interest rate is so low on it and save the rest to cover those upcoming costs when they come up.

Any insights into this would be appreciated.",finance

After graduating college I had in my name about $30,000 taken out in student loans. My parents had about $90,000 taken out in ""Parents PLUS loans"". I have agreed to pay for college, and now that I have been out of college since May of last year, the payment of about $1500 a month are really getting to me. I want to look into consolidating the loans, and my only thought would be to go through the federal student aid website. Honestly though, I have no clue what I am doing and neither of my parents or really anyone in my family have gone to college so we are totally lost as to how to go about this. I would assume that they would have to sign the loans over to my name, right? And from there, it almost seems as though even though they are through different companies (mine Navient, theirs Nelnet), it seems as though it's as easy as plugging in the numbers and studentloans . gov spitting out a payment plan for me. I guess what I'm asking for is how to go about this, from start to finish, explain like I'm 5 level, because I truly cannot afford to make any mistakes and really want my monthly payments to go down even a fraction and knock down some of the interest.

personalfinance,I make car lease payments in absentee owner's name,"I am a French National with a green card (I do not know if this matters). Leased the car Feb. 2017 at a used car dealership through a friend (let’s call him Bob) because my credit score was too low. Title is in Bob’s name and I make payments to Bob. Financing was through Bob’s bank. Insurance and registration is in my name which I pay directly to the insurance company and DMV.

I have regularly made payments on the car to Bob (directly to his bank, cash or check made out to Bob) and not missed a single payment.

Around Feb/Mar 2019 I couldn’t get ahold of Bob so I couldn’t pay him. So on April 2019 my car got towed for non-payment. I paid out of my own pocket to get the car out of impound.

I got ahold of Bob’s brother (let’s call him Tim) to try and get Bob’s new contact info. Tim gave me Bob’s new phone number and I continued making payments to Bob this time through Venmo.

When we reconnected Bob said he will be gone for awhile for personal reasons in Africa. Since then I have been paying Bob through Venmo, which he receives. I have also been taking screen shots and sending them to Bob via WhatsApp.

After the car towing incident I texted Bob and Tim if the payments that I am sending are getting sent to the bank. Bob did not respond. Tim stated that he and Bob are not on great terms either and that Bob can get a little weird.

On July 2019 I got fired from my job and will be relocating to another state. I would like to sell the car so I texted and called Bob and Tim that I would like a letter or document stating that the lease title be transferred to my name.

$275 / month since Feb. 2017. Downpayment of around $2500 (I don’t remember). Total price of car is around $16,000. Sorry I don’t recall the interest rate either. I am guessing I have about 1.5 to 2 years worth of payments left over on the lease.

What can or should I do to be able to sell the car? Thank you for reading.

personalfinance,Is refinancing your mortgage ever a good idea?,"I've been receiving a lot of refinancing offers in the mail and typically just ignore them, but looking at their estimated monthly payments makes me curious sometimes. I honestly dont know much about it but have always heard it's a bad idea.

Right now our mortgage is around $1,275 before taxes, insurance, and fees. Interest rate is 4.75%, and we've lived in the house for about a year and a half. Credit has definitely increased since we took out our loan.

One of the estimates I received says it's a 2.875% rate (3.652% APR). And my payment would be $1,017 or $1,154 with a $27,500 cash out. That sounds pretty nice, and too good to be true to me. I looked up the company and they seem reputable, and it makes sense if the rate is really that low.

I am 29 years old and $26k of my credit card debt that is currently at 0%, will become a 30% interest rate starting in Dec. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. I had become completely mentally unstable and chose to spend my savings, over the next 2 years, paying off the rest of a $10k school loan and for living expenses so I could focus on stabilizing my health. It paid off because I have stabilized and am now ready to work full time again :)

I have worked some but very little during those 2 years. Probably an average of $800/month. Given my qualifications and job availability in my area (I am a software engineer), I expect to get a job that pays $80k (around $58k after taxes) by February. In the meantime I will do some freelance work and prep for technical interviews.

My current monthly expenses that cover the bare minimum are about $1800, not including credit card fees.

I have enough to survive the next 3 months on cash alone.

My credit score has dropped significantly in the past few months from 750 to 672 from opening 2 new balance transfer cards, and being denied for a 3rd. I was late on only one payment ever in my life in 2016.

Here are my current balances:

Card 1: Balance: $4200 Credit Limit: $9000 Interest rate: Current =&amp;gt; 0%, Starting Early December =&amp;gt; 29%

Card 2: Balance: $22,300 Credit Limit: $24,000 Interest rate: Current =&amp;gt; 0%, Starting Mid December =&amp;gt; 29%

Card 3: Balance: $2,300 Credit Limit: $2,300 Interest rate: 0% for 12 months

Card 4: Balance: $2,500 Credit Limit: $4,000 Interest rate: 0% for 9 months

Total Credit Card debt: $31,300

Total Credit Card Debt I need to deal with within the next month: $26k

Student Loans: $2000 at ~5%

I can't get a personal loan for less than 29% interest because I fucked myself by getting new cards and lowering my credit score too low.

The credit card that has $22,300 on it is fairly new, within the last 2 years. I moved credit from other Chase cards to it, that is why it has such a high credit limit. The other card with $4,300 is a little older, maybe 3 years.

I've cut my retirement contributions to just what will get me the full employer match. If I put those funds toward the loan I should be able to pay it off in about 1 1/2 years.  I  can also probably put additional monies towards the loan as well.  I'd love to finally be out from under these loans.

I checked this sub's wiki and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bkvn8f/a_quick_comparison_of_highyield_savings_accounts/) from 6 months ago. But when I check the current interest rates, turns out they've fallen drastically since that time. 

For example, 

Bank| Interest Rate
---|---
[Ally](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) | 1.8
[Amex](https://www.americanexpress.com/savenow)| 1.75
[Barclays](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/online-savings.html)| 1.9
[CapitalOne](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/online-performance-savings-account/)| 1.9
[Discover](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/savings-account/)| 1.8

Among the 1.9%-ers, I do have credit card from CapitalOne and I do have an account with CreditKarma for credit monitoring. But would you trust CreditKarma with your actual money? I somehow / for whatever reason, don't feel good about them.

Anyway, which one would you recommend? (even outside the ones I mentioned in the table above.)

2) Interest rates are a lagging indicator so the impact on the economy is still showing up from the recent raises.

Many business owners were hurt very bad during the last recession and do not want to be caught with their hands tied behind their back.

personalfinance,Went on short term disability from work and the taxes on my insurance payouts are worrying me,"So I’ll try and keep this concise.

At the end of July, I went on STD leave from my job. I got a sweet deal and got 100% of my salary for the first 8 weeks and then 66% of my salary until the end of January. My concern is I’ve been doing some preparation for tax time since it’s around the corner and what I found is confusing me.

(Side note before this section, working full time I was getting about $3,200/month + $900-$1k/month for mileage since I use my personal vehicle.)

On a normal pay period from my job I’d be getting about $1,600 bi-weekly and in that I’d get about $60 in state tax and $80 in federal taxes taken out for a total of $120 and $160 a month respectively. Now looking at my payouts from my insurance company I’m getting paid weekly and for the first 8 weeks I was getting paid ~$1100 every week and I was getting about $30 for state taxes taken out, makes sense still ends up being about $120/month but for my federal taxes I was getting $250 taken out every week so $1,000/month? Now that I get 66% of my “salary”, It’s dropped to $170/week but that’s still over 4x what I was paying when I was working.

My question is will this mess with my taxes this year? should I have a professional do them? will I have a bigger refund? is there anything I should be worrying about?

I've been a mass-transit commuter all my life. Took a 30 minute train ride to high school, took the subway to college, and managed to get this far in my adult life (early 30's) and career by only using mass transit. So far it's worked out pretty well. 

We currently live in the city, but my girlfriend and I are considering a move to the suburbs, where my transit options will be significantly reduced. So I'm starting to do research now into how much it will cost me to buy and keep a decent, reliable car.

Like every other financial decision in my life, I started with a spreadsheet... [Spreadsheet image](https://imgur.com/gallery/Xpp657E)

Started with a modest loan amount, $12,000 and the shortest loan term to keep my overall cost down.

For the interest rates, I went to my credit unions website and looked at what they were offering. Used car rates for 36 month term start at 2.87%. I have good credit (mid 700s), but I don't want to make any assumptions here. Each column is representative of a different interest rate bracket. 

Insurance I pulled from [this website](https://quotewizard.com/auto-insurance/pennsylvania) and rounded up.

Fuel I came up with a simple estimator:

Fuel cost per month = (mi / mo.)(gal / mi)($$ / gal)

I did not take into account maintenance. I don't really know where to start with that. We have a mechanic in the family so hopefully that will take costs down a little, but I don't know by how much.

How am I looking?

Once I graduated, I THOUGHT that my dad had consolidated these loans so there was only one outstanding balance left (again, my fault for not being more diligent about this). In 2015 I received a settlement for an injury lawsuit and paid off completely what I thought was the full remaining balance. (Turns out I ONLY paid off the loan that was in my dad's name and the two had never actually been consolidated together.)

Now, on my 2018 taxes, my husband and I received notification that our $3k return (our first in years) is being offset against an outstanding loan with the Department of Education. Obviously, we were really surprised - I haven't received ANY notifications, letters, phone calls, or anything in the 14 years since I graduated on this loan to alert me to this, or I may have just assumed the notifications were about the OTHER loan I DID know about (I don't remember anything specific that I received about it). I don't remember anything saying it was in default or in collection. I saw that there was a loan on my credit report, but I assumed (again, stupidly) it was the same one that was in my dad's name. 

After some digging around we now learn that I have a $31k balance outstanding on this student loan and it is in default - they are saying I can either pay the whole thing off for a lump sum of around $24k (if I pay before Feb. 1) OR I can pay monthly (not sure the monthly amount yet) at an interest rate of 3% per day (and I'm not sure how that compounds or what that means). They say once I make 5 payments monthly, the loan is returned to good standing and there will be no future offsets against it. If we pay it off in whole, we will draw from my husband's business line of credit to cover it, which has a 5.4% APR - and I'll be able to pay back into it around $500/month if I'm really aggressive about it (which I plan to be). 

Any advice on what may be our best approach here? I'm (obviously) clueless about how the interest rates compare and which one makes the most sense for us.

TL;DR: Suddenly realize we owe $31k in old student loans - what is our best way to pay this off?",finance

solar,Any major changes coming to the solar market by late 2020/2021?,"Greetings all,

In figuring if it'll be better to get solar setup in 2021 vs 2020 because of the sunset of the Fed Tax incentives (24% vs 26% respectively) - it seems it would be smarter to get a setup in 2021 (unless something major happens by 2020 - ie much cheaper production method in full swing, a major supplier exiting the market, etc)

personalfinance,"With the advice that renting is better than owning, how to renters secure large loans for emergencies?","My husband and I were talking recently about how we would pay for a large medical bill, and one option was to use the equity line of credit on our house, which is pre-approved, no questions asked, at a low interest rate, and represents 10% of the value of our house. I'm wondering how people who rent would deal with the same situation. Wouldn't renting reduce your ability to get an emergency loan since you don't have strong collateral? If not, what resources could renters use to acquire one?

Edit: I think the piece I was missing is that I'm assuming a renter is paying the same in rent (price tag plus insurance) as I pay in my mortgage (principle, interest, taxes, insurance, plus 2% house value). We only bought a house once those were equal. In our housing market, we got a four bedroom house for the price of a two bedroom apartment, so it made sense.

personalfinance,Recently bought a new house. 70% of my monthly payment is going towards interest. Is this normal?,"Hi guys. Me and my parents closed on a house purchase recently (in New York City). Technically, my parents bought the house but I am helping to pay the mortgage and the house will be passed on to me when they pass. 

Our house value was something like $850,000 our loan was at 4%. Our monthly mortgage payment is $4500. 

When I checked the mortgage payment, out of the $4,500, $2,500 went to interest, $1,000 went to escrow (what is this?), and only $1,000 went to the principal. 

I can't believe thats how it works. It seems ridiculous to me. Is this normal? Accepted? 

Now if I calculate it, 4 percent of 850k is 34k. 34k into 12 months is $2800. So technically it makes sense. 

But also technically I don't understand it. Isn't this a racket? Out of my $4,000 payment, most of it is just going to interest while a tiny bit is going towards the principal. Thus the principal doesn't go down and our interest rates stay very high.  

Is this normal?? So after 30 years my 800k house will have cost 1.6 mil to pay off. So if I am selling the house I have to sell it for more than 1.6 mil to get a return on an investment? Is this because I am buying in New York City where the housing costs are crazy?

Fast forward to 2014 I transferred to a smaller school, so I could commute and work and cut down on student loan debt.  I intended to pay each semester off in cash to avoid debt and I accomplished this each semester.  Now in 2019, I was informed that I have north of $20,000 in student debt half of which is federal aid sent to my commuter school that I DID NOT APPLY FOR.  I was unaware that I was receiving aid and that I had loans, I only found out after getting denied for a car loan that my credit was shot from nonpayment of these loans.  The company that purchased my loans made no correspondence with me and had all my old information including address and email.  I was close to defaulting on loans I was unaware I had.

So far I have been making over payments to my loans with the highest interest rate but lowest balance. The next up in this ""queue,"" so to speak, would be my oldest loan, which was opened in summer 2011.

I was thinking about skipping making the over payments on this loan and just continuing with the minimum payment as I have been because this loan helps my credit score through my age of credit. The loan is the smallest balance out of all my loans and has a medium/low interest rate compared to my others so it only accumulates a few cents of interest  a day (which is a small amount compared to my larger balance loans).

Is this a bad idea? My line of thinking is that I have so many other student loans at play right now that I may as well make them work for me, even if it is something that doesn't have a *major* impact on my credit score.

personalfinance,Should I take out private student loans for living costs? Should I do a one year masters to get into medical school? New to personal finance feeling very confused!,"Hi there -- thanks for reading my post, I really appreciate it! Disclaimer: I posted this question earlier but my formatting/editing was terrible, so I have deleted that post and am trying again here.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I am a college senior about to enter my last semester of undergrad. This is a bit nontraditional though, as I attended my last semester of school in Fall 2018. I did not finish school (despite being oh so close) due to mental health concerns and a complete lack of motivation. I was a mess and did not care about school at all. I took a year off to recuperate and re-evaluate my priorities, and it's the best thing that has happened to me so far. Rather than just going to school just ""to go to school"", I discovered a passion for medicine and have used that to become a much more productive and responsible individual. I may have screwed up in the past, but luckily , I commuted from my parents', and my parents paid for my tuition for all 3.5 years of undergrad I've attended so far. Thus, I have no student loan debt and am very grateful. 


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I have moved out now, and will need to pay tuition + living costs on my own.  I qualify for ~$7000 of FAFSA unsubsidized loans, which is great because my tuition is ~$7000. Unfortunately, I will either need to take out private loans or work part time as far as living expenses go.  I would prefer to take out private loans, as I currently work as a medical scribe, full time, to pay for rent/food/etc. and make ~$12/hr. It does not pay well, but is great clinical experience for medical school. Unfortunately, to switch to part time work, I would need to work in the ED which has you work at very odd hours sometimes. Additionally, the ED scribe programs near me are known to be rather cruel to scribes in terms of scheduling, especially around exam time. Additionally, I regularly volunteer, am a member of a research lab, a collegiate student board, and the student senator at my university. I am worried that an additional 16-24 hours of work a week could be detrimental to my focus. 


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Is it advisable to take out private student loans for cost of living? I would need money for 5-6 months, and would need to pay for my rent ($620 a month), books/supplies (Probably around 600 dollars), transport (I bus, and have student access to an all-access student bus pass for $130), groceries, medical school/masters program applications, and potentially a new laptop since my old one is REALLY slow. I think I would probably take out around $7000 - 8000 in private loans. This number may go down though, as my parents have expressed interest in helping me a little with apps. I just took my MCAT recently and received a score above the 90th percentile, which bodes well for my admissions chances. This means that I would likely be able to pay any debts off in the future.


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

It's important to note another concern - mental health concerns and general lack of direction/motivation in life led to a tanked college GPA from junior year, onwards. MD admissions usually require a GPA above 3.5. While I have a good MCAT, I have been recommended to partake in a one year Special Master's Program (called an SMP) to address concerns with my low GPA. Essentially, I would be taking classes with medical students to ""prove"" that the me of the past is not the me of now. Doing well in these programs is a huge bonus to your applications, and a lot of these programs offer a guaranteed interview offer if you are able to maintain above a 3.5 in their program. I feel confident in my ability to do this -- I learned how to study while studying for my MCAT and it paid off. I also feel much more motivated in general as well. The problem is that these programs typically cost anywhere from $30,000 - $60,000 a year. Would this be a decision you would recommend? I would not have to rely on private loans for this masters, as I could cover it with federal grad plus loans.


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The alternate to do this would to just take around 30 credits of upper level classes as a guest student at my state university. While this sounds like the way to go with a net $14,000 cost + books/living, I cannot take out any loans but private loans for this. I cannot even declare a second bachelors and try to get loans that way -- my state school prohibits financial aid to such students. This would mean I would have to take out private loans at high interest that would accumulate until my eventual residency, or would have to take multiple years, working part time and taking classes part time. At that point, I would be worried about opportunity cost -- 2-3 years of doing that would be 2-3 years of MD salary I would be missing. Additionally, the thought of working in another field or scribing for those 2-3 years does not make me especially happy.  


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

TLDR 
I am very confused about my financial situation. I want to take out private loans for living expenses during my very last undergraduate semester. Is this advisable? I also have been advised to attend a one year masters that would expedite the process of getting into medical school. I have been told that the risk is mitigated in people who have great MCAT scores, but a lack of performance in this program would put me out of $40,000. I am confident in myself and have learned to study and am as motivated as ever, but cannot tell if I am taking a stupid, baseless risk. Any feedback is GREATLY appreciated.

personalfinance,Student Account in Collections,"Hi all. I'm in a bit of a predicament.

Some backstory to explain what's going on: I graduated high school in 2017 and went into University A right after. I filled out my FAFSA and all that good stuff. Throughout the semester, I kept having problems with my financial aid, needing verification. I did everything I could on my own to get it fixed, but ultimately the problem lied with a discrepancy in my parents' filing status and marital status (mom and step father are married, mom filed Head of Household, step father filed Single). Obviously, I can't fix their taxes for them, but they didn't want to listen to me when I told them that it was their mistake and so it never got fixed. I never got any financial aid for that term, and the balance fell on me to pay off. Meanwhile, a financial hold was placed on my account.

Fast foward to summer 2019, and I'm honestly sick of being not in school and rotting away at home, literally paying for my parents' mistake (they either don't realize or seem to care that I'm in this situation because of them), so I made plans to go to another university, Uni B, just so I could still recieve schooling. I came across a similar problem with verification, but was able to get it sorted out this time. Unfortunately, I couldn't go in as a degree seeking student and could only be admitted as a non degree seeking student as University B required me to send in official transcripts from University A, which I can't do cause I still have that hold.

As a non degree seeking student, I can still attend classes, but I'm limited to 15 credits maximum on my account, and, I didn't realize until after I'd been enrolled, but I'm already locked out of almost all forms of financial aid since a large majority of it require that I be classified as degree seeking. Fortunately I was able to get a loan for the term through Sallie Mae so that I'm not completely SOL by the end of the term.

Now, I realize that I probably shouldn't have gone back to school given the position I'm in, because I'm still paying off the original balance from University A. So what I want to know if there's anything I could do to help ease my burden? Or did I really just dig myself further down my grave?

For information:

* University A balance is currently $11,339. It actually already got sent over to a collections agency, but is thankfully being not reported. And there's no interest being accrued and charged. I'm on a payment plan paying $263.39 every month.
* University B loan is $6800 with a fixed 8.375% interest rate. I had a $500 refund, and applied that to this loan. Currently it is at $6,321.51.
* I have a 48 month auto loan (took out $9,702.61) currently at $8,764.37 with a 9.24% interest rate. I'm only 4 months in.
* I currently work full time (I'm only taking two classes currently. I may not continue schooling into next semester) at $11.50/hr with an extra $1k/yr from a health insurance waiver. About $24k/yr gross. Starting next month in December, I will transfer into a position that pays $14/hr and will continue to work full time.
* I do have credit cards but I always pay them in full so I'm really not worried.",finance

personalfinance,(US-MA)Help me review/suggest options on my current mortgage (refinance?),"Greetings!

We bought our first home back in 2014 for a total of $275K and I was wondering if we should consider a refinance in order to lower the interest rate since we didn't have 20% for a downpayment, I believe it's quite high at (4.87%). The mortgage is a Conventional with PMI (lender paid, the reason why it's high?). The principal is currently at 236,990 with the house appraising at around $320K. 

Sometimes I love the idea of lowering the interest rate/payments but hate to reset the ""clock"". I don't understand much about refinancing so if someone could run some scenarios on savings versus downsides would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,School Employee Savings vs money market question,"Hi all,

Disclaimer: I'm very new to investing. I’ve been spending my evenings learning what I can about saving and investing, mainly with the goal of deciding what the best place to keep my short/mid-term savings is. Maybe some quick advice could save me a little legwork.

I’m currently putting the bulk of my savings into a SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union savings account, which has a 3.75% apy. I contribute the max $2k each month. I’m wondering if this is the best place to save the bulk of my money, or if something like a Vanguard Money Market fund would be more lucrative?

Knowing nothing, I opened a Vanguard Roth IRA Money Market Settlement Fund (VMFXX) in June and threw in $1k. In 5 months, it’s gained $9.08. I figure if I had that same $1k sitting on a SchoolsFirst account, it would have made about $17 in that time. 

Am I missing something, or is the SFFCU account the better route? Do I just have a very conservative investment set for the Roth IRA?

I do plan to put the max contribution into the Roth IRA once I have the most optimal investment figured out. I also contribute to a pension through CALPers.

But would something like a mutual fund be a smarter place to dump savings than the 3.75% apy SFFCU account?",finance

personalfinance,US Should I do cash out refinance now or later?,"Goal:  I would like to purchase a home in 3 – 4 years by using the built-up equity in my current house.

Proposal:  I have been advised to take advantage of the low interest rates and do a cash-out refinance on my current home.  I have been told that I could 3.5% interest and take out up to 60k.  This would leave my current home at 80% LTV.  I would then use 22k of the 60k to pay off both cars and put the remaining 38k into a high yield savings account.

I would then put in approximately $500 monthly into this account for about 3 to 4 years or until my SAHM wife becomes employed.  The current home would be turned into a rental property and I would put 20% down on the new home.

Question:  Do you think it is smart to take out the home equity loan now while interest rates are guaranteed low or should I only consider this move when I’m actually ready to purchase the home?",finance
personalfinance,I anticipate a potential job offer would come with a pay cut - does it even make sense to consider it with over 80k in student debt?,"**TL;DR** - Made a spur of the moment decision to apply to job at university with much better benefits than my current role. Nearly certain the salary will come under what I currently make now. Looking for help on whether or not my current situation should make me close the door on considering a potential offer.

I moved to TX from PA about 2 years ago to take my first job out of college. I work as a technology analyst for a pretty well known company. I started out at 68k and I currently make 78k annually. I don’t really have any formal complaints about the kind of work that I do as it is always changing and I have a good deal of autonomy in my day-to-day; but the company seems to be headed for uncharted waters, at least in IT. For example, we just added a number of new team members who are based in India - and while I am sure they mean well - they are regularly reaching out to me when it is their workday; which is usually 11pm and beyond for me. Normally I wouldn’t mind, but it seems like reaching out to me at these hours is becoming a habit. I have also had a few 3am and 4am calls in the last few weeks.

On top of the changes at my company, my roommate is leaving in the middle of next month and my lease ends NYE - so I have been looking around at some 1BR apartments over the last few weeks. I ended up having a number of apartments swept out from underneath me before I had the chance to apply, which left me quite frustrated. About two weeks ago, I figured it might be a good idea to take a look and see what new opportunities might be in the market seeing as how I was having trouble finding a new place to live.

I stumbled upon an opening at my alma mater working as a business analyst. It seemed like a really interesting gig, and the type of work they do in this organization was very relatable to my current role. It said minimum requirements was 4+ years experience - but I thought what the hell and ended up sending my resume and cover letter.

I was very surprised that I was contacted in less than 48 hours to have a phone interview for the new position. That took place this week - and now I have been invited to have a second interview with the first interviewer’s manager. I am not trying to get ahead of myself, because nothing is set in stone yet; but I cannot help but wonder what might happen if they end up offering me a position. I have heard from a few friends that work there that they are relatively notorious for underpaying salaries, but that their benefits package is very good at closing the gap. I did not discuss salary in the first interview - but based on the posting, the salary band ranges anywhere from $52-$106k.

Based on what I know, I would assume that a potential offer would certainly come in below the 78k I make today. However, I was just promoted a short time ago; and don’t think I would mind regressing back to my starting salary and pretending the promotion never happened. The thing that makes me wonder is this: I have about 80k in student loan debt (about 47k is private). I am in year 2 of a 10yr plan - minimums are about 890 and I pay 1100/mo towards them. I plan on refinancing again and taking a longer term to secure a lower interest rate even though I can afford to pay above my minimums. But I wonder if a debt total that large should make me shy away from even considering this potential new gig in the first place.

Here are some of the benefits the new job would offer (and my current job’s equivalent in parenthesis):

* 2-to-1 401k match up to 5% (currently get 1-to-2 up to 4%)
* $50/mo contribution to HSA (currently get 0)
* 75% tuition discount (currently offered 8k/yr contingent upon one year of service after receiving aid)
* 24 vacation days (I currently get 15)

Getting my MBA is certainly a stepping stone I want to hit before I get married or have children - and want to either translate that into a career in business development and/or academia. It would also be nice to be a drive away from “home” rather than a flight.

Am I stupid for even considering this given my current debt load? Outside of the student loans my other bills are merely month-to-month expenses. No other major debt racking up interest. At what point can direct and indirect benefits trump things like salary? Is there a certain number I should be looking for to justify a change like this? I can take a deeper dive into the potential cost/benefit analysis; but like to hear to opinions of others on the surface.

**Disclaimer**: I know I don’t have the job yet. I know I might not get it. I just want to be sure it is worth pursuing.

personalfinance,Pay off remaining student debt or start investing in 401k?,"First time poster here. I recently graduated from college with a Computer Science degree, and was able to land a job as a Software Engineer starting 6 months ago, with a $75,000 salary. 

When I first graduated and began my job, I had about $25,000 in student loans. I have been attempting to pay them off as rapidly as possible, contributing an average of \~$2000/month towards them (just under half of my monthly take-home pay). I now have $14,000 left to pay off, at an average of 4% interest rate.

Starting on January 1st, I will be eligible to start contributing to my company's 401k plan. My company matches up to 4% of my salary, so I will certainly be contributing at least 4%. With the progress I have been making on my student loans, I am eager to continue paying them off at a rapid pace, to hopefully be completely done with them by next summer. 

However, I'm wondering if I should slow down my student loan payoff pace in order to up the percentage I contribute each month to the 401k (or savings?). I've read that contributing 10-15% of your salary to your 401k is advisable, but I'm not sure how loans play into that equation.

I'm 23 years old, and currently have $14,000 saved in a savings account with \~2% APY.

personalfinance,Health insurance plan question,"Wondering if someone can answer a question I have about HSAs.

Current situation in 2019 is that I'm on my wife's plan because I started last year (2018) as a contractor at my current job. I jumped on her insurance when I went from a full-time role to a contract role with no benefits.  Now that I'm permanent because I opted out of the company insurance I was getting like $1000 a year (split up into weekly payouts).  Great, that covers some of the cost that we're paying for me on her plan and it puts us under a yearly out of pocket max that's only $1000 more than if she was solo which is way better than me having my own high deductible to hit.  

Okay, fast forward to benefits election in 2020 at my job.  They did away with the opt-out bonus which kind of sucks.  I'm a bit miffed that they took that away, even giving me $1000 a year is way cheaper for them than me taking insurance and them paying their share.  So a coworker had an idea.  She ran the numbers and if I take the high deductible, cheapest HSA plan my company offers it runs about $860 a year in premiums.  If I do that, the company puts $1200 in to an HSA.  So if I was to do that I'm net $340.  The question is, if I continue to use my wife's insurance plan so we can share the out of pocket max for a couple rather than each having high deductibles can the HSA on MY plan be used to pay for the balance of what was due for claims on HER plan.  To put it another way I go to the doctor and run up a $5k bill on my wife's insurance plan.  I get a bill for let's say $1000 that's left as my responsibility.  Can I pay that with my HSA that's tied to my plan even though I claimed it on the other insurance policy?",finance
personalfinance,Calculating the effective interest rate on a loan,"I watched a financial education video, which presented the following scenario:

I get a loan of $120,000 today, for which I have to make 12 equal payments of $11,000 every month, starting one month from today. I would be paying a total of $11,000 * 12 = $132,000.

Out of this $120,000 is the principal. The interest amount is therefore $12,000, which comes out to 10% of the principal. Since the loan tenure is 1 year, the (simple) interest rate is 10% per year, correct?

However, the video presenter used the `RATE` Excel function (using $120,000, -$11,000 and 12 for PV, PMT and NPER respectively) which spit out a value of ~1.5% per payment period (month), which he multiplied by 12 to arrive at ~18%.

10% and 18% are pretty far apart! What is the correct way to think about interest rates on loans?",finance

Potentially making a big financial decision and I’d really appreciate some feedback before I move forward. I get stressed at the idea of moving so much money and possibly making the wrong decision. 

Currently, I have a federal student loan remainder of $34,000 at 6.25% interest and 19 years left on it. I have also managed to aggressively save $50,000 that is sitting in my saving’s account. I’m 32 years old with no other debt and earning $150,000 a year.

Option 1: Obviously I’m inclined to just wipe out the student loan and apply the rest to an emergency account. (Additionally I have a work 401k, and I've maxed out my IRA every year for the past 3 years).

Option 2: Refinance the student loan. Earnest is offering me (3.45% fixed / 1.81% variable) interest on a 5 year loan. I then use the money towards an emergency fund, retirement, possibly home down payment. My savings account yields at 1.70%.",finance

I just rolled over my previous 401k with past employer, i was there almost 7 years:

Employee Contributions	$17,007.45	 
   Show Details for Employee Contributions
Employer Contributions	$17,007.44	 
   Show Details for Employer Contributions
Rollover Contributions	$22,370.73	 
   Show Detailsfor Rollover Contributions
Summary of Contributions Total	$56,385.62	 

the 22,379 was what i rolled over from the previous job. So I guess i contributed 17k, then the company matched the 17k then that was added up to the 56k. 

What confuses me is that when i left that job in may i had about 90k total in there. I have a little more in there now. How did i get to 90k, when with my contributions and my employers there was only 56k? was this just due to how the market performed? 

I am alarmed by the 22k I had with my previous employer from 2005-2012. That seems so log, but i was only contributing about $25 or for the first 3 years of my employment every other week, then towards the end i was doing around $85 every other week. It feels like i should have more though, however i know the market was awul in 2009/2010. and i was out of work for about 9 months in 2009. 

At the job i had from 2012-2019, I was a little better about contributing. I just dont know where the number goes from the 56k to the 90k something? I think that must be because the market is better? I only contributed 17k of my own funds during that time. that was silly. I should have done more. Can't change the past though. 

I am feeling like maybe my last employer had a better plan. I currently have a 403b that i contribute to then my employer also has a fund that they contribute to on my behalf. For the employer funded program, for those 40 and over, the employer contributes an amount equal to 10% of salary up to the Social Security wage base, and 15% of salary above the Social Security wage base. - what does this mean??

The one I contribute to has the following info:

With two contribution options, 403b allows you to save for retirement and reduce your taxable income – now or in retirement. You may choose either contribution option or divide your contributions between them:

With the Traditional option, you make contributions before taxes, reducing your taxes today, and your savings aren’t taxed until you withdraw funds.
With the Roth option (new in 2017), you make contributions after taxes, your savings grow tax-free and future withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. 
You decide how much to save, up to the plan limits ($19,000 for 2019, with higher limits for those age 50+), and where to invest from among company's menu of available, low-cost investment choices.


staff who make no election are automatically enrolled in the 403b Plan after 60 days of employment, with an initial contribution rate or 3% of salary deducted from pay before taxes that increases by 1 point each January, up to 10% (not to exceed federal contribution limits).",finance
personalfinance,Unpaid Maternity Leave?,"Unpaid Maternity Leave?

Posting this in a couple of places. I just want to run my thought process by you guys and see if I’m doing the right thing. 

I’ve been in debt payoff mode for a few months now. My minimum payments are ~$500/month. I was throwing and extra $1k at them per month. Total balance right now is $16k, mixed interest rates. 

I am 23 weeks pregnant, and due to quite a few complications, I have had to use a lot of my paid time off during my pregnancy. I will only have about half of my expected time off saved by the time the baby gets here, and that’s IF I don’t have anymore significant issues and I can continue to work until the baby gets here. So I’m looking at a minimum of three weeks unpaid. 

My thought process is to stop putting anything extra towards my debt until I return to work after the baby is here. Right now, if I do this, I’m on course to have about two months of expenses saved by the time she comes. (Since I’m in debt payoff mode, I only had a $1k emergency fund prior to this). 

Once I return to work, I can continue my debt payoff. I just feel so weird about saving cash when I have so much debt (some of which is high interest). Am I doing the right thing? 

Side note: my employer does offer a “catastrophic leave” program where other employees can donate their vacation time to someone who is out of paid time because of illness. They also allow you to borrow up to 160 hours from a bank that gets paid back at 2 hours per paycheck until paid off. They won’t tell me if I qualify for this leave until AFTER I have run out of paid time, so I’m worried about depending on this in case they say no for whatever reason. But there is a chance I won’t have to take any unpaid leave.",finance
personalfinance,Young federal employee,"Just a quick question for you all!

My wife and I both work for the federal government. We have approximately 22 more years of service to go until we can retire with 25 years of service. She has 21,000 in roth tsp. I have 27000 in traditional tsp. Ive been thinking of switching and going all Roth as our employer matches our contributions up to 5%. This goes straight into traditional tsp no matter what.

Should we both go 100% Roth or should we split up our contributions? 50/50? We currently contribute 11% each pay check.

My plan is to dump about $3k per month into my student loans, which is well above the $500 minimum for the standard repayment plan. Wouldn't it make sense to choose an extended repayment plan so that I have a lower minimum payment per loan, so that I can put more of that $3k towards the highest interest rate loan? I called my loan provider (Nelnet) and the person just kept saying ""because you plan on paying $3k per month, the standard plan is the best for you"", but didn't really seem to understand what I was asking.

personalfinance,"Best way to file 2018 taxes late, with taxes due?","My husband and I have not filed 2018 state or federal taxes. We will definitely owe as he did not have taxes taken out of his pay, I am W2 so taxes were taken out for me already. I did not file an extension and have not paid anything to the IRS for anything due from 2018. In prior years, I’ve filed both of us jointly since we’ve been married. 

I was waiting to file due to my husbands father (owner of business that my husband works for) saying he would be giving him a 1099. This would be the first year he would have gotten one, we just reported his income ourselves in prior years. His father has agreed to pay the taxes due on our behalf and I guess we were waiting for him to have that money, but he’s definitely had it for quite some time as business has been great this year. I’ve been just waiting this year to hear some indication from either my husband or father in law that we can go ahead and file but I’ve been getting antsy to do it as I’ve never not filed taxes before. At this point I’m realizing that it will be a much bigger hassle to file due to how late in the year it is and I’m trying to see what’s the easiest way to do it. I realize I shouldn’t have depended on my father in law to give me the go ahead to file; he always filed late due to always getting a refund because of business expenses. 

1) I usually file online with TurboTax. Is that an option now or do I need to paper file?
1.5) Is TurboTax a good way to file/are there better/cheaper programs?
2) How do I determine taxes/fees/penalties that need to be paid?
3) Our highest deductions in the last few years was about $15k so we itemized. I think with new tax laws, we’re not going to come close to exceeding the standard deduction ($24k?). Should I itemize anyway or just claim the standard deduction? (Last year was the first time my husband was reimbursed for expenses, so we’re not going to be anywhere near what we deducted in prior years.)
4) I don’t know if his father in law will be issuing a 1099 at this point. Do I need to wait to see if one will be issued? If I self report and then it’s issued later, will I be penalized as if I didn’t report 1099 income?

All comments appreciated, I’m just trying to sort through this mess and avoid future messes.

Edited to add:
We don’t currently have the money to pay the taxes due. Can I file without sending a payment? I understand we would be continuing to accrue penalties/interest until payment for the taxes due are received.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Hope this is the best place to post this. 

My current financial situation is affecting my family's day to day life. We live in Australia, if that information helps. 

The problem we have, is a car loan with a 28% interest rate. (I do feel stupid for agreeing to the loan). So, the repayments are affecting our grocery bill. I am worried, as we have a 4yo and a baby on the way. 

There's 16k left on the loan, (for a 16k car from the dealership). I have had the car for one and a half years. The loan is over a four year period. Yet, I feel as though I should have paid more of the car off by now?

If I sell the car, it's market value is around 10-12k. So, that won't completely wipe the loan out. The car is a 2013 Holden Commodore Evoke. 

I work full-time in ICT Support. My position is permanent.  It's a great job, and I work with great people. $34.something an hour at 37.5 hours a week. 
So, my fortnightly pay check is a constant. 

Not sure if there are other options for me or whether I should question the maths, from the company I have the loan with.",finance

personalfinance,"Mom won't pay for college, or cosign a loan/FAFSA","I'm halfway through college with two years left in school. I live in a single parent household with my mom, no contact with my dad. The past two years, my mom paid my tuition + federal loans I got from FAFSA. I'm a premed + biomedical engineering major. 

Recently, two things happened. Me and my mom had some major disagreements on some issues with our close family. 
Secondly, I decided to drop out of premed and just do engineering, with the plan of pursuing a PhD after undergrad instead of an MD. My mom is not OK with this at all.

I attend a top 10 out-of-state engineering university, so my savings barely cover the tuition. I plan to continue working part-time and apply for scholarships. Since I won't be able to provide parental info on the FAFSA and I can't file independent as I'm under 24, I probably won't get anything on the FAFSA. The only other option is private loans, but I want to avoid drowning in ~100k of debt. I'll be on a PhD student stipend after college, which won't be much.
What are my best options?

EDIT:

Thank you for all of your responses. From your suggestions, as of right now, these are my main options, as an engineering student at a public university with 4 semesters left:

1) Gaining in-state residential status by getting an apartment, paying rent, changing drivers license,  vehicle registration and voter registration. If I succeed in doing this, my yearly tuition goes from 30k to 10k. I currently have ~15k in savings, and a job next summer that pays ~5k. If I continue working during semesters and summers, apply for some scholarships and strictly budget, I could walk out without borrowing anything. I then go pursue higher studies out of undergrad.

2) I don't gain in-state status. Then, I'd have to pay 30k a semester. I have close family who are willing to lend me some money, so that helps. The rest I would cover with my savings, scholarships, federal loans (if I convince my mom to fill FAFSA) and private loans for the remainder. I go work right out of college, pay off debts asap and then go do higher studies.

3) I don't gain in-state status. I transfer to a good in-state engineering school that costs 10k a year. I should be able to cover costs from savings and earnings.",finance

personalfinance,Should I finish my college degree and get into debt?,"Throwaway account, long time lurker and first time poster.

TL;DR in a decent paying job, looking for advice on weighing completing my degree for more pay vs the debt I would accrue.

I (25M) currently work in a social science field (2+ yrs of experience) and take home about $2600/month after taxes, 401(k) and health care. In addition, I set aside at least $350 a month for my rainy day savings. I pay $900 for rent&amp;utilities, $70-100 for meds, $60 for various memberships (gym, various streaming), $200-250 on groceries. Of course, I occasionally buy lunch, coffee at Starbucks, brunch, drinks, etc. I currently have a terrible credit score (570) due to a bout of severe depression/anxiety. The only debt I have is about $1K in a collections account that should be paid off in a year (it’s on a payment plan). I have 1 CD loan and 2 CCs w/ nearly $0 debt. I have no student loans, no auto loans, no medical debt. I’m a member of a local credit union. 

I would consider my job a decent job, with some prospects of pay raises and promotions within my company. I feel lucky to have landed this job without completing my college degree (I finished 3 years).

Now, here’s my dilemma: I have been looking to raise my salary, so I’m looking for jobs in other companies. Many, but not all, require a degree. Some will say a degree or equivalent experience. I’m worried that I won’t be able to land jobs outside of my company without a degree. Though, I think if I stay at my company for 2 more years, I will certainly accrue enough experience that the lack of degree can be looked over. 

Still, I’ve been thinking about finishing my degree online or in night school, so I can keep working while studying. Based on my estimates, this would cost at least $30,000 over two years, and I will have to take out loans completely on that. I’m hoping I can qualify to max out the federal loan available, so only a small bit would be covered by private loans. My employer also has a loan repayment program for a couple hundred a month (I think I can get $200-300).

Now, this seems daunting. I hear a lot of horror stories about terrible private loan services, and with my credit score, I feel like I would get terrible interest rates. I am just getting to a place in my life where I don’t feel like I’m financially drowning. I’m just starting to build my savings/emergency fund and rebuilding my credit. It seems like if I end up with a $500+ loan payment per month, I’m going to struggle again.

These often manifest in unrestrained spending, and, well, that's where I'm at.  Meds have been restored, and now I need a plan to help dig myself out of a 14k hole.

My interest rate is 12.74%, and over the weekend I plan to call and see if there's an introductory rate that they can toss my way temporarily to help me along.

My credit score is 723, which has gone down 63 points since this whole mess started.  

I make about 3k a month, about half of that goes to housing and bills. I have about 400 a month in other expenses, mostly groceries for me and my dog.  My ""mortgage"" is paid to my dad, at 0%.

Main question:  Am I better off looking into a balance transfer, a personal loan, or just putting my head down and chugging away at payments?  I've already put plans in place to prevent this happening again (paid cash for a backup refill to keep on hand, insurance is sorted, took my CC off my shopping accounts and put it in my bank box where I can't easily get to it, etc).

personalfinance,"About to have a baby, drowning in debt, need advice","To start my wife and I are 25 years old, we live in Idaho, and we are having our first baby next week.

I'm a CNC Machine Operator and I currently make $16/hour working 40 hours weekly. My average check is $1000, I get 2 a month. I don't have benefits, I work for a small family-owned business (my family) and am being groomed to eventually take over half of said business (the whole machining/manufacturing side) and at that point *should* make a lot more money. 

My wife worked as a retail sales consultant for AT&amp;T for the last year, and was also making $16 (or more) an hour + commission, and pretty sweet health insurance which has covered all of our prenatal visits and will be covering the birth. She has been on unpaid disability since Nov 1st and when the baby comes will have 6 weeks of paid maternity leave (not sure if this is at her normally hourly rate or not).
She does not want to go back to work after the baby, unless it is for part time, we want to avoid childcare expenses if at all possible.

We own a home that we purchased in 2015 for $135,000. We now owe just under $130,000 and have a pretty solid interest rate (3.229%). The housing market has boomed here in the last couple years, our Zestimate (means next to nothing) has climbed up to $205,000. It was at $135,000 or so when we bought the house, but we haven't gotten an appraisal done.

We have quite a bit of credit card debt which I will break down into detail, mostly due to poor consumer decisions, though some was medical bills and other things.
**American Express: $11,780, 14.74% interest, min payment $271** don't use it for anything but our car insurance payment ($115) comes out of it monthly.
**Chase credit card (Me): $3,942, 19.74% interest, min payment $104** don't use it for anything
**Chase credit card (my wife): $2,823, 24.74% interest, min payment $89** don't use it for anything
**Amazon.com Store Card: $2,265, 27.74% interest, min payment $105** stupidly been making purchases on this one to this day
**CareCredit: $2,474, 26.99% interest, min payment $134** my wife needed a tooth implant, due to a botched root canal

Total credit card debt: $23,284
Minimum monthly payments: $703

You are probably quickly seeing what it has taken us years to open our eyes to and realize, our way of life is unsustainable, and that is without a baby in the mix.

On top of this, I just went to the dentist, and I need about $10,000 of dental work to save my front 6 teeth and stop the spread of periodontal disease. 

We have 2 vehicles, a 2017 Subaru Forester which we owe $19,485 on with a monthly payment of $400, 4.99% interest.
And a 2007 Subaru Forester which we owe $5865 on with a monthly payment of $151, 11.49% interest (I know, I know it's a personal loan I've neglected to refinance, but at this point we just need to sell this car at least).
If my wife isn't working we can probably make due with one vehicle, but public transportation is out of the question because Idaho is apparently still in the stone ages.

Our bills are as follows:
Mortgage $846
Internet: $116
Garbage/Sewer/Water: $83
Natural Gas: $45 (level pay)
Electric: $94 (level pay)
Car insurance: $115 (goes to Amex card)
Credit card minimums: $703
Car payments: $550
Gas: ~$150 (should go down with only one person working)
Groceries (incl. Toiletries etc): ~$400-450 (we can make a lot of cuts here and plan to)
Spotify Premium: $10
We haven't paid for cell phones for the past 6 months or so thanks to credits after switching to At&amp;t, however our bill will probably be around $150 when that and my wife's discounts go away.
We also will have to get health insurance as my wife will be losing her benefits soon.

If you've made it to the end of this, thank you so much. I just need some advice, I am trying to figure out all my options to get us in a more manageable place. I'm more than likely going to be getting a second, part time job but beyond that we need some serious debt consolidation, to sell our house, go bankrupt or SOMETHING to get us in a more manageable situation.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment,"Hi all,

I recently got all of my updates for my loan repayment. I have about $28000 stacked up against me, and I am paying under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) program. My payments are only $125 or so a month, though this would increase when my income does. I also plan on filing for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) which means that as a public employee (i.e. teacher), my loan balance is forgiven after 10 years, instead of the usual 20.

However, my main question is about my payment strategy. I have 8 loans in total, half were subsidized and half unsubsidized (though that means nothing now). Balances range from $2500-5500, interest rates range from 3.760-5.05%. My repayment servicer allows me to ""target"" loans in my repayment. So instead of making $125/month towards the $28000, I could make $125 towards the $3900 with a 5% interest rate. 

I'm not great at financial math, and to me it seems like it would be an advantage to try and pay off the higher interest loans first. However, just how much of an advantage is it? Chances are my loans will be forgiven before I hit $28000, although I have no idea just when it would be, and what other factors may affect my repayment. On the other hand, it does not seem to be a great hassle to submit payments targeting a specific loan as opposed to the lump sum, so I have no hoops to jump through, even if it made a miniscule difference.

It seems like I am answering my own question here, but in reality I have no clue what the best course would be. In addition, I've heard of refinancing loans, though that would change my servicer/borrowing agency and I'm not sure I'd get the same sweet deals that I have now just to trade in a lower overall interest rate on money I wouldn't have to pay back as it stands now.",finance

investing,Bond funds for CA resident in 32% bracket,"Hi all,

I have a large amount in cash just sitting around in a money market fund, and I feel like I should do something with some of it. It's potentially for an apartment or house down payment in 2-3 years, so with that kind of short time frame I don't want to expose myself to large downside risks like equities with this money (I have other equity investments).

I am curious if anyone else is in a similar situation where they are also a CA resident in a 32%+ federal tax bracket.

At this point, a bond fund that produces current regular income is a lot less valuable to me than others. With a marginal tax rate of over 40%, some corporate or emerging market 4%ish bond fund yield would realistically barely beat inflation (4% \* (1-0.4) = 2.4% post tax yield). Such a low yield doesn't seem worth the downside risk (10%+) of bond fund ETFs compared to my FDIC insured money market yield of 2% ish (or 1.2% post-tax).

Some options I have researched:

\- US treasuries might be free from state tax? that slightly helps by 10% or so

\- CA municipal bonds are apparently federal tax free? Are there ETFs for Cali muni bonds that are known to meet the tax free status that are available?

\- Do I chase high yield in risky bond funds? This seems strictly worse than just investing further in stocks where I could go for high growth and low dividend - and pay cap gains instead",finance

Hello Reddit! Throwaway Here.

After becoming curious about whether I was being ""set up to fail"" and being moved to the express lane for termination, I sniffed around and learned that a round of layoffs/terminations is definitely coming. The source through which I learned this is also in a position to push for me to be offered a layoff package, and asked if I was ready to leave or what.

personalfinance,How Credit Card Companies Work,"When I made my original post about the Apple Card and why it sucks, it seems like a subset of individuals commenting on the post have a misunderstanding of how credit card companies business models work.

I'm here today to clear this misconceptcion.

There are two categories of income that credit card companies rely on.

Those with good credit are typically individuals who pay their bills on time, and do not occur lots of interest payments. These individuals are usually financially savvy. Credit card companies make their money from these customers through interchange fees.

Interchange fees are fees that are set by the payment rail companies (visa, mastercard, etc.) that merchants pay. The profits are split between the issuing bank and the payment rail company. The amount of rewards a card gives is typically deducted from the interchange fees.

To sum up, CC companies make money off of the spend that these individuals drive. Those with bad credit are higher risk individuals. Credit Card companies typically make more money off this customers due to interest and less because of the spend.

Now that we have talked about revenue, lets talk about expenses.


One of the most expensive things a credit card company has to pay for is a chargeoff. A chargeoff occurs when a customer with a credit card goes delinquent on their payments. At some point, the CC company believes that they will no longer be able to collect the outstanding balance and will sell off the debt to a debt collecter, at a large loss.

Another is the cost of the money that they borrow. Credit Card Companies typically borrow money from banks at an interest rate close to prime, and then lead it out to consumers via credit cards to possibly earn interest of around 20%.

Another is fraud.

That's it! The reason that better CC rewards are offered to individuals with higher credit scores is that these customers are deemed lower risk and are more competitive to acquire, but generate a lot of spend.",finance

personalfinance,How fast will getting a student loan affect my credit score?,"Hi, I'm in a bit of a predicament. 

**Necessary info:** 

So, I'm applying for 3 loans that I need all around the same time.

2. Federal Student Loans 
3. Sallie Mae student loans.  


I need to find out how I can do this the most effectively so that my credit score will sync up to the requirements. 

My plan is to apply for Sallie Mae loan first, since they have the highest standard for applicants.   
Then the personal loan.   
Then the Federal loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have a credit score of 715  as of now. 
* I have one credit card with a $500 limit that I've had for a little over a year now, which is the one inquiry on my credit history. (It's completely paid off, and I seldom use it).
* I will not have a co-applicant 
* I have made 100% of payments on time. 
* I have no other accounts. 

How fast will the hard inquiry fuck up my credit score for the other creditors to see, were I to apply at the same time? 

**Just additional Info:**  

Because of the way the university works since I'm an international student, I need to pay for the first semester upfront in order for them to enroll me. 

Sallie Mae distributes funds \~when semester starts. 

So, in order to be enrolled and actually get that offer, I need to pay \~10K first, far before the semester starts. Hence, the private loan. 

When Sallie Mae distributes the loan to the University, I will get a full reimbursement of the amount into my personal checking account, by the University.

I play games online regularly with my wife,dad, and sister. With that in mind, I'm trying to find some good simple and clean party games that people who aren't too hardcore can get down with.

We started this setup on CTR Nitro fueled, which has been great, even with a skill gap. My dad and I play The Golf Club as well. We also just picked up Overcooked 2; haven't tried it yet, but looks cool.

The main restrictions we're facing is that my Dad doesn't like slower, rpg-esque titles and my sister is VERY entry level without a whole of time to put into anything too serious.

With all that in mind, I really appreciate any suggestions you all have, and thanks a million for reading!",technology
Bitcoin,US Federal Judge Rules in Favor Bitcoin IRA in Case Against Kingdom Trust,"A United States federal judge has ordered asset custodian Kingdom Trust to fully restore data access to all affected clients following the unilateral termination of customers' access to their own account information on Bitcoin IRA's website.

Filed on Nov. 12, a court document reveals that South Dakota District Court Federal Judge Karen E. Schreier ruled in favor of Bitcoin IRA in the case against Kingdom Trust, where the latter allegedly breached a referral agreement by terminating customers’ access to their account data on Bitcoin IRA’s platform without providing prior notice.

**The breach of the referral agreement**

As described in the document, in September 2018, Bitcoin IRA and Kingdom Trust entered into a referral agreement, which indicated that Bitcoin IRA would refer its customers to use Kingdom Trust as a trust custodian. In return, Kingdom Trust agreed to pay Bitcoin IRA a referral fee for account owners who became Kingdom Trust customers.

However, in August of 2019, Kingdom Trust unilaterally removed Bitcoin IRA’s application programming interface (API) access and stopped providing daily updated account information. This eventually led to inaccurate reflections of information about assets held in clients’ accounts.

**The ruling**

Schreier said in the ruling that “Kingdom Trust unilaterally terminated customers’ access to their own account data on Bitcoin IRA’s website, and it has not shown that the interference is justified.” Following the order release, Kingdom Trust must:“Fully restore to the condition and functionality existing prior to August 21, 2019, Alternative IRA Services LLC’s (Bitcoin IRA) access to account holder data of the accounts to which Bitcoin IRA is the account designated representative by the account holder, and account holder access to Bitcoin IRA’s online platform, thereby allowing the account holders to once again self-direct their retirement accounts online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.”

**Expansion of crypto retirement savings offerings**

As cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted, holders are increasingly including digital assets in their retirement plans and savings accounts.

On Nov. 13, Kingdom Trust along with major American crypto exchange Coinbase and alternative assets investment firm Regal Assets began offering cryptocurrency-based individual retirement and 401(K) accounts in the United States. 

The new offering will purportedly give investors access to over 30 assets directly through Coinbase, with insurance protection provided by Lloyd’s of London.

As reported last month, Bitcoin IRA partnered with digital asset lending firm Genesis Capital to offer investors the opportunity to earn interest on crypto and cash holdings. Bitcoin IRA has reportedly provided digital asset IRAs since 2016 and processed over $350 million in investments, onboarding 4,000 clients.

Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.   

It was December of 1910, and Senator Nelson Aldrich boarded a private rail car with six other men, parked at a New Jersey train station.  These six gentlemen were Paul Warburg, Frank Vanderlip, Benjamin Strong, Henry Pomeroy Davison, Charles Norton, and Abe Andrews. 

They conducted their meeting in complete secrecy to avoid questions from news reporters.  The meeting was so secretive and so concealed from government and public knowledge, that the group used code names in their communications.

personalfinance,Trying to decide between buying parents' old car or just buying a used car,"As the title states, I'm looking at getting a ""new"" car but trying to figure out what's a better financial decision for me in the long run.

My parents have a 2014 Honda CR-V that they are looking to trade in, so I figured it would be easy to just take it off their hands. I asked and they're fine with that but there's still roughly $7000 that's left on the loan that I'd have to pay back if I took that car. The loan has an interest rate of 3.75%, which has the monthly payment at $240.

However, looking around at other used cars I'd be interested in, the monthly payments could be less but I'd have to pay it off for a longer period of time. I assumed this would be a more expensive option but now I'm not so sure. For used cars I'm looking at they are all under $20k with monthly payment estimates of closer to $200, assuming an interest rate closer to 5% for a 48 month loan.

For context, I have a 2010 Honda CR-V with about 115k miles on it that I would be trading in for either scenario. It runs fine, but obviously the longer I wait the more trade in value I'll lose out on from my current car.

EDIT: I'm assuming a trade in of $5k for my 2010 Honda CR-V and assuming I put at least $4k down if I were to get a ""new"" car",finance

Spouse should be getting a job in 2022 that will make any traditional IRA contributions non deductible.

Would it stand to reason to wait to pay off the car?  The traditional IRA would be in an account earning 2.2% so the tax savings should mean keep the car loan right?",finance

personalfinance,I think I messed up. Took out a 75k loan.,"I took out a personal loan for 75k with an interest rate of 9.74%.  I have been paying my loan down consistently and about the past year or so have been paying extra each month ($100) and the occasional few hundred.  Then I got into the habit of credit card churning, essentially I was opening credit cards to get the sign up bonus.  My score dropped from 800 to about 750 and my credit history is now less than 3 years (about 2.7 years).  I knew opening many credit cards would lower my score, but at the time I didn't care because I was not thinking about refinancing my personal loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I heard about lightstream with good credit I can get a loan with interest rate of 7.99%.  I currently have 50K left on the loan, if I refinance and somehow get the lower rate I could save potentially about 3K, not much but that's extra money that I get to keep.  Whats the best course of action I can do to pay this loan off faster?  My plan is simply continue to pay down the loan and wait until my credit score improves.  I believe in 6 months or so my credit score should be back to over 800, then refinance with lightstream.",finance
personalfinance,Vehicle refinancing before mortgage,"I bought a truck 4 months ago financed for 6 years at 6%. I accepted the interest rate at the time because my bank told me they would refinance me after one month at 2% less than whatever I had. 

I was soon after told by a non confirmed reliable source that it would look bad to future lenders on a mortgage if I jumped shipped on my original truck lender. 

Do potential mortgage lenders look that deeply into your credit and make decisions based on you refinancing? 

I’m comfortable with my current payment, I’d only like to refinance to have it with my checking and savings account. It’ll be a lower percentage but they are gonna charge me $500 and fully reextend it to 72 months.

personalfinance,Is it advisable (or possible) to transfer a portion of my mortgage to a credit card with 0% introductory rate,"Hi. We owe $73,000 on our mortgage at 5.625% interest. We pay $2,000 monthly instead of minimum payments. We are 1 year into a 30 year scheduled mortgage which started at $89,000.

I frequently receive offers for 0% introductory rate credit cards (for the first 15 months) with a 2% transfer fee. Does it make sense, and is it possible, to transfer $25,000 of my mortgage debt to the 0% credit card? The idea would be to pay off that $25,000 at 0% interest within 15 months to make sure I don't pay the eventual higher credit card interest rate (11%).

If I transfer I would be charged **$500.00** in a transfer fee, but if I don't transfer I would pay **$1700-1800** in mortgage interest for that same $25,000. While paying off the 0% credit card, I'd make minimum payments against my mortgage, but that should be OK since the principal would be lower and would incur lower interest payments.

I am trying to walk through each scenario (stay current course or transfer partial balance) but am not sure which other parameters to consider. Am I missing anything? Conceptually it feels like I should be able to save money by doing this as I would effectively be paying 0% interest on a good chunk of my mortgage instead of paying 5.625%.",finance

personalfinance,Vehicle Purchasing Advice (Deer Gone Wild Edition),"I'm exploring my options right now, but I'm looking to get some advice and opinions from others as well. Long story short, I struck a deer with my 2012 Sonic this past week and it appears that the vehicle is totaled. I'll be getting final confirmation on Monday, but the gent who saw the car says he's pretty certain it's totaled. My car was paid off and was reliable- I bought it new, kept all maintenance records, and planned to drive it 'until the wheels fell off'.  Now that I need a new vehicle, I'm exploring new and used options.

I would prefer to purchase a hybrid since I commute to work (40 mins one way) in a mix of city and highway in order to save money in gas over the long run. I was exploring hybrid Toyota's like the Camry or Prius, but a new one will be a little too much for me to handle in monthly payments right now. For that reason, I'm looking at used ones that have less than 20-30k miles. This is ideal to me because they're likely to still have some warranty left and the previous owner has already paid the lion's share of the initial depreciation.  I'm looking at 2017 year models which hover between $18-23k. I found a Certified 2017 Camry Hybrid XLE for $23.6k that only has 14.7k miles on it and looks great visibly. I was also looking at a 2017 Prius Prime Advanced for $25.4k with 15.3k miles. I know that my interest rate will be higher purchasing used, but I can always refinance later on if need be.

Alternatively, I can purchase a new vehicle that has all the bells and whistles for about the same cost, but it likely won't be a hybrid. I know that I'll have less to worry about mechanically (peace of mind), but I'll be eating the depreciation. The new car I was looking at a 2020 Sonic (I loved my old one), but for vehicle longevity, I can't argue with Toyota's track record. For the record, I'm trying to go for a vehicle that isn't just a base model and has more than the basics. I know I'm being incredibly picky, but I'm going to try for that as much as possible. If I have to get one without the extra features, so be it.

I would like my payments to be at or below $300 a month if possible which means a larger down payment or I look for something under $20k. With Black Friday coming up, some dealers are offering fairly enticing offers on newer vehicles (2019 Sonics are being discounted). My thought is that if I buy new and plan on keeping the vehicle for its life, then depreciation doesn't as matter much since I don't plan on selling it/trading it in. Unfortunately, life doesn't always go how we plan so there's always potential I have to sell/trade it later on which means the depreciation will matter. I'm at a bit of a crossroads in how I want to proceed and am looking for general advice or opinions to consider. I'm very much undecided and am still exploring all my options.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 18th, 2019","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 18th, 2019.

# **After Dow tops 28,000, the next 1,000 points will be determined by trade talks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/trade-talks-will-decide-whether-market-rips-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced on trade headlines on Friday, but the market could stall out in the week ahead if there is no real progress toward a deal.
*****
&gt; Stocks ended the week at record highs, but Treasury yields unwound half the big move of the prior week, as doubts surfaced about a trade pact getting completed.
*****
&gt; The Dow soared above 28,000 for the first time, ending the week at 28,004, with a gain of 1.2% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 0.9% at 3,120.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, there is a last blast of earnings, from a few big retailers including Home Depot, Macy’s and Target. Walmart in the past week raised its outlook and said consumers looked healthy going into the holiday season.
*****
&gt; There are some economic releases, but the most important report will be the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting. At that meeting, the Fed cut interest rates and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that it was done with policy changes for now.
*****
&gt; There is housing data with housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There is also Markit manufacturing and services PMI, which will be watched carefully Friday for signs of a pickup in manufacturing activity or any spillover from manufacturing weakness into services.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had Powell speak. It’s crystal clear at this point on what the Fed is thinking going forward,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “It feels like with retail sales behind us we go to the half of the month where things are going to be pretty quiet for a while.” Powell also testified in the past week, on both Wednesday and Thursday, before congressional committees.
*****
&gt; It’s trade that could be the big factor for the market. In the past week, stocks barely budged when trade news pointed to a possible lack of progress and the focus was on demands by the Chinese to roll back tariffs. But stocks turned around and rallied Friday on comments from White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who said the U.S. and China were getting close to a deal.
*****
&gt; “Honestly, next week it’s going to be every day: ‘Give me the details on the trade deal,’” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. He does expect a deal, but the markets have been trading for weeks on the expectations one would come any day.
*****
&gt; “They’re desperate to do something. They know they can’t leave the market hanging at all-time highs without a written agreement,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; As stocks rallied to new highs in the past week, Treasury yields backed off recent highs. The 10-year Treasury, after hitting a high yield of 1.97% the week earlier, was at 1.83% Friday. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “Our view is given the rally in the market, and unless we get really, really concrete indications of a trade deal being done and a date being set for signing, there is a potential for a pause in the rally in our view,” said Julian Emanuel, head equities and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the impeachment hearing is not impacting the market and investors are ignoring it for now. “If headlines from Washington between Republicans and Democrats become more contentious that could become a focus as well,” he said. But for now, investors do not expect the Senate to find that President Donald Trump did anything wrong though he will probably be impeached by the House.
*****
&gt; Stocks could ignore that unless the hearings uncover something that would change the tone of the investigation enough to move Republicans to support impeachment of the president.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he expects the market to correct either this year or in the first part of next year.
*****
&gt; “We actually think the potential for consolidation in the market in the near term is kind of ripe because we’ve gone a long way since the fourth quarter started,” Emanuel said. The S&amp;P 500 is up 4.8% quarter to date and up 24.4% year to date.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he believes if there is a sell-off, the market will recover and continue its move higher. He said one reason the market rally could keep going and a sell-off would not be severe is that investors are still apprehensive about the stock market. He said many are confused about where to invest and are not piling into the rotation into cyclicals and away from defense.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen people basically adding market exposure,” Emanuel said. “The embracing of the rotation is probably only in the second or third inning. ... We think the ninth inning is by the middle of next year.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel and other strategists say that trend is powerful enough to keep the market going higher.

# Pace of Market Gains Likely to Slow in 2020

&gt; With pre-election year 2019 quickly nearing its end and the market closely tracking historical, seasonal performance throughout, let’s preview how election-year 2020 could unfold based upon historical seasonal patterns. In the following three charts for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historical performance in Election Years, All Years and when a sitting Republican was running for a second term have been plotted.

&gt; Since 1950 there have been five Republican Presidents that ran for a second term, Eisenhower (1956), Nixon (1972), Reagan (1984), G. H. W. Bush (1992) and G. W. Bush (2004). Only G. H. W. Bush failed to win re-election in 1992. DJIA’s average performance in these five election years was 4.1%. DJIA’s best year was 1972, advancing 14.6%, its worst year was 1984 with a 3.7% loss.

&gt; When comparing these past five Election Years when a sitting Republican was running for re-election to All Years and all Election Years, average performance is noticeably weaker. Part of this could be due to strong above average performance in the preceding pre-election years where DJIA averaged 18.6% (1955, 1971, 1983, 1991 and 2003). Nonetheless, the current bull market is likely to continue into and through 2020 as the market has historically performed better with a sitting president running compared to an open field. However, gains may not match the pace of 2019.

# Above Average November Could Stumble Before Thanksgiving

&gt; Stocks have been strong to start off this November. As of today’s close DJIA is up 2.39%, S&amp;P 500 +1.79%, NASDAQ +2.34% and the Russell 2000 has risen 2.09%. This is well above historical average performance in pre-election year Novembers. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have averaged just 0.3% gains in 17 pre-election year Novembers since 1950. Gains this month have been driven by better than expected earnings and an improving trade outlook. However, risks still remain. Trade is likely the biggest as a deal, Phase 1 or other, still remains elusive. November also has a historical tendency to weaken after mid-month with major indexes historically surrendering the major of their first half gains beginning around the 11th trading day through the fourteenth trading day. Should such a dip occur this November, don’t despair as the month also has a historical tendency to rally strongly from around the fifteenth trading day to its end.

# Sluggish Manufacturing in the New York Region

&gt; This morning saw one of the first looks at November activity with the NY Fed Empire Manufacturing report. Economists weren't expecting much of a strong report to begin with as the consensus forecast for the headline General Business Conditions index was for a reading of 6.0 vs last month's reading of 4.0. The actual reading actually showed a slight decline from last month, though, falling to 2.9. While the current conditions index declined, expectations actually saw a small boost rising from 17.1 up to 19.4.

&gt; One interesting thing to note is how little Empire Manufacturing has changed in recent months. With monthly readings of 4.3, 4.8, 2.0, 4.0, and now 2.9, the index has had a five-month range of just 2.8 points. In the history of the survey dating back to 2001, the only five-month window with a narrower range was in late 2011!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111519-Main-Chart.png))**

&gt; In terms of plans for Capital Expenditures and Technology Spending over the next six months, it was encouraging to see both of these readings rebound after falling sharply in recent months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111519-Tech-and-Capex.png))**

&gt; Finally, the table below shows the month/month change for each category of the Empire Manufacturing report in terms of both current conditions and expectations. What's interesting to note about this month's data is that while there was broad-based weakness in terms of current conditions, expectations rebounded, suggesting that manufacturers are expecting an upturn from current conditions.

# Shrinking Ranges

&gt; In the S&amp;P 500's run to new highs over the last few weeks, overall volatility has really become subdued. For example, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't had an intraday swing of even 1% in more than a month now. The chart below shows streaks over the last ten years where the S&amp;P 500 didn't see a 1% spread between its intraday high and low and allows us to compare how the current streak stacks up to prior periods.

&gt; While the current 24 trading day streak without a 1% intraday move is far from the longest over the last ten years, there haven't been a lot of streaks that were longer. Ironically enough, the three streaks that were the longest of the last ten years all occurred in the two years after the 2016 election. For all the turmoil that seems to surround this Administration, market turmoil hasn't been one of them.

# Sentiment Stays the Same

&gt; Despite a couple closes at all-time highs in the past week, the S&amp;P 500 is currently right around the same levels as last Wednesday's close. With little in the way of price changes, sentiment has likewise seen little change. Per AAII's weekly survey, bullish sentiment rose just 0.42 percentage points to 40.72% from 40.30% last week. That small increase is in the bottom 5% of all week-over-week changes in bullish sentiment in the history of the data.

&gt; While little changed, the bulk of investors are still optimistic. Another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence also echoed these results. In that survey released yesterday, 57.6% reported as bullish. While that is the highest reading since July, it is up only around half of one percent from last week.

&gt; Bearish sentiment was also little changed. The percentage of investors reporting as pessimistic rose 0.89 percentage points to 24.82%. Like bullish sentiment, the one week change in bearish sentiment was small relative to history with this week's change sitting in the 7th percentile of all readings. This week also marked the fourth in a row that bearish sentiment has been below its historical average. That is the longest such streak since a seven-week run from the end of March to early May of this year.

&gt; Neutral sentiment moved the most this week falling 1.31 percentage points. Now at 34.46%, neutral sentiment is the lowest since early September and back in the middle of the past few years' range.

# Record Closes Starting to Pile Up Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's breakout to new highs in late October has kicked off a resumption in the count of record closing highs with half a dozen in just the last twelve trading days. With four record closing highs during the April failed breakout and then another nine in June and July, the total for 2019 now stands at 19, which is tied with 2018. A year ago today, the S&amp;P 500 was close to 8% below its record high, so therefore the prospect for additional highs to close out the year was low, but this year is another story altogether. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is actually above its record closing high of 3,093.08, so not only are additional new highs likely over the next seven weeks, but we may even see one today.

&gt; The chart below shows the number of new highs for the S&amp;P 500 by year going back to 1950. Over the 70 years shown, the greatest number of record closing highs for a given year was in 1995 when there were 77, while 1964 saw the second most with 65. In the current bull market, 2017 had the most record closing highs at 62. 2017 was also a year where the S&amp;P 500 never saw a pullback of 3% or more, so therefore record highs were always within striking distance.

&gt; One interesting aspect of the chart is that there have basically been three distinct periods since 1950 where new highs for the S&amp;P 500 were clustered together. The first was from 1954 through 1968 (there were also two years in 1972 and 1973 but there were four years between without any) and the second spanned a 21-year window from 1980 through 2000. The latest period began seven years ago in 2013, and while it may seem like the current 10-year market run has become long in the tooth, if it's anything like the prior two periods, it could be another few years at least before occurrences of record new highs start to dry up.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
economy,"Economic growth is close to zero for the fourth quarter, according to Fed gauges",[deleted],finance
investing,CDs in a high interest rate country?,"This may seem like a silly question since I am new to investing, but to make long story short, I currently live in Egypt. The interest rates for CDs range in the ~10-12%, and the latest reported inflation rate is 3.1%

The central bank here has started to decrease the interest rates in this past year. It used to be nearly 20% (but inflation was extremely high as well)

Now I am wondering if it makes good sense to use CDs as an actual investment tool in my situation (at least while the difference between inflation and interest rates is this big)? It doesn’t make much sense to invest in stocks/index funds/etfs and other more “risky” instruments when the likely long term gains are about the same if not less.

Am I missing something here?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off car and deplete savings?,"We have $14k in savings and owe $11k on a car. Interest rate is 3.12%. We could pay off the car, but we would only be left with ~$3k in savings. We’d be able to add to our savings again, but having that little in savings would make me nervous.  I need a new car because we’re expecting a baby in 2 months, but decided to finish paying off this car before we get a new (used) car to avoid two car payments. Should I pay off the car? Pay half off?",finance
personalfinance,What is the most optimal way to pay off student loans?,"I have my first student loan payment due in Jan for $196 &amp; I was looking at my loans (7 total all serviced through Nelnet) to try and determine the best approach to paying these off within a year.

I just got two employment opportunities, Job A is part-time and pays $13 an hour. Job B is per diem and pays $23.54 an hour. For those curious about the pay discrepancy I’m doing job A more for the experience than pay. Although job B is per diem, the hiring manager told me that the work demand is pretty constant and I could probably get full or part-time hours if I wanted. 

-My expected monthly income from job A is $1,248 

-Since I don’t have a fixed schedule for job B I’m just assuming it will probably be around $1000 (realistically it will probably be more than that). 

I’m fortunate enough to not have to pay rent (still living with parents) and I really have no expenses or obligations so I can make hefty payments towards my loans. My goal is to have them completely paid them off in a year. The only real expense I would have is gas, food, and possibly taking over the car payment of the car I use from my parents. I’m just having a little trouble figuring out how I should go about paying off my loans as I really have only basic  knowledge on business/econ/loans/interest etc. 

In total I have 7 student loans which are broken down as follows:

OPS = Outstanding Principal Balance
AI = Accrued Interest
IR = Interest Rate
CB = Current Balance

Loan #1:
-OPS = $260
-AI = $0
-IR = 4.29%
-CB = $260

Loan #2:
-OPS = $3,520
-AI = $610
-IR = 4.29%
-CB = $4,130

Loan #3:
-OPS = $1,686
-AI = $0
-IR = 3.7%
-CB = $1,686

Loan #4:
-OPS = $2,152
-AI = $244
-IR = 3.7%
-CB = $2,396

Loan #5:
-OPS = $2,662
-AI = $281
-IR = 3.7%
-CB = $2,943

Loan #6:
-OPS = $2,500
-AI = $0
-IR = 4.45%
-CB = $2,500

Loan #7:
-OPS = $5,132
-AI = $0
-IR = 5.05%
-CB = $5,132

The loans with $0 accrued interest so far were all subsidized loans so weren’t accruing interest while I was in school but will once I make my first payment I believe.

Vechain,"Some newcomers may wonder how VeChain, as a Blockchain startup, is getting access to so many prestigious enterprises, here’s insight into one of the major pipelines","This is from an article that many old timers remember being made a huge deal; the China Tobacco agreement - https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-blockchain-solutions-to-enter-chinas-tobacco-industry-in-force-c92b3729878f

The news of VeChain signing an exclusive agreement to provide the technology to trace tobacco production rightfully took the spotlight, but this article also revealed a very telling sign that is beginning to manifest today. 

&gt; Three months ago, DNV GL introduced a trusted “gateway” entity to VeChain, NRCC, or National Research Consulting Center, a top tier management, standard and IT consultant in China. (http://www.nrcc.net.cn)
We are excited to announce that under the guidance of DNV GL, VeChain has signed an exclusive strategic partnership agreement with NRCC to develop and implement blockchain related solutions across their business network.

In other words, *around October 2017*, DNV GL provided VeChain with access to a huge pipeline of enterprise opportunities. DNV GL is all in on VeChain, so this is no small thing. NRCC is...

&gt; NRCC is among the most prestigious consulting companies across China. NRCC serves as a China Enterprise Confederation Management Advisory Committee Executive Committee Member and a China Association for Certification and Accreditation Advisory Committee Member. They are also the first of its kind, within China, to have gone through the International Quality Management System Certification process.
&gt;After more than a decade of management consulting practice, NRCC has formed a pragmatic project management and quality assurance system establishing an international partner network extending through Europe and the United States.
NRCC’s services the following industries:

&gt;-Government Administration

&gt;-Tobacco

&gt;-Automotive

&gt;-Agriculture and Food

&gt;-Financial Services and Insurance

&gt;-Pharma/healthcare

&gt;-Property development and construction

&gt;-Oil / Gas

&gt;-Energy/Electric Power

&gt;-Manufacturing

I’m sure some of those industries ring a bell in terms of the recent partnerships. 

This really highlights Ben Yorke’s post about DNV GL being the ideal partner: https://vechain101.com/2019/04/09/dnv-gl-the-ideal-partner/

&gt; it’s in China where DNV GL’s massive influence is really put on display. In a country where third-party standards and verification are sorely needed, DNV GL works closely with government agencies on non-blockchain issues to ensure projects are both safe and sustainable. They oversee key infrastructure projects like the Shanghai HongQiao airport and the Qingdao Subway, while providing ISO certification in a number of key areas.
&gt; Can VeChain compete with tech giants like Alibaba? Alone, you wouldn’t like VeChain’s chances. But when partnered with DNV GL, the playing field looks a lot more even.

This seriously cannot be overstated. *DNV GL is all in on VeChain*, they said so during the VeChain summit (paraphrasing):

&gt;we will move EVERYTHING to the VeChain blockchain over time.

personalfinance,mortgage options near-FIRE. asset-based vs. while i'm still employed,"anon due to financial details-

i'm nearing my early retirement date, planning on stopping work next spring. we intend to move 2-3 months later once the school year ends. the 2-3 month gap is to get our affairs in order, downsize our household, and prepare for a big move. we have saved $2M in taxable brokerage, $1M in retirement accounts, and have our 20% mortgage down payment and 18 mos living expenses in high yield savings. we presently rent and will buy, taking out a mortgage to move to a lower COL area. 

my question is what is the best way to go about getting a mortgage. i believe the options are 1) traditional mortgage while i'm still employed and can demonstrate current income - which means i would carry a mortgage payment and a rent payment for a few months, and 2) get an assets-based mortgage after i stop working - which means i could time closing such that i'm not ""double paying"" mortgage and rent. are there other options? if i go the #2 route is it correcr that  the loan options are more limited? i have seen a few articles suggesting interest rates are much more variable with these kinds of loans as well.

i'm not terribly familiar with the current state of mortgage lending and would appreciate any guidance from those who've already gone this route or otherwise are very familiar with this area. tips on specific lenders if #2 is your recommendation are also appreciated. thanks very much for your assistance.",finance

personalfinance,HSA Dilemma -- Are the long-term benefits worth the added monthly/yearly costs,"Hello all,

Please help me think through this. I want an HSA for the reasons that have been extolled here and elsewhere. However, the HSA plans really suck. There is a much better, and cheaper plan offered by Oscar but it's not HSA-compatible. I still think the long-term benefits of HSA will be worth it but it's a bitter pill to intentionally buy such a bad plan. Have I missed some option? Do my numbers and reasoning make sense?

Background: Wife and I are small business owners in Los Angeles. We pay for our own insurance. We also have a 1.5 yo baby. Our income will be well over 6 figures. We don't qualify for subsidies. We have solid emergency funds and savings. We are shopping for plans for 2020.

Options:

1. Oscar has a nice-looking ""Silver"" plan for $768/month. Like most plans, preventative care is covered and other doctor visits are under a reasonable copay. I can share all details to those who are interested. For an average year with a few unexpected doctor visits, we'll spend $9,218.16 on premiums and another $300-400 out-of-pocket. In an extremely bad year, we'd spend the out-of-pocket max of $16,300.
2. HSA compatible plan premiums are no cheaper than this Oscar plan. There's a Healthnet PPO which has premiums nearly 15% more than the Oscar plan at $880/month and a Kaiser (HMO) for $769/month. And these plans offer SIGNIFICANTLY less coverage. We'll pay 100% out of pocket for anything but standard office visits until hitting the deductible. In a good year, we can expect to pay a couple of thousand more out of pocket. In a very bad year, these HSA plans might be better as out-of-pocket max is $13,800 ($2,500 less than the Oscar plan)

Of course the upside is that we can put $7,100 into our HSA each year as a tax deduction. Since we're in CA, we cannot deduct from state but can from Federal. If laws remain the same for our lifetime, we can also pay ourselves back for medical expenses without paying tax on the gains made in our invested HSA account. This could mean a lifetime savings in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

I'm leaning towards going for the HSA plans. I'm just sad it comes with such bad coverage. Please show me if I'm missing something or wrong in my understanding of anything here. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage downpayment or student loans?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a physician, recently married.  We moved to the city she lives in and are staying in her house, which we're pretty cramped in.  We've found a house and I've gone back and forth on the plan of attack.

I currently have \~135,000$ in student loan debt.  Interest rate on the student loans is 4.6%  I also have my own house, which I've listed for sale.  Outside of that, I have no other debt.  She has a car and her house obviously (which we also plan to sell once we move).   We also don't have kids.  So our money is pretty free.  And I've been throwing big chunks at the student loans every few months for the past year or so.  I think I can reasonably have it paid off in 18-24 months.

Flip side:  If we're looking to get the house now:  What's the best approach?

I mention I'm a physician.  My current house is on a Physician Loan.  I spoke with a bank that will give me another Physician loan.  No PMI, but 4.25% interest.  We both have outstanding credit scores.  780's and 800+.  I feel like we can do a lot better than this.  The problem being:  If I want to aggressively attack the loans, I don't have the down payment.

I've got 3700$ a month on auto-pay to the student loans.  Once they're gone, I could REALLY pay down the mortgage and get rid of any PMI.

Is the lack of a down payment going to kill me on the interest rate?

My other thought is we could take a higher rate and plan to refinance once the loans are paid off.  But I figure the PMI will be lower than the closing costs to refinance.

Third option:  Just take the best Physician loan available despite the higher interest rate.  Once the Student loans are gone, I can aggresively pay down the Mortgage.

I've kind of rambled and explained my situation.  Any thoughts or guidance as to the best plan of attack would be greatly appreciated.",finance
Forex,NZDUSD - End of the week update,"Just wanted to give an update to my technical example of NU and share the rest of my thoughts. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/duf3ht/top\_down\_analysis\_nzdusd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/duf3ht/top_down_analysis_nzdusd/)  


There were two possibilities to my bias, so now we'll talk about what transpired thereafter.

Like I said, I don't trade NU but just wanted to share this as an example of what simple technical analysis looks like and how it played out. As we can see here price did play out the first possibility which was a short at the first supply zone, if entered at proximal line, we would've seen 6 pips of drawdown and 42 pips of profit. Price fell and stalled into that fresh demand zone, if recognized by a trader, they could've caught the huge rally caused by the interest rate decision and could've caught the pullback into the broken supply now turned demand. But before that happened, price played out the second possibility and if entered from the proximal line, we would've seen 12 pips of drawdown and 47 pips of profit. 

I imagine the aforementioned bullish behavior caused by the IR decision probably caught a lot of people by surprise. And because of this, it's always best to stay dynamic so, therefore I'm out. On to the next trade! Cheers",finance

personalfinance,Debt Collection: They're after my father - and he's dead.,"My father died a year or so ago. He had lived with me and my wife for nearly 10 years. He was a lifetime smoker who spent the last years of his life paying for it. He had been using oxygen equipment from a medical supply company for a number of years, but cancelled his service \[about 6 months before his death\] when he thought he had found a better/different solution to his portable oxygen needs. At that point he asked them to come pick up their equipment (tanks and a home concentrator unit). After multiple calls got no action from them, we ended up stashing the equipment away. He was happy with his new gear, but his time was up anyway and he passed a few months later.

8 months after his death, the supply company started sending him bills for services which were dated after his death, and well after he cancelled those services. Since he lived with us, I know for a fact that no services were rendered. After multiple calls I finally got them to come pick up the gear that we had, and I figured that that was it. Alas, no! Now they've passed this debt on to a collection agency, and I'm getting a little bit fed up. I'm not terribly knowledgeable in these matters, but there must be a route for me to dispute this. This is more a matter of principle for me at this point - I believe this company was just fishing for a few extra dollars, and I am not at all happy about giving money to people like that.

Bitcoin,Conveying Legacy Finance Politics to Salty Bitcoin Redditors,"At least that's what I always try to do. And I always get ignorant flak from this subreddit.

If you even have any money, if you even run some sort of business with crypto or have significant savings in it, then my posts apply. If you have nothing to lose because you don't have anything and want to post salty subcomments, then you know you might be part of the problem.

I'm politically anarchist for what' it's worth. But my point is, crypto and btc users are going to have to use their damn electoral politics, their actual representation and federal representatives. If we raised as much hell as legacy finance, if we spent the lobbying money they spent, if we didn't just lay back and take it, the regulators wouldn't be able to go this unchallenged. 

The biggest issue stems from the US using the dollar as a political weapon and having a framework in the treasury department for infringing everyone everywhere's rights with overreaches in the patriot act and AML laws. I saw an article in cointelgraph asking if lawmakers are using AML as an excuse to centralize the industry

\*YES THATS WHAT THEY ARE DOING, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND TO ENRICH THEIR WALLSTREET INSIDE TRADING FRIENDS\*

Had people here read the FATF papers on bitcoin in June, I wouldn't get the smarm. If your LIVELIHOOD depends on crypto, YOU NEED TO READ THAT FATF PAPER. DO IT.

The treasury departments goal is to ultimately make bitcoin not bitcoin. They want to treat it as something that isn't fungible and isn't interchangeable in address, something that isn't peer to peer cash, emphasize on cash. They are struggling to do this,so they are going to be sneaky about it and attack the integrity of the network incrementally with regulations. They are asking bitcoin to be something it literally isn't and cannot be.

In order to do this they will have to go after third party wallet and hardware wallet providers and exchanges. They will have to create a gardened system that taints and tracks bitcoin in such a way, that it is bound to you like  a bad case of fleas, ultimately debanking people, ratting them out to creditors. You basically lose all the aspects of bitcoin with NONE of the privacy of an actual real bank account. So as soon as someone Dox's you and your wallet amount that the feds have hoisted upon you, they can just come beat you to death in your house and take it (the hackers, but the feds certainly love to do that to people who wrong them aswell). 

The IRS is profoundly unfair towards crypto. Refuses to give it commodity taxation or security taxation, no exemptions, no 475, no QBI. If you trade crypto on coinbase and live in San diego County you have a 50% tax rate FIFTY FUCKING PERCENT. In texas is you trade crude oil futures, you have a 27% tax rate.

personalfinance,WWYD With Current Financials,"Hello Reddit :)

I've been following this sub for quite some time and I'm interested in hearing advice &amp; suggestions (no commentary please). From a financial perspective, I would say my life has improved a lot. I want to make good choices and make the most of what I currently have. I'm not in a rush to take any actions so time is on my side but I won't drag my feet for too long. I've seen people ask for details so I'm being as detailed as possible. Here's my breakdown!! :

Me: Late 20s, Single

Salary: $65,020.80 / Gross (Bi-Weekly): $2,500.80 / Monthly Net Total (After Taxes, Contributions, Benefits): $3287

I will skip the breakdown of my taxes, benefits, &amp; bonuses, so here are my contributions:

HSA: $105.77 per check (maxing out, total $2,750 yearly. Work gives $750 a year). My current balance is $5,400\~. I invest everything except for $1,000 but considering my current savings amount I'll most likely invest it too. I'm in good health.

Roth 401k: 3% / $75.02 per check (I was doing 7% to both 401k and Roth 401k but scaled back after moving back home. I know I could have upped my contributions during this time, but these past couple of years were rough on my finances and I figured this time would most likely be the last chance I could ever hoard cash like this. Also, I'm not particularly interested in retiring early but hey options I suppose). My current balance is $19,900\~. I've been at my current job for 2\~ years.

Transportation: $190 pre-tax, $13 post-tax - I ride a vanpool to work because I live outside the city. This is taken out on one paycheck per month

I receive a total of 5.5% matching from work. Fully vested in 3%, the remaining 2.5% started last year and I will be vested next year.

Here's a breakdown of my bills (I have different checking accounts for my bills so the money is always separated each payday &amp; they're on auto-pay so I don't have to worry about it):

Cell Phone: $105 per month for 2 lines. Unlimited everything + few perks. Once my 2 year AppleCare is expired, I will cancel my phone insurance so it will be $90 in a few months.

Car Insurance: $130 per month. I have Clearcover (25/50/25, $500 deductible, Roadside, $50/day Rental/Trans.)

Student Loans: $128 per month / $15,690 total. I recently consolidated my federal student loans. Originally I was paying $398 total between 3 loans and I was on the 10-year payment plan for them. One of the loans I changed to the Graduated payment plan 2\~ years ago but earlier this year it went from $152 to $232, and I believe 2 years later it would go up to $300\~, so eventually I would be paying $460\~ total including a small private student loan I had). The original pay-off date would have been April 2023 and I intend to fully pay it off by then. Interest rate is 4.875%

Car Payment: $260 per month / $15,000\~ total. I put down $6,000 for my down payment. The site is down right now haha (Ally). The interest rate is 6.09% - my credit score was average at the time. My car was totaled last year (rear-ended, please drive safe!) so I was driving a spare car of my family's. Unfortunately, one of my parents got rear-ended a few months later too, totaling their car. I had to give them the spare car back and buy my own. I was actually given $15,000 to buy a car, but I instead used it with $7,000 of my own savings to pay off $22,000 in credit card bills (I did the math, the interest I would pay over the life of the loan, $3,078, was less than the interest I was paying in a year for my credit cards, which I calculated last year was about $4,500\~ It was a good trade-off in my eyes). Once I get to paying the car half off I will pay it off. The credit card debt amount was an accumulation of 2 periods of unemployment and not budgeting correctly. I have accepted responsibility and learned from my mistakes, both financially and otherwise. My car is currently valued at $17,397.

I currently do not pay rent, utilities, or groceries. Moving out I knew was coming and got a heads up when it was going to happen, but it was unplanned going back home. It has worked out better than I thought. My parents are very gracious. Of course, in return, I do whatever they ask of me. They are in great financial health. My dad only asks that I save and my mom I buy her whatever she wants. We have good relationships.

Savings: Minimum $910 per month (this was my rent + utilities that I budgeted for when I was living in the city). I normally transfer $450-$500 to my savings when I get paid, and before my next payday, I would transfer out any leftover money in my checking. My average savings amount has been $1,700 per month.

Remaining Net: $964 ($3287 - $105 - $130 - $128 - $260 - $1700). This would account for my average monthly spending, which is about 29% of my net pay. I say average because some months I saved more/spent less and vice versa, but I always made sure to save that minimum $910 per month. This spending includes gas, entertainment, traveling, groceries, miscellaneous spending, car maintenance, big ticket purchases, etc.. It is not consistent expenses. This is higher than it was when I was living on my own for sure though. I will scale it back once I'm on my own. I was budgeting $400 - $500 for monthly spending, but I would normally spend less and put it in my savings. Also, my bills were a lot higher before too. Thankfully though those costs have decreased significantly but they are not reflected in this. I'll need to spend time breaking down my spending per month since I moved home for further review.

Total Savings: $43,650. $41,000\~ is currently in an HYSA (1.82%) and the remaining in a regular savings account. I recently came into a windfall of cash a few months ago, tax-free. I used a portion of it to pay off the rest of my cell phone ($200), a private student loan ($800), and a credit card balance ($2000, a remaining balance after the mentioned above). After I did that I stuffed the remaining windfall in my HYSA ($31,000)

Once I move back into the city we are budgeting $1200 per person for rent + utilities and that would come out of my current average savings rate. May end up being a bit less. And I've been looking around and there are places for $2,000 - $2,300 for 2 bedrooms. Some places are definitely a good find like my last place haha so I'm not worried about finding something within our budget, it'll just come down to timing. There's no rush in moving.

Starting December I plan on tracking my spending again until I move out so I can work on reducing my spending and create a budget. I'll admit I spend a bit more nowadays, but that's mostly been for my family and friends. I've wanted to show appreciation for all the support they have given me. I probably won't move out until Q2 2020 l so I will make the most out my time remaining home. Some things I was thinking of doing:

* Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity (My 401k and HSA are with them)
* Increase my 401k contributions back up to 14%, thinking 15% (5% 401k and 10% Roth 401k, so including my HSA and employer match I'm putting away close to 25%)
* Open up a taxable brokerage account ($100\~ a month)

I know my savings are quite up there lol so I don't think I'll be contributing to it anymore so that $500 after deducting $1200 rent would instead divert to my 401k increase. Using SmartAsset paycheck calculator, if I up my contributions to the above my total monthly paycheck net would become $2,800\~ (the transportation contributions would no longer apply):

New remaining Net: $2800 - $105 - $130 - $128 - $260 - $1200: $977\~

If I kept it at the 3% though it would be: $3380 - $105 - $130 - $128 - $260 - $1200: $1577\~

I recently learned of the strategy that you contribute until you get the full company match, max out IRA, max out 401k, and then open up a taxable account. I have a feeling most people would say to do this so I will if that's the smartest move (I'm pretty sure it is haha).

If that's the case then I should open up a Roth 401k for this tax year (take $6,000 from my savings), and then for 2020 contribute $500 a month or put $6,000 at once again from my savings, and maybe up my 401k contributions a bit or set aside the $500 a month for next year. I'm thinking maybe not increase it from 3% to 15% but maybe 5-10% and I can still put aside $500\~ a month and I will have a good amount of cash for living expenses leftover (Before I spent $100/month for groceries and I drive a hybrid now so currently spend $60\~ a month on gas. I have a gym and music subscription totaling $30/month). Sticking with the 3% contribution and doing $500/month for a Roth IRA, I would have $887 leftover. I would not spend all of this frivolously of course but I like that amount to work with.

I know I could pay off both my student and car loans and have about $13,000 leftover and increase my cash flow by $390\~ a month but I didn't want to jump the gun after receiving that windfall.

Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated - thank you!

personalfinance,How to pay for living expenses in college?,"Hello,

23yo, currently living at home, working full time, and attending 6hrs/semester of community college which I pay for as I go (I love CC).

I have a decent full-time job right now that pays $15/hr. I plan on moving out sometime in the next 6 months. Mom wants me independent, I want to be independent; staying at home until I graduate is not really an option.

I will be in community college through the Summer of 2020, then I have 2.5 years of university left if I can manage to go full time. I qualify for enough FAFSA loans to cover full tuition, around $10k/yr and in my mind, \~$25k in federal loans is a worthwhile investment for a STEM degree and career satisfaction.

My question is, how do I pay for living expenses? If all else fails, I will work full time and do school part time, but it will take twice as long to graduate. My dream is to go back to school full time and really devote myself and focus 100% on my education. Knowing my own time management skills and ability to focus/succeed in school, 40 hours of manual labor and full time software engineering coursework would not be feasible. I believe my grades would suffer as would my mental health.

Is it feasible to take out loans for living expenses? I do not know if I qualify but my state (TX) offers College Access Loans which can be used for rent, food, transportation, etc. up to the cost of attendance of my university minus tuition costs (covered by FAFSA).

I know people who have done exactly this, one of which I know graduated with over $100k in debt. I would work part time, work-study if I can, to minimize loans but I would still need to borrow a substantial amount to pay for essentials. Since I only have 2.5 years left I could keep loans to a minimum, but taking out loans for living expenses is very intimidating to me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Under what circumstances would it make sense to pay off my mortgage faster?,"I have about $227k left on a 30-year mortgage at 3.25%. I'm about a little over 3 years into it. Of my monthly payments --  about $1140/month -- it's about a 65/35 split, with 65% of the payment going to the principal and 35% going to interest. Any dollar OVER the monthly payment amount goes directly to the principal, so I've been paying an extra $50 per month towards the principal. This has brought the term of my mortgage down by like 1.5 years or so. The other day I added another $50 on top of that. Which got me thinking: Would it be in my best interest to pay this off as soon as possible?

I imagine this has to do with goals. Do I want to sell it? Maybe, but for New York City, I'm making out like a bandit. And the interest rate is very low. What are the tax implications? What else should I consider? What am I not thinking about or should I be thinking about?",finance

investing,Concept Check: Ratios to evaluate P2P Interest Earnings Notes,"Hi All,

I'm an investor on LendingClub for the interest earning notes they offer which are peer 2 peer loans. They have their own credit rating metric and provide additional data for each of the notes such as gross income, occupation, credit score, revolving credit balance, application type, no of credit lines and so on. The notes are structured as an amortizing loan where the borrowers pay a fixed payment amount each month that is composed of principal and interest such that the entire principal amount is also paid off at the end of term length, like a mortgage.

In addition to what ratios are available, i thought it would be prudent to have additional independent ways to check these notes so i set up a calculator on excel that computes a total obligation to post-tax discretionary income ratio to make a risk assessment similar what is done with the debt/EBITDA or debt/capitalization ratio. I used the following assumptions which i was hoping i could get your thoughts or a sanity check on:

\-Total obligation is computed as (total monthly payment + Monthly revolving credit balance) \* term length of note-Discretionary net income is computed as (total gross income over the note term length) \*(1-(federal tax rate +state tax rate) )\* 40%(40% in the above formula reflects the assumption that 60% of post-tax income goes towards 'Necessary Expenses' such as rent, food, utilities etc)

The main doubts i have is:

1. Does it make sense to include the revolving credit balance in computing a total obligation amount?My thoughts were that, hypothetically, if you were required to pay down all your obligation tomorrow, then in evaluating one's ability to pay the note would factor in the revolving credit balance so i thought it makes sense to include in the leverage ratio calculation.
2. The 60% assumption for necessary expenses in computing the discretionary net income has a weak basis in the 50-30-20 ratio a lot of personal finance websites discuss for the appropriate split between necessaries-fun-savings, and then tweaking it a bit. What do people think about this?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated !!",finance

Growing up my grandparents and my father ""did the right thing"" with money, but they never really involved me in it except taking me to the bank and letting me write the deposit slip. It took me years of living on my own to figure out what the hell they were actually doing with the money. (inb4 ""could have asked"" - messy divorce when I was 13, grandparents died when I was 16, mom drained all the investment accounts for drugs, haven't seen dad since I was 17)

So for my niece, I want to teach her in a different way. She's 12 right now. Here's my plan:

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

year 1 - $10 gift to start, in a box, i'll pay 10% interest on whatever money she has in that box at the end of every month.

year 2  - 100% match as the gift, plus 10% interest on whatever money she has in the box at the end of every month. I will require her to keep a written record of her balances and my interest payments

year 3 - 100% match as a gift, instead of 10% interest, she picks a security and I will pay her at the end of the month whatever that stock has done for the month

year 4 - 50% match as a gift, same deal with the stock

year 5 - I set her up with a roth IRA and her 50% match will be used for the opening deposit assuming she's had enough of an income by now (age 17)

I'm going to send her $9.99 for Christmas. Along with a treasure chest style box to keep it in. And an agreement that every month, I will pay her 10% interest on the balance she has in that chest. I picked $9.99 instead of $10 because this way I can give her a five, some ones and a bunch of change because kids. I figure the more pieces she sees the more value it looks like.

There is no restrictions on what she can do with the money. She is free to take it all out and spend it immediately if that's what she wants to do. 

Then each year for Christmas, instead of the 10% interest, I will match 100% of what she has. 

For the first year, I will be mailing her the money in an envelope. In the envelope I will include a very basic statement, showing her balance for all the months and the interest I paid. Starting in year 2, I will send her a blank statement sheet for the year, and in order to get the interest, she will have to count the money, write down her balance, and submit it to me. 

When she turns 15 I will stop paying 10% by default, and instead let her choose 1 stock or ETF. I will pay her based on the performance of that stock. I'll still send her the same statement, but now will add a graph showing the performance of her stock, and the performance of VTSAX for comparison. I'll let her change her stock pick once a month if she wants. If the stock runs negative she will get $0.99 in pennies, don't want her to get discouraged. Or I might just pay her a basic interest rate at whatever the current rates are in addition to the stock percentage. But who knows, they might be negative by then

The following year I'll cut the match from 100% down to 50% (she'll probably begin working and I don't wanna get suckered in to paying her $10k) but keep the same deal with the stock choices, but she can now choose more than 1 and she will be paid the average. Same as with the statements, in year 2 she will need to send me a report of the stock(s) performance in order to get the payment from me

I'm projecting this to cost between $3,000 and $7,000, depending on how much money she saves when she begins working. $3000 is about what the payout would be if she never took money out and never added her own money in and got a nice 3% return per month, every month on her stock picks. And really, the couple dollars a month I'm paying in interest should pretty much be covered by the interest off my emergency fund. That's how I came up with this idea actually, wondering what to do with the couple bucks a month in interest that would be worthwhile.",finance

#How FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0
*By Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman
Nov. 15, 2019*

WASHINGTON — In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard.

The public face of its lobbying effort, which included a tax proposal of its own, was FedEx’s founder and chief executive, Frederick Smith, who repeatedly took to the airwaves to champion the power of tax cuts. “If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment,” he said on an August 2017 radio show hosted by Larry Kudlow, who is now chairman of the National Economic Council.

Four months later, President Trump signed into law the $1.5 trillion tax cut that became his signature legislative achievement. FedEx reaped big savings, bringing its effective tax rate from 34 percent in fiscal year 2017 to less than zero in fiscal year 2018, meaning that, overall, the government technically owed it money. But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as Mr. Smith said businesses like his would.

Nearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.

FedEx’s financial filings show that the law has so far saved it at least $1.6 billion. Its financial filings show it owed no taxes in the 2018 fiscal year overall. Company officials said FedEx paid $2 billion in total federal income taxes over the past 10 years.

As for capital investments, the company spent less in the 2018 fiscal year than it had projected in December 2017, before the tax law passed. It spent even less in 2019. Much of its savings have gone to reward shareholders: FedEx spent more than $2 billion on stock buybacks and dividend increases in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $1.6 billion in 2018, and more than double the amount the company spent on buybacks and dividends in fiscal year 2017.

A spokesman said it was unfair to judge the effect of the tax cuts on investment by looking at year-to-year changes in the company’s capital spending plans.

“FedEx invested billions in capital items eligible for accelerated depreciation and made large contributions to our employee pension plans,” the company said in a statement. “These factors have temporarily lowered our federal income tax, which was the law’s intention to help grow G.D.P., create jobs and increase wages.”

FedEx’s use of its tax savings is representative of corporate America. Companies have already saved upward of $100 billion more on their taxes than analysts predicted when the law was passed. Companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index had an average effective tax rate of 18.1 percent in 2018, down from 25.9 percent in 2016, according to an analysis of securities filings. More than 200 of those companies saw their effective tax rates fall by 10 points or more. Nearly three dozen, including FedEx, saw their tax rates fall to zero or reported that tax authorities owed them money.

From the first quarter of 2018, when the law fully took effect, companies have spent nearly three times as much on additional dividends and stock buybacks, which boost a company’s stock price and market value, than on increased investment.

#Statement from Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx Corporation
*November 17, 2019*

The New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday, November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the U.S. economy.  Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx, the New York Times paid **zero** federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 – 18% of their pretax book income.  Also in 2018 the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy during that same year.

I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.  The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.

I look forward to promptly hearing from Mr. Sulzberger and scheduling this open event to bring further public awareness of the facts related to these important issues.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan refi dropped my credit score 50 points,"I recently used Sofi to refinance my student loan.  In doing so I'll save over $1,500 and pay it off 1.5 years faster.  I thought it was a no brainer, but in doing so it closed my oldest account which was my student loan from US Dept of Ed.  This account was 13 years old.  Now my oldest open account is only 3 years old and my credit score dropped 50 points!  I think this is such an incredibly stupid way of calculating a score.  I'm basing this off of VantageScore 3.0 provided by TU (through Chase).  Based on current interest rates and ranges of scores, this could cost me approximately $10,000 over 30 years.

personalfinance,Will I owe taxes if I sell my house?,"We frequently see posts asking about what income taxes are due when someone sells their house, many times with misunderstandings about the rules.  Even if you are not thinking about selling today, maybe you wonder how this works.  Here is a quick summary of the rules for such things in the US; it includes the most common scenarios, but not every situation.   (This excludes any state/local transfer taxes associated with the transaction.)

- First, let's assume we are talking about the house you live in as your primary residence, as opposed to an investment property.  (If you sell a  property where you took any depreciation at any time, then you have  other rules that came come into play, and that's another post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dympoq/taxes_on_sale_of_investment_real_estate/)

- If you sell the house you live in, the federal government (and then the various states) gives you a break if you own and occupy the property for at least two years.   This doesn't have to be continuous, but usually it is.  If you lived there for two+ of the last exactly five years, you're good, whether or not you live there where you sell.

- The break is in the form of an exemption of some of (and usually all of...) the gains from the sale of the house in the amount of $250,000(!) for a single person, and $500,000(!!) for a married couple filing jointly.  That's a pretty nice piece of untaxed income right there.  All yours.  No need to buy another house, or do anything else to qualify for this.  You can take advantage of this once every 24 months.  

- What are gains?   Counter-intuitively, it has little to do with the money you physically receive from the sale, or the amount after you pay off your mortgage.  It has everything to do with the difference between a) your cost basis, which is usually what you originally paid for the house, way back in the day and b) what you received from selling the house, minus your cost of selling.   I.e. you buy a house for $300K, and you sell it for $400K after brokerage commissions, etc....your gain is $100K.   Even if you got $400K paid out because you didn't have a mortgage, or only got $50K because you recently refinanced to a bigger mortgage.   

- your cost basis starts out being what you paid for the property, and you can include some costs of buying, e.g. taxes you had to pay...those increase your basis.  (With an inherited property, it's the market value at the time of death.)  You then add the cost of permanent improvements you made to the house.  Replaced the roof?   Upgraded the kitchen?  Those expenses improved your house and increased your cost basis, so reduce your gain when you sell.   Maintenance does not increase your basis.  

- So, take what you realize from the sale (net proceeds, minus costs of selling), subtract your cost basis (purchase price plus improvements), that's your gain.  Subtract $250K as a single person, $500K as a married couple.  Anything remaining is subject to long-term capital gains taxes, typically 15% rate.  

- If you lost money on the house, then there is no impact on your taxes.  You cannot deduct the loss on the sale of property held for personal use, including a house.

- If you sold before you could pass the two years in the last five test, usually you get no exemption and owe tax on the gains, but there are some exceptional circumstances, including relocating to take a new job.

Here are some articles that describe this process in more detail:

https://www.thebalance.com/sale-of-your-home-3193496

https://smartasset.com/taxes/taxes-on-selling-a-house

https://www.taxact.com/tax-information/tax-topics/12-tax-tips-when-you-sell-your-home

Here are the IRS rules: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p523#en_US_2018_publink10008952

So, there you have it.  The vast majority of personal residence sales result in no taxes due the exemptions, and don't even need to be reported on your taxes in most cases (though you may want to report them anyway).",finance

personalfinance,Concept Check: Ratios to evaluate P2P Interest Earnings Notes,"Hi All,

I'm an investor on LendingClub for the interest earning notes they offer which are peer 2 peer loans. They have their own credit rating metric and provide additional data for each of the notes such as gross income, occupation, credit score, revolving credit balance, application type, no of credit lines and so on. The notes are structured as an amortizing loan where the borrowers pay a fixed payment amount each month that is composed of principal and interest such that the entire principal amount is also paid off at the end of term length, like a mortgage.

In addition to what ratios are available, i thought it would be prudent to have additional independent ways to check these notes so i set up a calculator on excel that computes a total obligation to post-tax discretionary income ratio to make a risk assessment similar what is done with the debt/EBITDA or debt/capitalization ratio. I used the following assumptions which i was hoping i could get your thoughts or a sanity check on:

\-Total obligation is computed as (total monthly payment + Monthly revolving credit balance) \* term length of note-Discretionary net income is computed as (total gross income over the note term length) \*(1-(federal tax rate +state tax rate) )\* 40%(40% in the above formula reflects the assumption that 60% of post-tax income goes towards 'Necessary Expenses' such as rent, food, utilities etc)

The main doubts i have is:

1. Does it make sense to include the revolving credit balance in computing a total obligation amount?My thoughts were that, hypothetically, if you were required to pay down all your obligation tomorrow, then in evaluating one's ability to pay the note would factor in the revolving credit balance so i thought it makes sense to include in the leverage ratio calculation.
2. The 60% assumption for necessary expenses in computing the discretionary net income has a weak basis in the 50-30-20 ratio a lot of personal finance websites discuss for the appropriate split between necessaries-fun-savings, and then tweaking it a bit. What do people think about this?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated !!",finance

The Russian Federation continues to consistently carry out actions aimed at stabilizing the situation in Syria and bringing peace to the Middle East.

The Russian leadership responded to Damascus' appeal and transferred military equipment and personnel to Syria as soon as possible, beginning to cut off all terrorist-fueling terrorist routes. The enemy manpower, terrorist supply centers were struck, and the situation really began to change.

Over time, the situation reached a solution to the problem of regional interests in Turkey, which has long sought to clean up 30-32 km from the border of northern Syria. They needed to secure their border, and Operation Source of Peace showed who was on whose side. The United States simply abandoned the Kurds and solved their tasks related to the theft of oil and gas from the Syrian subsoil. In such a situation Russia showed wisdom and thoughtfulness, was able to stabilize the situation. Recep Erdogan then called and spoke with Donald Trump, but here he flew to Vladimir Putin personally, where the parties long and hard agreed on all the features of the roadmap, which was born in the form of a 10-point memorandum. And today, they are all performed, and one of them is joint patrolling.

This patrol, conducted by Russian military police in Aleppo province, maintains the successes achieved earlier: Syria is gradually tightening its forces and consolidating positions, strengthening its influence in the region.

Russian patrols are now actively stabilizing the situation in northern Syria because Damascus is no longer trusted. In addition, there are no other forces that could help. This decision also frustrates Turkey, which launched Operation Source of Peace. So in such an unusually difficult situation, it is Russia that is able to organize difficult patrols. This is already a unique model of the country's transition from chaos to the situation of sustainable development of the state and the world.",energy
personalfinance,Trying to get on the right track!,"For reference I’m a 26F living in GA.

So my family wasn’t very financially literate when I was growing up so I had no example to really follow (and no one to get advice from now that I’m older). 

Mistake1: When I was first in college I got an old navy store card not knowing it was a credit card. That 10% off if approved thing really screwed me over because the purchase I made that day was put directly on the card. I just forgot about the whole thing and paying it for a long time until my mom got a strongly worded letter in the mail about paying it back. I couldn’t pay it at the time since I was drowning in overdraft fees from my bank and my mom was dealing with her own medical bills so she couldn’t pay it either. Needless to say the interest incurred on that small old navy purchase is likely astronomical by now.

Mistake 2: that old college bank account I had? Well it started off small. I didn’t even realize I’d signed up for “overdraft protection “. Well a small negative charge plus a +$35 overdraft fee was more than I could pay between paychecks as a student. Rent, school fees, and gas to get to work/school were all a higher priority and I wasn’t balancing things as well as I thought I could at the start of the semester. 7 days go by and just before my paycheck should hit the account I’m charged ANOTHER $35 for an extended overdraft fee. Then I’m hit with a maintenance fee and that gets ANOTHER overdraft fee. Now a huge chunk of my paycheck was going to be eaten in fees and I’m effed. My knee jerk reaction is to simply cancel my direct deposit and ignore the problem. I never looked at that account again. I got a better job as a waitress and making more money in tips but I was too afraid to see what kind of damage was in the account by that point. As far as I know that account is still open and just snowballing fees on itself.

Now it’s been over 6 or 7yrs since all that went down. I moved abroad for 3 of those yrs and am just now getting solid footing again in America. My credit is trash(540) so I can’t live on my own even though I’m making $43k and can afford it (no one will rent to me). I also don’t know how to even begin paying back those previous 2 mistakes (and neither does anyone else in my family). So I guess I’m asking, how (if at all possible) do I move forward with fixing my mistakes and getting better credit to rent an apartment?",finance
investing,What to do with $300K cash?,"Dear friends, 

We need your advice!  Let me describe our situation:

1. We’re a couple in our middle 40s with two children living in a low-living-cost midwestern university town. 

2. We both have stable/secured jobs and plan to work until we are 65 (or at least 60). We have maximized all our tax-deferred accounts, including 401A, 403B, 457, Roth IRA and HSA, total $90K per year. Also, we have no debt (no mortgage, etc). 

3. We NOW have $300K CASH sitting in the savings account with an interest rate of 1.9%. We didn’t invest in stocks after the 2008 crash (except for our 401K), we put every saved $ into the savings account with nearly negligible interest. Now we realize it is a HUGE mistake.

4. We don’t foresee any huge expenses in coming years except college tuition. Kid #1 will go to college in 4 years, and we should be able to save another $100K within 4 years for her. Kid #2 will go to college in 12 years, so we have plenty of time to save money for her college. BTW, we didn't invest in 529.

5. So, the million-dollar-question is what should we do with the $300K CASH? Wife thinks we should buy stocks in a lump sum way or over a period of time such as over 2-3 years (don’t know which one would be better), given we have at least 20 years before retirement. Wife believes time in market is more important than timing the market. Husband thinks we should let the cash sit in our savings account and wait for 1-2 years, since stock market is at its record high. Husband believes there is a good chance that market will crash in 1-2 years. 

6. Who would you support? Wife or Husband? Or if you were us, what would you do?

personalfinance,NQDC Plan Benefits - Significant Bonus Pay,"I have searched and read through the other posts I can find regarding NQDC plans, but didn't find any posts specifically addressing a situation where a significant portion of earnings are via bonus.

I am currently making $69k base, but earn between $40-50k a year in cash bonuses, paid out monthly.  There is no foreseeable change to either the bonus structure, nor the amount I am making, and my bonus percentage will increase slightly each year over the next four years.  I am also on a LTI plan that will pay out $100k after the first five years, and $90k every three years after that.  I enjoy my job and my company, and feel very confident both in my company's future solvency and my continued employment there.  Married, two kids, wife stays at home.

My biggest gripe with my current comp plan is that our 401k contributions/match are only taken out of our salary, not including bonus pay (not sure if this is standard or not).  So while I can max out my 401k contributions, the match is very poor (less than $1,000/yr).

I can choose what percentage of each type of pay (bonus and salary) to defer.  Bonuses are taxed at 37%, but I get most of that back at the end of the year.

My initial thought is to defer only bonus pay, up to the point that we can still fully fund 401k and pay bills (again assuming interest rate is \~8+%).  On the years where I will receive the LTI payouts, I would change my deferrals to 85% of my total comp from bonus, and the balance of my base that will still let me fully fund my 401k.

I am looking for advice on anything I am missing, or anyone who has been in this situation and had success.

personalfinance,"Federal Government paid for relocation, but never mentioned I would have to pay taxes on the ""reimbursement"", is there anything I can do about this?","I get that this is one of those situations where you are probably responsible for being aware of the situation/laws yourself, but there are a few extra points that feel a bit overly unfair:

* I was relocated by the federal government in September 2018, and I did not have to pay for anything out of pocket. I was told I could move myself and be reimbursed that way, but why waste the effort?

* I later learned that the relocation benefit is taxable as of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (effective January 2018), specifically for new hires. PCS for existing government employees is still taxable, but they can file a Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) claim and be RE-reimbursed for the taxes that they had to pay. Again, this benefit is strictly NOT available for new hires.

* I was asking my local travel/relocation office what the deal was, and they said they had NO IDEA that this was a thing. Again, it has been in effect since January 2018 (and retroactively so as well), but they were not aware I would be taxed on the reimbursement (and therefore did not make me aware).

* The real kicker is that they spent $6000 on the move, and they are telling me that I owe $1800+ in the 2020 tax year. Let me tell you it is no surprise that the company that moved our household goods was of the absolute lowest quality, but to find out they spent $6000 on it? Cmon man...

I am not sure what recourse there could even be, but it was unfair of them to not notify me that I would be responsible for the taxes on the reimbursement (when I could have moved myself for MUCH cheaper, been reimbursed, and payed way less taxes), and on top of that, I am responsible for an amount that I had no way of knowing beforehand. My household was about as small as it could be, but for someone with a bigger household or family, they would have easily spent over $10000 and been charged $3000-$5000 in taxes alone! How is that allowed? I know life isn't fair, and the federal government is not easily bargained with, but is there any recourse here?

**tl;dr: Gov paid for relocation and is now telling me I owe $1800 in taxes. No one ever told me I would owe taxes, and the amount wasn't even known until this week (I moved in September 2018 and I am just finding out in November 2019...). Is there anything I can do?**",finance

personalfinance,"Car accident not my fault. Other driver not insured. Should I have filed this claim, PF, or did I shoot myself in the foot?","I'm located in Wisconsin. A few days ago, we had one of our first slippery snowfalls of the year and--while on my way back to work from lunch--was hit by an uninsured driver. They weren't driving recklessly, but had a pretty shoddy car and had no traction around a 90 degree curve. The accident was low-impact, but they hit me directly in the driver's-side door, and bent the B-Pillar. The car is almost certainly totaled

# A bit of info about the car.

I drive (drove) a 2005 Volkswagen Passat Diesel. I mention it is a diesel, because this is the main reason I got/loved the car. It had 240k miles on it, and I was hoping to get \~350k (if not more--these engines are famous for going until the car falls apart around them). The blue book on the car in the condition it was in was somewhere between 2k-3.5k. Trade-in was around $500.

I have collision coverage with a 1k deductible.

# What happened next and some questions

I called the insurance company (Geico) right after the police. Insurance dispatched a tow truck and brought my car to the tow company's impound. Because the other driver was uninsured, the agent recommended that I file a claim through my insurance. Fine.

The impact was slow. My drivers side door is badly dented and my handle is missing. The airbangs never went off. Mechanically, the car still runs and I don't think any vital mechanical components were damaged (I don't know this for sure).

Still, the tow company said the B-Pillar is bent, and I expect to hear from the insurance adjuster today that my car is toast. This will mean they will total my car at a value they determine. This leads me to my first questions.

1. How will insurance determine value of the car?
2. Can I contest their assessed value?
3. If so, what is the best evidence to bring to them to adjust and what steps should I be taking now?

It has also recently dawned on me that--since I had to use my insurance--any money I receive from them will be minus my deductible. This means I wouldn't be surprised if Geico's first offer to me is $0.

A couple more questions come to mind:

1. Will this count as a 'ding' against my record when it comes to insuring future vehicles?
2. My wife and I have a substantial emergency fund. Is it even worth going through with an insurance claim? Would I be further ahead selling the car for scrap/salvage (not sure what this entails) and eating costs like towing/storage out of pocket?

This is the part where I vent my frustrations

...and celebrate for not having my head up my ass financially.

My car wasn't worth a penny to anybody in the world except me. Notwithstanding emotional value (which I don't expect you all to take into account), it WAS worth a decent amount to me. It represented YEARS of low-maintenance, highly-reliable driving with a next-to-negligible cost of operation.

This incident is also going to cost me ACTUAL dollars. On top of the $1,000 deductible, I will need to pay taxes and licensing fees for whatever used car I will buy (likely an additional $1000 at the price point I'm shopping). It also represents weekends spent car shopping, driving to craigslist finds, and negotiating with dealers/owners. It ALSO means that I am handcuffed into buying what's on the market NOW (rather than keep my eye open over the course of months and see what comes up for sale).

On the other hand, the other driver will be hit with a $500 ticket for driving without insurance.

# And this is the part where I reflect on the value of an emergency fund

A lot of people will probably remind me that the other driver IS ultimately responsible for my costs. I can go after them for the cost of my deductible, and Geico will likely pursue them to whatever degree it is able.

Still, we all know that this is likely fruitless. The people who hit me were driving to Salvation Army to register themselves for Adopt-a-Family. They were driving a 16-year-old car that their son had bought them. These people don't have car insurance because they *have no money* and I can pursue them as much as I want, but I won't be getting blood from a stone.

The other lesson I would take from this is that insurance is likely not going to be very helpful here. If I was relying on insurance as a means to replace my car, I would be in real trouble.

In the end, my wife and I are in a good place financially, and while this is a frustration and an irritation, it is--really--not ultimately an emergency.

personalfinance,Refinancing a mortgage - asking for help assessing if it’s a good call.,"On mobile - apologies for formatting. 

I have a 4.125% interest rate on a 30 year mortgage initiated 2 years ago.  I plan to be in this house for the next 10+ years. 

Between paying extra towards principle and my home value rising, I could refinance today to 3.75%, reducing my payment slightly and eliminating my PMI. 

Most articles on “is it a good idea to refinance” say “yes, if you can drop a whole percent.” 

Question 1: is it worthwhile to refinance for less than .5%? 

Question 2: Fed rates are forecasted to cut again in early 2020 (I’m in the USA). My broker says that won’t reduce mortgage rates (but I know she’s motivated by commission). Should I strike now or wait and see after the next fed cut?

Taxes were just paid out of escrow this month, so I will be mostly out of pocket for the escrow on the new loan - or roll it into the mortgage (I’ll have to put ~$4k into escrow but will only get refunded $600 from my current account). 

Question 3: should I wait to refinance when I have more in my current escrow, roll the new prepaids into the mortgage, or just bite the bullet and pay the escrow amount in cash from my emergency fund? Same question for closing costs (~$2k-$3k depending on broker)?

I’m finding it hard to get clear, objective guidance. I would love some input - or even a link to a website that breaks down the factors I should consider.

It snows multiple feet so I can’t bike to work (it’d be a brutal bike ride even without snow every single day), and there’s close to no public transportation at all. Uber, Lyft, etc. would be about $30/daily just getting to work and back. Worst part about all of this… I accepted a car loan when I was young to get this car at a 30% interest rate… yeah.

And I’m afraid of any other random hospital debts I may owe. I had a few medical emergencies a few years ago that have sprouted in and out of my life haunting me with debt. I think I’m fine now after this one that’s currently trying to contact me, but I’m not 100% positive.

If you count what I owe on my car still, my debt is about $13500 at this moment.

I make $32,500/year before taxes and I’m working my ass off for a raise at work. I know it's not a lot but I'm 23, on salary with benefits, lotsss of paid vacation time, very relaxed atmosphere where I'm finally taken seriously, and I'm very proud of my current title, and really looking to move on up in this industry (digital marketing). One reason I would prefer to not get another insanely intense job because I know if I put in a lot of work now, it will pay off. If I’m showing up to work exhausted every single day because I’m working as a server at night too, it’ll show and I may not get that raise/promotion I’m hoping for. But… I’m weighing my options, so I’m open to discussing anything obviously. I live in Oregon and there’s a high income tax rate, so I take home $2040/month.

Here are all of my monthly bills:

$600 - rent

$200 - car (with that 30% interest rate…)

$150ish - utilities

$60 - cell phone

$50 - department of revenue

$77 - school

$15 - online portfolio (attempting to get some freelance work but not a lot of luck lately)

$10 - spotify

So this makes up about $1162 of bills. Let’s say $1212 because I NEED to call back that other hospital and set up a payment plan. I’m thinking/hoping maybe $50/month they’ll let me do?

After groceries, gas, etc. I don’t have a TON left over, but I do have some. I know I need to cut back on eating out, etc. but what are some ways you guys make sure the money you put in your savings STAYS in your savings? 

Moving in with my parents/getting any financial help from them is not an option unfortunately. I also pay very cheap rent for where I live so finding anything cheaper is pretty unlikely, if I could, it’d probably only be $50-100 and my mental health would probably suffer because I wouldn’t be as happy. But I’m still looking at Craigslist daily for anything random to pop up.

I’m thinking my first move is to sell the car. Because if it were to break down tomorrow and there were no options other than sell it for parts (which obviously wouldn’t equal the $2200 I owe on it) or pay $6000 for the new transmission, I would be royally fucked beyond belief. I don’t even know what I would do… at all. I think I need to try to sell it and HOPE I can get $3000 for it, then get a loan for about $2000 that isn’t 30% (wow, I hate even typing that)... and get a crappier car but something that’ll get me from point A to point B.

I also don’t really have any assets other than my car. I have a bike that I got from Craigslist for $70 that I’m going to try to get $40 for because why not I guess. I have a Coach bag that I was gifted that is online for $400 new, maybe I can get $100 used. I have an old dresser that I could maybe get $30 for. I LOVE fashion so I have a lot of clothes, but I’m more of a vintage and thrift finder and have a very niche style so selling clothes won’t be super easy, but I’m attempting to sell ⅔ of my wardrobe tonight on Instagram, Poshmark, Depop, etc.

Does anyone have ANY advice? I feel like all of my twenties will be crushed by this debt. The most reasonable debt here (in my eyes) is the school debt. It’s not a huge debt considering it’s school, it paid for me to get some good jobs, I learned a lot, the interest rate isn’t high, etc. I would honestly be fine having that payment monthly for a while because I feel like that’s pretty standard to have school debt at age 23. The oregon department of revenue and my car though are the really tough ones.

I’ll take ANY advice on paying these off, saving money better, any comforting words, personal stories, etc.

Thank you SO much for reading and thank you for any advice in advance.

TL;DR I’m already in a ton of debt for my age and I want to kill it before it ruins me for the next ten years.",finance

This non-profit called F3E came to my agency on a course about TSP and taxes.  I ended up getting an appointment with them to try and learn about maximizing my TSP and saving up for a down payment on a house.  The advice they gave was that I should switch to a roth TSP and I should just match the government and use the other money on other investment accounts that could have tax benefits and are more liquid.  Before my next appointment, they wanted me to take a health assessment to better understand my situation and find the best investment options for me.

Two questions:

gaming,a stupid question to a stupid problem in DOOM Eternal Multiplayer,"They said no TDM or other more ""classic"" multiplayer modes in DOOM Eternal because they weren't ""well recieved"" and because they didn't encapsulate the ""spirit of DOOM"". Their half baked solution, from what i've seen, is to give us a 1v2 mode with one side as Doom Slayers and the other as beefed up demons.

Now here's my question. Wouldn't a cooperative horde mode be just as good in terms of DOOM multiplayer while still capturing the essence of DOOM's gameplay?

 I'm frankly upset that there were no official coop modes in the first game aside from what was made in snapmap. And if this 1v2 mode is all the multiplayer DOOM Eternal is gunna have, i think players are still going to be sticking to the campaign and not even touch the new mode. I think that a coop horde or arcade mode would definitely be a good idea to keep a multiplayer base.",technology

personalfinance,Your home as an investment,"I just did a thought experiment about home ownership. Someone proudly told me that they sold their house for $1.2 million dollars.

This was a good investment, and probably not amazingly likely to continue for the next 20 years, but I will share some of their details and some of my assumptions.

This is the only place I am going to say it - but it is what tips the scales from a meh investment to a great investment.  They got to live in their investment for 15 years. Without that benefit I think that it is easy to get better gains with a lower risk (if reit's are 10% of your investment, great, but I am sure they were closer to 90% in this case. If 1.2M dollars is 10% of your portfolio I doubt that I have anything to tell you that you don't already know:)

Purchase price for the home in 2004 was $540,000. Interest rates back then were around 5.25%. I used 20% down as an assumption, but I am interested to go change that variable. That puts in a monthly investment of $2500. By the end of the 15 years he still had about $220,000 owing on the mortgage.

I used an annual maintenance budget of $5,000.  I am hoping that some people assume thats a terrible assumption, a 1.2M property is going to need more than $5,000 worth of work every year.  I hope other people see a bill that high and wonder if he knows how to cut his own lawn and change his own lightbulbs.  This isn't a number you get right, but I want it to be reasonable.

Property Taxes are another variable.  To get a useful number I took todays tax rate and applied it to the initial purchase value.  taxes have gone up, the house value has gone up, So perhaps using $3.6 per $1000 of property values is a good average. It might be low. I am having a hard time finding historic tax rates.

I used insurance of $1200 per year.

I used 2% of the 540,000 as a closing cost for purchase, and I assumed $0 as the cost for selling the house.

After covering the mortgage, the taxes, the maintenance the end value of the investment was about $850,000. So, he picked a stock called NYSE:HOUSE and put in $104,000 in 2004 and continued to buy $2,500 worth of shares every month. This year he sold them for $1.2M. This would be like buying a stock that increased in value by 4.3% annually.

______________________________________________________________
this ends the analysis.  

Real estate looks really good.  And this wasn't a bad investment.  But as you drill down into it stocks are also a pretty decent investment. Especially if you get to keep the capital gains, like you do with your primary home in realestate. But I would have expected the numbers to be even better.  The property, on average, went up 6% per year.  He was able to buy on margin. But he would have had more money in his pocket if he'd lived with his mom and invested in etf's!",finance
personalfinance,Finally not poor. Small car loan or no?,"Okay, I need some advice. I will first explain my situation.

I recently finished graduate school. While I was in school I was living below the poverty line in order to avoid taking out more debt, but I still ended up with some credit card, medical, and tax debt. This year, I got a good job and am finally no longer underwater. I still have an average amount of student loans from undergrad, but otherwise I am now  entirely debt-free. It feels good, and my credit score--while still in the low 600s--is rising steadily for the first time in years. I work part-time with no benefits, but I make a great hourly wage (55/hr) and the work is pretty reliable (20-30 hrs per week). I have a growing savings account that, if I don't touch it, will hit $10,000 this month. Lately, I've been able to put at least between 2-3k in savings each month. Because work is project-based, there is a slight chance that I will lose some hours in February or so, but probably not that much. I feel alright. I can finally breathe.

Okay, so, in light of all that, I've been thinking about getting a car. I sold mine last year (hassle, money hole, needed the cash) and have been doing mostly alright without it. My town is walkable. But I want to drive down south from the midwest next month to see family for the holidays. (I have a dog, and driving is way easier.) When I looked into rentals, I thought, Jesus, I should just buy something. (More on this option below.)

Now, \_if I were to buy\_, I'd want a car I could rely on. I've had too many $1,000 junkers, I'm over it. The thing is, I also don't want to totally drain my savings to get a car. So I'm wondering what people think about putting 1-2k down on a car and taking out a loan for between 5-8k. I am EXTREMELY torn because:

1. My credit score means I'll probably get a bad interest rate.
2. More debt.
3. A monthly drag on my finances.

But then I think:

1. It's a small enough loan that I'd always be able to pay it off at a moment's notice.
2. It would help me build credit.
3. I'm not living in poverty anymore, and I wonder if my fear is just residual anxiety from that hellish couple years.

I just want to do the smartest thing. Maybe that's spending the grand to rent a car and waiting another year to actually buy something outright. But I just want input. I've been over it a million times in my head and I just can't settle on anything.

Please be nice. I'll listen to your advice. Thanks.",finance

I pay $120 a month toward a 401k loan.   12500@3.5%. The interest gets put into my 401k.

investing,Corporate debt bubble question - how does this work?,"Can someone please explain this theory to me?  If corporate debt causes the next major downturn or recession, how would that play out?

Are we talking just junk bonds, low investment grade, or problems across the board with AAA too?

What happens next?  Obviously whoever invested gets burned, but is there a domino effect that trickles into other areas?  How deeply are insurance companies or bond insurers involved?  Is this another ""too-big-to-fail"" incident from insurance companies?  I see there's talk about the bubble, but I'm curious what the nightmare scenario is.  Who suffers beyond the initial defaulting-company and its investors?

Are we talking another global crisis here, or is it just if something turns the markets sour, this would be the cause?  Obviously no one knows, I'm just interested in what the theories are.

It's hard for me to believe this is possible, given the fact that it makes zero sense given the fact that it's not the Federal Credit Union's job to withhold the money we are legally entitled to for 30 days, and then charge us 75 dollars for our own money. Plus no other bank charged us this, kept our money for 30 days, and told is this was the law. So what is going on with Penfed?",finance

Bitcoin,Russian Agents Suspected of Cleaning Bitcoin-Exchange Platform,"The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), a successor agency to the Soviet KGB, could be involved in the disappearance of some US$450 million in cryptocurrency from one of the world’s largest online exchange platforms in the world, the BBC reported last week.

Wex, a crypto exchange platform in Russian, with hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins and other virtual currencies, collapsed at the end of last year.

According to the BBC investigation, there is also a possibility that a Wex founder, Alexander Bilyuchenko, may have transferred the Bitcoin to FSB accounts.

The report reminds that Wex was launched in 2017 as a successor to another Russian crypto exchange platform - BTC-e, which the FBI shut down. US authorities accused the platform of laundering up to $4 billion of dirty money from all over the world.

One BTC-e's client was the Russian cyber-espionage group known as Fancy Bear, which US prosecutors alleged used bitcoins to fund hacking the US Democratic National Committee in 2016.

Bilyuchenko, a business partner of BTC-e's main operator - Alexander Vinnik, together with Dmitry Vasilyev, a high-volume BTC-e's client, then formed Wex, promising, as Meduza news outlet reminded, to return some of the funds its clients had lost in their dealings with BTC-e.

The BBC's report alleges that Bilyuchenko and Vasilyev started looking, in early 2018, for influential patrons for their exchange, and eventually found Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian oligarch and founder of Marshall Capital, a leading Russian investment group. Malofeev has also been known as a pro-Kremlin billionaire under US, Canadian and EU sanctions for bankrolling Moscow-backed forces in Eastern Ukraine.

Bilyuchenko and Malofeev reportedly agreed to build on the foundation of Wex ""a new exchange that would serve as specialized accounting infrastructure to protect the financial and economic sovereignty of the Russian Federation.""

As Bilyuchenko later testified, FSB agents contacted him, and ""an individual named Anton demanded"" he hands over a flash drive containing encrypted Wex assets, saying that the cryptocurrency in the exchange would ""go to the account of the FSB of Russia.""

The BBC has also obtained audio recordings between individuals discussing the Wex platform, in which the outlet says Konstantin Malofeev discussed the importance of bringing Wex under the control of the FSB.

I applied to Medicaid and have been seeing doctors for 4 months. So far, not too much progress. I was a field engineer in NYC, and the disease affects my joints so I'm unable to walk, lift, stoop, reach, etc. Also most days I don't feel well enough to work long hours, so can't get a full time job thus no benefits. I accepted a low-paying, low-stress job. It's great for my condition. However, they want me to work 38 hours per week in the coming months. But as I'm still a ""seasonal"" employee, they won't offer me benefits.

I need the money as I've run out of savings, and still have some medical expenses as insurance doesn't cover a lot of autoimmune services (i.e. allergy tests, supplements, etc). However, I need the medical attention more as I'm still seeing a Dr. 2-3 times per month. 

I'm fortunate that I'm living with my brother who owns his house, so my monthly bills are pretty low. Would love to start saving again but obviously medical attention is most important right now.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Because of the different flight schedule, my s/o had dropped the car off for me (registered driver when renting so he could) and notified me that when dropped off enterprise pointed out this dent/scratch that we never knew of. Person at the Enterprise told us we would be in contact in 24 hours. but never heard anything until +10 days after the return via MAIL. I got a letter... when I called, they said they have sent something via Fedex, which I never received. In the letter they were saying that I have to claim to actually see the damage within 24h, but since I received the letter more than a week later, I have no way to actually see the damage except from this other bill that I have gotten (via email) with $525 charge for Operation - BLANK, Front bumper, Labor of 0B (B meaning body, according to the chart they sent). And in the same doc, I have received 2 pictures from them, one with facing the front of the car (which I cannot see the damage at all) and one close up of a damage where I can see a dent that seems smaller than half of the credit card.  When I was picking up, I was shown the flimsy card looking chart with circles in them (the agent showed it for me about 3 sec..?) And I was told any scratch/dent on the bumper is ok, but not the body.

We are sure and have no problem paying if the damage was from us, but as I stated before, we didn't even know about it. We didn't get any insurance because we used citi card, and I didn't know about the Citi card update.. (they stopped with the rental car coverage a week before from my rental date)

personalfinance,In desperate need of a better situation,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I just feel like I'm in despair.

For context, I'm 25/F in Southern California. Went to a state college locally so I could commute and not bury myself in student loans. Approximately $22k in fed loans. Double majored in Communications with an emphasis in Journalism, and Business Administration and Management. I was a ""gifted"" kid growing up and severely disappointed my high school teachers by choosing to go to a local, public university when I was accepted to more prestigious institutions.

I worked a sales job at a kiosk in the mall selling skincare for a major brand pretty much my entire college career, and was promoted to Assistant Manager. Quit when I graduated college, had short stints as an office manager at a medical office and buyer's agent for a real estate brokerage. I worked for the school newspaper in college as well, and did the school-mandated internship as a marketing/ecommerce assistant at a friend's dye sublimation apparel printing company. I have a children's entertainment company side hustle that I love but it is mostly a summer and weekend thing. Currently I work as an Executive Assistant to the president of a small but successful property management company and commercial real estate brokerage but feel severely underpaid/overqualified. 

I'm currently making $35,000 a year with no health benefits. I have been here over 2 years and my boss has made it clear (through saying ""we'll see"" and then never getting back to me) that a raise or promotion are not in the cards. I will lose my parents' health insurance in March and will not be able to survive. I have severe chronic migraines and my medications would cost me nearly $1,000 a month without insurance. Trying to live life between bouts of debilitating pain is probably a big part of why I am in this unfortunate situation now. I truly feel worthless and have sent out so many applications and do not understand why I can't find the right role.

I am open to going back to school, preferrably 2 more years or less, if it means making average or above-average money. Having a work-life balance is extremely important to me. I would do anything within my abilities to earn enough money to someday be able to live with my partner and, by some miracle, own a home.

I have been told I have a knack for marketing and should explore it but every entry-level marketing position I have found is more of an awful telemarketing job with the same or worse pay grade than I currently am living with.

personalfinance,Should I use Mutual Funds to pay off student loan debt?,"Hi all -

I'm 25 and currently have $67k in student loan debt. I recently got a new job and make $60k a year. I have a ~$1200 monthly loan payment, the bulk of which goes toward my private loans. At the moment, I'm paying ~$150 above the minimum. Breakdown is as follows:

* $17k federal (interest rates from 3.15% - 4.41%)
* $48k private loans (5.5% interest)
* $2.6k Perkins loan (5% interest)

I have $14k in savings as well as $22k saved up for retirement thus far. My mom opened up a mutual fund for me when I was young that is no longer contributed to, total balance of ~$30k.

I currently live at home and do not pay rent. However, I am looking to move out within the next year or so. I work in NYC where the rent is VERY expensive.

I've generally always been good at having a credit card - I only have one and it's been important to me to keep it that way if I can. The past year has completely kicked my ass though - emergency dental procedures for my family, unexpected travel expenses, car repair costs, basically a ton of huge expenses that I hadn't planned for. As a result I'm in higher debt than ever before and the interest rate on the card is making me feel, each month, like I'm just never going to dig myself out.

I was thinking about getting a balance transfer card but I've always, since a young age, had such a fear of impacting my credit score negatively that I keep blanching at the idea. I'm going to rebudget and see what I can cut out so that I can make possibly significantly bigger monthly payments for my card but what have people's experiences been with a lower interest rate balance transfer card? What would I do with the card once my balance is paid off? Would you guys recommend going down that route?",finance

personalfinance,Federal Loans Question,"Hey Everyone,

I have paid off my student loans (YEAH!) but now I am helping my wife tackle hers. We have been in the process of refinancing her loans since her credit score has dramatically improved.

The last loan we are looking at is $24,000 fed loan that is currently on a graduated loan payment at $380.00 and will rise to be paid off in July of 2024 at a rate of 6.5%.

We both have steady jobs and she was preapproved for Lendkey at their lowest rate, I am really eyeing the Variable Rate at 1.9% which could be lowered to 1.7% for autopay over 5 years at a payment at $423.00. I am not really nervous about the losing federal protections, but the variable rate.  The Fixed rate is 3.49% over 5 years but I am really thinking about the variable rate.

We will be more aggressively paying it off and technically we have the money in the bank to pay it completely off but it would destroy our savings to almost nothing, not into that idea, but if the rate went crazy we could pay it off.

What do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,About to become financially independent- should I wait longer?,"I am a 19 year old college student, currently in my sophomore of school (2 years left if everything goes right). For personal reasons, I've been saving for the past three years to become 100% financially dependent from my parents, and I think I'll be able to be there early next year. However, once I ""disembark"" I won't be able to rely on my parents for financial support at all, so I want to be sure that I'm doing this right before I cut the cord. If some people who know what they're doing on the ""supporting yourself"" end could look at this and give me some advice,  I would really appreciate it.

Here's my financial situation:

I work two part time jobs, and have been saving money for the past few years. From what I can tell I make enough money to sustain myself month to month, but I want to have as large a backup fund as possible. My savings goal is around 4 months of living on my own, that number including rent, food, transportation, medication (can't afford insurance but I'm pretty healthy), and a little wiggle room. I'm going to take out a Stafford (federal) Loan for next year to pay for school, but I won't be able to provide financial information for my parents next year so I can't take out another Stafford Loan after that (I will not be considered independent by the FAFSA so I am required to have parental information). My education is pretty cheap though, so even if I take out a private loan for senior it shouldn't be more than 10k. 

Am I saving up enough money or should I aim a little higher than 4 months? Also, what can I do to minimize my private loan? I was thinking about taking out a credit card to build up credit--is that a good idea? Or is there a better way to build credit?",finance
personalfinance,"Pay off student loans (with PSLF), invest, or save for down payment?","Hi there!

I have a new-ish job and have also happened upon some inheritance money. I want to be sure I'm making the most any extra money I have at the end of the month and also would like some suggestions on how best to allocate my savings. Here is some information:

Base salary is around 67000, but I'm a nurse and with shift differentials/overtime/weekends I estimate I make about 75k before taxes. I am 30 years old. 

\-I contribute 10% to the TSP (government 401k), with a 5% match - total 15%. Current retirement savings 20k

\-Take home net pay is around $1750 biweekly

\-I share my one bedroom apt with my boyfriend so rent is low at $477 per month.

\-I save an additional $1500 minimum each month. Emergency fund is in place. All of my savings are being dumped into a HYSA.

\-I have 52k in federal direct loans, interest rate 5.25% and I contribute to PSLF since I work for the federal government. I have already started the employment verification process on that and have all my ducks in a row, so if everything works out I could potentially have the remainder of my loans forgiven by the time I'm 40. I used an online calculator and I would have approximately $18k forgiven (tax free) in 10 years.. I will have paid an estimate $54k at that point. 

\-I am receiving 15k in inheritance money per year (max allowed tax free) until my mom retires. She is 60 and says she  has no plans of retiring in the next 5 years. Currently I'm putting this money into my HYSA until I figure out what my plan is. 

\-Current savings in HYSA is $29k

After receiving inheritance money in January I will have enough money by May next year to just pay off my student loans. I'm tempted, being debt free sounds amazing. With that said, I'm not sure that is the best decision considering my interest rate, and also that I have the opportunity to have my loans forgiven in 10 years under PSLF. I am also considering buying a house/condo, but I'm not in a rush to do so if it means I can better my financial situation. I'm not necessarily excited at the prospect of buying a house in this market in my location of choice (Madison, WI).

I have minimal credit card debt. Credit score above 750. 

TLDR - Current savings 29k, 52k in student loan debt (forgiven in 10 years under PSLF) at 5.25% interest,1500 savings each month, 15k inheritance money each year. Should I pay off student loans now or put my extra savings toward better use / maximize growth?

These houses for rent aren't great either. They are really old and aren't updated at all. Most of them don't have updated appliances. Now for around $900 to $950 a month, I can buy a house that is a lot nicer. I guess I should add that we are living in a house that we bought last November because we moved closer to the job that I was currently at and we didn't think that this opportunity would come up. Getting this job was something that we didn't expect at all and that's why we are in this predicament. We can make a profit off the house but we would have to pay a hefty tax on any profit we make.

1. I like holding pure treasuries more.

3. I'm in a high tax state. While some of the income the Federal MMF generates is exempt from state and local taxes, it varies from year to year. Last year, it was around 77% of it for my state. And I also don't find out how much is exempt until Vanguard releases that information after the year ends. But 100% of income generated by the Treasury MMF is exempt from taxes in my state every year since the fund holds 100% treasuries. That type of consistency is helpful in tax planning and investment comparison.

I just graduated law school and have some student loans I want to refinance. I also moved away for work and have been looking into travel credit cards. I found that the Chase Sapphire is one of the best options and I am pre-qualifed since I already have the Freedom card and checking/savings accounts with Chase.

My issue is that I am not a big spender, so meeting the spending requirement to get the bonus points on the Chase Sapphire is going to be tough, unless I use it to do my Christmas shopping. However, I also want to refinance my student loans at the best rate possible. I don't want a hard inquiry by Chase and by a potential lender in such a short span of time.

I called Chase and they refused to approve me off a soft inquiry. I have been a customer for years and always pay off the entire balance on my Freedom card. Would asking for a supervisor and pitching my case be possible? Would I be able to do my own hard inquiry and provide it to lenders and Chase so there is only one inquiry? Other suggestions?

personalfinance,Any and All Advice Welcome!!! Stuck in Car Loan??!,"Hey y’all, first time posting and I am in desperate need of help. 

Here goes:

When I was 18, I was financially illiterate and irresponsible (and let’s face it, angsty), rage quitting my job and getting my first car repossessed after having it for less than a year. Since then, I’ve paid off (most of) my debts, held steady jobs and overall learned my lesson, building my credit from a 425 to a 670. About a year after the repo, I was approved for another car. Now I am 3 years into the new financing loan with 3 more years to go, making payments on a 2012 Jeep Patriot that has about 120,000 miles with an interest rate of 25%, financed for just under $11k. And beyond learning the importance of financial responsibility, I’ve learned that Jeeps are expensive to maintain and need a tons of it, recently I learned the Jeep is in need of another $2k repair less than 2 months of paying another $1k repair. 
Additionally, the Jeep does awful in the heat, high temperatures (90 degrees and above) cause the transmission oil to overheat and basically leaves the car undrivable until it cools down substantially- right now its not much of a concern as I live in a place where it stays relatively cold and it snows, but moving to Southern California in the spring makes the Jeep LESS than ideal to keep in addition to how much of a gas guzzler it is. 
I can’t trade it in because there is no equity. I can’t get approved for refinancing due to previous repossession. 
So I need advice- do I keep the car and take it to Southern California, continue to make payments and pay for repairs even though it won’t be drivable in the heat? Do I let it get repossessed and take the hit on my credit? Will this affect my partner’s untouched credit if her and I are married? Can I sell it privately? What then happens to the title? I need any and all advice anyone has to offer. I don’t come from a financially healthy or responsible family and I’m learning everyday and I am thankful to have the privilege to have a (mostly) working vehicle, I just want to stop financially suffocating because of it. Not looking for a brand new car, would definitely buy used, just a car that is better on gas mileage, will hopefully require less (expensive) maintenance and is more compact.

Was the whistle blower a Black American citizen, whose custody the United States government left you in for a civil investigation matter? Do you know if anything civil matter happened? If the suspect wasn't guilty of the civil matter, why do you think it is unfair for the suspect to live as a victim and not blow the whistle? How do you really feel about black women? Do you believe they are entitled to too much of America with human and civil rights to defend themselves and explain the truth? Where are you from? Do you hate America? Do you want to go back there to live after retirement? Well, Black women in the US do have rights to live and have all the same experience as you. Regardless, if they are single living alone or in the house with husband. the next time, you find out a civil problem did't occur, don't use or spend anymore money that belongs to the federal government. The federation isn't suppose to be having fun with other women boy friends or getting high on drugs. you were suppose to be working a case, and you lied.

They can lower our interest rate from 4.75 to 3.25 and lower our monthly payment by 400 dollars with the 29 year loan. Saving a little above 100k over the life of the loan.

What are some things I should look for in these? They’re saying there are no costs just the VA fundin fee which rolls into the loan amount.

All the other ones look like spam, and only took interest in this one because it’s from roundpoint which is our current mortgage lender.

personalfinance,"Past employer didn't report my income, I never paid taxes on it, want to get it resolved.","TLDR: Collected unemployment while under the table for 3 years, when it ran out I was 1099'd and have yet to pay federal taxes on any of it or state taxes on 2 of those years. I want to fix all of it.

I worked for a company for 3 years just out of high school in 2011, this is all in California. I was on unemployment when I applied there. Because I didn't know any better and the owner of the company told me it was ok because of my ""classification"" I started to work there full-time and was instructed to continue receiving unemployment. That continued for about 7 months of 2011, and almost a full year of 2012. I never paid any taxes and was supposed to make $2000 a month but rarely actually saw that amount.

In 2013, I was still employed there but when tax time came, I was handed a 1099. Prior to that I was under the table. I didn't understand what it meant, and was told that it was just paperwork shit and to not worry about it. So I didn't. I quit that job in 2014, went back to college and received a letter in the mail from the state of CA stating that I need to pay taxes on that 1099. I wrote the state a letter stating that I didn't believe I was a 1099 employee, they told me to fuck off and I paid the couple hundred bucks and went on my way.

I have since graduated, no longer live in the state and realize that this entire period was wrong. I need to fix the unemployment benefits that I wrongly collected, and I need to pay taxes on all salary I earned from 2011 to 2014. My question now is how? It's my fault for listening to poor advice, and ima wear that, but I want to know what options I have regarding being mis-classified as a non-W2 employee for 3 years. The company shut down in 2015 or 2016, amid a slew of employee labor disputes specifically regarding pay.

investing,Satellite stock Intelsat drops 40% after FCC 5G decision,"I haven't been following this stock in a long time and was wondering if anyone out there followed it more closely. My question is, why did a private company and private investors think they could sell public assets and pocket billions of dollars? Are we really at that stage of delusion?

 [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/intelsat-stock-drops-as-fcc-will-auction-satellite-spectrum-for-5g.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/intelsat-stock-drops-as-fcc-will-auction-satellite-spectrum-for-5g.html) 

 

&gt;The Federal Communications Commission announced on Monday that it will publicly auction off a valuable telecommunications asset, in a move investors viewed as a blow to U.S. satellite communications provider [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I).  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares of [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I) dropped 40% in heavy trading volume after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a tweet that his agency “must free up significant spectrum” for 5G telecommunications. The FCC told CNBC that it expects an auction to happen “before the end of 2020.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve concluded that the best way to advance these principles is through a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band,” Pai said. “I’m confident they’ll quickly conduct a public auction that will give everyone a fair chance to compete.”  
&gt;  
&gt;C-band spectrum is a key telecommunications wavelength the FCC regulates. Four satellite operators, including Intelsat, provide C-band services in the U.S. to about 120 million households. The FCC wants to repurpose the C-band spectrum for 5G and an auction is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars. But a public auction would see the proceeds go to the government, an option the satellite operators – organized as the C-Band Alliance – have opposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fundamental issue here is that there’s the ideal and there’s the practical. Everyone recognizes the best use of this spectrum is for 5G services – but what is the most economical and timely way to do that?” Chris Quilty, president of satellite financial services firm Quilty Analytics, told CNBC. Quilty formerly led Raymond James’ coverage of sattellite communications and the broader space industry for 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The C-Band Alliance [has been pushing for a private auction](https://spacenews.com/c-band-alliance-says-it-would-send-billions-to-u-s-treasury-under-private-spectrum-auction/). The group on Friday gave a proposal to the FCC where the satellite operators would keep some of the proceeds while paying taxes on the sale, as well as contributing at least $8 billion to the U.S. Treasury and possible helping fund a rural 5G network.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The private auction would generate billions in proceeds for Intelsat and the other C-band operators,” Quilty said. “The potential C-band proceeds gave Intelsat a path for deleveraging, which has otherwise escaped the company for the past 10 years.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Intelsat had a market value of about $1.8 billion before trading began on Monday. Even before the latest drop, Intelsat’s stock had declined more than 10% on three consecutive trading days as the tide shifted against the C-Band Alliance. The FCC’s announcement of a public auction means the satellite companies may not recoup the value of their C-Band investments, such as the expensive satellites.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What we’ll likely see happen, which is the worst case scenario, is that the satellite operators have every incentive to drag their heels and take this to the courts, because they’re no longer being compensated for this spectrum,” Quilty said. “People are assuming they’re still going to get something but they’re not going to get the $8 billion to $10 billion windfall they were expecting.”",finance

Can write a check to a vendor, other bank for CC balance transfer, or write a check to myself. 4% Transaction fee

I'm also in the market for a new car (and by new I mean 2013 Civic or Camry) because my car is a piece of junk and might die any day now. I'm abiding by the tenants of this subreddit and the internet's car-buying by using the 20/4/10 rule. I'm thinking, however, is to use these 0% APR checks to pay an even larger down payment (I'm thinking 40%) in order to get a few advantages:

* possibly better interest rate
* lower paid interest over the life of the loan
* lower monthly payment for the auto loan


I ran the numbers of an amortization schedule of an example to see if it would make sense.

$10,000 car with a 20% downpayment, 48 months, and a generous 3% interest rate (for the sake of simplicity)

With this example, I would pay $500 in interest over the life of the loan and have a monthly payment of ~$177


Example 2 is a $10,000 car with a 40% downpayment, 48 months, and same 3% interest

I use the promo offer check and contribute another $2,000 to the downpayment, but pay a 4% transaction fee of $80.

Over the life of the loan, I pay $375 in interest and an $80 transaction fee for a total of $455. Monthly payment ~$133


With this example over the life of the loans, I save $45 with example 2. The car will probably be 10k-15k and the interest rate is unknown so scale the numbers up a bit, but it's really not that much. The main reason I'm thinking of doing this is to use the 40% downpayment as leverage for a better interest rate because I know it's not certain I'll get a 3% interest rate on my auto loan. Additionally, I can contribute more of my income towards my Roth IRA for 2019 (because I wasn't able to max it out this year yet) and then afterwards, pay off the promo check.

Is splitting the loan into 2 overly-complicated for no reason? Is having a 40% downpayment as leverage not worth the administrative hassle?",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell my house?,"My SO and I decided to buy a house in his city last year thinking I would move there at some point. Who would've thought he would get laid off right after we closed on the house, and due to visa restrictions, he had very little time to look for a new job. He was lucky enough to get a new job in my city within a month and had moved over. We had to rent the house out, and the lender had found out that both of us are now out of state, and said that we should really be paying an interest rate for investment property. They said they would investigate stuff on their end but never got back to us so it has been a relief. The rental income has been covering about 75% of the mortgage payment so we were able to keep up with them. 

We had thought about moving back at some point but both of us are doing pretty well in our current jobs so there's not much motivation. Also with the low interest rate environment we thought about refinancing but we're worried that shopping around for a refinance would expose the fact that we're not living in the property so we would have to start paying higher interest rates. The one-year contract of our tenant is coming up soon so we'll have to look for a new tenant if we keep the house.

* Principle &amp; Interest: $791.71
* Total Monthly Payment (with escrow): $1,398.15

I closed a few months ago and have made two normal mortgage payments so far.  I know that extra payments have the biggest impact early on in the loan, and am considering doing this.  My understanding is that it only makes sense to pay extra if the interest saved is more than the expected return of investing that money elsewhere.  The part I'm having trouble with is determining where that cut off point is.  Is there a formula I can use to figure out what percentage I am paying each month, so that I can determine when I should switch to outside investments? 

I am also trying to figure out *how much* extra to contribute.  I still need to crunch more numbers, but right now I am contributing 11% towards my 401K (plus a 3% employer match).  I have $25,000 in a savings account and $7,000 in a mutual fund that I contribute $100 towards monthly.  My take home pay is around $38,000 ($1,445 biweekly) before bonuses/commissions, which are typically around $7,000, for a total of \~$45,000.  I need to get a better handle on what my *actual* monthly spending is (things got skewed with a few one-time expenses with the house and living for free with family for a couple months before I closed), but based on what they were when I was renting plus some quick additions, I believe they are around $1,500/month (excluding the mortgage).  This number includes bills, but also includes going out to eat, buying gifts, etc.  I tend to be pretty consistent with my spending from month to month.

This leaves me about $200/month that's unaccounted for.  Additionally, I typically get bonused out about $5,000 every January.  Should I put either/both of these into the mutual fund?  Should I put it towards the mortgage principle?  If so, for how long?

personalfinance,Should I focus on paying down student loan debt right now or establishing a bigger emergency fund?,"Hello!

Here are some quick details about me to start off:  
Age: 26  
Salary: 60k/year with quarterly bonuses starting this upcoming Feb and potential for merit increases every year (just started in June with a 6 month wait before I'm eligible for the bonuses)  
401k: 6% Roth After Tax - aggressive allocation - currently have a 13.5k balance  
Emergency fund: $1500

I currently have a small emergency fund of about $1500 as shown above. No excuses, I was just an idiot who neglected creating a solid emergency fund in the past. I am now putting away 300-400 per month in a high yield savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs thanks to this sub. I also have about 13.5k in my 401k with an aggressive allocation which I continue to contribute to with every pay check. 

However, one of my biggest financial goals is to pay off my student loan debt by 30-31. I currently have about 30k left to pay off with an interest rate of  4.250%. The 30k loan is made up of two larger loans of 17k and 13k, each with the 4% interest rate I mentioned (this is after I consolidated the many many tiny loans I had before). The interest rate is fixed and will not change. I have a required monthly payment of $200 which is a fixed amount as well and use auto pay to reduce my interest by 0.25%.

I am able to pay up to $650 per month right now toward my student loans which is great because it is helping me bring the principal amount down quite a bit and still leaves me room in my budget to live life comfortably.

But I'm wondering if I should be focusing more on putting money into my savings account right now and maybe scaling back on the loan payments or if I should just continue to chip away at this debt. What do you all think? 

I was thinking maybe I can focus a lot on paying off my student loans and then just put my bonuses from every quarter into my savings account as well as making smaller monthly contributions (maybe 100-200 per month rather than 400). Would this be a better idea if I'm aiming to pay off my student loans ASAP? 

Any and all advice appreciated!",finance
stocks,Stablecoins: What You Need to Know,"Stablecoins reside at the intersection of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. They simplify the transfer of funds between crypto exchanges. Stablecoins make purchases faster and less expensive and are used as a medium of exchange, a means of storing value, and a unit of account. In 2012, Mastercoin proposed a stable-value cryptocurrency, which was later renamed as Omni.

A collateralized stablecoins is pegged to assets such as national currencies, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. In centralized models, the stablecoin issuers back the value of their coin by holding the asset.

A Stablecoin’s value is pegged, for instance, to the USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. Other stablecoins are pegged to the price of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, with algorithms that manage supply and demand of the coin and the reserves. Regardless of how a stablecoin is backed, its value is in its price stability.

In a crypto-collateralized arrangement, a cryptocurrency backs a stablecoin, while seigniorage tokens are not collateralized by anything other than software, which maintains the price stability. A hybrid stablecoin might blend the three above approaches.

**Fiat-backed Stablecoin**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. Custodians manage the fiat in such an arrangement by holding the proper amount of backing currency in an account. Fiat-backed tokens can be issued or destroyed by the custodian as needed to maintain the peg. Stablecoins today are backed by the euro, Japanese yen, and other fiat currencies. Of course, stablecoins where funds are held in bank accounts or by third-parties are susceptible to fraud.

A problem with fiat-backed stablecoins is their centralization.

**Commodity-Backed Stablecoin**

Commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to a commodity, such as gold or silver. A token could be backed by one gram of gold stored in a third-party custodian’s vaults.

These stablecoins are backed by one or more commodities. The backing commodity must reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

**Cryptocurrency-Backed Stablecoin**

A Crypto-collateralized stablecoin is backed by a cryptocurrency and sometimes a basket thereof. Certain mathematical innovations were needed in order to make such a stablecoin possible. These stablecoins are considered a more decentralized alternative to other stablecoins.

A major difference between this type of stablecoin and the abovementioned types is the former is handled on blockchain, with smart contracts, where the latter are done in the physical world through bank accounts or gold custodians.

These stablecoins are oftentimes more complex and require more collateral, due to the volatile nature of the backing cryptocurrencies themselves, than the abovementioned stablecoins.

**Seigniorage-Style Stablecoin**

A seigniorage-Style stablecoin is stabilized by an algorithm. The algorithm could, for instance, control the supply of the seigniorage-style stablecoin. New stablecoins can be minted to stabilize prices if demand for the stablecoin increases.

**Libra, JPMorgan Coin &amp; The Stablecoin Market**

Big institutions have shown interest in creating their own stablecoins. Facebook’s Libra is a stablecoin, because the social networking site sees stablecoins as a potential bridge between the existing world of government-issued money and a crypto-based future.

Stablecoins are also gaining attention from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Inc. According to Facebook, Libra will be backed by “a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.” Libra’s value will fluctuate in the same manner that the US dollar varies compared with the euro or yen from day-to-day. Exchanges will be established so that users can convert fiat for Libra.

JP Morgan says its JPM coin will enable fast money transfers between its corporate customers on an internal, private blockchain. JPM Coin is backed by the U.S. dollars held by the bank.

The Federal Reserve has been advised to [consider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain) stablecoins, and the central bank of Sweden is planning a pilot project with an “e-krona” later this year.

**Money on Chain: A Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin**

Money on Chain foresees big things for stablecoins, too. That’s why in 2015 we started to work on a stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We chose to design a stablecoin on top of Bitcoin because it allowed us to build a truly decentralized stablecoin. We believe Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance is crucial to a stablecoin.

We’ve created a stablecoin pegged to the American Dollar (Dollar On Chain) that incentivizes various participants in the Bitcoin systems.

Money On Chain is made by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.

personalfinance,Saving Strategy and Future Guidance needed on liquid cash at 30 -- HYSA for now? (More inside),"Hey [r/Personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Personalfinance/)! You guys are absolutely incredible for all the advice you give. Wanted to ask for a bit of my own.

Currently i'm a 30-year old Exec at a company making around 350-400k+ a year. I owe 300k on a house, and I have liquid cash assets of around 400,000 total. No other debt, and my house is cash neutral/slightly positive due to renters. I'm maxing out my 401k/Roth and this is the remainder that's left that i'm currently struggling with.

Overview of Finances: 420k in liquid, 100k in 401k from employers, 70K in a Roth, and 50k in standard stock trading accounts. I have no debt outside of the home (300k) at this time, and my monthly run rate is around $2,000-3,000 a month.

As I am not sure about what's going on with the market at this time (still doing my research and leaning towards adopting a ""wait and see approach"") I'm planning on moving a majority (350k) of my money into a HYSA as i'm not convinced what's going to happen to the market due to trends etc...

Three main questions I have are:

My current strategy is wait for the interest rates to drop a bit more before refinancing, I'm on a 5 year ARM and am 2 years into a low rate-- is the current thinking to refinance once/if the market crashes? Or should I go ahead and start the refinance process now? I'm currently at 3.25% 2 years into the ARM.

I understand that Capital One has a High Yield Savings account, I was going to depot 150,000 into that account for the 90 days to obtain the 1,000 bonus, and put the rest (200) in either Marcus or another HYSA - should I take advantage of another bonus? What's the strategy here? Additionally, is there any reason/impact to my credit after the bonus, or should I consolidate into one HYSA? (I thought the reasoning was to split up accounts to hit the max of FDIC insured limits, is that correct?)

\*Anything else i'm missing here that I should be thinking through? Am I doing okay for my age?

Thanks so much!",finance
personalfinance,MO. Dealing with an unwanted car. Advice???,"I was emotionally manipulated into signing for a car I don't want and technically can't afford. The payments are at a roughly 27% interest rate. Currently the payments - a little over $700 - are being covered by spouse's SSD.

I try to do the bare minimum when it comes to keeping up with my financials (regularly checking creditkarma, minimizing my debt, put away money, etc) but I don't really understand the underlying things of how the financial system works.

Anyways, so I logged into creditkarma today for the first time this month and apparently both of my credit scores went down 30 points (Equifax) and 20 points (Transunion) for no apparent reason. I've had no credit checks, my balances have been going down (I hardly even use my card), no new accounts, nothing.

Also, I logged into my savings account and found my interest rate went down, also for no reason. Does this have anything to do with the Fed cutting rates?

*How can I leave when the gross amount, due to taxes, includes money I never received, touched, or have?*

I'm about four months into a job that came with a substantial sign on bonus.  
I'm having doubts about the decision to join as it's away from friends and family.  
Part of the reason I took the role was my S.O. which isn't a part of the picture anymore.  


The way I hoped this would work is that if I paid back the post-tax amount I received that the taxes would cancel and I'd be even with the company. From what I've read this is not the case. Here is the taxes breakdown:

* Federal Income Tax (22%)
* Social Security Tax (6.2%)
* Medicare Tax (1.45%)
* State Income Tax (9.62%)
* City Income Tax (4.25%)

These taxes add up to 44% of the bonus. I haven't spent any of the net.  
*How can I leave when the net minus gross amount is so large and includes money I never received, touched, or have?*",finance

personalfinance,Is there a reason I SHOULDN’T get a home equity line of credit?,"I’ve never had to take out a loan and don’t anticipate any large purchases in the near future, but a lady at the bank today was explaining that it’s peace of mind—for example if I lose my job and just need money quickly (whereas if I try to apply for it if that ever happened, it’s likely I wouldn’t get approved with $0 income). So do I just get it and let it sit there? Do people do that? Is that smart?

A second hypothetical question is...why wouldn’t I get the line of credit, then take like a $10k loan (at a pretty low interest rate) and throw it in the stock market? I was told the minimum I’m required to pay is the interest. Let’s say that’s $50 / month on a $10k loan. So $50 to have $10k cash to invest in the market and, based on historical data, earn more than the interest I have to pay on the loan. So in a few years, sell high and pay back the principal and keep the remainder (i.e., more than the interest I’ve paid).

Thoughts on either of these?

personalfinance,"Soon to be new grad, starting a job after school, need any advice regarding my future financial situation","Hi all, I've never posted here before so hopefully I give enough info and ask the right questions.

Some info about me:

21M graduating college in May 2020

Salary: $100k a year starting July 2020

Signing bonus: $5k after signing and $5k after starting

Debt: Around $120k in student loan debt ranging between multiple federal and private loans (federal loans are around average of 5% interest I believe and account for probably $20k and private account for about $100k with an average of 10% interest)

Investments/Savings: $3k in an index fund and $2.5k in a Roth IRA. About $10k in savings (this is leftover student loan money that I still need to pay rent/buy books and supplies/food/etc., will probably still have some left post graduation, maybe $5k if I had to estimate)

So yea, I got lucky with a great job out of school in my home state, commuting distance from my parents' home (about an hour there and an hour back). My reason for this post to get general advice on how to make sure I make the most out of this and get my life started on the right foot.

Here is a little potential budget I made using one of those online budget calculators: [https://imgur.com/a/Go17ZZc](https://imgur.com/a/Go17ZZc)

That budget is assuming I live with my parents, commute to work about 2 hours everyday, finance a new car, and pay $2500 in student loans per month. I'll explain more below.

So to get started explaining myself, I have read that refinancing your student loans if you have high interest is a good idea, so I was planning on that. Refinancing to something like 6% interest and then repaying around $2500 a month in order to have everything paid off within 5 years. Should I throw all of my bonus money straight into the loan at once in one big payment? Is this a good plan or would you suggest something else?

Another large expense I have on there is the $10800 annual car expense from financing a new car and yearly car insurance. For this job I will have to commute about 1hr there and 1hr back everyday from my parents home. If I do that, I'd like to get a car like a Tesla (something I've wanted for years and would love to get one if it makes sense financially) so that'd be around $800 a month if I finance over 72 months with a $5k down payment and 3.5% APR. It would make the drives hopefully a lot more enjoyable and I'd be saving around $250 in gas per month which I would need if I drove my current car. I understand this probably isn't what most people would recommend I do, but I'm only considering it right now and if it's that bad of a decision then of course I won't go through with it. Again what do you guys think of this decision?

Now what I could do is not live with my parents and get an apartment close to my job (probably around $800-$1200 a month) which would replace the want for me to get a new car (however my monthly expenses would be around the same since the car payments and rent would hopefully be similar). This would probably introduce new costs like paying for my own food and other expenses that occur when you don't live with your parents though. However as I said I won't want a new car since my commute would be hopefully a lot shorter. Thoughts on this scenario?

All of my other decisions like my monthly savings/investments/retirement goals I feel are somewhat accurate. I did some research and asked my parents and friends what they thought. I would plan on investing that $1000 a month into the Vanguard index fund I currently use, then retirement I would do a 401k for work (they match 6%) or continue my Roth IRA or both. Once again though, I could be completely wrong about my numbers so any advice would be awesome.

I've only listed a few specific topics, but literally any advice about anything would be so appreciated. I really want to make sure I handle all of my debt and earned money correctly and intelligently. Apologies if I worded some things wrong or left out some info, I'm not the most gifted in knowledge of finances, just leave a comment if you need any more info or clarification.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Is 9.99% the best interest rate for an unsecured personal loan?,"Spouse and I currently have a personal unsecured loan for $30,000. The interest rate is 9.996% - We currently have $27K remaining to pay off.

The finance charge is $7,425.78/54 payments

We used this loan to pay off the rest of our house (valued at about $72K).

Would it be a good idea to refinance in some way to get a cheaper loan? Maybe we could use the house as collateral to do this?

Our income is about 68K and we both have 730+ credit scores.

**Update - People are asking why I went with a personal loan rather than a mortgage.**

I was thinking that if we wanted to buy a different house that we would miss out on any first time homeowner programs. The thinking was that the amount of discount from a program like that would be better used in a more expensive house.

personalfinance,Reduce bonus taxes using 401k contributions,"Hello everyone!

Let me give some background. I'm working in California. Let's say gross salary is 100k, and quarterly bonus is 5k, so 20k in bonuses annually. I'm contributing 18% (to traditional 401k) of both bonus and biweekly paycheck to max out 401k.

However, now I'm looking to reduce the taxable bonus income, as that is taxed at \~35% supplemental rate, whereas regular income tax is around 27% total (federal, state, etc combined)

Does it make sense to switch my bonus's 401k contribution to 100% traditional, until I reach the 401k contribution limit? In turn, I would move reduce my regular paycheck contribution to 0. At year's end, I would still have maxed out my contributions, but would be taxed based on my regular salary tax bracket vs. my bonus supplemental tax bracket.

I'm looking online for calculators so I can do some math myself, but would love your feedback. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks everyone for your input! Turns out I need to learn more about taxes vs withholding, but you all pointed me in the right direction. 

TLDR: Withholding is reconciled during tax time -- no real benefit to change current 401k contribution.",finance

personalfinance,Home Equity Loan vs 10+1 ARM,"Context first and questions at the end.

My parents currently have a 15 year, $200k home equity loan on their house with a variable rate. Monthly payment generally ranges from $850-$950/month (just to cover interest). They are considering switching to a 10+1 ARM loan that would be a lower interest rate (3.6%). My understanding is the rate would be fixed for 10 years and then it balloons the 11th year, but you are able to refinance before you hit the 11th year (not sure how easy it is to refinance). Appraisal and settlement costs are going to increase the principal of the loan marginally, but the monthly payment will be less by a couple hundred dollars. The house would sell for $500k – $550k today.

Additionally, it came to my attention that even though they have been saving money elsewhere, they’ve barely been trying to pay down any principal of the home equity loan. They were just paying the interest and they plan on paying interest until they decide to sell the house. Combined income is about $125k/year and they have about $230k in savings. That $230k does not include the money they would net from the house if they sold it today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly asking two things:

1. Should they switch from the home equity loan to the 10+1 arm loan? Is refinancing really not an issue in the 10th year/is that unwise to rely on?
2. Should they start attacking the principal of the loan? And if they do, should they use some of the savings that they already have on hand? Does it depend on when they want to sell the house? Generally, I know you should always aim to eliminate debt. They are older and have a good chunk of equity in the house already and I'm not sure if there is a more nuanced strategy to apply in this context. That said, if switching to the ARM makes sense then at the very least I feel like they should keep paying what they have been on the home equity loan and have that extra couple hundred dollars in attack the principal every month.",finance

About 3 weeks later (early October) I received a notice that I had not sent in the W-9 form. I called customer service and was told I needed to send it in again. I asked them to confirm the address and they gave me a P.O. Box in South Dakota despite the return mailer being for a P.O. box in Missouri.

Should we refinance or just get the house reappraised and pay down the principal to remove PMI?

personalfinance,Making young children authorized users?,"I'm looking for advice for my specific scenario. I know there are lots of opinions about making children authorized users. My intent is to make my children authorized users on one or more of my credit cards as soon as they are able (per minimum ages defined for each account) in order to give them some sort of credit baseline. I do not intend to tell this to my kids until (if and when) I figure they are old enough and responsible enough to start learning/using credit. I'm particularly fond of the cards that allow me to set spending limits, but I digress.

My questions are:

1) Does an authorized user have to show activity on the account? Meaning, if I make my child an authorized user but I hold onto their physical card, do I need to use it occasionally? Or can I throw it in a drawer for years?

2) When should I remove my child as an authorized user to minimize damage to their credit? As soon as they can get their own credit account? After they've built up 'independent' credit for a while? Never?

3) Is there any increase risk of fraud from an outside agent by having a child as an authorized user? I plan to monitor my children's credit to catch/prevent identity theft type issues.

4) Are there other strategies for giving my kids the best credit possible from an early age? I'm thinking like adding them to a car payment, rent, insurance, utility bills? I get that doing some of those will incur additional charges or poorer interest rates, but I'd like to way the cost-benefit.

I realize if my credit tanks I'm taking them with me. I have no reason to believe this will happen (my spouse and I are currently at 800+ credit scores and steady full-time careers and good investments, e-funds, etc) and if the worst were to somehow happen I would remove authorized users asap. I'm asking for advice with the assumptions that my spouse and I are extremely low risk for financial issues. Our accounts are completely intermingled, we have outstanding love and trust, and take educating our children about finances very seriously (as opposed to the complete lack of anything we got from our parents).",finance
personalfinance,Returning Expat to USA. Will need to buy a car. Whats my play here?,"Hi all, 1st some details.

I am a 43 yr old American, married to a UK citizen, 3 yr old daughter. We are moving to the tri-state area in 3 weeks from England. Wife is a lawyer and is the breadwinner. Income north of $150k a year. I have been gone since 2007 so will be starting over from a credit standpoint? We will need to buy a car just about immediately and I want to make sure we are taking advantage of the situation in order to build credit as quickly as we can. As we will be starting from no credit history I presume we will be sub prime? I am a Mechanic by trade (now a stay at home dad to my Daughter), so lets just assume that repair costs and actual car selection are non issues. I know what is worth buying and it costs me nothing but time to keep a car running. I am torn between 3 choices.

Do I buy a $2-3k beater for cash and just not worry about it for the 1st few months (I don't really want to do this).

Do I put that $2k down on a $8-10k car that we would hang onto for a while. I presume with a sub prime loan? Is there any advantage or penalty to paying it off faster than they expect? Are we better off letting the loan run its course?

Or do I put the $2k down on a $20k car that we would actually really enjoy owning? I know we can afford this option, but I assume its a bad move as then I am paying the higher sub-prime interest rate on a bigger loan?

All of this would be cars around 10 years old or so, remember I can fix them for free so I have an unfair advantage here. To my mind the most we would EVER spend on a car, even if we were fully established would be $30k or so. Being in the industry I am unwilling to take the depreciation hit on anything new.

I am correct in assuming that we will have no credit history so we will be sub prime right? Neither of us even have a US bank account yet so we will be totally starting from nothing. Is there even any point in approaching the bank/credit union directly for the loan? My assumption is that as we would be sub prime we will have little choice other than dealer financing and just taking the hit. So I am leaning towards the middle choice as it were. That being the case Is it in our best interest to pay it off on time, or faster than needed? Or should I just keep it in mind and ask for a shorter term loan? I am afraid I am somewhat illiterate to all this as I have never financed a car before in the states (or otherwise) and when I left the states I was still young enough (and single enough) that I didn't pay much attention to my credit score. Now the need to finance a house in the not too distant future means I need to pay a lot more attention.

personalfinance,Advice upcoming car purchase and large down-payment,"Hi PF - I'm looking to buy a truck (Tacoma, 1-3 years old - expected price around $32K) in the next 6-12 months, although I'd prefer to buy around July 2020 due to a trip in the following month.

Right now I have $17,000 in Ally Savings that is earmarked for a car, and each month I add $650 to that. (I have this broken down into $400 + $250 as the intention with the $250 is to mimic the amount of a  car payment that I would like to have. After buying a car the $400 would either be going to Student Loans for a faster payoff or i'll keep saving for eventual house purchase.)

**My other assets are as follows:**

* $6,000 in emergency fund (I'm comfortable with this amount and don't have plans to increase it in the near future; also have ~$1000 in credit card rewards that could be used in emergency as well)

* $12,000 in Roth Ira (Contribute $400 monthly to this)

* $12,000 in employer sponsored retirement (These are my own contributions only - contribution is fixed at 7%. Employer matches my contribution but I don't get vestment for another two years)
* $4.8K in brokerage account (Opened in college; No longer contribute to this)

**Debts (Student Loans only)**

* $14,000 (currently paying $350 per month; $150 is minimum payment and I add an extra $200 to go to highest interest rate loan - which is currently $1,200 @ 6.8% - the rest of the loans are around 3-4%)

If I were to make the purchase in July 2020 - my car savings would increase by about $4,500 in that time bringing my car fund to ~$21,500. 

**So - my main question - is putting $21,500 down on a truck and getting a loan for the balance (~$10K) the best way to go here? Are they any other suggestions that I might consider?  I'm hoping to get a loan term of 48 months but I would be okay with 60 months.  FYI - credit score is ~800-805 so i'm not too concerned about getting a good rate.**",finance

personalfinance,Using Cashout Refi to my advantage?,"Hey guys, 

I would like to get your opinion on this. In preparation for the upcoming housing crash, I am planning to do a cashout refi to pull out the equity I have accumulated from the housing bubble and use it to pay my new mortgage (sounds counter-intuitive, I know, hear me out). Here are the basic numbers:

* Property value:   $430,000
* Loan remaining:   $147,000
* Max Loan Possible:   $344,000
* New Mortgage interest rate: 3.75%
* Cash on Hand:  $194,000

Some background, my wife and I are avid savers and investors. We have a small mortgage that is about 15% of our income. I still carry a car payment but only because the interest rate on it is 1.95%. We don't have any other debt, so we are not one of those people who do a cashout refi to buy a boat or a new car. We have quite of a bit of saving in both cash and stocks, so weathering a 3-5 years period is not a problem. We won't have to touch the cashout money.

After refi-ing, I will have about $194,000 on hand, which I will diversify into the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* high yield savings account (20%) :   to maintain liquidity
* dividend stocks (40%): to add cash flow without having to sell stocks
* ETF  and growth stocks (40%) : to generate potential growth

&amp;#x200B;

The $194,000 will accumulate interest  and be used to pay the mortgage payment every month. Assuming 4% annual return, this money will run out after 13 years based on this chart:

Chart #1 - [https://ibb.co/hyc1SpQ](https://ibb.co/hyc1SpQ)

At which point I will take over the payment. Assuming 2% inflation, below is a comparison of what I would've paid under my original mortgage vs. leveraging my equity with a cashout refi, after adjusting for inflation:

Chart #2 - [https://ibb.co/jyvz5R7](https://ibb.co/jyvz5R7)

In a nut shell, assuming inflation stays at 2% and my investment generates 4% return, I will have paid extra $45,000 to have $194,000 cash on hand for opportunities in a financial crash and/or 13 years of extra cash flow by not having to pay mortgage. 

Increase in inflation and/or interest rate will work in my favor as well. For example, if I can get 6% return instead of 4%, I will be able to go 15 years 9 months without having to make mortgage payment, in which case I will actually save $31,000 2019-dollars. If the inflation is 3% instead of 2%, I will save even more in that scenario, to a total about $50,000 2019-dollars. If the Fed continue to keep interest rate artificially low, I can also refi again to a lower interest rate. 

I grew up in more of the Dave Ramsey's teaching - no debt - but now that I am a little older (35 yrs old) I have begun to understand how to manage money better besides just carrying no debt. Has any of you done something similar to this? I am sure I missed something that might potentially lead to a pitfall. Any insights or recommendation will be appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,AirBnb Refinancing Question,"Hi r/personalfinance  \- I'm interested in getting everyone's opinion on next steps for an  AirBnb property that I purchased on July 31st of this year. This is the  first property I have ever purchased.

Here's the rundown on the property, the financial situation, and eventually the question I'm curious about getting an answer on.

I  purchased the property for $63,000 on July 31st, it's a 370 sq ft.  studio located close to a ski resort in the Southeastern U.S.  Transaction costs to purchase the property amounted to $2,407.

Since  purchasing the unit it has grossed $4,667 and costs have totaled to  (including transaction costs) $5,700, so my net profit on this purchase  has been -$1,053. So I'm in the green $1,400 if you don't count the  one-time transaction costs.

Monthly  revenue seems to average at $1,500 a month and expenses are about $800 a  month (including cleaning at $60 a clean) so it's cash-flowing $700 a  month right now. I'm pretty satisfied with the numbers and I'm renting  for 95-110$ a night, every weekend since I purchased it it has been  booked.

So what's my question and why haven't you mentioned your down-payment yet?

My  Aunt offered to loan me the cash to purchase the property for 6 months  at 0% interest, which I of course took advantage of. After 6 months  (January 31st), I need to refinance the property and pay her back. So  right now I don't have a mortgage payment.

I  have a 25% dp (\~16k) of my own personal money that I am willing to put  down at refinancing and my separate bank account for the AirBnb has  about 4k in total in it. I haven't taken any money from the AirBnB yet.

The  mortgage banker I've been working with says he can get me a loan where I  can put a minimum 10% down, and he can refinance the loan with that as a  second property.

He hasn't  offered me an interest rate yet since I apparently can't refinance until  I have owned the property for 6 months (my Aunt is aware of this and is  totally fine with the delay in payment) but I've ran some numbers and  even a 20 year mortgage on 48k (15k down) at 5% is only a $320 payment,  which still fits really well into my budget.

So  what would you do in my situation? How much money would you put down?  From which bank accounts would you pull the money from? What are the tax  implications of pulling the money from two different accounts (it's not  an LLC)? What kind of mortgage term would you look for?

As  an aside, I don't own a primary home, my current rent costs are $600 a  month and will be moving in with my girlfriend (who owns her property  outright) and my rent costs will drop to $400 a month.

Thanks - looking forward to everyone's feedback and advice.",finance

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,"My investing in early 20s, what can I improve on?","So first of all I want to say that this is not a brag post or something along those lines. I realise I'm in a position that's quite rare and I could do with some advice on how I could handle investing even better for the future. 

General sketch of me: I live in the Netherlands and I'm 21, 2nd year of college and about to move out. In the Netherlands we have this system where you can get a loan of €1000 a month to pay towards any college funds/books/housing. My college funds and books are about €2000 a year. I set up this loan as soon as I could because it has a 0% interest rate, so far I've been saving/investing all of this money and I've also earned quite a bit of money as I have a job as well. I'm about 19K in debt but I've got about 27K in my investing account. My work will pay off my housing once I move out, meaning overall I'll still be getting somewhere between €1000-€1200 a month (combination of loan &amp; earnings). 

I'm very lucky that my dad is investing in stocks as well and that he wanted to teach me the basics, which is why I'm doing what I'm doing right now. So far I've been investing mostly in dividend companies. At the moment I'm getting paid about €1200 a year in dividends alone. 

Knowing what you know right now and what you have learned through investing; what are some tips that you might have for me? What are things I should look out for or try to be more careful about?

I'm willing to give more information if needed, just ask me in the comments.",finance

personalfinance,Consolidating grandma's finances,"My grandmother has a number of financial products. She's 87 years old and looking to consolidate some of them WRT passing them on to her heirs (7 people).

She doesn't currently have to file tax forms. I don't know if that's due to her disability or low income. She makes next to nothing aside from SSI/disability income and she has almost zero living expenses. She lives with my parents. Her medical bills are minimal (&lt; $50/mo).

She has the following products:

* Two whole life insurance policies. One of them is paying ""paid-up additional"" dividends back into the policy which seems wasteful.
* A fixed annuity in a traditional IRA with a terrible return. (MRD ~$1.6K, total ~$20.7K)
* A traditional IRA with a company I've never heard of. (total $3.1K)

She's taking forced withdrawals from both IRAs.

What should I recommend to her? Here are my initial thoughts:

* I don't think she needs life insurance at all. Look into cashing out both policies and see if any penalties apply.
* The annuity pays a very low interest rate (about 0.5%). Cash that out as well if the penalty isn't too high.
* Move the IRAs somewhere that doesn't have administrative fees.

Does this seem like good advice? I've had very good luck investing on my own but these financial products are very different from the ones I'm familiar with and she has very different goals from mine (pass money on to heirs vs. FIRE).

[https://finance.zacks.com/ira-bond-7110.html](https://finance.zacks.com/ira-bond-7110.html)

Anyone here old enough to even know what these bonds were?  Please don't answer without knowing what they are.

I know you can do such a rollover.  I don't know the mechanism.  I don't know whether they are cashed in by the process (take away whatever interest rate they were earning, which varies by the year you got them, so it may be beneficial or harmful to switch to whatever you would invest that cash in within an IRA).  If a rollover does cash them into the IRA account, I assume that entire amount is tax deferred.  If it doesn't cash them, all such bonds were originally paper and I haven't seen anything about a way to convert to electronic, so how would an IRA hold paper bonds?  Or how does the conversion to electronic work?

More important than possibly changing the interest rate while keeping the money tax deferred, is the impact on RMD.  They stop earning interest when you turn 70.5, so you would want to cash them when you turn 70.5.  So you would want the taxable distribution of that cash in that year to be part of your overall RMD for that year, rather than in addition to that RMD.  If they had been rolled into an IRA then obviously they become a simple part of the RMD.  If they haven't been rolled into an IRA, the IRS language I've read is far less clear.  Maybe those bonds are lumped together with IRA's for (both side of) the RMD computation anyway.  But if they aren't, it is worth some effort to get them to be.",finance
personalfinance,Interest too good to be true???,"hi all,

i'm trying to buy a 298k house and have a mortgage broker running loan options for me. when he ran the simulations, for whatever reason, my interest rate is lower with a 15% down payment than a 20% by 0.25%. however, the 15% down payment will incur a monthly PMI of $27. has anyone ever heard of this? why would a PMI garner me a lower rate? 

since i was planning to pay 20% anyway, it makes sense to me to make the 15% down payment to lock in the more favorable interest rate, and then immediately make an early payment into principal in order to bring my equity up to 22% to have the PMI drop off.  perhaps i'm overthinking, but this seems too good to be true and i'm very apprehensive about surprise costs, an inability to shuck the PMI for whatever reason, amongst other things. i'll take whatever insight i can get!",finance
personalfinance,Recommendations on Bank accounts that provide automatic transfers from savings=&gt;checking to cover overdrafts,"I hate keeping my money in a low-interest rate checking accounts.  Therefore I have a nice setup with Fidelity that allows nearly all of my cash kept on hand to be earning a decent interest rate.  I have 2 accounts:
- a cash management account that is effectively a checking account, unlimited transfers, atm fees reimbursed yada yada. It has a 0.82% APY. I pay all bills from this account, and when overdrawn it pulls funds from the below account.
- a brokerage account with funds invested in SPRXX (7-day yield at 1.52%).

This allows me to keep as little money as possible in the cash account and I don't have to worry about if I have enough money to cover bills.

I recently opened a Simple.com account because they have a ""Protected Goals"" account that offers 2.13% APY.  I also have a cash account (0% APY) with them, but they don't offer the same auto-transfer functionality I have set up on Fidelity so I don't use it for anything.

My cash management story has now become more complicated because I have 2 ""savings"" acccounts.  To get max yield I need to keep more in Simple, but then I have to be careful that my fidelity account never dries up.

I'm basically looking for a ""simpler"" (sic) solution that perhaps earns me an interest rate between the two ( ~2%) and enables me to ignore my account and NEVER have to worry about overdrafts (given I don't run out of cash).",finance

I think i could get a 2016-2017 sedan for $10-12,000. hoping for some opinions. I've got \~$130,000 in student loans. Making $65,000 before taxes.

 

&amp;#x200B;

Loan Breakdown:

\~$90,000: Private loan (75,000 princ. + 15,000 int.), floating rate (8.25% as of last payment, but should drop after Powell cut rates last month), payment this month is $717

\~11,000: Private Loan, fixed 6.49%, fixed payment $129

\~28,000 Federal, mix of interest rates (average around 3.5-4%), fixed payment at $288

Total of $1134 monthly

   
 

Pay: $65,000, paid biweekly. paychecks are $2,012 so total take home is about $52,300 and monthly take home is about $4,359.

   
 

Expenses broken down monthly:

Loan Payments: $1,134

Rent: $1,150

Utilities: \~$50

Wifi: $25

Gas: \~$50 (short commute and don’t drive too much other than that)

Gym: $35

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think that leaves me at $1635 for the month. Parents currently cover phone bill and car insurance. I go out on the weekends, get dinner with my girlfriend, occasionally buy a Gatorade at the convenience store, etc. But most of that reflects how much I am willing to spend and if I need to cut back I can. I haven’t had to make any loan payments yet but grace period is up next month and the payment cycle will begin. I also plan to chop away here and there on my biggest loan with the highest int. rate when able.

gaming,Multiplayer PC Gaming is corrupted beyond repair,"Multiplayer PC Gaming is corrupted beyond repair, Competitive multiplayer PC Gaming has slowly been filled with a new type of customer that has now been accepted and targeted by the gaming companies, companies that seek the benefit of a bigger income that derives from a bigger market. This type of customer or player seems to be more defined by being ""pro Cheating"" or by the ""little emperor syndrome"" from China, than classic competitive players from the Lan era, where a moral rule was kept by players having some control over the games, they were part of. 

This ""corruption"" appears to be rampant in all parts of PC gaming, from Pro Streaming Players using cheats or hacks (most popular one ""auto-aim"") to gaming companies adapting their games to please this kind of player to avoid losing a considerable part of the income from the said market. 

How are Gaming companies being complicit? Gaming companies that have Battle royal competitive style multiplayer games, seem to be avoiding integrating certain tools or options to their games that in the past where pretty common, from ""Kill cams"" to basic options like ""vote to kick player"" or in-game server chat to communicate between players to identify cheaters and act accordingly .

Besides these simple ways of adapting to that market, the gaming companies seem to go beyond that and casually arrange Pro tournaments where the players can compete from their homes with their computers, with the companies doing little to no effort of making sure they are not using undetectable hacks/cheats, and only relying on their ""anti-cheat programs"" that seem to be more of a false illusion of fairness than an actual working tool to stop cheaters. 

This corruption has been ignored or fed by companies that benefit economically from this market, from companies that rely on naïve people that think that everybody can become a Pro streamer and make a career of it if you just subscribe to their service, to gaming companies doing little to no effort on their behalf to make it more difficult for cheaters to exist or to keep at it (putting registration walls or paywalls) or by private gaming companies controlling public forums of their games and not letting the subject of cheating to be talked about in any way or by controlling the narrative in a forced manner.

Anyway before you as a reader create an opinion on who or why somebody would take their time to write this, let me clarify my intentions for writing this, it's not to attack or just complain about something that right now or in the near future has no solution, it's to at least bring a little peace of mind to an apparent few that actually notice this, to the unknown legit pro players behind CS Go all the way to APEX Legends, that every day they get that feeling of ""This just doesn't add up"" that makes them feel a little bit crazy, while they try to enjoy their favorite hobby, Multiplayer PC gaming.",technology

investing,US Credit deterioration,"Since the beginning of 2018, US credit (via ICE BofAML) total return performance across credit ratings is beginning to draw some concern. I'll highlight a few of those concerns below:

1. Since the beginning of 2018 owning AA through Single-B, broadly speaking, has had a total return of \~10%, regardless of the credit rating. Owning CCC-rated and below securities has yielded you a LOSS of \~1.5%. In this period we have seen the Fed raise rates, then reverse, and have seen investors truly ""reach for yield"", see negative rates.
2. To tie into #1, you have performed BETTER (total return) by owning AA US corporate credit securities over Single-B rated debt since the beginning of 2018. Better performance with a significantly different risk profile. Again, this is a space where participants are ""reaching for yield"".
3. On r/economy, I highlighted a chart I put together to help monitor turns in US corporate credit. In 2018, between January and October, a blow-off like top occurred with the highest reading ever seen, since data was available dating back to 1997. This marked the peak, and ever since has fallen precipitously to levels seen during the following periods: Q4 2015, September 2008, and August 2000.

It's a simple assumption, but given history, I suspect in or around Q1 2020 will be a bit of a ""pain point"" for low(er) grade US credit: Single-B and BB-rated. Likely spreads are to really get good traction to the upside. It's my estimation that the easing in credit, regardless of the Fed, has peaked around the end of September of this year, 2019.

How this impacts equities, if at all, I have no clue, but I believe the cost of protection for equities, i.e. volatility, is EXPENSIVE (yes, expensive) when compared to the cost of protection against US credit, specifically spec grade, using HYG as a proxy. And for the record, I believe the cost of protection for equities (proxy, VIX) is ""too cheap"". Lastly, since I used HYG as a proxy, one may note that the largest sector exposure is communications at \~25%. Second and third are both Consumer sectors (non-cyclical and cyclical), making up some 30% of the holdings combined. Worth noting on where to watch.

I nicely raised the subject with my boss and he literally told me that everyone who was hired this year is making the same as me and anyone who says otherwise is confused or just starting rumors. 

I'm not that stupid, but also at a loss as to what to do since he shut me down like that. I know many jobs on the line and carried a central station on my back for 6 months while we were short staffed and no one else knew the job. 

I don't want to leave, but I may have to if I have no options for being paid as much as new hires. Advice?",finance
personalfinance,Can someone help me estimate how much I will pay as a 1099 independent contractor?,"Hello! So I have been struggling to understand how contracted employees calculate their taxes. I understand that there is a self employment tax that includes social security plus Medicare (around 15%), but are there more federal taxes on top of those to pay? I am an Alaska resident, which does not have an income tax, but is there a federal income tax? Also, I’m hoping someone can explain to me how I may need to split up my taxes to pay quarterly, but I’m having a hard time conceptualizing what that will look like, as my contracts don’t have my working continuously always (offshore industry, so typically 5 weeks on, 5 weeks off or more). I see myself setting aside money from each 5 week tour I take to pay taxes, so would i just total those amounts per tax period? Basically, I’m trying to decide whether to take a job I’ve been offered and a lot of the weight is going to be on my earnings and if I will be screwed on paying contractors taxes. Any help would be much much appreciated!",finance

Bitcoin,"I didn't buy bitcoin because of how well I thought they'd do 6-12 months out, but 6-12 years out","And whenever the price is low, even though I got it in during some fomo, cost average, if I was willing to drop $1200 on a tenth of a bitcoin, today's prices look like a bargain, I actually bought $508 of it yesterday.

I didn't plug my money into the cryptomarket as well I could have, I should have averaged it out more across a longer period of time, that said, iirc the inflation on bitcoins mined and released into the market prior to the next halvening is high compared to say our fiat USD...that will drastically change 5-10 years out when the inflation rate is substantially lower than inflation on fiat.

I believe there is a chance that the next recession could be a doozy, and say a substantial credit downgrade on US Treasury bonds, bond holders demanding higher interest rates, or the US somehow defaulting on its outstanding debt instead of say mass printing off a good $23,000,000,000,000 as opposed to  of absolving itself from debt...there could be a major change in the world order on USD being the world's reserve currency.

In terms of conflicts among major powers this has been the most peaceful 70 years the planet has ever seen between rival powers...I believe there will be a major event in our future where that is no longer the case, dystopian at minimum.

stocks,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,"As usual I’ll start off with a high level round up of the large caps before adding a bit more detail on the value and speculative stocks.

**TJX** and **Target** both reported excellent results. However, it was not a good week in general for retail with **Macy’s** reporting a 3.5% drop in same store sales and a data breach. **Kohls** dropped 20% after reporting a miss, cutting guidance and pointing to an “increasingly competitive promotional environment”. 

**Home Depot** results were mixed and the stock price also dropped 10%. A little harsh perhaps after what was a narrow miss and considering comps were still up a very respectable 3.5%. A number of analysts followed the sell off with reassuring comments that the market for home improvement products remained strong with improving home affordability, lower interest rates, aging baby boomers spending money on remodelling and millennials entering the housing market.

Elsewhere, **Snapchat** announced it will be fact-checking all political advertising in a move that offers a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter and may help it take a larger share of political advertising budgets ahead of the 2020 elections. Advertisers will be keen to use Snapchat’s platform which remains highly popular among younger demographics (which are seeing significant increases in voter turnout). With the total spend on political advertising in 2020 estimated at $10 billion even a small share could provide a meaningful boost to Snapchat (TTM revenues $1.54 billion) over the next year.

The man credited with bringing **T-Mobile** back from the dead, CEO John Legere, announced he was moving on and was to be replaced by COO Mike Sievert. The market took the news in its stride, reassured by announcements that there would be no change in strategy and realising perhaps that the time had come for a more conventional approach. Nevertheless Mr Sievert has some big shoes to fill.

**PayPal** said it was putting part of its cash pile to use with a transformative $4 billion acquisition of, discount-finding tool, Honey Science. The stock fell 1.5% but the news was well received by analysts who said it should drive engagement and develop a deeper relationship with consumers and merchants.

Bad news for **Slack Technologies** as a blog post this week by Microsoft Corporation revealed its Microsoft “Teams” service now has more than 20 million users. Teams seems to be gaining momentum, which is clearly a negative for Slack. The latest numbers suggest Teams added 7 million new daily active users in the past five months compared to adding just 1 million new daily active users in the previous 10 months.

Finally the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) released data on Monday, showing a 12% year-over-year declines in appliance shipments. That sounds like bad news for appliance makers such as **Whirlpool** but, as of Friday, the stock was little changed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks (Fluent Inc)**

**Fluent Inc** jumped 20% after management sent a strong signal to the market. However I think it could go significantly higher. 

The company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them.  A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent which has already reportedly started testing in the UK.

However Fluent's stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 75% (with a valuation of 0.5x sales and 0.6x book) from highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice. That by itself is an issue as it suggests that, not only is there a problem but, management dont understand how bad it is.

The overall change in guidance was actually not that bad (not something that suggests a 75% SP drop is required). Full year sales are still forecast to rise 6.4% although EBITDA will drop 34%. Q3 and Q4 numbers are down on 2018 but Q4 still reveals an annualised EBITDA of $20m which compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million.

I think there is more upside potential. Management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform is very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). They said they did experience some softness at the core for approximately 60 days, spanning mid-August to mid-October. On the November 11 conference call CEO Ryan Schulke said ""Since mid-October, we have regained our traction and to date, we've seen trending improve from top-line revenue and media margin perspective.""

That has been supported by Tuesdays share buy back announcement with Schulke saying “This stock repurchase program reflects the continued confidence we have in the fundamentals and long-term prospects of our business, further supported by improvements we have seen in our core commercial trending following a challenging third quarter,”

Management clearly want to send out a signal that the core business is improving again and the SP jump of 20% is a good start but it is still down 30% on a week ago and 75% on April highs. (as mentioned above the annualised EBITDA of $20m compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million)

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Target)** 

**Target** reported excellent results as it appears customers warm to the concept of same day pick up from a Target store. More hassle in some ways but it eliminates a load of cardboard boxes that would have to be recycled. Third-quarter results shot past guidance as store traffic and sales growth accelerated. Revenue grew 4.7% to $18.7 billion, beating analyst expectations of $18.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36 after the company had forecast EPS between $1.04 and $1.24 three months ago. Stock ended the week up 24%. 25% EPS growth compares favorably to the 20x 2019 PE.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highly Speculative Pharmaceuticals (Karuna, Myovant and Hepion)**

**Karuna Therapeutics** jumped 440% on Monday after reporting a very positive mid-stage clinical trial for its lead candidate, KarXT, for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia

Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D., professor and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons and a member of Karuna’s scientific advisory board said “The results of the Phase 2 trial are impressive and encouraging because they indicate that KarXT, if approved, could represent a game-changing therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia,”

He added. “The effectiveness of antipsychotics has been limited by the frequent and serious side effects of first- and second-generation drugs which are difficult for many patients to tolerate, are potentially harmful, and lead to high rates of discontinuation and relapse. In addition to its novel mechanism of action, KarXT could be a new therapeutic option that has the potential to offer robust efficacy devoid of weight gain, metabolic effects and extrapyramidal *{involuntary movement}* side effects.” 

The second point is important as KarXT antipsychotic drugs are notorious for negative side effects that often cause patients to discontinue use of the drugs. Karuna reported that discontinuation rates in the study were similar between patients receiving KarXT and those receiving placebo. The company said that there was ""no evidence of somnolence *{drowsiness}*, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain relative to placebo"" -- all of which are common worrisome side effects of current antipsychotic drugs.

The company also said it planned to explore other CNS disorders that could benefit from the treatment, such as psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease as well as the management of pain

Back of the envelope, I would consider the probability of approval has increased from about 20% to 40% and that the lack of side effects should make it possible for the company to take a 40% share in a $10 billion market. 30% margins with forward PE of 14 seems reasonable.

That would yield a valuation of $6.7 billion (40% x 40% x $10 billion x 30% x 14 = $6.72 billion) compared to yesterday’s close at $1.99 billion. That looks attractive even before considering potential applications for psychosis in Alzheimers or pain management.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of small-cap biotech **Myovant Sciences Ltd** doubled after Myovant reported on Tuesday that the the Phase 3 study that evaluated once-daily oral relugolix 120mg in men with advanced prostate cancer met the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as six key secondary endpoints.

Now as far as I can see, relugolix faces some competition in its end market meaning its not going to have the market all to itself. One commentator suggested it would win just 5% of the market. I think that is low, men don't like having their testosterone levels suppressed (given the side effects of hot flashes, fatigue and loss of sexual desire and function) and relugolix can help reduce the time patients need to use the therapy.

Data has shown relugolix quickly lowered testosterone to castration levels and the study also showed testosterone levels recovered faster after patients stopped taking relugolix, which could bring benefit for drug holidays or intermittent therapy.

Consequently I think a 10%+ market share along with 85% probability of success, 3 million people in the US with prostate cancer and cost of treatment $4,400 (based on firmagon estimates) then we have a TAM of $1.1 bn (10% x 85% x 3m x cost of treatment $4,400).

With 30% margins and a PE multiple of 10 you get a target valuation of $3.4 billion compared to current market cap of $1.15 billion. I suspect the 30% margin assumption or the 10% market share assumption maybe too high. But even if that is the case, I dont think Myovant's current mcap is expensive.

Stock closed up 128% with market cap of $1.26 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for an off the scale speculative stock. Please exercise extreme caution. New Jersey-based **Hepion Pharmaceuticals** (market cap $12.4 million) reported on Thursday that its CRV431 treatment prevented the development of liver cirrhosis in a highly aggressive, preclinical model of liver disease in an animal study.

""The results align with previous findings in other experimental models and highlight the tremendous potential of CRV431 as a treatment for liver diseases, including NASH, where progression to cirrhosis is a primary medical concern,"" said Hepion CEO Robert Foster.

I’ll just say caveat emptor and it’ll be a great a story if it works out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insider (Nesco Holdings)**

On Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of Nesco Holdings, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. 

Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).

At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked ""We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”

That is a very positive outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. With the stock trading on 0.6x revenues other investors may also want to have a closer look.

personalfinance,Refinance student loans?,"I currently have two federal student loans that I’m thinking of refinancing to a private loan.  

Current loan details:

LOAN 1: $16,889.26 fixed 5.5% interest.  Actively receiving 1% reduction for on time payments (6.5% without reduction)
Monthly payment is $167.55
This is an unsubsidized consolidated loan if that makes a difference 


LOAN 2: $17,953.21 same rate details as above. 
Monthly payment is $178.36
This is a subsidized consolidated loan. 

Both have an expected payoff date of 11/15/2035. 

I am not in public service or military so would not receive any type of forgiveness.  

I’m currently in a position where I can be aggressive with paying these off, so the question is, should I leave them as is and just throw a ton of money at the current loans, or should I refinance to a slightly lower rate with a 5-7 year term?

The loans I’m looking at and have already been approved for would be 

7 years at 4.81% fixed (includes a 0.25% reduction for automatic payments) $499.74/mo

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Interest Rate Rocketed to 11% Denied by Two Companies to Refinance,"I recently posted to r/StudentLoans, but I have another question for this subreddit. As the previous post, I will try to be concise.

I tried to refinance my Navient loans--all private. I used to be on their rate reduction program. I threw as much money as I could, and got some loans paid off, but I'm still 89K deep. The interest rates are crazy now--between 11% and 13%.

Here are the eight loans broken down: (Edited: seven loans. Sorry, it says eight but one was just paid in full).

**Current Balance:** $18,995.74  **Interest Rate**11.000

**Current Balance** $7,598.34 **Interest Rate** 11.000%

**Current Balance** $14,815.01 **Interest Rate** 11.000%

**Current Balance** $13,971.39 **Interest Rate** 11.000%

C**urrent Balance** $15,899.50 **Interest Rate** 11.000%

**Current Balance** $11,361.23 **Interest Rate** 5.750%

**Current Balance** $6,912.76 **Interest Rate**13.125%

For five of the loans, I have to pay $703.06/month. For the 6.9K, I have to pay $91.63, and for another $71.75.

Their reasons for denying me were the same, more or less as SoFi. But I am not sure how they factor these things in:

* **Affordability concerns (low positive cash flow)** **-** Our review of your accounts indicated that your income is substantially committed to existing expenses. A positive decision is more likely for applicants with income above and beyond monthly expenditures.

So, my last taxes, I made maybe 20K. Now make 55K. It's not a lot. But I did go from 12K (yes, you read that right) in one year to 20K in another year to 55K in one year.

I have also federal loan I will start paying soon. The federal loans are 150K but the interest rate is at 6%.This is a lot of debt, I understand. I have no living expenses, no credit card debt, credit score is 805. I live with my parents. I drive a used car and only pay for maintenance and gas. I do not spend much on a weekly basis, maybe sixty dollars on groceries. I'm most worried about that crazy interest rate.

My other, obvious, solution is to increase earnings. But this means I will probably need to move to DC. My background is in political science. (Feel free to mock me for the degree plus loan debt). DC is expensive. I am not sure how much disposable income I will have compared to now. I live in Florida. Wages are low, but we don't get taxed on a lot of things.  My job pay is very low, but ""secure."" I am worried if I pick up an leave I have the risk of getting laid off and then I get even more screwed. I work close to home. I maybe fill the gas tank twice a month. I rarely go out.

I came from nothing, but managed to put around 11K in savings in a short amount of time. I can pay the 6.9K loan but my emergency fund will go to nothing. Since I drive a used car, I need to make sure I have some money in the bank for the maintenance. I have to fix my teeth. This will probably cost 3K. It's not a cosmetic issue, though it can be, but it's mainly for health reasons. (Jacked teeth are screwing a lot of other things, apparently).

Believe it or not, I actually paid a good chunk of this out, and paid another loan off with a high interest rate. Not sure what to do. This debt used to make me suicidal. Now, I'm really worried, but not nearly as anxious. I just don't know how to tackle the loans since I got denied by two companies to refinance. Thank you for any help.

Edit: Will be, and am, applying to other jobs all over. Need to strategize in the meantime--assuming the next six months.

**Edit 2:** I really appreciate the responses, but I notice there is a lot of focus on the federal, as well as my poor life choices.  I can work with the federal, my question is really what is the best, current plan of attack for the private loans while I look for jobs, because if I am going to move, that's going to cost money. E.g. not sure just pay the 6.9K in full atm, distribute the my money among them, attack another loan instead, etc.",finance

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

personalfinance,"With declining interest rates, where should we be putting our savings money? (US)","I am in a situation which I suspect a fair number of us in this sub are in. I am planning to buy a home in the next 6-18 months, so have some money set aside for the down payment. Because we have no idea when the right home will become available, we can't invest in an index fund nor a long-term CD. So our money is currently held in an Ally savings account, with a current interest rate of  1.7% (even their no-penalty CD is 1.9% at best).

Instead of splitting the money between a bunch of different high yield accounts with a max on how much is interest bearing, or accepting this lower Ally rate, are others putting money they may need at any moment in a different place?

Any recommendations from the sub are appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Question some of my fellow nerds can help me wrap my mind around this morning.,"I’m comparing index fund returns to rental real estate returns. Not trying to get that into the details, but here is my question:

When comparing investment returns, do the rental returns compound in the same way as index funds? 

My initial thought was yes, but then I thought no.


Your indexes compound every single day, while cash flow only compounds when you take that money and invest it into index funds or another rental. Your property equity payoff only compounds when you are eventually able to cash that money out into another rental.

Example with fake numbers:

If I have a rental that rents at $1,000 and has 6.5% mortgage. Cash flows $250 and has principal payoff of $150. Once again fake numbers, but let’s say my cash on cash ROI is 15% and my principal payoff ROI is 12%, for a 27% ROI.

Doesn’t my cash on cash ROI only return 15%(annualized) when the cash is first brought in, and then immediately fall off to wherever I stick that money? Whatever the savings, investment, or future rental returns? So if I have a index fund returning 10% and throw it in there, I’m getting 15% annualized at first and then 10% annualized immediately until I throw it into a different investment? 

Same question on equity payoff, except it locks in the property temporarily which should mean my gain gets locked in at debt interest rate until I pull it out.

Just trying to figure out how much this actually matters and should be accounted for. If it matters, a 10% index fund would beat a 10% total ROI rental (not even to mention the extra work), so I should be looking for deals that perform even higher to account for that. 

Is this important or am I way overthinking it?",finance
personalfinance,Anyone have experience with Earnest?,"I am trying to find somewhere to refinance my student loans, but the process for just getting an estimated rate from Earnest is extremely detailed and seems a bit much.

Then, after adding that information they are saying that the amount I am requesting is more than what appears on my credit report.  It's actually $30,000 less than what's on my report (only looking to refinance private loans and the rest is federal loans).  Now they are asking for my loan statement and my most recent paystub?  I read on many threads that a lot of people had a positive experience with Earnest, but did anyone have to provide this much information just to get a rate estimate with them?

personalfinance,Need Help Consolidating or Refinancing Student/Federal Loans,"Hello All,

I  am looking for advice for ways to refinance or any type of advice for my student and federal loans. My wife and I are new to this. I'll start with our situation. We live in Michigan if this helps.

So, we're looking at around $**67k**  take home a year. The problem starts below. The private loan provider is Sallie Mae, and the company managing my Federal Loans is Navient.

**Sallie Mae Total** is 126k or $1,379.84 a month for 15 years.  
**Navient Total**  is 53k, and in December is asking for $1,144.77.  
(In January) Total housing Expenses + car payments (want to pay it off soon) - $3,426  (housing expenses and debts)+ $1,000 (car payment, we can pay the minimum of $300 instead but would like to pay the car of quickly) =  4,426.

Now the housing expenses cover everything from rent to medical bills to credit card debt. So,  starting December, my student loans kick-off. We only have around $1,400  to give for any student loans. Navient is asking for $1,144.77 and  Sallie Mae is asking for $1,379.84.  We can't afford to pay both loans in our current situation. Because as I mentioned we have only $1,400 to put for the student loan debt.

So, my question is **first**. What can I do? Navient or Sallie Mae? My wife and I only have $1,400 to drop on student loans, and we can not do both. **Second**  question is, how do we consolidate or refinancing this and how do we do that? Do we ask for consolidate or refinancing to whom we ask for that?  We are completely new, Monday I will talk to my university if they can help us at all with this as well. **Third,**  what are the cons of not paying the private loan provider or the federal one? From what I've gathered the federal one's consequences are much worse.

Thank you for your help,",finance
personalfinance,Is a Roth IRA worth it? Do the withdrawals fall under long term cap gains and therefore a majority will be tax free anyway?,"I am currently making about 86k in taxable income and am getting killed by taxes (federal/SS/med).  I max out my Roth IRA each year and plan on starting one for my wife.

Why would I stick with ROTH when the 0% bracket for long term cap gains is $78k? When I retire, that will be plenty (assuming it will rise with inflation). When I am old enough to start withdrawing, I don't plan on being employed.  Therefore, contributions to a traditional IRA now will help me with taxes now, and when I retire, my withdrawals will most likely be under the long term cap tax bracket, so I wont pay tax anyway.

Am I lost on this logic?",finance
personalfinance,Paying on student loans vs building emergency fund.,"Repost from r/studentloans but I was told I should post here as well.

personalfinance,Can I pay estimated tax 1040es to make up for underpayment of withholding?,"So I screwed up my withholding after getting married this year and long story short we’re going to be around $3700 short on federal withholding according to the IRS withholding calculator.  I’m aware of the preferred method to modify my W4 to withhold more until the end of the year.  However, by the time my employer actually makes the change to withhold an extra $700ish from our paychecks we'll only have maybe two pay-periods (we’re paid every two weeks) to make up that deficit and avoid a penalty.  A few years back it took 2 cycles for payroll to change my withholding.

I also realized some capital gains this quarter which isn’t figured into that calculation and intended on making an estimated tax payment before January 15th for it.  Can I tack on an extra $3700 to the estimated payment to avoid an underpayment penalty?  It seems like a straight forward option, but from what I've read on the form it also doesn’t feel like that’s what the 1040es was intended for.

If paying a large one-time estimated tax payment would run afoul of the IRS somehow, and assuming I’m unable to change my withholding in time, how much of an underpayment penalty would I be looking at anyway? $10s? $100s? $1000s?",finance
personalfinance,In laws want to sell us their larger house - good idea?,"tl;dr: My wife's parents are offering to sell their larger house to us to keep it in the family while they retire in another state to see the scenery and get better tax treatment. I'm not sure it's a good idea for us to buy their house, but am looking for advice.

Background information: early 30's and married with 2 little kids under 4 in a smallish one story 1300 sq ft. house in good school district in Portland, Oregon. I make $100,000k a year and my wife does not work. She will go back to work once kids are in grade school. Cost of living is fairly high-ish and we are $300 a month short currently of funding our retirements to the amount they should be funded. We have no other debts. Cars are in good working condition. Our mortgage is $2,000/mo and we owe roughly $260,000 on our house that is worth roughly $410,000. Fairly frugal perspective on finances.

Details:

In-laws house: $550,000, 2600 sq ft. New roof, 10 year old heating, original ac, on a busy-ish road. Their house is a mile for our current house.

Our house is $410,000, 1300 sq ft. We owe $260,000 currently. Mortgage is $2,000 with an interest rate of 3.2%. We bought 3 years ago. We live in the burbs walking distance to schools.

The offer:

\- Sell our house, give $150,000 from the sale to in-laws. 

\-  Get loan on house for $300,000 to keep current mortgage payment similar

\-  Do a balloon loan on the remaining $100,000 to in-laws at current mortgage interest rates  \~3.7% due in full when we sell the house. We can make payments on this loan during this period if we have extra money.

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns:

\- similar monthly mortgage, but higher overall loan. monthly bills are larger due to bigger house and yard. Already not saving enough for retirement.

\- worse schools, less ideal location for raising kids (not as close to parks), little further from work

\- dealing with family - can and usually does get messy

\- housing market is cooling off, it goes down we would be under water faster than in our current house 

\- We are planning to stay here for the foreseeable future, but life happens and that can always change

\- more house to maintain

\- I don't like the idea of having a larger loan and taking longer to pay off the full loan. In my head I know that putting money towards investments typically yield higher returns (7% vs 4%) and makes more sense to invest more than pay off a mortgage faster. On the flips side, I like the idea of hedging the markets by paying off my house faster because it's a guarantee return and once the house is paid off one could rent out or at the very least psychologically be in a better position without having a $2,000/mo bill to be worried about.

My Questions:

Would this financially be a huge benefit for us to to take advantage of or do the risks not outweigh the benefits? What advice do you have and is there anything I need to consider that I haven't yet?

/edit: Thank you all so much. These have all been so helpful for me and I appreciate you all. I’ve talked with my wife and we both agree we won’t be accepting the deal.",finance

business continuity is a big thing, they learned a lot about the last block explorer.

luckily they were able to build a new one first. and thank you Fabian

they realized(learned) they need to have multiple things in case things go down for business continuity

should be coming in the next few weeks (explorer)

so far progress is well, they want to make sure like every time that it's solid.

In terms of the master nodes. (obviously he has quite a different opinion)

You can see what happened with Libra Mastercard and others they ended up withdrawing which hurt libra

He wants to say that enterprises now he wants to respect that they want to be a master node. 

He doesn’t want to force anyone to show themselves. It’s also a risk to security for the company as well.

He will say he respects their decision to make their own announcement/claim themselves.

Until hacken gets more and more secure, otherwise they’re going to keep as is.

In terms of general master nodes, dashboard. They’ll be showing them in the dashboard. 

Whitepaper 2.0 – (voting has been a big contention) They want to grant more voting rights to x node holders and economic node holders. Makes everyone legitimate and qualify/contribute. Timeline: key and critical point was asked and determined already. 80% contents finished. Just need to make polish on the wording. They tried to trim it down. Made it more user friendly, easier to read. Timeline: no later by the end of the year that’s their own deadline. (otherwise somebody going to be dead /s)

2.0 is based on the experiences of the last few years and for the future. Kevin and peter are doing a bang-up job on that. And the CFO – It’s a team effort

Bulletproof – they’re trying to find real use cases for it. Maybe san Marino, more use cases coming. He thinks there are some comments on bulletproof in 2.0

New POA model – they won’t say new, new. They did improve the model. Absolute finality or safety guarantee, better stability, faster transaction confirmation (nice) They received a challenge to increase block confirmations when it gets busier. They got a request from (NDA industry). They’re talking 100s of millions of transactions from one enterprise. They’re talking 1 million transactions per day requirements. They need to get faster confirmations, that’ll be needed most (that’s what’s driving that, HUGE)

When is the new governance model coming into play from the 1.0 – They DO want to change it, and they’re currently working on the voting now. Gas price or vtho generation that’ll be in place by the governance team. They’re looking for a balance between de and centralization. They want to implement more parts as time goes on to make it more decentralized. When they’re having the debates inside the steering committee, they do have debates. Over the last 2 years Vechain has been over a lot of attacks (most stupid attacks are coming from someone making fun of MacDonald partnership. Now they’re saying VeChain is creating fud or is a liar) these attacks happen every day. What do they do for these types of attacks in the future? This means that their governance isn’t mature, and they need to do more work. Lesson learn, take small step every time, also to learn from the existing systems and other management systems.

Vechain voting platform will probably launch in December. They’re doing testing using VeKey for proposals (like master nodes) June/July will be the new election of the steering committee, they’re going to use the vevote platform. Sunny isn’t going to retire this time, he will run for reelection for steering committee. 

Talk more about vtho generation rate and forecasting – it’s hard like right now, especially in the early stages like now. The vtho generation isn’t that level, even though they’re increasing transactions a lot compared to 2018. He talks about how far we’ve came in transactions in such a short time. Whitepaper 2.0 will have improved contents about this forecast, they’ll also announce how they manage/monitor that. End of 2020 he thinks 100s of millions of transactions and they’ll have better insight and will be able to forecast much better. The unit cost of each transaction should be low for enterprises.

About Jason’s video saying VeChain charging nothing right now for transactions – (sunny disputes this) He doesn’t understand. He charges them for actual solutions for sure. Enterprises that use vtho for sure. Even if they are giving away the vtho – it’s not like the foundation giving it away, it’s using a small amount to motivate the users to get started, but not large amount forever, not for that.  He considers it FUD and needs to listen to the context in the barrier to get started. Jason’s point is VeChain mission is to adopt enterprises, they don’t want the cost high to scare them off. Start them off small, and then get them started. He would say like 0.something cents. Enterprise don’t need to pay for that. But on top of that their solutions to onboard enterprises they try to lower the cost as much as possible to ease them onto the blockchain. IN summary, every enterprise pays for vtho consumption directly or indirectly. Even including dnvgl. Walmart, BMW, h&amp;m, everybody. First hundred items or whatever they’ll give away to onboard but remember that’s step 1. Once they launch in production, they will pay for that. In any enterprise if they use it for free, they won’t take it seriously.

Buyback is it still going? Yes, sure why not. Will it be in the next financial report? Yes, every financial report. When next stage? When they feel it right, they’ll announce. They’re going to stay in the timeframe. They cannot put any kind of impact to the price. They have a professional team. The requirement to the team is do NOT impact the price. They’re going to do it slowly, small spreads. They have strong confidence in Vechain and enterprise adoption and valuable transactions.

Side chain – firstly, all the side chain could be in a diff language. One is in swift, other chain in the same setup, not ready for launch yet. So far will say they aren’t really happy, they are satisfied but they want more settings and answer regulations. Might need side changes for china market, or other industries. There is still some small part in technical implementations that will take time. 75-80% of the work has been done. They need to polish. When they have the right use case they’ll deliver. He doesn’t consider any barriers or tech, but more following the progress of use cases. Definitely the side chain will bring value to the main net. FTOC will bring many use cases for the side/cross change. Side chain isn’t separate from main chain. It’ll connect value to main net as well. In fact, they’ll boost the financial implications of the main net. Eventually it all links to the main net.

Do you support other public blockchains? They have a couple discussions, like the xrp AMA. There is a possibility, but they don’t have concrete progress.

Is any enterprise using sidechain? Not yet, every client using public blockchain.

Hybrid mode? Coming from a very interesting conference call from someone w/ IBM. He was asking the question to David Host but he left IBM already. What is the future of blockchain? Network of private, or public. They both agree it should be hybrid. Some sort of merge together based on the requirements. 

US roadmap – penetrating is too strong word or too ambitious. They got started in early 2019. Recently he spends a lot of time in US. They’re exploring in the US and with dnvgl, start ups in L.A.  There’s a lot going on that he’s excited about, but they want to launch step by step. Their plan is based on the opportunities and the use cases like they do all the time. He would not be surprised if Jason came to him with more people to work with. He’s preparing for that time to happen.

China roadmap – Vechain (Xi) advantage, he doesn’t see any other blockchain projects in the lead. Right now, they’re in the leading position. They’re setting up good examples with one build one road and with DNVGL. They’re going bigger and bigger. They’re in a quite good position. Keep doing what they’re doing and keep working on scale out. IN terms of China policy, they might think about a side chain for china specifically to meet their requirements from China. Clearing customs faster with blockchain because it’s known to be trusted (didn’t think of that)

Is it true VeChain is approved by china? He doesn’t really understand. Despite the words difference, Vechain got officially registered with number 666 (good number in China) They’re officially registered. China has been very bullish about blockchain applications since 2016. Vechain has been working directly with the strategy of china. Applications, VeChain is doing them all for years, secondly, they’re focused on one build one road strategy support. They have global applications that can make the use cases and connect them from country to country. They have competitive skills/advantages. That’s their strategy. They didn’t change much, just continued doing what they’re good at.

If you believe in the technology or trust Vechain mindset and adoption, we’re going to change the future. The token represents the rights to use the blockchain resources. More and more applications running on VeChain means more value to the tokens. This kind of success will take time, also going to have hurdles and barriers and difficulties. Despite all the difficulties he can see more coming in the future years. If you’re patient enough, long time believers to blockchain/VeChain, ride along. If you’re going to ask him, he’s not going to have another job, it’ll be his last.

Is planning for 2020 started yet? Yes, based on the San Marino, they’re collaborating, and it’ll be fun. The progress is still going, they’re just on next steps as usual.

He believes if you try as hard as you can and don’t give up, you’ll be rewarded. That’s how he stays encouraged. If no smart contracts are running on the blockchain he’ll consider it failed. He says more than 80% is from enterprise and smart contracts. Quite hard to be a failure right now. He doesn’t see VeChain (almost impossible, he’s that confident) being a failure.

New opportunities/challenge in 2020 – business adoptions. How to motivate everyone with the same goal, different contributions to achieve the same goal. Governance consensus. When different enterprise can work together to be partners even competitors. When honeymoon ends you can’t fight the greedy/fear in people. The bad guys should be punished, good guys should be motivated. They’re already thinking about that. In terms of Vechain he would say it’s more about how to be more professional. You can see Facebook, JPMorgan, Alibaba, those big players are coming to the space. They have unlimited resources compared to startups like VeChain. They have tons of people who can pay higher salaries. How to continue to improve internal management, to grow the team. That’ll be Sunny’s challenge, core team challenge. How to make VeChain more professional. 

Say VeChain hits Tx and price in 5 years. What are your plans for head of company, you going to take rest or keep working? Do you see VeChain as your career peak – his HR team did a very interesting evaluation, as it reads out, he’s an ultimate climber. Some people are quitters, some people are campers. He’s obviously a climber, climber +. Even when he reaches the top, he might think there’s more. If the company runs better and better, he’ll take more time w/ his family wife/daughter, play more soccer. Give more opportunities to the team, to young guys. If some day, he finds someone better than himself he will not hesitate to let him/her run. Sunny can fit any position the organization need him.

He hopes he never reaches 2 million travel miles, he’s not yet to 1 million miles (he hit 1 mil Kilometers)",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Job Insecurity. Should I refinance mortgage now?,"The company I work for has been undergoing a series of layoffs (3 rounds so far) and I'm concerned my job might be next on the chopping block.  I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to refinance my mortgage (30 year) now to get to a lower monthly payment - something that I could afford even if my job goes away and I get something paying significantly less. I don't plan on moving, I'm 48 years old, divorced and this is hopefully ""my forever home"".  Here are the numbers:

Current Mortgage: $155k at 4.25% with 20 years remaining. Monthly payment including escrow: $1433.

Home Value: No official appraisal, but Zillow and comps in the area put it roughly at $290k

Income/Debt: I make $134k/year, have $150k in 401k (half went away in divorce) and only other debt is an unsecured personal loan for $75k (5 year divorce payoff). 

My credit scores: TransUnion 738, Equifax 741 and Experian 744. 

I'm thinking I might be able to refinance to a comparable or slightly lower interest rate, but looking to get the monthly payment as close to $1k as possible. I just personally feel like is something I could afford even if I took a substantial hit to my income. I'd be hard pressed to find something to rent at that price in my area. If nothing happens to my job, I figure I could just aggressively pay down the loan to my original terms.

Protected my car, as I wasn’t going to be able to afford one if I let it go in the bankruptcy. The caveat is I still owe $10k but my payments go unreported to credit bureaus. I can afford the payment and I know where the car has been because I bought it used with less than 15k miles a couple years ago. Min is $360 a month but I throw $700-$900 on it a month because i want to pay it off ASAP.

My only reported debt is my $20k in FEDERAL student loans now. Before my bankruptcy was discharged I applied for a credit card with CapitalOne. Got approved for an unsecured card with limit of $500. Been having fun with it the past 3 months. Paid in full each month.

I figured I should go for a secured card as well considering my now bad/thin credit file. Did some research. Settled on discover it secured and boom denied. Denied for a secured card? Really? After I already have an unsecured card that’s being reported? I mean what other options do I even have for a 2nd card to help build my credit back up quicker that aren’t shit banks like CreditOne??

Betterment has a HYSA that they advertised starting at 2.69%, but is now 1.77% less than 4 months later. They also have a checking account that I was just approved for at Betterment. It will be better than my current account in the sense that it has no ATM fees and can be set up to work automatically with the HYSA, but I still feel like I could be doing more, especially since it is a 0% account. I'm trying not to keep very much money in my checking and shuffle it to savings, so maybe that's not a big deal.

I feel kind of lost right now, and I don't want to mess with always chasing the highest rate possible through moving money around; I'd like to set it and forget it, but I would also like to make a great long-term stable choice.

Its setup to automatically withdraw on the 15th of every month so I've never missed a payment or been late.

My question is...my tax return was withheld earlier this year in an effort to pay the loan off. Can they do that it if I've arranged a payment plan with the organization and have been following through without fail on a monthly basis? Or will they continue to garnish my tax returns until the loan is paid off?

It's not a big deal either way. At least if they garnish it, its going to pay off my loan and will eventually help my credit once it's no longer in a delinquent status but the tax return would also be nice. I'm just genuinely ignorant so I'm asking. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Title Loan to Obtain a Car??,"TL;DR at end.

My SO and I have been together for 2 1/2 years; this is the first serious relationship for both of us (living together, paying bills together, wanting a future together, etc.). Neither of us were raised with even halfway decent financial role models, so... Needless to say... We shat our credit from the get-go, even though we said we wouldn't. So... Yeah.
Well, to make things even more lovely... We haven't had means of transportation since July. I work from home, thankfully, but my SO has 2 jobs that require transportation. And he has very limited family and friends... He's been scraping by somehow for 4 months (missed shifts occasionally due to lack of transportation), but we need a car for things apart from his job as well (such as Dr appointments, classes for me on campus in January, etc), his job is just the biggest reason.
All of this is to say: his aunt offered us a car. She wants $1,100 for it, which is a very fair price considering it's in great condition for a 2002 and has less than 200k miles. But, she wants the $1,100 upfront. Neither one of our families can help with this, and our credit is shot, so my mom suggested having us all complete the title paperwork and then do a title loan on the car, because she took out a title loan on two vehicles of my parents' to cover the cost of a truck. But, from my understanding, a title loan may not cover the full amount and it seems to have insane fees and interest rates.... So... I'm really lost here, but we need a car before January.
So 3 questions Should we do that? Will that work? Is there any better solution?

TL;DR: SO and I haven't had a car since July, SO's aunt offered a car in great condition for $1,100 but wants money upfront. We have horrible credit. My mom suggested title loan w/title of car aunt is offering... Should we do that? Will that work? Is there any better solution?",finance
personalfinance,401k loan to payoff high interest car loan,"I've tried looking through previous posts to try to get help on this issue, but haven't seen anyone with my exact situation, so figured I'd make my own post to see what the best option is. 

In August, I took out a loan for a car at a ridiculous 20% interest rate (yes I understand this was stupid and I have my reasons for why I did it. I don't need a lecture on how bad a decision it was). I currently owe $11,500 on the loan. I am able to take this same amount as a loan from my 401k at 6% interest. The 401k is currently getting an +21% rate of return. 

I can afford the current car payment, so I'm not really in desperation mode. I'm not sure if I'll be able to refinance, but if I were to refi through my credit union, I'd still be looking at something like a 9-10% interest rate. Does it make any sense to do the 401k loan in this situation or do I wait it out and try to refinance in a couple of months?

I want to get a new 19/20 Camry SE. Right now i'm driving a 2005 Camry, with 230,000 miles.  I work in sales, and drive ALOT.  I drove at least 30k miles since January.  I just went through a divorce, and need to give this car to my ex wife when i buy a new car.

I don't want to put any more money into the Camry i'm driving.  It needs a new muffler, and a few other things.

I get paid mileage for work, so I know I can afford my car payments.

The problem is I have shitty credit. The app I use says its 700, and it has been getting better, buy my ex wife screwed it up pretty bad. 

When I went to Toyota, they came back with something like 620. I read online that they use a proprietary formula to get this number. I have never had a car payment before, so this is weighed heavily. They offered me an interest rate of 10%. I walked out the door. I was floored. The 24k car would be 33k after taxes, and all the interest. Fuck that.

I did contact my credit union about a car loan but haven't heard back yet. Hopefully its a few points cheaper.

So, how stupid would it would to purchase a car with a 10% interest rate, if I plan on paying it off early? I get paid bonuses in February and March. I plan on putting 3K down, and can probably pay off another 10K in the next 5 months.

My credit score already took a hit from the couple of applications I had to fill out. Should I waste $1,000 and fix the old Camry, and drive that until my credit is better.

I've read the wiki, I've done the things, and I'll have enough to invest 6k at the beginning of the year into my roth (I've already maxed 2019).

If I spread it out, the money is just going to sit in a checking account or equivalent earning garbage interest that's taxable, right?

personalfinance,"Moving cost: $60,000?","Trying to work out how costly it is to move from one home to another of the same value.

Let's say you buy a home for $200,000 with a 20% down payment at 3.75% interest. Your monthly premium plus interest payment is $741.

10 years down the road, the home is worth $260,000 (2.3% appreciation for 10 years - the average for my area). You want to move, so you sell the house for that price.

After closing costs, seller concessions, staging and prep work, overlap costs, title, escrow, notary, and transfer tax (est. $28,600, per Opendoor), and paying off the rest of the mortgage ($124,980, per any amortization calculator), your proceeds are $106,420.

Let's say you put that down on another house worth $260,000 (same as the house you just sold). After closing costs and prepaids/escrow (tax rate: 3.89%), you put down $88,980 as a down payment for a 20-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.5% (slightly lower interest rate because of the lower term of the loan).

The premium plus interest on that loan would be $992/month, $250 more than you were paying with the previous house (of the same value). This difference actually amounts to 3% inflation over 10 years, so as long as my salary is going up at least that much annually, I could afford it. But it's still $250/month that my mortgage payment would increase, essentially overnight, as the cost to move from one house to another of the same value. That's a $60,000 move.

Am I missing anything? Are the costs associated with selling one house really 11% of the house's value? Are the costs associated with buying a house (including prepaids/escrow) really 6-7% of the house's value?

I feel like when people talk about moving, they don't talk about how it sets them back 20% of their home's value or an extra decade of mortgage payments.",finance

personalfinance,How to compare mortgage loan options?,"I'm currently shopping around for mortgages and I've gotten a few quotes from lenders, but I'm not sure exactly how to calculate which is the best option for my situation. Coming into the process I thought APR was the best measure of the loan, but some loan products I've been offered have options (buying points, no PMI, etc) that are making me scratch my head to see what is worth it for me. This confusion is compounded with the thoughts that I would be more than able to put extra money towards the mortgage on a monthly basis, so for some offerings it would cut the PMI out early and for others it would just shorten the overall length of the loan.

Further, the house I'm buying is not meant to be forever, but the goal is for it to get my future kids through 8th grade.....so will probably stay there anywhere from 10-15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need help judging what is the best loan for my situation and what other factors should I be considering?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the 2 loans I'm looking at (same principle - $572k)

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 1:

3.5% Interest rate

$140 PMI - would go away after about 66 months of regular payments

3.67% APR

Option to buy it down to 3.25% IR, 3.33% APR for $4300

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 2

3.63% IR

$0 PMI

3.66% APR

personalfinance,I’m 22 years old and I’m drowning in debt with no clear path out.,"I’ll preface this by saying that I know I’ve messed up and am stupid and all of that, so please spare me comments like that. 

Alright, so when I turned 18, I took out so many loans and got credit cards and student loan debt. I had 2 cars voluntarily repossessed and a bunch of other stuff. A few months before my 20th birthday, I filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Everything was discharged except for student loans (obviously). 

It was like a fresh start for me and I was super happy. Well, I immediately took out another car loan and got a bunch of credit cards and maxed them out (7 of them), a fingerhut account maxed out, a personal loan, and now a bunch of medical bills because I went the whole year of 2019 without health insurance. Early 2019, I traded in my car that had a loan on it and bought a 2018 Nissan Altima that I will pay well over $30,000 for after the loan is kid for with interest. The money I owe the lawyer from my bankruptcy hasn’t been paid either. I’m 22 now and I’m terrified. 

Literally every item of debt I have is in collections or is nearing collections. The only thing I’m current on is my car because I can’t go without it. I haven’t paid on any debt because I got behind shortly after I bought my car and never got caught back up and I guess I just stopped paying the stuff. 

According to credit karma, my total debt amount is just over $32,000. 

I have monthly bills and utilities as well that vary but I’m not too worried about those. 

In 2018, I made $36,000 before taxes. My average paycheck is $1,200 after taxes. My last few have only been around $950 (commission based job). 

At this point, I know it’s all my fault. I 1000% live above my means. For example, I bought the new iPhone 11 Pro Max, I have a 2018 vehicle, I literally go shopping after I get paid every two weeks. I eat out every day for lunch and any other time I’m around a lot of food options. I smoke cigarettes so that isn’t helping. 

I’m not trying to deflect any fault from myself. I know I did this and the entire purpose for me writing this is because I’m fed up with being poor and I don’t want to get sued for any of this. I don’t know what to do at this point. Do I file chapter 13? Find a debt relief company? The amount of debt I have is close to what I make in a year so I feel stuck.  

I will be honest and say that I have totally and recently have been in the mindset that when I take out more debt that I just work pay for it. Like that’s messed up. I don’t know how to get out of this mindset and cycle. I’ve even had my mom take out debt for me (around $1200). 

I don’t know what to do and I guess I’m just venting and am looking for advice because I feel like I’m never going to get out of this and I’ll always be in this situation.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this and help me if you do. It really means a lot.

EDIT: My mom co-signed with me on my car. My credit score is around 500. I can’t get approved for anything so I don’t know how to get rid of my car. I don’t even know how I got approved for it. 

All the credit cards I got were offers that came in the mail after my bankruptcy. I was approved for them all and just used them to the max. 

I think my spending issue is from the fact that I grew up poor. My parents filed bankruptcy 3 times in my life. I was always with my cousins and their parents growing up and they would always buy whatever they wanted because they had money. I feel like now I have the mentality of “I don’t want to live so poor like I did growing up” but that mentality is keeping me in this situation. 

I’ve heard of Dave Ramsey and used to watch him all the time on YouTube. It’s so daunting that I just stopped. 

I am getting medial insurance as of the first of the year in 2020 and I will be 100% making an appointment with a therapist.

personalfinance,Employer provided HSA; worth keeping? Or should I explore other options?,"**Edit: I understand the relationship between insurance and HSA now.  Thanks everyone for clarifying what a HSA was, and how it's related to insurance.  I've opted to keep my insurance along with the HSA for now and will compare offerings on the marketplace this week before open enrollment closes.  Thanks everyone for your support and patience while I learned about this!**

It's open enrollment time.  I have a family of four (spouse and kids aged below 10).  From what I'm seeing, the cost to me per paycheck to have HSA plan is $212.80, this is on top of my $200/paycheck contribution into the HSA.

Individual deductible is $4k.  Family deductible is $8k.  Out of pocket expense is $4k.  Cigna will cover nothing, with HSA picking up the full tab for all things medical, until I've met the deductible.  At that point, they'll cover 100%.

I did the math; I'd basically be throwing away $5,532.84 for the privilege of having a HSA account in where I'd still contribute $4.8k annually and still pay for everything myself without Cigna picking up the tab (individual deductible, $4k, family, $8k, with 100% being met beyond deductible).  My company does contribute 80% towards cost, with me picking up 20% of the cost.  My employer also matches $1 for $1 for a maximum of $50/mo in contribution to my HSA account.  My company pays 80% ($1,844.30/mo), with me paying $461.07/mo (20%), for the privilege of having a HSA.

I find that completely insane.  So I'm wondering if I'd be better off doing one of the following:

A. Open a HSA account elsewhere, waive medical coverage and have $860 be direct deposited into that HSA account from my employer -- assuming my employer is willing to work with me on that.  That'd let me avoid dealing with the $5,532.84 annual loss in HSA fees.  This would mean after a year, I'd hit the annual max of $7k and be able to deposit the rest into my usual account.

B. Assuming employer refuses to work with me, I could instead then waive medical coverage, and have $860 be deposited into a HSA that I open elsewhere.  I'd still have to claw back the tax when it comes time to file taxes, although social security/medicare taxes would be lost.  I live in Texas, so there's no state income tax.  So it'd be just the federal income tax that I'd be able to claw back at year's end. This would mean after a year, I'd hit the annual max of $7k and be able to deposit the rest into my usual account.

With both options, net difference to me in paycheck would be minimal as this amount is already the same in my current paycheck.  Main difference is I'd be throwing away MUCH less.

I've been on my employer's HSA for nearly a year now.  Looking at my HSA's history, I have paid out nearly $5k in medical expenses, with me being charged by Cigna $18.50 in distribution fees.  It's a safe bet to assume the medical expenses will be the same in 2020.  That being said, I do have $1.5k in my HSA account invested in Vanguard, with the HSA cash balance being $389.95 (when cash balance goes over $700, anything over $700 automatically gets swept into Vanguard).

For those wondering, my employer does offer other plans (also via Cigna):

\-Buy Up Plan, costs me $368.27/paycheck (30%), with my employer picking up the other $1,861.83 (70%).  Individual deductible, $3k, family, $6k. Coinsurance, plan picks up 80%, I'd pay 20%. PCP is $40, Specialist is $60. Preventative is covered 100% by Cigna. ER, $250 copay.  Urgent care, $100 copay.  Drug coverage $20 for generic, $75 for preferred, $100 for non-preferred.

\- Premier Plan, costs me $583.36/paycheck (45%), with my employer picking up the other $1,544.81 (55%).  Individual deductible is $1.5k, family, $4k.  Coinsurance, plan picks up 80%, with me picking up 20%.  PCP, $40, Specialist, $60.  Preventative care, Cigna covers 100%.  ER: $100, Urgent care, $40.  Drug coverage, $20 for generic, $50 for preferred, $75 for non-preferred.

I'm no financial guru.  My best guess is that option A is best (open HSA elsewhere, waive medical coverage but keep dental/vision, have $860/mo be deposited into HSA until max is hit, then deposit rest in savings).  If my employer refuses to work with me, then it's option B for me.  Am I missing anything here?",finance
personalfinance,Financial improvement plan,"Hello,

I am a mid 20s full time worker in my second year of employ. I am currently trying to improve my financial security. I have read a decent number of the guideline/sticky posts, but a bit of it tends to fly over my head. I've taken many financial liberties in the past year, and now I want to move in the right direction. 

My stats: 60k salary in NYC, living at home with parents, no cost of commuting (I cycle to work). No student loan debt. I am currently aiming to complete my time at my job in the next two years.

Current things I am doing

- paying off my credit cards (about 1k left)
- contributing to my 40x retirement account (full roth contributions)

Steps I plan to take

* reduce eating out. I have gotten into the bad habit of eating out with coworkers. I fully intend to reduce this behavior, and am doing it significantly less (&lt;2 a week). Definitely burned a hole in my pocket (guesstimate expense of 4k over the last year and a half)
* selling my hobby assets. I had some small hobbies over the past few years, and when I started working I went a bit overboard on them. Unfortunately there is no liquidating a league of legends account, but fortunately I diversified my portfolio (ha) and a lot of the money is tied in tangible items
* continue to live with my parents

Things i want to do

- open an IRA
- create a solid safety net (hoping to set up around 10k)
- set aside enough funds to go back to school (I expect the admission process to run me $3-5k. I intend to take out student loans, I am hoping to get a low interest rate with my credit score, and have potential cosignees if necessary)

I have started by outlining my budgets. My take home is around 40k a year (I am taking 0 deductions, I used turbotax for my first year of employ but will surely go to a CPA this year to have everything kosher). I am planning to do roth contributions for both my 40x and the IRA when it opens, as I felt convinced it would be the better call for me.

In addition to any feedback on my current plans, is there anything I am missing?",finance

personalfinance,How can I quickly repair my credit score?,"I’ve been working on my credit for over a year. It started out in the high 500s, but I planned to buy a mobile home right about now. In January I went to a credit repair service and have spent about $500 so far repairing my credit. It went up to the mid 600s which would have been about perfect for what I want to do. 

About a month ago, two of my student loan payments fell behind. My mom actually pays my student loans (I know, I’m lucky in that regard) and I don’t blame her at all. Things happen. But it instantly caused my score to drop 100 points, making it lower than it was to begin with. The loans are current now. I took out of my savings I’d been working on for my home and fully paid off my credit card, hoping I could bring the score back up too. It jumped maybe 10 points, and it hasn’t moved since. 

This is about the time I set for myself and my savings, and I would have been looking to make a purchase this month. Now I don’t know if I can without having a higher monthly payment and higher interest rate. 

How long should it take for me to be ‘forgiven’ for that late payment? Is there any way to bring it back up sooner rather than later?",finance

personalfinance,Best way to pay for $4k in surgery expenses,"Dog needs surgery, cost is going to be roughly $4k. I don't have the cash right now and I can't put it on Care Credit because my Vet office doesn't do payment plans. However I do pay for it, I plan on paying it off in two years, if not less. I haven't done a lot of comparison of rates online, but I have an auto loan at a local credit union, so I spoke with them on the phone about what they could offer me. They have a couple different options:

* Secured Personal Loan w/ 2.47% interest rate
* Credit Card w/ 9.90% interest rate
* Personal Loan w/ 11% interest rate

I can't get a secured loan as I don't have $4k in collateral. The credit card seems like the better option between card and personal loan as it has the lower interest rate. When I spoke with them, they mentioned to me that if I were to get a credit card, they would advise that I get a credit limit of $5k - $6k to prevent credit utilization from lowering my score too much. Of the three options the credit card seems like the best deal. My question to you folks is what you might recommend I do to pay for the $4k? I’ll talk to other banks/credit unions to compare rates, but should I be considering non-credit unions credits cards as well? Are there any other options I might be missing? My credit score is usually around 720-770. What would you folks recommend in my position?

personalfinance,Whole life insurance - keep or drop?,"Just joined a whole life insurance policy and am having second thoughts. At this point the cash value is pretty low - but that’s a sunk cost. I’ve done a a short con and pro lists. The cons are: you can take a loan but it’s taxable, you can take out the cash savings - but it’s taxable as well, the interest is low, and premiums are very high in comparison to a term insurance. On the pro side, the only thing I could think of is that it’s a saving device.

So I guess what I’m trying to ask is: how bad have I messed up? Or is there an upside to a whole life insurance I’m not seeing? And if I did mess up - should I get out now?

Could really use some community insights right now...

Update 1: I've talked with the insurance agent, and they raised a point regarding another aspect of this insurance: I can borrow against the cash component while it still accrues some interest (the loan interest rate is usually lower than the dividend rate). On the other hand, just putting the money in an index fund will yield better returns - so I am still losing money all and all.

Last year I filed my taxes for the first time using turbotax, which advertises itself as free but somehow I ended up paying 60 bucks out of pocket and didn't get any sort of tax refund. For reference, that year I spent 11 months volunteering full time for a federal agency (received free housing and a small stipend for food in return, so enough to survive basically) then spent one month working a min wage job in SF. This year was pretty similar but I worked part time for 7 months and volunteered for 2. If it matters/if you couldn't tell, I'm single, not a homeowner, both last year and this year worked in two states (CA and AZ) otherwise pretty much just your average young adult with a useless degree.

personalfinance,Need advice on how to spend inheritance. Should we lob it at the car?,"I unexpectedly received $15,000 in inheritance and thought I would just seek your wisdom about how to spend it.

**Stats:**

* Just my husband (38m) and I (34f), no kids.

* We each make about $45k/y pretax, at stable government jobs with pensions. Combined monthly income is ~$4k. 

* We each contribute about $200 per month to a 401k, there’s minimal employer match that we easily meet. We each have about $35k saved so far

* No CC debt. Credit score &gt;750

* $6k in an emergency fund, (2-3 months of expenses. Yes I know this is a little low, but as I mentioned, our jobs are fairly stable)

* Own home, worth about $235k, owe $148k, 20 years left on mortgage, payments are $1,350.

* We bought a new car (Honda HRV ex) last year that we share/carpool. We owe $15k, payments are $400. Killer interest rate at 1.9%. Selling the car is not on the table. We like the car.

* And I have about 11k in student debt, most of which won’t start being owed back until 2021. Interest rates are 3.5%-4.5%

**Imminent needs (next year or two):**

* Roof repair and possibly a new roof

* A procedure to save my husband’s eyes from a progressive condition called keratoconus (~$8,500. Insurance *might* cover some or all of it. We are waiting for pre-approval.)

Generally, our expenses and income are such that we are pretty comfortable, but doesn’t give us a lot of room to save or pay down debt aggressively. We’ve been using YNAB for the past several months and we’ve been doing well with it. 

**Proposal:** Although it is by far our lowest interest debt, I’m leaning toward lobbing all 15k to pay off the car. This will increase our cash flow by $400 immediately and allow us to tackle my student loans and mortgage a bit more aggressively, save more in “sinking funds” and increase our monthly contribution to retirement. It would certainly relieve the crunch we feel on our budget. 

But is this a foolish move? If we need a new roof or end up needing to pay for my husband’s eye procedure we would need to get financing and I doubt we’re going to find a better deal than 1.9% interest. But we could probably get longer terms with lower payments. 

tldr: Should we lob inheritance $$ to pay off a low interest car loan completely and increase our current cash flow significantly? Or is there a better use for the funds?",finance

I am putting as much of my meager wages toward asset growth as I possibly can, but it isn't much. I come from a lower middle class, blue collar family. We were very poor. I've worked a job and have paid into social security since I was 14 years old. I am smack in the middle between Generation X and the Millennials. I am writing this to get something off my chest, because I don't think my Xennial POV is talked enough about in investing, and yet its crucial to understand in order to understand where the economy is headed and point out the blindspots in current economic policy.

The reason I give all of this background is because I feel that a majority of the people dealing with Wallstreet and investing do not understand how precarious the current economic situation is. I believe this is because the inequality gap between the upper and middle/lower classes has widened substantially in the last 10 years, and in addition to that, the generational wealth gap is substantial. I want to give my perspective from a lower to middle class person, that has watched economic cycles for the last 30 years with great interest and no ability to capitalize on my insights.

My assertion is that the middle and lower classes never fully recovered from the last financial meltdown and this is changing economic behavior at a macro level. Here are why I think these things are true and why this very important financial fact is overlooked.

1.  The lower middle class has had a very hard time staying out of debt during the last 10 year bull market. Boomers have horded assets over the last 10 years and sold to make great profits, while wages for Gen X and younger have stagnated for the last 10 years, while concurrently, debt has accumulated in younger generations in an effort to keep up with the boomers and their inflating asset values. Take for example, the young couple that bought a house in 2006, went bankrupt and lost the house in 2009, and then who were able to repurchase an inflated asset again in 2016. This has happened across the board. Risk takers are once again being rewarded for irresponsible risk at the household level.

2.  The current climate in the job market is one of defensive gratitude to be fully employed and to have medical benefits that don't have high monthly premiums. The current attitude for the younger generation employed full time in jobs is LOW RISK and stability minded employees that will take less pay for guaranteed stability and affordable benefits. Jobs are also highly specialized and skilled, taking years to master. Changing jobs usually requires a large investment of time and effort to learn. This is why despite low unemployment, there isn't a lot of job hopping happening. Younger generations need stability to make their monthly payments. They aren't going to risk changing jobs in an overly optimistic job market when it feels, sounds, and looks the same as the market did in 2007 and they still feel poor and vulnerable to economic change.

3.  Over the last 10 years, the lower to middle class has been targeted heavily by high risk, interest rate dependent, debt loads such as mortgages, car loans, and personal loans. Loans are everywhere. Cheap and easy money is everywhere, regardless of credit history. This makes the lower and middle classes look better off than they are, just like it did back in 2007-08.

4.  As boomers asset values and the stock market asset prices have risen dramatically, asset ownership of younger people has become unattainable because its out of reach financially. HOWEVER, that hasn't stopped banks from continuing to offer cheap loans to those that can barely afford them. A person that makes under 70 grand a year can get a mortgage worth 300,000. Its not hard to do the math, and figure out that if that person has one financial issue, they will not be able to make that mortgage payment consistently every month. The same can be said for credit card debt, car loans, and personal loans.

5.  Unless you have a perfect credit record, and you are disciplined or lucky to have a thrift mindset, you have felt that you need to take on this debt, and you don't have a choice because you can't make ends meet any other way. As rents have risen, and car financing has gotten cheaper then buying used (per monthly payment when you need to buy a car on time), you took the risk and put on the debt knowing that the only way to keep your transportation needs and housing needs met is to continue to hold debt. This debt stretches the lower to middle class very thin, but it has been necessary to keep food on the table and houses over their heads. Add on top of that, there is record setting student loan debt. As long as we are burdened with this debt, we cannot and will not think about asset ownership. As a result, asset ownership is shifting to the upper classes and has been for awhile.

6.  Many Millennials aren't fully participating in the labor force. They have lived in the lowest starting wage environment for young adults in modern history when adjusted for inflation. They are opting out of raising kids, owning homes, or purchasing large ticket items because they don't believe in the stability of their wages far into the future. Tack on top of their meager wages and no asset ownership the increase in medical costs, and lack of wage increases. Millennials are prudent. Millennials are thrifty, and yet they get sucked into the same traps as Xers when they try to keep up with the financial status quo set by their Boomer parents. They chase the American dream and buy more than they can afford, but less enthusiastically than their parents. They save money. They believe in ethical responsibility. They don't believe in corporate goodness or monopolies but reluctantly have to use them to provide food and shelter for themselves. The lower to middle class Xers were anti corporations and Millenials are anti consumer overall. The majority reject the status quo and don't expect to ever retire or have many assets. This is a devastating point of view for the future economic reality! This mindset is very common on the west coast in large cities where housing is explosively expensive and out of reach of ownership for a majority of lower and middle class Millennials.


What does this do to the economy in the future as the boomers retire?

Lower and middle class consumers, under heavy debt load taken on while trying to keep up with the asset rich boomers and asset rich banks, are feeling the crunch every time economic policy shifts, even slightly. This fact in combination with the anti consumer, anti debt mindset of younger generations, combines in a combustible fuel that can ignite with any small changes in the economy. The inflated asset prices are out of reach for the younger generations, and they know it! They simply refuse to participate in that economy, period, and those that do will be under a debt load very difficult to bear. Unless wages rise quickly, this economic reality will get worse over time!

Future economic shocks can be caused from simple small changes, such as the Fed raising interest rates, a small number of people laid off who aren't able to make their monthly payments, people and companies that are over leveraged and have no emergency fund in the bank, or, a fully leveraged person or company over leveraging to the point where they can't make their monthly payments anymore because future income didn't stay consistent with forecasts. 

Why does debt and credit cycle matter to ALL of the economy in the future despite what prevailing economists think?

This isn't a problem exclusively limited to corporate and upper class debt, which is why I think this gets overlooked by economists consistently. CREDIT MATTERS. This is a problem among all sectors of the economy, and within all generations. What happens to a bank when more than one person is no longer able to make their debt payments because they took out a cash-out refinance of their home at the peak of the market in 2018, or took a personal loan from a bank to pay off accumulated credit card debt, or a car payment they can pay as long as they are employed but have no backup plan if they lose a job? Banks will not have enough money to pay their debts. You will find symptoms in places such as the repo market. Same can be said for coorporate debt and needing to pay their bills during an economic contraction. Its ugly all around for the economy overall.

Conclusion.

Just like the pre-crisis times of 2007-2008, there is a massive amount of optimism in Wallstreet about the debt burden and our ability to pay it off in government, consumer, and corporate debt, and yet there is a complete lack of understanding that the majority of households are completely tapped out, and one layoff in a household could cause a ripple effect that would cause them to default on a majority of their debts from multiple institutions. Unlike 2008-2009, we don't have the same prosperity and cushion to absorb an economic shock because the Fed never raised interest rates high enough to get their target 4%. 

The activity in the repo market for banks is a mystery to people that don't understand what is happening at the micro level in individual households. It was a mystery to people in the banking industry in 2008-2009 when nobody was looking at the obvious housing market pump that occurred when banks and individuals were willing to take on debt loads they had no hope of paying off, and a lot of the lenders did it knowing full well it was unethical, if not illegal. The predatory nature of those loans was never discussed in full by a majority share of banks, and I assert that the same predatory greed mechanisms that led to the housing crisis will lead to the same result in all debt in our current economy once a level headed mindset returns and the Fed stops printing money to boost the bond market. 

This bond market is awash in debt up to their eyeballs and continues to pile on more risk and leverage in a fury of gleeful greed. As a Xennial, its disgusting to watch all of this happen again. It disgusts me because I've never lived in an economy where I've been awarded for responsible financial policy in my own life. Since I've become an adult, I've never been able to make money off of my money. As soon as interest rates rise, and responsible and ethical savers start to make money off of their work ethic, it gets trampled on by the market of frothy greed.

This gleeful greed pattern over the last 20 years has severely inflated values of assets in housing prices and in stocks twice. Once in 2008 and once in 2019 and I'm frustrated that my generation will once again be asked to endure another financial collapse at the cost of everything we've gained in the last 10 years. For those that have never made it out of debt, and took on a boomeresque unaffordable debt burden, they are going to be screwed during the next downturn and bubble burst.

Please convince me this is wrong. Please convince me that as a Xennial, I have a bright financial future to look forward to if I refuse to take on debt and I won't over leverage or bet my future to purchase assets I can't afford and that are inflated beyond what I can comprehend as logical.

I admit that when I write this, I feel a bit of anger. I have a 401k, and what little I've saved between 2009 and now, I want to keep. There is NO WHERE for me to put my money to protect it from the greed of others during the next downturn. I have no 401k funds that will keep my money safe in a cash equivalent fund. All of the available funds include shitty debt such as non investment grade bonds. I'm worried that if this asset and debt bubble bursts, I'll be back to square one yet again, and have nothing to retire on when I hit 65.",finance

personalfinance,"Finish paying off student loans ASAP, or switch to making minimum payments?","Hey everyone!

  
So, for some background: I started my working life in 2016 with \~80k in student loan debt that I accrued between my bachelor's and master's degrees. Since then, I've taken on roles in software engineering, got into a company at the right time to catch a nice growth in the stock, and as of about five minutes ago, I just made a large payment that got my debt down to 17k!

  
I'm thrilled with my progress. I managed to save a rainy day fund (the actual amount is \~27k, but around 7k of that is just tax money that I'm letting grow in my HYSA before filing.) My 401k is at \~47k, and I have a small Roth IRA that's at \~8k. I have no car, no house, I rent a cheap rent-controlled room with roommates, and I pay my credit cards in full at the end of every month (I just use credit cards for the points.)

  
If all goes well, I'll be able to pay off my student loans in the next 3-6 months. This means that I'll be able to pursue a dream of mine: living and working abroad. Right now, my company is open to the idea of transferring me to our Berlin office, which would come with a pay cut - but with the lack of debt, this is something I'd be comfortable doing.  
I paid off my student loans by getting rid of any private loans first (which tended to be high-interest anyway.) Once those were all gone, I focused on my federal loans and paid off the highest interest loans first. To accelerate this, I switched to one of the graduated repayment plans (i.e., my monthly payment is the absolute minimum, something like $250 a month.) I set my minimum payment to autopay, and then went in each month and bumped up the total repayment to $800-1000. Now, I'm looking at the remaining loans, and except for one that's at 5.59%, all of them are in the 2.5-3.5% interest range. Additionally, looking at my credit score, my student loans are the oldest form of credit history I have. I started school in 2010, but didn't get a credit card until 2013/2014.

  
So, I'm wondering: should I just finish slaying the beast, and pay off my student loans ASAP as I planned? Or, would it be wiser to switch to the regular payment plan, and take some time to pay them off, and start figuring out other investment strategies (which is particularly important to me since, as of this year, I started maxing out my 401k.) Aside from the big move, I don't have any major financial plans.  


Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,How can we set ourselves up for financial success in our early 20’s,"My fiancé and I are currently trying to merge our financial live before taking the big plunge. We are starting to figure out how we should handle our finances and set ourselves up for financial success. 
Here are our basics:
Both 21. 
Her: Employed making ~3800/mo net 
Him: Employed making~2350/mo net
We are both recent college grads, and somehow managed to get jobs in our fields within a few months of graduation.
Both put 15% towards 401k
 
Debt:
CC ~ 8000/ or 240/mo (we had a major incident and couldn’t help but put it to a card)
Student loans~28000 or 300/mo (subsidize federal ~4%)
Both have credit scores around 750

Savings: 0 in savings(yeah I know bad on us, but we didn’t have the money as college students to save)

Monthly expenses:
Rent and housing(utilities incl): 1630
Car payment: 300
Insurance: 140
Debt Min payments: 550
Gas:140
Cellphones:80
Groceries: 300
Total expenses: 3050 a month.
Net after expenses: ~3000

Our plan of attack:
1)Save up 10-12k as an emergency fund
2)Tackle credit card debt. And roll the amount we would be paying towards the next debt.
3) Pay off $7000 car payment to free up the 300 to put towards student loans
4) put every cent toward paying back student loans.
We want to be debt free in 2.5-3 years.

Now here are where the questions start.
Is this the best way to go about paying off our debt?
Should we pull back on 401k to pay off higher debt faster since returns on 401k are lower than the interest of credit cards and car loan?
Any other concerns you see or budgeting issues you can note?
What order should we pay off the debt?

First time home-buyer here with my fiancé. We're based in SoCal and looking to buy in the OC area.

We found a house that we love and signed the papers a week ago. I spoke to a friend of mine that said that I can still jump ship on the loan until we actually move in or a bit before ( House won't be ready until April )

The incentives to pick this preferred lender which is wells fargo is 20,000$ that I have split between the design center down payment and the actual closing costs.

We have 20% down and have asked for 850,000$ the bank has quoted us this:

30 year fixed

3.875% interest rate

3.919% apr

0.00% discount points

Comes out to 3950$ / Month 

Our annual pay before tax is 400,000$ between the two of us and we both have 720+ credit scores

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that I had when speaking to the bank was that I only have two trade-lines ( One credit card and one car payment ) And I've been told in most cases I need 3 so I just opened up another card as per recommendation from the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep getting told to use the preferred lender and while I do understand the extra 20,000 in hand for when we pay the down payments does come in handy, but I want to be sure that we're not getting a real bad loan offer if we have enough time now to potentially change it.",finance
personalfinance,A friendly warning about no/low interest financing and accrued interest.,"While I'm sure most people on this sub know about accrued interest, a story from a friend (who's usually quite financially savvy) made me realize it might not be common sense and is worth posting. 

My friend, after purchasing his first house, bought around $14,500 worth of furniture, appliances, etc. from two big box retailers. He had applied and been approved for a 0% interest, 24 month consumer loan for the full amount with no minimum payments. 

He knew the interest rate on the credit was high (32%), but as he's pretty financially secure with a good job he had no worries about paying it off on time. He apparently was willing and could have paid for everything at the time of purchase comfortably, but figured that a no-interest loan for 24 months is too good to pass up, and he'd be better off investing the money over that time period.

He never forgot about it, and with about 2 weeks left he paid off almost the full balance. He transferred $13,000 from his and his wife's easy to access accounts (chequing). He didn't have the full amount in the two chequing accounts and thought it would be a hassle to move around his investments to pay it off, so he figured he'd just bite the bullet and pay the 32% interest for a bit until his next paycheck came at the end of the month. 

He didn't realize what accrued interest is, and that the terms of conditions of the consumer loan stated that if the full amount was not paid by the end of the promotional period, accrued interest is paid on the owed amount from the BEGINNING of the loan. After the promotional period ended, the $1.5k he had left on the account turned into 12k, as two years of compounded 32% interest from the 14.5k was added. Yes, a fairly simple mistake ended up costing him over 10k. 

He has taken up the issue with both the financing company, as well as the two retailers (who he claims advertised it as the interest starting after the promotional period), but realistically it is looking like he will be on the hook for the whole amount, as the terms were pretty clearly laid out - he just never took the time to read and understand them. 

He told this story to about six of us, and most of the people listening were shocked and had no idea that financing loans can work that way. Hopefully this post can stop others from making what is a simple mistake. 

Tl;dr: For many consumer loans you are paying interest for the ENTIRE time unless you meet all the terms and conditions.  While 0% financing can be smart, ensure you don't miss any payments and pay off the whole amount or it can be disastrous.",finance

The one thing that is sticking out is really the bearish look of gold.  TLT (the treasury bond etf) is making a countertrend rally within a bearish trend.  I think it's going to fall right about now.  If that thing falls big, it's game over for gold.  For anyone who would like to see what I am referring to.  Pull up a chart of the 2016 for TLT.  It's doing the same thing with a mountain top.  Although I see the risk on rally continuing due to the fund flows from bonds into stocks.  I think the potential for a bond drop is greater.  I wouldn't be surprised if a trade deal gets done (at least the phase 1 part) along with Powell acting hawkish at the next Fed meeting.  Don't buy bitcoin if you haven't already.  The established downtrend it is in needs to have some consolidation before it can make a move up again.  That takes time.

In terms of global stocks, I think Chinese stocks and oil/oil stocks are the biggest potentials for upside moves.  Both have had heavy negative sentiment but have flattened out in terms of technical action.  Be ready for upside moves in both these asset classes.

Now, I've been around these circles long enough to know that people are going to respond with, ""No one knows the future and so we should disregard anyone who's predicting a recession.""  Say what you want, but these two are obviously **very, very** knowledgeable when it comes to the inner workings of our economy and the stock market.  I think it's completely reasonable to heed their warnings.

Furthermore, I'm curious what everyone here thinks about the long term viability of our economy and even the United States as a country.  The general consensus here seems to be that the market may go up and it may go down, but long term it will always grow.  Many of us base our decisions on the historical performance of the past and that we can reasonably expect the market to grow about 7% long term. If someone doubts this, you will ask, ""what is different about this time?""

The answer is that there is a whole lot of different scenarios taking place in our country today.  We have more debt on a national level and people as individuals are more in debt than it seems has ever been the case before.  We have stagnating wages, people who are either unable or unwilling to save for the future, meanwhile there are [$122 in unfunded government liabilities.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/01/10/unfunded_govt_liabilities_--_our_ticking_time_bomb.html)

Not only do these legitimate problems severely threaten our stability, but we are plagued with all sorts of changes that were not a thing of the past.  We have more obesity, drug addiction, and homelessness than ever before and these problems don't seem to be getting better.  There's a lot more here threatening our social stability that I'm just not going to get into because it's too inflammatory for this board.  Which is kind of sad when you think about it, since as investors we should be able to put our emotions aside and look at things rationally. 

Normally, I would try to be optimistic and say that we can overcome any challenge if we want to.  But, the leadership in Washington seems incapable of coming to any sort of compromise which we desperately need to get things done.  Tensions between liberals and conservatives are higher than they have ever been in my lifetime.  It seems like the direction we are currently taking is in no way one that leads to peace.

Personally, I'm starting to question whether investing is even worth it at this point.  The stock market is at all time high with a bull market that never seems to end, but the reality on the ground does not in any way paint a prosperous, growing society.  I feel like I must be an idiot to keep pouring my money into my 401k when so much is at risk, but not really sure what else I should be doing.

List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming
This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.

Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97-98%[1]) are convinced by the evidence that humans are significantly contributing to global warming.[1][2]
This is a list of scientists who have made statements that conflict with the scientific consensus on global warming as summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and endorsed by other scientific bodies. Very few are climate scientists. Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97-98%[1]) support the consensus on anthropogenic climate change,[3][4] hence this list represents a minority viewpoint.
The scientific consensus is that the global average surface temperature has risen over the last century. Scientific opinion on climate change was summarized in the 2001 Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main conclusions on global warming at that time were as follows:
	1	The global average surface temperature has risen 0.6 ± 0.2 °C since the late 19th century, and 0.17 °C per decade in the years 1971-2001.[5]
	2	""There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities"", in particular emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.[6]
	3	If greenhouse gas emissions continue the warming will also continue, with temperatures projected to increase by 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C between 1990 and 2100.[A] Accompanying this temperature increase will be increases in some types of extreme weather and a projected sea level rise.[7] The balance of impacts of global warming become significantly negative at larger values of warming.[8]
These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized nations;[9] the consensus has strengthened over time[10] and is now virtually unanimous.[11] The level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science.[12]
There have been several efforts to compile lists of dissenting scientists, including a 2008 US senate minority report,[13] the Oregon Petition,[14] and a 2007 list by the Heartland Institute,[15] all three of which have been criticized on a number of grounds.[16][17][18]
For the purpose of this list, a ""scientist"" is defined as an individual who has published at least one peer-reviewed research article in the broad field of natural sciences, although not necessarily in a field relevant to climatology. Since the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, each has made a clear statement in his or her own words (as opposed to the name being found on a petition, etc.) disagreeing with one or more of the report's three main conclusions, and each has been described in reliable sources as a climate skeptic, denier, or in disagreement with any of the three main conclusions. Their views on climate change are usually described in more detail in their biographical articles. Few of the statements in the references for this list are part of the peer-reviewed scientific literature; most are from other sources such as interviews, opinion pieces, online essays and presentations.
NB: Only individuals who have their own Wikipedia article may be included in the list.


Scientists questioning the accuracy of IPCC climate projections
These scientists have said that it is not possible to project global climate accurately enough to justify the ranges projected for temperature and sea-level rise over the next century. They may not conclude specifically that the current IPCC projections are either too high or too low, but that the projections are likely to be inaccurate due to inadequacies of current global climate modeling.

Scientists arguing that global warming is primarily caused by natural processes

Graph showing the ability with which a global climate model is able to reconstruct the historical temperature record, and the degree to which those temperature changes can be decomposed into various forcing factors. It shows the effects of five forcing factors: greenhouse gases, man-made sulfate emissions, solar variability, ozone changes, and volcanic emissions.[72]
These scientists have said that the observed warming is more likely to be attributable to natural causes than to human activities. Their views on climate change are usually described in more detail in their biographical articles.

personalfinance,Joining Online-Only Banking after 20 yrs at BOA,"Hey team,

I'm new to this subreddit and have done some reading about HYSA and am astonished that my 20 yr Platinum status Preferred Advantage Savings account at Bank of America at a boosted interest rate of 0.04% is not competitive (/s)... so I'm looking to make a change. In all reality, it has been very frustrating learning about HYSA and realizing that I have been missing out on several thousands of free dollars by staying with BOA for so long.

I was recommended Simple as an alternative, and after some reading on this subreddit, saw that Ally has consistently received really good feedback as well. I'm planning on keeping a minimum balance in my BOA checking just to keep my account open (I have a few CCs there as well and I'd want to be able to take advantage of BOA's ATMs), but would otherwise be moving about 20k in checking and 35k in savings to a new online bank. I have separate investment accounts elsewhere so this would only be for high liquidity/emergency funds, so the goal here would be to offset inflation as much as possible.

Currently, Simple would net me an extra $50/yr at current rates (2.15% savings, 0.01% checking = ~$753/yr) compared to Ally (1.68% savings, 0.6% checking = ~$708/yr), which isn't a lot but it'll add up over time. To be fair, I don't know how frequently you guys change banks in search of higher rates or what thresholds would encourage you to change, so I'm looking at this choice like a decision for the next 10 yrs (ideally). I also know that Ally's rates fluctuates with the fed rates, so I'm not sure what market pressures are allowing Simple to be so high above market rates right now, which has me concerned whether Simple can keep it up for the next X years.

Simple, however, is more geared towards creating and planning a budget, which I do on my own. If I'm not going to be using one of Simple's core features, it makes me wary of choosing them over a company like Ally whose sole focus is banking, not budgeting. I may be putting way too much weight on this though.

Hoping for some of your input to help break the stalemate in my head. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Do I talk to an estate planner or do I also need a financial planner?,"Getting old is apparently complicated. My girlfriend and I have a laundry list of questions that we've been meaning to get answers to but keep putting off. A classic predicament of lawyers &amp; financial advice being expensive vs spending money now to save grief later.

**disclaimer**: *I am not looking for answers to these questions, only advice on what type of professional I should look to in order to get answers.*

With that said, this is our giant list of questions which hopefully adds context &amp; I appreciate the time spent reading:

* What do I do w/ a modest lump sum of cash? Mainly, what type of account should I be putting it in? Not the kind of lump sum one can quit their job over...but also not pocket change.
* Is it possible to offset the capital gains tax I'm inevitably going to have to pay on previously mentioned cash or is that a futile endeavor?
* My girlfriend and I have been together nearly a decade. We plan to stay together, but aren't married.
   * Marriage vs Domestic Partnership vs ""same old."" Especially in relation to one partner with high student debt, a fairly severe income disparity, and zero intention of ever having children.
   * Health Proxies, power of attorney, etc depending on the previous answer.
   * We're LGBT and I don't super trust the government given the whole ""having equal rights"" thing is still new &amp; the supreme court is looking mighty conservative these days. How can I make sure we're protected even if the federal gov't lets us down? Our state is very liberal and I trust them to keep us relatively protected, but it makes me worried over the long term. I say this not because I want sympathy but to make it clear that I ultimately want iron-clad legal agreements. I understand that this will require a lawyer at some point.
* I own a condo, my girlfriend is not on the deed. I bought it through an affordable state lottery system &amp; it is deed-restricted. How can I make sure she doesn't wind up destitute if I die?
* Now that I make enough money to have extra savings beyond my 401k &amp; an emergency fund, where should I even be putting that? 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst case scenario is that we need to talk to an estate planner, a financial planner, and a real estate lawyer. Between an estate lawyer and a financial planner: do we need both? If we need both, which does it make sense to talk to first?",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"Got an offer for a full time job, need advice on planning","I got offered a full time job @ $75k per year in Seattle starting January 2020. I understand it's not much for the area but it's a place that I've been wanting to work at for a long time and I'm on the high end of how much they're willing to pay for someone of my experience level. 

That being said, I need some advice with budget planning because not only will rent eat up a chunk of my money, I will need to send money to my parents and save for retirement.

Here are a few pieces of info I have:

* I'm 29, I have $20k total between my checking and savings with $4900 stored in a traditional IRA.
* I would prefer to avoid having a random roommate unless I know them in person. There's no one there I know in person in Seattle.
* The company is offering to pay for up to 30 days of temporary housing while I find a suitable place to stay. Alternatively, they will offer a single lump sum payment of $1500 for housing assistance.
* The company is offering 3% matching for the 401k plan but I still need to perform some deeper research once I start.
* I will be getting relocation assistance (definitely going to use that).
* I Intend to take the bus and send my car back to my parents in South Florida since they will need it more than me.
* Pay is biweekly and salaried.

Assuming the current federal income tax rate, my estimated take home pay would be ~$59,463.

Now comes the difficult part: my parents are nearing retirement, they have very little money and savings, and I need to help them financially.

If I max out my 401k and Roth IRA contributions, that's $18,500 and $5,500 that I won't be using for a long time, so should I consider doing so? 

If so, what's left is effectively ~$35,000 and because Seattle rent is so high, more than half of that will be purely for rent! That's not accounting for food, utilities (I know it's metered there), and emergency expenses!

I need advice on what to do because just thinking about this is making it really infuriating!",finance

personalfinance,Should I use savings to purchase a car outright?,"My wife and I have two cars that we own and don't make any payments on. I drive a Mazda 3 to and from work (around 80 miles round trip) and she takes the 2007 Ridgeline because it has more space for our son in a car seat. Unfortunately, the Ridgeline is having multiple issues cropping up. The A/C is having issues and now there are electrical issues. She's been left stranded either at our house or while running errands around 5-6 times in the last 4 months. We've also taken it into a Honda dealer multiple times and each time they ""fix"" the issue, but the electrical problems persist. So we've been looking into purchasing a new (to us) vehicle. I'm having trouble with the decision because of sticker shock on some of the different family cars we've looked at (vans and SUVs), but on the other hand I want something we can rely on.

The other issue is that we've been trying our hardest to save up money to purchase a larger house. The house we have is ok, but my wife is due to have our second child in April and the house we are in doesn't really have enough space for everything we need. We were hoping to look into buying a new house next year once things have started to settle down with the new baby.

So, my question is: should I use what money we have in savings to purchase a reliable car for my family or should I take a small loan so I don't have to fork over so much cash? I'm certain we would also have a down payment on the new vehicle, but I'm very concerned about losing a major portion of the cash we've set aside for a new house.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who's responded with advice! I'm very thankful to have others weigh in on my problem. I wanted to give a bit more info to help clear up the situation. We have about $46k in savings. $15k of that is set aside as an emergency fund. I was hoping to use as much of the difference along with the equity in our current house when we sell to put down as much money as we can towards a new house (this would be around 25-30% down on houses we have been looking at). My goal is to make the monthly mortgage payments approx the same as we are paying now, even though the house will be bigger. We are looking at a couple different areas that have a cheaper housing market with good schools to help make that a reality. I also was planning to make the car payments around $200/month, which would be manageable. My wife has been looking at some used vans/SUVs listed around $14k-$18k. I had an idea to take a car loan of $8k-10k and paying the difference in cash/the trade in value of the Ridgeline. I have good credit, should I should qualify for a fairly low interest rate.

Edit 1: Another update. We heard back about the truck and it died again overnight at the shop. So the fix they thought they had yesterday wasn't the issue. I am leaning towards getting a van for \~$15k, putting down $3-5k and taking a loan for $10k. I will also use any bonus money or tax refunds to help accelerate paying off that debt.

cybersecurity,Malware Analysis With Lack of Safe Environment,"Hey All,

Currently ran across a bit of an issue at my current place of employment dealing with analysis of malicious links, attachments, etc. Our IT Sec department is a bit behind the times, understaffed, and not receiving much funding. I'm rather new to the team/field but currently we have no streamlined or safe way to do this analysis. Just yesterday I was told to pull an attachment from an email, throw it in a folder then upload to Hybrid Analysis or VT and pray our AV doesn't start freaking out. If that was the case then get our prod machine wiped/rebuilt (obviously this isn't best practice).

What are some of your recommendations to re mediate this dilemma? We have plenty of old laptops lying around and have access to numerous Citrix environments and was just wondering how some of you handle this type of activity on a daily basis.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs retirement,"Hi everyone

I’m an mba grad working a one-year contract with possibility of extension. I just got to 6-7 months of expenses saved up in my emergency fund (originally thought I’d need a full year to be conservative, but I want to save for my retirement since I only have $20k in it). My emergency fund has $21k in it, mainly through me being very frugal. I currently make $43 an hour ($89k yearly more or less). 

I borrowed $56k in federal loans to pay for school/cost of living (loans are at about 6.5% interest rate on average). Should I prioritize paying these off vs saving for retirement? (I don’t get 401k matching at work so I’d only be doing my Roth IRA which means I can pull money from my contributions penalty free if needed). My goal is to pay the loans off in 10 years but ideally much less time; long term a goal is to buy a condo but that’s another story.

personalfinance,Seller-paid Mortgage Points,"I am in the process of looking at mortgages from different banks for buying a home. I came across some articles about buying points on the mortgage, and those led to articles about having the seller pay for points. 

I am considering the possibility of having the purchase price closer to the asking price, and having the seller pay for points up to the value I would otherwise have offered at. For example:

Scenario A - asking price of $700,000. I offer $670,000. Offer is accepted. No points paid on mortgage. $536,000 mortgage with 20% down. 

Scenario B - asking price of $700,000. I offer $685,000 with the seller paying for 2.5 points on the mortgage ($13,700 in points paid). $548,000 mortgage with 20% down. 

Based on the articles I read, a point typically reduces the interest rate by .25% (1 point reduces a 3.75% interest rate to 3.5%).

Under really any scenario, unless the decrease you get from a point is actually much lower (most of my trial examples showed that ~0.075% decrease per point was the threshold) it is better for the buyer to do scenario B for purposes of monthly payment and interest paid on the house. 

Not only that, but my understanding is that the effect for the seller is neutral since their capital gain is decreased by the payments for points, and buyer’s basis in the house is at the higher purchase price. 

This seems like a win for everyone, so I feel like I must be missing something that explains why this method is not standard practice. What am I missing here?",finance

**Global Equities**

* We see a China-led stabilization of ex-US growth and the pause in US monetary policy tightening as key to prolonging the business cycle, just as they were in early 2016. In particular we view the probability of a recession in the coming year as low given the strength of labor markets and consumption across the developed world. We believe that the global economic growth is stabilizing around its trend rate.
* After inconsistent Fed rhetoric prompted fears of a US monetary policy mistake in late 2018, a clearer and unequivocally more accommodative Fed narrative has emerged. In our view, the Fed is now likely to let the US economy 'run hot' in order to rebase inflation expectations. With scant evidence of significant momentum in US core inflation, the Fed has considerable breathing room.
*  The ability of China to cushion its slowdown continues to be key to the global economy and markets. The Chinese authorities have a broad range of policy tools at their disposal and have shown willingness to use the full breadth in achieving a difficult balancing act between de-risking a highly leveraged and capital inefficient Chinese economy and softening the slowdown prompted by those deleveraging initiatives.
* In our view, risk assets discounted material concerns about factors including the potential impact of a protracted US/China trade war at the start of the year. The speed and scale of the rally in the face of disappointing macro data globally and downgrades to forward corporate earnings expectations suggest strongly that expectations for good news on US/China trade talks have now been largely priced in. We remain constructive on global equities, but the speed and scale of the rally in 2019 has tempered to a degree the conviction of that positive view. The likelihood of further material upside for risk assets in the short term is, in our view, now dependent on the ability of ex-US demand growth to accelerate from current weak levels to support earnings. In particular, the effectiveness of the broad array of measures progressed by the Chinese authorities to cushion their growth slowdown remains critical.
* We retain a negative view overall on developed world duration over the medium term. With global growth showing signs of stabilization, we think it is too soon for the market to be pricing material easing from the Fed, although the risks around this view have increased with apparent Fed determination to boost inflation and inflation expectations. Across the Atlantic, we are unconvinced that the ECB will be unable to tighten this cycle. In our view, yield curves are likely to steepen as global growth rebounds along with inflation expectations. While wage growth has yet to materially impact core inflation measures, developed world labor markets continue to tighten. We see nominal yields moving gradually higher as output gaps close, wage growth accelerates and the global economy stabilizes. However, upside to nominal yields is likely limited by structural factors including fast ageing populations in the developed world and technology-driven price pressures.

**US Equities**

* During the first few months of the year, US equities benefited from a resilient domestic economy and a lower exposure to global growth factors compared to other major indices. While we do expect US stocks to remain supported by easy to beat consensus earnings expectations and solid US consumer demand, the recent pickup in Chinese exports and manufacturing activity should support ex-US stocks to a larger degree as they exhibit higher cyclicality and trade reliance. US equities trade at a premium relative to other markets leaving less room for further rerating.

**Global (Ex-US) Equities**

*  In Europe, growth has decelerated considerably, due to external and domestic factors. Externally, China's slowdown and trade uncertainty negatively affected European exports. Domestically, political upheaval in Italy and France along with disruptive auto emissions regulations weighed on the economy. However, we expect those headwinds to fade over the coming months. European stocks remain supported by solid domestic demand dynamics, attractive valuations and by a likely stabilization of global economic 
conditions towards the second half of 2019.
* We remain constructive on Japanese equities despite the recent headwinds from weak Chinese imports. Diminished political uncertainties and ongoing structural reforms are supportive of higher price multiples while a solid underlying domestic economy suggests the outlook for profits is stronger than markets are discounting.

**Emerging Markets (EM) Equities including China**

* Emerging market equities have this year underperformed developed market equities driven by a continued deterioration in earnings but the surge in Chinese social financing bodes well for EM growth over coming months.
* We remain broadly positive on China in the expectation of further measures to cushion the domestic growth slowdown. Any broadening of the current trade stand-off with the US is likely to hamper Chinese growth, but a gradual economic slowdown is already priced in and the Chinese authorities have already shown themselves willing to provide monetary, fiscal and regulatory support to help smooth the ongoing economic transition. Chinese equities still trade at a PE discount to other markets and further market liberalization could prompt a rerating as international capital starts to flow into Chinese assets following the inclusion of onshore Chinese equities in MSCI's widely followed EM equity indices.

**Currency**

* As signs of stimulus from China begin to take hold, we expect ex-US growth to stabilize. Over time, we anticipate capital will flow from the US into earlier-cycle economies and that the USD will weaken, especially as the USD remains somewhat expensive on a real trade-weighted basis. Elsewhere, we continue to see strong valuation support for the JPY and see short AUD as an effective hedge against ongoing China weakness in an economy where domestic household leverage is likely to constrain growth.

**US Bonds**

* After the recent downward repricing of US rate expectations, 10yr nominal US Treasury yields appear reasonably value given our outlook. Nonetheless, US nominal yields look attractive relative to most other developed government bond markets on an unhedged basis. In the absence of a material pickup in inflation or term premium, yields are likely to remain range bound. Our overall assessment is neutral.

**Global (Ex-US) Bonds**

* In aggregate, we see global sovereign bonds outside of the US as unattractive. The ECB has committed to low rates for some time, limiting attractiveness of core Euro area bonds. We find Italian BTPs attractive on diminishing political risks. Swiss bonds continue to look very overvalued and in our view they have an increasingly asymmetric risk profile. The Swiss economy is relatively strong and we see Swiss bonds as vulnerable to attempts to normalize monetary policy by a Swiss National Bank increasingly concerned by the strength of the housing market.
* Elsewhere we are more positive on Australian duration on a relative basis. We see the Reserve Bank of Australia taking a cautious approach to policy given elevated household leverage and slow inflation.

**Investment Grade (IG) Corporate Debt**

* Although we do not believe that a sharp demand slowdown is imminent, we believe IG spreads troughed for the cycle in early 2018. Moreover, we are concerned about increased supply, reduced demand, and potentially large number of ""fallen angels"" when the economic growth takes slows down significantly and downgrades begin.

**US High Yield Bonds**

* Current default rates in high yield are very low by historical standards. Given the still relatively positive economic backdrop, we do not expect a material pick-up in US defaults in the near term. However, after the significant recent rally, spreads have now tightened to a point where we see the balance of risks skewed towards more widening.

**Emerging Markets Debt**

* Spreads on EM debt relative to US Treasuries widened substantially in 2018 in the face of higher geopolitical risks, a strengthening USD and higher USD funding rates. However, EM local currency bond yields have rallied both in absolute terms and relative to the US yields since September while EM hard currency bonds yields began a rally in late November. This reflects investor expectations for a less hawkish Fed, less aggressive US trade policy, and/or more China stimulus.",finance

AND, according to the bank, there's still the issue of the \~$9 interest that would be added to that payout everyday. Notably, that payout actually hasn't changed in the last four days though.

What I'd like to know from you bunch'a wizards is: Am I likely to get slammed for some $20000 unpaid balance when we hit the maturity date and (if I understand that term properly) I'm expected to have the full balance paid, or is the payout value just high for no good reason and when maturity comes I'll be fine?

EDIT: I've made a couple mistakes here, and I'd apreciate help understanding what it all means, but when I was looking for my interest rate (7.73), I also found out that the loan officer that told me my maturity must have been mistaken..

I'm a 20 year old college student who just got a handful of EE savings bonds that have been gifted to me throughout my childhood and I'm trying to figure out if I should cash them in or ride the interest wave. 

The breakdown is like this (according to TreasuryDirect.gov): 

* 6 Bonds from 1999 - Interest rate is 2.3%
* 1 bond from 2000 - Interest rate is 2.3%
* 1 bond from 2007 - Interest rate is 3.6%
* 1 bond from 2009 - Interest rate is 0.3%

My strategy so far:

Hold the 2007 and 2009 as they will have ensured double in value (double from their purchase value) in 2027 and 2029 regardless of the interest rate. From there I would sell the 2009 and hold the 2007 (I like the 3.6% ensured rate).

Her bank doesn't issue temporary debit cards for ATM use and she doesn't get paid until Thursday... Thanksgiving, so the branch will be closed and she can't withdraw cash through a teller.

We considered maybe she could transfer money to my account (Hughes Federal Credit Union), but Chase doesn't process wire transfers on holidays, so it wouldn't go through on the day. 

She can't use PayPal (no debit card number), or Zelle (my bank doesn't use it), and we're sorta stumped on our options. Is there something we can do, an app to use, maybe, where she could transfer money from her account to mine on the day she gets paid and have it go through the same day?",finance
investing,Dividend stocks are superior to bonds in terms of fixed income,"In today’s turbulent economic situation, many investors have fled to the supposed safety of fixed-income financial instruments (bonds) for the promise of a steady return and relative safety from fluctuation in price (value at risk). 

This may appeal to some people but I have a differing thought. 

You see, bonds are not paying a lot of money. A measly 1.8% on 30 year treasuries? As the basketball players would say, “swerve”.  I do not even stop to pick up 1.8% off the ground! Conversely, many reputable dividend stocks are paying 2, 3, even four percentage points!

So, why would you not just invest in dividend stocks instead?

Now, some* might say, “you trifling buffoon! Stocks are riskier because the price of the stock may go down!”

To which, I say two things:

1. What if...... you never sold it? 
2. Heh...you don’t think prices of bonds don’t change?

Bonds are basically as volatile as equities when you think about interest rates. You do not think that precious safe bond might turn around and just fucking stab you in the fucking back?! And you are locked into a fucking crime of a low interest rate and then the bond value JUST FUCKING PLUMMETS TO THE GROUND LEAVING YOU BROKEN AND MANGLED AND WEEPING? Consider the federal reserve.

personalfinance,Index fund investing is inherently very risky,"“What should I invest in?”. This question has been repeated a million times in r/personalfinance. And the answer is invariably the same: buy index fund ETFs that follow the US economy. No matter what happens in the world, what price you’re paying, what the underlying assets are. No matter if interest rates are high or low. No matter where we are in the business cycle. No matter if companies are earning money or not, weather consumers actually want to buy. 

90 years of continuous expansion, 7% average returns. An impressive track record.

However, ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"" should be taken into account. The US economy growing forever is a big assumption. There are various factors at play here. Even 50 years ago it wasn’t clear if the US would have that kind of performance. It depended on unknowns like the impact of the cold war, the effects of economic reforms, etc. All things which can go one way or the other depending on so many factors.

Bottom line is: investing in index funds does not take away risk, even in the very long term. There is no “buy SPY every month and that’s it” kind of answer. No one knows what will happen. Being diversified is great. But what if prices are too high right now? What if earnings decrease and stagnate for 10 years? Are you ready for that kind of risk? Buying and index fund does not imply that you don’t need to research the underlying asset. It should be considered the same as every other investment. It may be less risky because of diversification. But it doesn’t mean it’s inherently a good investment at any time or place.",finance

personalfinance,"Currently stacked at $14k credit card debt, $6.2k personal loan, $27k in federal student loans, and $7k in private student loans. WHAT DO I DO?!","Long story short, I am a fresh graduate from college back in May and had to use my credit card to cover moving out of state for a new job and racked up a lot of debt because of having to furnish my apartment, getting myself a car, and basically restarting my entire life in a completely new area without anyone's help. I also had to pull out a personal loan of $10k last year due to lack of finances and family losing business that I knew I couldn't ask my parents for help. I have a remaining balance of **$6.2k in personal loans left** to pay back, **$7k in private student loans**, **$27k in student loans,** and **$14k in credit card debt** (I got myself the Chase Sapphire Reserve to benefit off their $50,000 bonus points rewards by purchasing new things for my apartment). I know that these loans are immensely high, but I had no choice since I didn't want to rely on my parents and even having a part-time job at the time couldn't cut it since I went to an expensive school and lived in an expensive city. I also have other expenses that goes towards my paycheck and will leave a link below for you guys to see a breakdown of my costs:[https://imgur.com/a/K6FwmCM](https://imgur.com/a/K6FwmCM)

My current salary is $66500 and I know it's not enough to cover the debt I made in a quick manner. I want to really clean this act up ASAP and find a way to bounce back to becoming positive in balances without risking myself in even more debt. My parents never really taught me how to save and budget well and this is my first time in my life where I'm actually independent for once, so I would love some life tips as to how I can clear these loans quickly. Thank you so much.

I also forgot to mention that I’m putting money into my 401k as well. It’s about 15%, so my spreadsheet most won’t reflect the take home balance once it registers into the system.

personalfinance,How big of a difference should a variable loan have before I consider taking it over a fixed?,"I'm refinancing my student loans, 34k 8.35% at the moment. I looked at SoFi initially and got quoted at 5.03% 10 year for both fixed and variable, but Earnest just quoted me at

-4.09% 7 year variable

I'm paying around $1.8k/month with my minimum payments at $400ish right now, so I'm looking to pay it off in a year and a half.

I really don't know what to expect out of interest rates in that time, rates have been super low but I worry about them getting jacked up. What are the chances they increase above 4.56% quickly enough for it to be not worth it?

personalfinance,"Making an honest push for financial literacy. I want to improve my credit, pay off my debts, and start making my money work for me. Advice needed.","After an uninsured trip to the ER this month left me with an almost $8,000 bill, I have made a personal goal for myself to become financially literate and start digging myself out of a hole. I feel as if I made some mistakes, but I don't fully realize the gravity of them in a sense. I have been following the advice on the side-panel on creating a budget for myself and putting myself in a position to take care of my debts - but I need some advice on how to prioritize the payments I have to make. I apologize this post will be numbers dense as I just want to lay all my cards on the table - I will cut back a lot of the emotional content but obviously, I feel so many emotions from my situation ranging from hopelessness to anger. I realize these  emotions are just not useful in making any advancement so I've been putting them aside and trying to stay focused.

First off, I'm 28 years old and I live in Colorado Springs, CO. I work salaried in IT for a managed service provider making roughly $2,500 a month, it's a small business where I don't have any benefits/health insurance. I've worked here for almost a year, I have no degree or any IT certifications - I got this job due to my support experience. It can be a very stressful job at times, but I feel like this is my first ""legit"" job that's not technical support call center work and I'm grateful for that. 

I live with my girlfriend (26) and we split the cost of rent ($995 total, so I pay $495.50). We have a great relationship and we both don't spend money too frivolously - we could be much better about eating out though. Both of us don't really want kids and just want to try to get a handle on being adults first. 

I have student debt from loans I took out when I was 18 years old. I defaulted on them and got it taken to collections years ago but I payed off the money I needed and got them back to a provider (Navient.) The total balance is $17,088.62 (according to the site). I have 3 loans left as of today. I had 5 earlier in the month but using the advice from this sub, I spent roughly $1,000 this month to pay off all the subsidized/federal loans. This is what I'm left with:

\- Loan 1 is at $4,716.66; min payment of $57.76 p/mo.; 6.8% interest

\- Loan 2 is at $6,321.07 with a min payment of $77.40 p/mo.; 6.8% interest

\- Loan 3 is at $5,387.97 with a min payment of $65.98 p/mo.; 6.8% interest

I own my car completely. It's a used Honda Civic from 2001 that doesn't give me too many issues. Recently I replaced the battery in it and changed the tires back in July (I bought used). 

I have medical financial issues. This new bill (\~$8,000) being one of them and a previous uninsured visit that resulted years back in May of 2016 that involved stitches (\~$2,000). I haven't payed a dime on any of it and frankly I don't even know where to begin. I tried applying for Medicare when my accident this month happened and I found out I just don't qualify. I'm aware I can haggle the price and get on a payment plan for this, and this so far sounds like the most realistic option - I'm planning to get on the phone on these issues in December once I can see my whole financial picture a little better. 

I ran a credit check last week using CreditKarma and currently my Transunion is at 461 and my Equifax is at 461. I don't own a credit card and usually pay everything with debit cards. All my credit hits are from Navient/student loans. 

I got about $2,700.00 in my bank account.

I think that's pretty much the whole picture, hopefully this is enough information to get some perspective or direction here - if not please let me know. I realize a lot of my situation here is caused by my own ignorance on finances, I'm really hoping I'm not too late to turn the my life around for the better. I would love to get to a point in my life where I can consider having a house or  maybe going back to school for a CompSci degree, etc. but I realize I just have to play my hand right now. I live a really quiet/ minimalistic life mostly practicing guitar and music, hanging out with my girl, playing video games, and going to work. I don't care for buying most consumer goods, or partying it up, etc. im just fairly boring and aimless tbh lol. Anyway, I'm rambling.

personalfinance,Getting mortgage with no prior credits,"Hello financial gurus.

I'm getting close to the point in my life when it's time to buy a house, and would appreciate your advice on that.

Besides credit cards, neither me nor my wife have taken any loans. We bought our cars with cash, we pay credit cards in full and on time. We are average earners, but living frugal so don't really need to borrow any money for anything but mortgage.

Doing that, we managed to grow our credit scores pretty high (780-800), according to our Discover and Wells Fargo accounts.

So I wonder if it's really feasible to get a mortgage as a first actual credit, or the interest rate would be too high?  
Would it make financial sense to take a car loan first, even though we don't need a new car?  
Would it help if I start utilizing those ""0% introductory APR"" offers just to get some actual loan history for free?

We are also self-employed, so I've heard it makes getting a mortgage harder.",finance

Ive heard of people using a 0 interest rate card to pay off an existing debt to manage this, but im unsure if thats legal or would be a good way to go.

personalfinance,Is the secret to paying off credit card debt using it more?,"Ok hear me out, I'm not saying this is accurate. I am bringing this up for conversation to see if my thinking makes sense. I'm also not asking for behavioral finance suggestions, simply if the MATH makes sense or not.

This is a totally hypothetical and grossly over-simplified scenario:

I make $1,000/month but have $5,000 in credit card debt. I make a minimum payment of $100 every month but my 15% interest rate results in $60 of that accruing in interest each month. My remaining $900 goes to essentials and I don't have room to pay more than $100/month to the card.

Most would continue paying the $100 (essentially $40 towards the balance) and slowly whittle that down.

We know transactions don't accrue interest during the statement period and up until the payment due date. We also know payments applied go towards the oldest part of the balance. Essentially I could go 30-60 days (depending if the charge is at the beginning or end of my statement period) without accruing interest. 

Am I better off charging my $900 of expenses on my card and making a payment of $1,000 each month? Basically, within 5 months I could have a revolving balance with significantly less subject to interest each month.

I don't think this is a long term fix and at some point, expenses must go down or income must go up. But is this a viable temporary way for consumers in debt to stop accruing so much interest and put more of their credit card payments to work sooner?

We have little kids too, so I think we'd expect this house to be our house for the next 5-7 years or so before we decide to upgrade.

Income - $250,000 - wife stays home
List price of house - 800k
Student loans - 2600 a month
Life insurance/disability - around 500 a month
No other cc or monthly obligations
Credit - 750+
Downpayment - pretty much nothing lol

I am also a big fan of saving for retirement so ideally putting about 9k into our 401k (we match 50%) and doing a backdoor Roth for myself and wife so another 11k a year for that (20k total)

We would probably go with getting a physician loan - for those unfamiliar, no downpayment required, no need to pay pmi. Trade off is a little higher interest rate - around 4- 4.25.

So now I have decided I don't want the Lexus as it has been in 2 accidents(not my fault) and of course the Juke has just been in storage.. And I would like to save up for my dream car, which to most is a stupid idea but i've wanted this car since I was a teen. 1994 Nissan R32. 
I have been doing research on the best possible outcome for getting rid of all loans in the best possible way, which includes reading all posts when it comes to getting out of car leases/loans. 
2011 Juke 110,500 miles - Monthly payment $240, PayOff $9127.17. KBB 7K
2015 Lexus 52K miles - Monthly payment $439, PayOff $25K. KBB 19K
My plan is to sell the Lexus to either Carvana/Carmax/Dealership(I have about 8K in savings), then use the Juke for temporary while trying to pay off more monthly to be able to sell it. ( Once it sells I still have the car that kept breaking down on me to drive)",finance
personalfinance,should i ramp up my tax exemptions for month of december?,"I currently have 2 for federal, and 1 for state.

personalfinance,Cash in EE Savings Bonds?,"I've read the Wiki &amp; searched through other posts, but I'm still uncertain because the interest on many of my EE bonds are pretty low. I'm wondering if it's worth it's worth it to cash out the low interest bonds because they're being beat by inflation, or if that interest rate is variable that it may increase during the coming months/years. Obviously not looking to cash out the ones that didn't meet face value yet.

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"In a time in which I needed to, I took out two personal loans from two different financial institutions for a total of $28,000. The details for each loan is:

Loan A: $13,000 initial amount, 6.99% interest rate, $258.13 monthly payment, loan maturity date: 6/13/2023; current payoff amount: $9,820.53

Loan B: $15,000 initial amount, 11.49% interest rate, $391.26 monthly payment, loan maturity date: 6/15/2022; current payoff amount: $10,438.93

I'm in a better spot now after paying down some debt, and I got an offer from one of my credit card companies for a personal loan of up to $25,000 with a 36 month payback period with an interest rate of 5.98%. Using their quick calculator online, they determined my monthly payment for a 36 month payback period would be $608 for a $20,000 loan. (I can cover the \~$250 I'd need to payoff Loans A &amp; B in full.)

I did some calculations myself, and it looks like I would only save about $558 total over the life of the loan if I were to take their offer and payback Loans A &amp; B. Here are the calculations I applied to come back with this amount:

Remaining payments on Loan A (43)\*monthly payment amount (258.13) = $11,099.59

Remaining payments on Loan B (29)\*monthly payment amount (391.26) = $11,346. 54, total = $22,446

If I took out the new loan of $20,000: monthly payments (36) \* monthly payment amount (608) = $21,888

$22,446-$21,888 = $558

Can someone check if my math is correct? It seems like I would save more than that especially considering Loan B has an interest rate that is almost double this new offer. If my math is correct, is it worth refinancing?

Would appreciate the feedback. Thanks",finance
personalfinance,New vs. Used vs. Leasing... HELP.,"Figured posting here might help me wrap my head around things.

I have driven a used 2002 Honda Civic with 120k miles on it for the past 4 years. Before that, I drove a '99 Buick Century. My Civic just recently died in the sense that repairs now cost more than my KBB value, putting me in the market for a new car. Having only purchased my past two vehicles at 15+ years old and for under $4,000, I need some advice.

I am 27 years old. I take the bus to and from work every day, and use my car for getting places on evening and weekends, as well as to my hometown that is 250 miles away multiple times a year. Generally speaking, I put 10k miles or under on my car each year. I live in a very snowy region, so I would like a small SUV with good safety features. I have test driven, and have narrowed it down to the Rav4 and CRV.

I plan to keep this car for a good while. I really love the 2019 Rav4 redesign (not really a fan of the older model), but know buying new cars is not the smartest choice for the most part, especially for a person who doesn't drive a whole lot, though I expect to drive more for work in the coming years. Also, I am seeing a lot of year-end deals to get the 2019 models off the lot. They are quoted between $24,000 - $26,000, and I plan to finance over 5 years.

With the CRV, I am looking at a 2017 or 2018 used models (lease trade ins) that have about 10k-20k miles on them, and those are close to $20,000 - $24,000. 

Also curious as to when leasing is a good idea. I don't drive a ton at this point, but I have always held onto cars for as long as possible. I know nothing about leasing. 

I have always heard to never buy new, but I have also been told that interest rates can be lower on new cars. Having never done this before, I am curious as to what others have experienced or if you have any advice for my predicament, tips for negotiating costs, and what to look for throughout this process.",finance

Cal, me (F, 34), husband (40) and kid (2), currently trying for a 2nd baby. My husband is doing a medical fellowship and has 2.5 years to go. I'm a stay at home mom, but do some side hustles and make \~$200+/monthly. No CC debt, one car that is paid off. 

My husband has $220k in student loans, we make min payment on that as we are hoping to do PSLF (I know that a lot of applications have been denied, still hoping). I have $33,500 in student loans and have been using the snowball method to pay it off (focusing on smaller amounts, but highest interest). All student loans are federal and we are on a PSLF eligible repayment plan. Have life ins policies for both of us. Contribute 7% to retirement thru husband's work (mandatory per job), no match :(

Whatever's left goes to savings

I know that having $36k sitting in a savings account is not maximizing our money. We will have to move within the next year and a half and will most likely have to buy a second car, which I'd like to buy outright ($22k). Because my husband is under contract, we really don't need 6 mos of expenses, but I like to have at least a couple thousand in the savings for unexpected expenses (like a $500 dental bill coming up). 

What is best to do with the money? Throw more at my student loans? Invest? I want to continue to max our Roth IRAs the next 2 years so that's $24k. He gets an extra $6k ever year for work so that takes care of half of it, leaving us $12k to cover. He'll also be able to moonlight (make extra $ on the side) tho I'm not counting much on that aspect as he didn't really moonlight during residency and he'll need to study for boards. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,HSA: Take the employer's or shop around?,"I will be enrolling in a High Deductible health insurance for 2020. Now I'm wondering if there is a drastic benefit in choosing my employer's HSA versus shopping around and selecting an HSA from an outside source.

A few things I've read is that you do not get the benefit of FICA taxes withholding if you shop elsewhere. If the HSA contributions will come directly out of your paycheck you aren't susceptible to the Medicare and Social Security tax on that money. If you use another source, this will be a factor. My employer will not be contributing anything to my HSA. 

My employer has failed to include the terms and conditions for the HSA provider and I will be following up with them as soon as possible to see if they can provide color on this. In particular I'm looking for figures on minimum balance required and possible funds and fees I would expect, including interest rates.

personalfinance,What's the best strategy for us to pay off our debt?,"We're $195,018.46USD in debt. How do we pay this off?

*How* it happened is largely irrelevant. Most of it is student loan debt (first generation college student) that originally qualified for debt forgiveness because of several years of public service and no longer does. The rest of it was poor financial literacy and medical payments.

We recently got married and combined finances--one of us had far more debt than the other (this isn't an [r/relationships](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships) thread; we both knew each others' financial situation and accepted it for what it is before entering the marriage). That means that we have a few savings accounts that might not make sense *now*, but they did when our finances were separate.

**Critical facts:**

* We're both in our early thirties. We both want kids and are unwilling to have them unless our debt is under control.
* If we make just minimum payments on all of our debts using the avalanche method, it'll take 12 years to get out of debt.
* Right now, we cannot make minimum payments. With our existing income, debt, and monthly expenses, we're short -$223.22‬ every month.
* Since getting married and combining our finances, our credit scores are both around 650.

# We are witnessing a growing Global Storm visibly sweeping the face of our Mother Earth. This Global Storm will prove, unless we awaken, to be unprecedented in its violence, unpredictable in its course, and sometimes catastrophic in its immediate effects. It appears that no place on Mother Earth is protected from the cleansing, healing and unifying,  power of this Global Storm. 

# This is due to a widespread “paralysis of will and action” to make the essential decisions and behavioral changes needed to move forward positively and constructively. The gridlock that supports this “paralysis” is the reluctance to entertain the possibility of subordinating national and personal self-interests to the needed requirements of concerted global actions. It is also reinforced by a deep-seated conviction in the inevitable adversarial nature of humankind. We seem unwilling to articulate a desire and need for a world in which we can live in peace, harmony, and prosperity for all members of our human family.

# The primary question to be resolved is: how can we, in our entrenched systems, patterns of conflict, and the resignation of will, make the change needed?  How can we transform our world so that harmony and cooperation will prevail, leading to the healing of our human family, Mother Earth, and the establishment of a peaceful global civilization?   

# A Turning Point

# A vision of a young Hunkpapa Lakota woman, from the Community of  Wakpala,  Standing Rock Reservation, resulted in prayerful and peaceful actions to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). This action inspired a global movement to Protect the Sacred.

# The unprecedented, unified actions at Standing Rock, and around Mother Earth to Protect and Restore the Sacred, highlight the growing global involvement of young people. These growing numbers of young people are referred to in the prophecies as the 7th Generation. They now represent more than 50% of the world’s population. 

# This emerging leadership of young people,  in every dimension of human and community transformation, long prophesied by Indigenous elders,  signals the global rise of Indigenous leadership. Indigenous leadership in facing the growing threat of runaway climate change, loss of biodiversity, ecosystemic collapse, and unfolding a new Global Civilization.

# We have now entered the long-promised Spiritual Springtime and the rapid emergence of the 7th Generation. This mobilization of young people, from everywhere on Mother Earth,  is addressing climate change and biodiversity loss with unprecedented, unified action. One such example is [Our Children’s Trust](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/) who has filed a landmark U.S. federal climate lawsuit. 

# Across the Americas and around Mother Earth, the 7th Generation is resonating with a call for a political, social and spiritual transformation to address an ineffective and unacceptable political and economic system, everywhere all at once. No matter the challenges, we will eventually awaken to the spiritual and biological reality that we are all One Human Family, intimately related to all Life. 

# A New Global Civilization

# The vision of a new global civilization is a promise found in spiritual and prophetic sources from Indigenous prophecies, such as Black Elk Speaks, the major Prophets, the Call to the Nations, the Universal House of Justice, and many elders, spiritual teachers, and faith traditions everywhere on Mother Earth. This new global civilization, which Indigenous peoples and other related prophecies speak of, is not to be confused–even remotely–with the various new world orders fearfully alluded to by various contending sources. It is not a new world order where the extremely wealthy or a secret elite enslave most of humanity for their own selfish and greedy purposes, where everyone is forced to look, act and think the same, or where anyone nation-state dominates all others.  

# Our success in building this new way of life leading to an equitable, balanced global civilization, now unfolding, is based on our full commitment to the unfettered and independent investigation of the truth for ourselves. The obligation of each human being to acquire knowledge and understanding through their ""own eyes and not through the eyes of others"" requires our very careful, in-depth reflection, consideration, and investigation of the sources from which we receive our “news.” Once people know for themselves, they will change the way they feel, speak, and act. This knowledge is rooted in gaining an ever-deepening spiritual understanding and purpose in our lives and requires changing how we live together as a Human Family. 

# This new global civilization, foretold by our Indigenous prophecies, including the Eighth Council Fire, the Return of the White Buffalo, The Peacemaker, Quetzalcoatl, Sweet Medicine, Black Elk, the Hopi, Vira Cocha and many others, is founded on the unshakable consciousness of the Oneness of the Human Family and all Life. From this consciousness naturally unfolds the realization of:

# The Equality of Men and Women  

# The Balancing of the Extremes of Wealth and Poverty

# The Elimination of All Prejudices

# The Unity of Science and Spirituality

# Universal Education

# The Independent Investigation of Truth, and

# Unity in Diversity.  

# The practice of these unifying principles will bring about a new global civilization where the voices, the wisdom, and vision of Indigenous peoples are justly and respectfully represented and whose ancient wisdom is listened to and acted upon.

# All the human sciences confirm there is only One Human Race, though infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life. This is why the full recognition of this fundamental truth requires the abandonment of all prejudice–prejudice of every kind– race, class, sexual orientation, color, creed, nationality, gender, the degree of material wealth, everything which enables people to consider themselves superior or inferior to others. Abandoning all prejudice is a great spiritual challenge and requirement for all of us at this time.

# The full consciousness and acceptance of the Oneness of our Human Family is the fundamental prerequisite for the reorganization of the world as One, the Home of Humankind and all Life. Universal acceptance and realization of this spiritual principle are essential to the successful attempt to establish Peace on Earth.

# The spiritual – as well as physical – reality of the Oneness of our Human Family should, therefore, be taught in every school, and affirmed in every nation as preparation for fundamental changes in the systemic structures of our unfolding global society. World peace will only be fully achieved when this spiritual reality of the “Oneness” of all Life is realized.  

# As prophesied,  organizations like the [United Religions Initiative (URI)](https://www.uri.org/), the [Parliament of the World’s Religions](https://www.parliamentofreligions.org/), [Unity Earth](https://unity.earth/) and others, are promoting interfaith and interspiritual understanding, awareness, and unprecedented, unified actions toward global harmony. The URI Preamble, Purpose and Principles, organizational framework, and integrative scheme of thought are key in the global movements that are clearly supporting the fulfillment of the prophecies.

# In promoting enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice, and healing for the Earth and all living beings, the Parliament of the World’s Religions, Unity Earth and URI welcome Indigenous Faith Traditions as co-equals in uniting and moving us toward world peace and a new global civilization.  

# The recognition of the Oneness of Humankind calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole world. A world that is naturally unified in all the essential aspects of its life–its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language–and yet infinite in the diversity of the unique characteristics of each culture and bioregion. This promised future will take faith, vision, patience, time and unprecedented, unified action, well beyond 2020, 2030, and 2050. 

# The time will come when the imperative for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage to actualize world peace will be universally and undeniably realized. Elected representatives and cultural and spiritual leaders of our Human Family will consider the ways and means to lay the foundations of the Most Great Peace,  for and among all members of our Human Family. Whether or not the current world leaders are prepared to consider these issues, they will eventually and inevitably be fully addressed by our Human Family. Indigenous women arising from every part of Mother Earth will be an important part of this global leadership.

# The prophecies, like Black Elk’s “Hoop of Many Hoops”, clearly outline a “Global Commons” in which all nations, races, creeds, and classes are closely and permanently united as One Human Family. This will be manifested when there is a globally shared commitment to place the common good of our Human Family ahead of any national, ethnic, religious and selfish interests. 

# This will also require a new global governing system, rooted locally, organized and scaled bio-regionally, and synergized globally, whose members are elected in a non-partisan, principle-centered manner. Key among its responsibilities will be stewarding the sustainable and harmonious development of our global resources and cultures, while ensuring the enacting of such laws that will regulate and satisfy the needs and relationships of all members of our Human Family, including balancing the extremes of wealth and poverty, and upholding all fundamental human rights, such as the equality universal education, free expression, and individual sovereignty. Indeed, its primary function will be to safeguard the unity and harmony of the whole. 

# A world language will be invented or will be selected from our Human Family’s existing languages that will be taught and spoken in all the nations,  in addition to our mother tongue.  Science and spirituality, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will cooperate, and will harmoniously develop together. The economic resources of the world will be organized for the welfare of all members of our Human Family to ensure the distribution of its products and services will be equitably regulated. National rivalries and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding, and cooperation.  

# The freeing up of enormous resources, from the end of war,  will be dedicated to research extending the range of scientific inventions and technological developments, increasing productivity, exterminating disease, raising the standard of human health, ecologically sustaining the resources of our Mother Earth, and furthering the intellectual, moral, cultural, artistic, and spiritual life of all members of our Human Family.

# In summary, these prophecies foretell a global oneness, a unity in diversity, embracing the entire Human Family in a respectful, sustainable and harmonious relationship characterized by the understanding that “the Hurt of One is the Hurt of All, and the Honor of One is the Honor of All.” This is the Day that shall not be followed by night!

# Though our work will be long and arduous, the prize which the Great Spirit has chosen to confer upon us is so precious that neither tongue nor pen can fittingly praise it. The fulfillment of this ultimate vision and the fulfillment of the prophecies of our Indigenous Peoples and the Ancient of Days is assured!

Bitcoin,"How Latoken scammed us for 18,000+ USD","**HOW LATOKEN SCAMMED US FOR 18,000+ USD**

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, my name is Joe and I'd like to share our story how we worked for LAToken and they have

*scammed us* for our referral cut.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all a year ago I was working as a listing manager at Worldcoretrade, a new crypto exchange,

which was recently closed, sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

The exchange has been developing very slowly and their management was very weak so I decided to work on other exchanges in order to list the existing clients and find better commissions. I had a few clients and many connections who were already listed at Latoken, so I decided to give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I got connected with Valeria Fedorova, Latoken listing manager.

She promised golden gates and diamond roads, considering the commisions they charge (from 5 btc up

to 17 btc per listing).

So we launched an independed website and started promoting their listing offers.

A few days later, they have offered even better solution – IEO, initial exchange offering, which promised about

25% referral fees for a 8+ btc listing cost. So basically we worked for 2 btc commision for each listed

client.

One of my initial clients that was first listed at Worldcore Trade has accepted their offer and arranged a

listing. This happened 1 week (!) after the service proposal in January and we had this client since the

beginning of Jan 2019. You can check their news so it's clear – first they got listed at Worldcore, then at

Latoken.

But somehow they have not told me anything about this client while I was suggesting other clients I

have introduced, sometimes they were saying – don't communicate with them, as they are already

negotiating our offer. Frankly speaking, I was confused with such reactions, but well, we have just

started, so I tried to respect their ongoing issues and did not interfere.

But this client (TOKENMOM exchange) was our client with many other directions, not just worldcore.

I personally did communicate with Bobby Ong at Coingecko and managed them to get listed there. I

was keeping the communication with Valeria and once we suddenly found out that TM is running IEO

at latoken, I contacted her. In response she told me that I don't have any proof that TM has been listed

with our assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats when the shady actions have started, with very easy explanation I'll be posting below.

Communication via e-mail and TG did not bring any success so I decided to give it a try at their

meeting held in Europe. So I gave them a visit and first attempted to talk to their “ceo” Valentin

Preobrazhenskiy. He was mean and rude, forwarding me to Valeria, and she was trying to hold me busy

talking while the attendees were watching us arguing for a while. After a 30 minute talk, she said that

they will FIND A SOLUTION ON the following Monday and it's all good – just to contact them on

Monday via chat. So I did, but when I contacted them, she said that the listing was done via a local

representative and I need to sign some agreement (after 6 months of work!) if I want to work with

them!. I was amazed but decided to find out more about this.

&amp;#x200B;

So finally I discovered after talking to another local rep here that local representatives get WAY lower

commission, it's not even close to 5%. This perfectly explained why they scammed us.

Now, when I contacted them in live chat, they reacted to this instantly promising that their support will

contact me. Afterall Valeria got FIRED for that event held which I visited. I figured that she was fired

because I came into the event and somehow compromised the reputation which is ruined anyways

already way before this. SO Valeria got fired just to cover this scam and they have lied again – no

support has contacted me, however, when I asked again when they will contact me, they have banned

me from the chat.

&amp;#x200B;

Latoken is being run by russian cons, that thought that i'm an English speaker, so I can't really influence

the primary origin, however that was a big mistake because I do speak Russian fluently and do have a

lot of stuff to say about their scam.

&amp;#x200B;

Please see the attached screenshots, proving that TokenMom has been our client from the very

beginning of January 2019 and that LAToken scams every listing agent, because of the fee difference –

they just forward the tokens to their local representatives and save 80-90 percent of the commissions

promised.

I also have some chat screenshots with Valeria where someone from her account (she is fired,

remember) is asking me questions such as who I contacted and explaining that she left the LA herself.

So I suppose these shitbag liars will continue scamming others as they are definitely used to this and

that's their primary goal – **stealing the funds from listed tokens and listing managers.**

They faked the volumes so bad, that they can't even keep the exchange in one piece – it's falling apart

now, considering the feedback you can see in their live chat – many people got scammed recently

including the account holders (delayed withdrawals, changed passwords, etc)",cryptocurrency
stocks,Goldman Sachs Bullish on Gold for 2020,"Goldman Sachs has a bullish outlook on gold. Analysts at the investment bank see prices pushing to $1,600 an ounce next year. The price of gold currently sits at $1459.62. That is a nearly 10% gain from present day prices. December gold futures are trading at about $1,456.70 an ounce.

On Sunday, the investment bank stated in a report that it likes the precious metal for 2020, because investors are looking for alternative investment assets.

“Investment deficit creates excess savings, supporting gold. In theory, savings should equal investment, but due to this decline in capex and a rise in precautionary cash balances, a savings surplus is beginning to develop that is supporting gold prices,” the analysts wrote. “When combined with 750 tonnes of central bank gold purchases related to de-dollarization and defensive portfolio rotations, the savings glut means we maintain our bullish gold stance in 2020 with a target of $1600/toz..”

The investment bank’s analysts believe that heightened global uncertainty, along with slowing economic growth, could support gold prices. Recession concerns remain, moreover, according to the analysts. Increasing inflation, as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, could buoy gold prices. A potential flight from the dollar could also help support the gold price.

Goldman Sachs is less bullish on silver for 2020. The investment bank does see prices increasing to $18 an ounce, a gain of 6.5% over current prices.

“Outside of investment demand, silver fundamentals remain challenged as industrial demand contracted and mine supply, while flat this year, is expected to grow strongly in 2020,” the analysts said. “While we expect investor interest in the precious space to be high in 2020 it will likely be less than during 2H19 when recession fears spiked. In such an environment while gold investment can continue to grow silver often gets overlooked being the marginal precious metal.”

personalfinance,"With a HE Loan, I could be financially stable. To get a HE Loan I need to be financially stable. Have I totally screwed myself?","So here's the thing, I don't know much about how home equity loans are approved behind the scenes but I assume it's all predetermined formulae and strict rules. Is that right? If so, I'm kinda screwed.

I admit that I haven't been the best with my money, a surprise baby, spent too much on frivolous crap, and I've used credit cards waaaaay too much and have a few personal loans through Marcus, Upstart, etc. (I also have a 140k+ in student debt). So yeah, yikes.

My current credit score sucks (618) because of all my debt, but I have never missed a payment in like 13 years. I just have high balances, I guess? 

My income is decent, too (\~$200k plus bonuses and equity).

My Debt to Income currently is around 54%, which i know sucks.

But here's the thing: If I was approved for a HE Loan, my D:I would be around 37% (and obviously, my credit score would shoot through the roof by paying off my credit cards).

So here's the question:  
Am I just screwed because my credit score sucks and my D:I is too high? Will every lender send me packing despite my income and credit payment history?  
My ultimate goal would be to get approved with a ghastly interest rate like 9.5% or something, pay off all my personal debt (except my student debt), make payments for a year, and then refinance it when my credit score is sitting around 775 with a 34% D:I.

Is there any hope for my situation? I realize I am not destitute or going to hit the poor house, but I am spending like half of my income on credit card and personal loan payments. With a HE loan, I could actually make this manageable. 

Thanks for your honest advice.  :/",finance

personalfinance,Used up my emergency fund,"My car needed work (twice, totally unrelated issues) recently which cost more than I had in my emergency fund. Because I need my car to get to work I used a credit card to take care of the rest of the cost ($2500). The bill has not yet generated for this card but I won’t be able to pay it off when it does. What do I do from here?

I expect to be able to put $100-150 towards paying this off each month. I will be trying to cut down on expenses but that’s my estimate for now. 

Do I just pay as much as I can to the credit card (over 20% interest rate)?
Do I take out a lower interest loan from my credit union (or wherever I find the best rates) to take care of this balance? I should be able to get somewhere in the 5-9% range. 
Do I try to re-establish some kind of emergency fund before I dig hard into this debt?

I recently took care of all my debt and lifestyle creep got to me. This was a well needed wake up call and I will be working on fixing my habits. I just need to know what my best options are from here. I don’t need advice on how to cut expenses or generate more income, I can figure out what will work for me and worst case I pay a bit more interest in the long term as punishment for being mildly irresponsible for the past 6 months.",finance

personalfinance,Choosing to pay short term capital gains instead of long term gains? Does this scenario make sense?,"I could use some thoughts on a hypothetical stock sale in choosing to realize a gain from longer term holdings or to sell a new acquisition that would have a smaller gain and lower taxes. 

(Assume these were acquired in two big chunks - the stock was acquired as restricted stock units that vested two years apart.)

To make the math simple:

10 shares vested at $100/share in October 2018.
10 shares vested at $120/share in October 2019.

Current stock price is at $125, so the 20 shares are worth $2,500.

Income is high enough that long term capital gains = 15% and, for ease of calculation, assume a 30% effective federal tax rate for short term capital gains.

If you were to sell 5 shares - what would you do?

1.	Selling 2018 shares: $125 gain will be taxed at 15% for $18.75.
2.	Selling 2019 shares: $25 gain will be taxed at 30% for $7.5.

My original instinct was to sell the longer held stock first and eat the “extra taxes” but is that being stupid?

I had like $10kish total in my employer plan.

I worked at my previous company for 2 years.
my first paycheck that i qualified for on 401k benefits, it defaulted with pretax. so it took out i around $40ish or so from my paycheck to pretax contribution.

after that, for the next 2 years , i put it all into roth 401k.
in that 2 years, my company also did a profit share plan thingy. and every 2 years, 20% vested.
so with my 2 years (20% vesting) and my contributions + employer match, my total of $10k is now $7.4kish (I forget the exact amounts of each.)

I called vanguard to get that all into an IRA account so i can avoid w/e fees i may have. and it looks like it went through.

However, LONG ago, i made a roth IRA acc just so i can have a vanguard account up. i believe that is the ""roth ira brokerage"" thats shown.

I now also have 2 separate ones, titled rollover IRA and just ""roth ira"".

additionally, my ""roth ira brokerage"" seems to have other options within it itself? like vanguard federal money market fund.
i thought this was the ""normal"" ROTH IRA acc. but comparing it to my ""ROTH IRA"" titled one, it doesnt have other options.

So I guess what im asking here. what are the difference between the 3 accounts (im guessing 1 is post tax or roth, and the other is pre tax. Rollover one = pretax by logical deduction)? why are they not simply consolidated (atleast the roth IRA one.)? is there a difference between the roth IRA and roth IRA brokerage?

I was, all-in-all, irresponsible tbh.

I've read the latter is hard to do but I've found several lenders who seem to be good to do it.

I'm just unsure what the best course of action is in terms of refinancing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Here's a breakdown of my loans (all Nelnet are FAFSA):


Lender | Principle | Current Amount | Interest Rate | Subsidized?
------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------
Sallie Mae | 3500 | 3800 | 8.5 | N
Sallie Mae | 10000 | 10300 | 9.875 | N
Sallie Mae | 9600 | 10400 | 10.875 | N
Sallie Mae | 9000 | 10600 | 10.25 | N
Sallie Mae | 9500 | 10600 | 8.5 | N
Nelnet | 2000 | 2060 | 5.05 | N

Are there any recommendations on how to handle the refinancing? Should I not refinance the Parent+ (I realize the interest rate is pretty decent but I would really like to get them out of my parent's name)? I don't think I should refinance the FAFSA loans but I'm also not sure.

Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off All of Loans Now or in a Year?,"I have around $45,800 is my bank account and have the following three student loans:

* Loan 2: $14,649.21 with 6.8% interest rate
* Loan 3: $2,927.25 with 5.750%

Should I pay everything off now leaving around $23,680 in my bank account or make a payment each month such that I pay off everything in a year? Would I invest some of this in index funds? Currently I am paying around $3200 a month on the loan with the highest amount (Loan 2). Should I keep doing this and then pay of Loan 1 and then Loan 3? Or just pay everything now?   Also my monthly income is around $6800, no rent expenses, only some utility and food expenses. No contribution to 401k and am not sure whether to pay like 80% of it now and invest rest in index funds? Also these are student loans. Also I am in the USA.

personalfinance,Parent Plus Student Loans,"Hello,

My father has a Parent PLUS loan which he took out for my education a few years back. Per our previous agreement, I intend to pay this loan back to him once I finish my entire graduate studies. My question is if I can consolidate this loan in the future with my own direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans? 

Since the interest rate is quite high on his Parent PLUS loans, he is looking to potentially re-finance to a private loan. Does this affect my payment options in the future?

I contribute only 4% to my 401K, max out my HSA and auto-invest, and max out 15% into the ESPP plan. 

Should I keep paying what I’m paying on my loans which would probably take me 7-9 years to pay off. Or should I continue max out my stock plan and let my shares grow and grow for the next decade and then cash out my stocks over time to pay off my debt more aggressively?

personalfinance,Living without debt and credit score dropping.,"I currently have no debt and I’d like to buy a house within the next 18 months. When paying off my student and car loan I understood the accounts I closed would negatively affect my average account age and thus drop my score but I wasn’t sure how much. So far my score has went 792-788-771-767-754. Everyone here seems to agree anything above 740ish is treated the same when getting an interest rate for a home loan but should I be concerned with the score still sliding? I will be putting at least 20% down. I know very little about manual underwriting with banks or if I would still get a low interest rate with manual underwriting and my score sliding. Anyone have experience or suggestions?

Edit: I have a credit card and pay it off monthly. Lots of competing info here but I’m probably going to disregard the score, put down 20-30% and assume I’ll have to use manual underwriting if the score continues to slide. I expected it would slide after paying all debt off, hopefully it is just settling into the 750 range after 6 months of slowly dropping.",finance

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines. The bank has found itself in politicians’ cross-hairs. Australia’s treasurer said it had been indifferent to the scandal; the attorney-general noted that it was an “unbelievably serious” matter. Westpac has reportedly cancelled its Christmas party.

**Charles Schwab**, America’s biggest discount broker, struck a $26bn deal to acquire **td** **Ameritrade**, a rival. The pair had recently been engaged in a price war, both ditching the transaction fees they charged customers. The combined group will have around $5trn in client assets. See [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/30/charles-schwab-agrees-to-buy-td-ameritrade-for-26bn).

The **Brazilian real** fell to a new low against the dollar, after Brazil’s finance minister said he was “not worried” about a strong greenback. The slide prompted a brief intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency. The country’s current-account deficit has risen sharply this year, and interest rates have tumbled.

**Google** reportedly fired four employees who had been active in organising protests at the company and had apparently tried to gain access to private internal documents. The tech giant pioneered an office culture that mixes politics with work, which it may now regret. Vociferous staff have pressed management to drop an ai contract for the Pentagon and have walked out over sexual harassment and a search-engine project for the Chinese government. Their latest gripe is Google’s work for immigration enforcement. Google has told employees to tone it down and reduced staff meetings to one a month.

In an effort to boost profits and its feeble share price, **Telefónica** announced a plan to hive off its operations in Spanish-speaking Latin America and focus on its core markets in Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, where it brands itself as O2. The telecoms group also wants to expand its business in the internet of things and cloud computing.

On the lookout for new superdrugs that will replenish its portfolio, **Novartis** offered to buy **The Medicines Company** for $9.7bn. tmc’s crown jewel is inclisiran, a treatment that has been found to be highly effective in drug trials at reducing “bad” cholesterol, and which a patient needs to inject only twice a year. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/the-reinvention-of-novartis).

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said it alone would inspect the **737** max before it is returned to service, relieving Boeing of the exercise and signalling that it will sign off each jet individually.

**Tesla’s** share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it took after an unforeseen event at the launch of its new Cybertruck, which has been described as a cross between a futuristic car from “Blade Runner” and a SpongeBob SquarePants character.

personalfinance,How to carve up proceeds of home sale,"Hello friends! We had a weird situation recently where we closed on buying a new house about three weeks before we were able to close on the sale of our old house. Long story, not terribly interesting, but let's start with that.

We were able to put 20% down on a $700K house at 3.75%, which (after escrow and all) results in a payment of ""larger than we'd like."" Now that we've got a substantial sum from the sale of our old home, we're trying to decide the best way to use it.

Our original plan was to recast this loan, dump most or all of the proceeds into the mortgage and get the monthly payment down. Unfortunately, the terms of our loan say that we can't recast for 120 days, so theoretically we've got the Big Mortgage Payment in our laps for four months. Or we can refinance immediately and see if we can sweet talk the new lender into easing up on the closing costs. In either case I expect we'll put a pretty large chunk (most if not all) toward the mortgage.

*But.* We're also sitting on some other debts that we could pay off? There's a $12K car loan at 4.1%. There's a fair number of student loans hovering between 2.7 and 3.5%. 

*And.* And I could throw some more into my company's 401(k). Or fire up some new modest investment somewhere for retirement.

I'm open to any advice you all might have about priorities for this new sum, but mostly what I'm looking for is this: advice on *how to calculate* several possible outcomes. I'd like to be able to model scenarios like:

* If I can recast the loan with $X and the same interest rate, what would my new mortgage payment be? 
* If I paid off my car, what would happen if I redirected that monthly payment toward extra payments on my mortgage principal? Or what if I invested it somewhere?
* How much can I carve off of my new funds to, say, furnish the house a little nicer or do the landscaping, and still have a significant sum to put toward the mortgage? 

The uncertainty is a little stressful, and I'd like to feel confident that putting together a plan of ""Use $X to pay for things and the rest to shove into the mortgage"" would actually result in a good outcome.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

 Every bed and breakfast owner know how to make people feel contented, but that perfect environment usually have need for extra investment. Whether you need to make repairs, upgrades, or require more staff, constant cash flow is essential to ensure success of your B&amp;B.

In order to increase revenue and to keep up with the changing demands, funding is often required. Securing a bed and breakfast loan is the way to have those costly repairs, upgrades, additions, or hiring and achieve your goals.

There are numerous business loans for B&amp;Bs that can help you grow, take advantage of the opportunities, and help stay solvent during your slower seasons. In this guide, we’ll walk you through some of the best business loan options for bed and breakfasts, and help you assess which option to choose based on your needs.

**Why Bed and Breakfast Owners Borrow?**

Among many, here are the top needs of B&amp;B that require borrowing:

* You need to expand your offerings such as addition of extra rooms, more space, outdoor sitting, extended menu or maybe kitchen upgrades. The reason could be anything and it could make the difference in growing your business and clientele.
* Your existing rooms are dreary and archaic that necessitate remodeling. A clean, modern upgrade can help boost your guest satisfaction and make them feel welcomed.
* You might need cash for your day-to-day operations. If you’re having a slower season, need an extra space or to face any financial challenge, a short-term capital can help fill the gap until you rebound and make progress again.
* Managing your guests requires a lot of effort because customer satisfaction and service quality matter the most in this industry. All that necessitate more staff in the workplace. Your customer’s experience and words of mouth is a great way to bring about new customers.

**Business Loan Options for Bed and Breakfasts**

Before jumping into the best business loan options for Bed and Breakfasts, you should consider few things:

* How quickly the cash is required
* Are you willing to do the paperwork
* For what purpose the money is required
* How much capital you can afford
* Are your business financials strong enough

Understanding all these considerations will help you find the best business loan for your bed and breakfast based on your affordability and qualification.

**See Your Business Loan Options**

**Best Overall: SBA Loan**

Small Business Administration (SBA) loans are widely considered the best business loan for bed and breakfasts with higher loan amounts, longer repayment terms, and lowest interest rates.

SBA loans are provided through a network of banks and alternative lenders and are guaranteed up to 85% by the federal government through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The guarantee protect the lenders in the case borrowers default on the loan—making them less risky for lenders and favorable for borrowers. Of course, SBA loans are highly competitive; only the most qualified borrowers with a strong financials and credit score can qualify.

The most popular types of SBA loans are SBA 7(a) loan and SBA 504/CDC loan, which provides instant working capital for small businesses. SBA 7(a) loan are like a traditional business term loan or a business line of credit, and SBA 504/CDC loan are for fixed assets purchases like real estate.

SBA loans take time to approve (up to 4-8 weeks) and involves a significant amount of paperwork. If you need money fast, it’s recommended to look for other options.

**Best for Startups: SBA Microloan**

Lenders approval decision is primarily based on borrowers creditworthiness, And as new bed and breakfasts business owner, you might not have one. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t secure capital. SBA Microloans are the most suitable options especially for startups, which provide loan amounts up to $50,000. To qualify for SBA Microloans, you need to have a strong personal credit.

Like all other SBA loan types, Microloans also take a lot of time for approval. However, with their favorable terms, they’re worth to apply for.

**Best SBA Loan Alternative: Business Term Loans**

When you’re unable to qualify for SBA loans, business term loans are a better alternative. Business loans have less stringent requirement and are structured as lump sums of capital. For risky borrowers, the terms can be short with higher interest rates and vice versa.

Generally, medium-term loans have repayment terms of one to five years, and short-term loans have repayment terms of 18 months or less. Securing business term loans is far speedier than SBA loans. If your paperwork is complete with all the necessary documents, you may get an approval decision in as little as 24 hours.

**Best for Incremental Expenses: Business Line of Credit**

A business line of credit is an appropriate option especially for businesses with incremental expenses. In a credit line, you’re provided with a credit limit to draw from as you need it. The best thing about a business line of credit is that you only pay interest on what you use. A business credit line is best for quick repairs, upgrades or for cash flow issues. While running a B&amp;B, you might need additional seasonal staff, low margins, pay for operational expenses, payroll, and similar expenses, this is where a business line of credit can help.

A business credit line also offers quick turnaround on approval for qualified borrower with little paperwork. A business with 6 months of time in business can also qualify for a business line of credit, which is also a plus over other types of loans.",finance

*Source of this article:* *Sina Finance. This content is intended to convey more market information and does not constitute any investment advice.*

Sina Finance News On November 29, 2019, the ReFinTech Financial Technology Summit was held at Beijing New World Hotel. Li Lihui, the head of the China Mutual Fund Association's blockchain team and former president of the Bank of China, attended and gave a speech. The topic of the speech was ""National Strategy and Fiat Digital Currency.""

Li Lihui said that digital currencies will play a central role in the global digital economy competition in the future, and it is necessary to step up research on feasible routes and implementation plans for the issuance of global digital currencies led by China. Digital finance is bound to further strengthen the globalization of finance. In the construction of the global system of digital finance, China should actively participate in and strive for the right to speak. It is necessary to strengthen international regulatory coordination, promote regulatory consensus, and establish a unified international regulatory standard for digital finance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blockchain technology architecture**

**Li Lihui pointed out that blockchain is an integrated innovation of multiple technologies and has the following four characteristics.**

&gt;Chain block structure based on timestamp, it is difficult to tamper with the on-chain data;  
Real-time running system based on consensus algorithm, specified data can be shared;  
Based on self-rules of smart contracts, technical trust can be authenticated;  
Based on the end-to-end network of the encryption algorithm, the counterparties can choose each other.

**According to different technical architectures, blockchain can be divided into 3 types.**

**The basic characteristics of the public blockchain architecture are: a decentralized distributed ledger that uses open read, write, and transaction permissions; a decentralized digital trust mechanism that uses consensus algorithms and encryption algorithms; and a virtual currency incentive mechanism that demonstrates work contribution and equity. .**

The technical drawbacks of the public blockchain architecture are high hardware requirements and low transaction speed. If the public blockchain can break through the technical bottleneck of transaction speed and resource utilization efficiency, and achieve publicly recognized reliability, it may be able to expand the territory in social life and modern commerce.

**The characteristic of the private blockchain architecture is that the distributed ledger is centralized, and the read, write, and transaction permissions must be approved by the ""central"" and subject to the constraints and restrictions of the ""central"". The digital trust mechanism of the private chain does not emphasize ""going intermediary"".**

Private blockchain has the ""centralization"" feature of traditional information technology architecture, but uses blockchain technology such as distributed ledger, smart contracts, and encryption algorithms. Blockchain platforms are easy to integrate with existing information technology platforms and can establish bureaus Regional multi-dimensional interaction architecture improves data processing speed and quality.

**Alliance blockchain can generally be regarded as a collection of private blockchains. It adopts a distributed, multi-center, intermediary architecture. Its basic characteristics are open-source, multi-center distributed ledger, limited license, limited authorization. Read, write, and transaction permissions, without emphasis on the digital trust mechanism of intermediaries.**

Different from the traditional big center data architecture, the ""central"" status of the alliance chain may not be designated by the administration, but largely depends on the competitive results of technological advancement and service friendliness; ""trust"" can come from intermediaries and rely on tradition Credit model can also be technical trust without intermediary.

**The characteristics of distributed, end-to-end, open source, and multi-center that the blockchain technology theoretically possesses are likely to restructure the technology architecture in a certain range and rebuild the business model in a certain range.**

First, the distributed architecture and end-to-end network are helpful for the parallel transmission of information, the realization of information sharing, and the parallel control of control. In the scenario of many counterparties, many transaction links, long management chains, and high degree of discreteness, time-space folding And three-dimensional interactive business architecture to improve cooperation efficiency and operation efficiency.

Second, the chain block data structure, consensus mechanism, time stamp, and key technologies can help prevent tampering of the original data, control the risk of data leakage, and protect privacy and data security.

Third, smart contracts help to achieve differentiation and credibility of transaction rules, automate the execution of business processes, ensure the timeliness of transactions, avoid false transactions and repeated transactions, and reduce moral and operational risks to a certain extent.

In the field of finance, the application of the alliance's blockchain technology is likely to build a distributed ledger system in which large, medium and small financial institutions participate together, forming a technical platform for financial institutions to interconnect and interconnect, and to seamlessly link existing systems with innovative systems and realize financial The direct link between the service system and customers enables information sharing, product sharing, and service sharing to provide more efficient financial services.

**The practice of blockchain technology development and application proves that in large-scale commercial applications, the alliance blockchain is most likely to become the mainstream architecture.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Central Bank Legal Digital Currency**

Digital currencies with legal status, endorsement of state sovereignty, and subjects with issuance responsibility constitute legal digital currencies, or central bank digital currencies.

Central banks of many countries have long announced the launch of digital currency research and development. But regarding the basic structure of legal digital currency, countries are still demonstrating and have not yet made a choice.

**The development of China's fiat digital currency lasted for 5 years, and there have recently been signs of preparation for issuance.** **According to the information disclosed by central bank officials, China's legal digital currency may be called DC / EP, Digital Currency / Electronic Payment, that is, digital currency and electronic payment.**

**First, adopt a two-tier operation delivery system to inherit the indirect issuance model.** Applying digital technologies such as blockchain, fiat digital currencies can adopt the ""central bank-public"" direct issue model. In the direct issue model, the central bank can have the absolute power and ability to regulate the money market and can directly absorb public deposits, which will limit the initial credit capacity of commercial banks. If the indirect issuance model of the fiat currency ""Central Bank-Commercial Bank-Public"" is selected, it will inherit the current money market operation mechanism and monetary policy transmission mechanism.

The benefits of inheriting the current model are savings and robustness. First, it is not necessary to rebuild the financial infrastructure, which is conducive to saving investment; second, it is not necessary to restructure the currency issuance and management structure in addition to the old cloth, which is conducive to managing risks; third, it is not necessary to look forward and backward to connect different characteristics of the currency issuance model, which is conducive to stabilizing the market.

**Second, adopt a parallel technical route and adhere to the central bank's central management model.** Based on the judgment that ""the existing blockchain technology cannot meet the high concurrent demand of the retail market in the super market"", fiat digital currencies should remain technologically neutral and do not rely on a single technology. The central bank should adhere to a centralized management model to ensure the reliability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the efficiency of currency control, and prevent financial institutions from overspending.

**Third, the ""account loose coupling"" method is adopted to replace the currency M0.** Electronic payment tools such as WeChat Pay and Alipay use the ""tight coupling of accounts"" method. They need to be tied to a bank account and transfer value through the bank account. Under the real-name account management system, the need for anonymous payment cannot be realized. The fiat digital currency may adopt the method of ""account loose coupling"" plus electronic wallet, to achieve end-to-end value transfer from bank accounts, reduce the dependence of financial intermediaries on transaction links, and achieve controllable anonymous payments within the scope permitted by the central bank.

**At present, the design of China's legal digital currency may be limited to replacing M0, that is, cash in circulation, rather than narrow money M1 and broad money M2.** **This depends on the judgment of the digital trends and potential market demand of China's M0, M1, and M2.**

WeChat Pay and Alipay use digital technology to build mobile payment and living service platforms that use trust links as a link, breaking through the traditional payment model, and have achieved 1 billion straight-line links, ranking among the top 2 in global mobile payment platforms. WeChat Pay and Alipay dominated the retail payment market, with cash and ATM transactions significantly reduced, and bank cards became bundled account cards.

**The legal digital currency in China's design can theoretically be separated from the network and from banks to perform value transfer.** **This is different from WeChat Pay and Alipay.** But in the end, whether it can replace traditional currency forms, replace emerging electronic payment tools, and become the main currency form and main payment tool will be decided by the market: it is more convenient to use, the circulation cost is lower, and the public is willing to accept it, thereby forming an economic scale with commercial value .

**Digital Economy National Strategy**

The application of blockchain technology has extended to many fields such as digital finance, the Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, and digital asset trading. How to evaluate the current status of blockchain technology and industrial development? My opinion is that the **underlying technology** of the blockchain is **not yet mature, and the technical bottlenecks of large-scale and reliable applications need to be broken. We are in the period of great opportunities for the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation.**

**First, blockchain technology is still immature and bottlenecks need to be broken.**

In the underlying technology, as a technology integration innovation, the basic components of the blockchain database, P2P peer-to-peer network, and cryptographic algorithms are relatively mature, but they must further meet the new requirements of integrated applications; new mechanisms such as consensus mechanisms and smart contracts Technology needs to be improved. Gartner, a technology consulting company, believes that it will take 5-10 years for blockchain technology to mature.

At present, large-scale applications of blockchain technology have not been implemented in various countries. China's blockchain technology research and development is committed to breaking through the bottleneck of large-scale reliable applications.

The first is private computing technology. Under the blockchain consensus mechanism, how to effectively shield sensitive information, improve signature technology, secure computing technology, encryption technology, trusted execution technology, etc., to ensure data security and digital link reliability.

The second is the authenticity supervision mechanism. How to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data before the on-chain, when the blockchain technology is used to trace the source of various assets, a closed loop is truly formed to avoid information distortion and prevent speculation.

The third is smart contract technology. How to avoid technical loopholes in smart contracts, and achieve controllable business logic corrections and contract upgrades.

The fourth is key technology. Key security is the cornerstone of blockchain trust. In the unique technical structure of the private key, how to effectively prevent the private key from being stolen or deleted maliciously, and to remedy the loss and theft of the private key.

Fifth, integration of diversified technology platforms. How to optimize the multi-dimensional parallel interaction architecture to achieve efficient links between more participants; how to improve the quality and speed of data processing to achieve ultra-large-scale, high reliability, and high security requirements.

**Second, implement the national strategy for the digital economy.**

The attitudes and trends of developed countries on digital finance and digital economy deserve our attention.

The United States is concerned about digital financial market norms. The focus of US regulation is to regulate digital financial markets and prevent digital financial instruments from being used in illegal areas. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission included ICOs under supervision, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the Chicago Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to launch Bitcoin futures trading. In 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stated that the regulatory strategy for digital currencies is to use case law enforcement rather than a systematic interpretation of securities laws, and to carefully, orderly, and actively clarify regulatory principles and boundaries.

Germany and France are concerned about digital sovereignty. On October 29, 2019, Germany and France announced the ""Gaia-X"" project involving German and French core companies, which aims to build a secure and reliable data infrastructure for Europe. German Economy Minister Peter. Altmeyer said that this infrastructure will help us regain digital sovereignty and lay the foundation for a digital ecosystem. French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno. Lemaire said the project will include data storage, data concentration and data sharing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that what worries me most is that most of the processing of industrial and consumer data is done by American companies, and a kind of dependency relationship is being formed. Merkel advocates taking a long-term view and digitizing the overall layout from as many European perspectives as possible.

**We should implement the national strategy of the digital economy and maintain the security of the digital economy.**

**The first is to master autonomous and controllable technologies.**

On the underlying technologies such as the blockchain consensus mechanism and smart contracts, China currently lacks independent property rights. Most of the application projects in China use the open source blockchain underlying platform for adaptive adjustment and development, and optimize from the number of concurrent users, throughput, response time, availability, security, etc., to meet business needs, to achieve identity authentication, privacy Protection, node management and other functions.

Extensive application of foreign open source programs may lead to technology dependence risks, and must comply with the jurisdiction and legal constraints of the place where the open source platform is registered, potentially hiding geopolitical risks. For example, the terms of use of the open source program GitHub clearly state that the use of GitHub must not violate export control or sanctions laws in the United States or other applicable jurisdictions.

We should vigorously support technological innovation and strive to master digital technology. Clarify digital technology and digital industry policies, grant tax and fee concessions to digital technology R &amp; D enterprises and professionals, encourage digital technology R &amp; D and application, national team plus private team, Chinese plus foreign capital, large, medium, small and micro. In the field, we have independent and controllable intellectual property rights and establish global competitive advantages in key areas of digital economy and digital finance.

The development of next-generation computing architecture should be intensified to ensure the fairness and correctness of mathematical algorithms, the privacy and reliability of data, the security of the entire process and the entire cycle of data, and the speed and efficiency of mathematical algorithms.

**The second is to accelerate standardization and institutional innovation.**

The International Organization for Standardization ISO has established a blockchain and distributed ledger technical committee to study 11 standards, including terminology, reference architecture, privacy and personal information protection, security risks and vulnerabilities. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a distributed ledger technology security-related problem group to study 10 standards, including security assurance, security threats, and security framework. The development of IEEE standards for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is mainly focused on blockchain in the fields of IoT data management, digital asset management, government department applications, and cryptocurrencies.

China's blockchain financial standardization construction and institutional construction have just begun. We should pay close attention to improving the technical standards, security specifications, and certification review systems for blockchain finance. Clarify the legal definition of assets, clarify the contractual nature and effectiveness of smart contracts, and clarify the responsible subjects and their behavioral and regulatory standards in a distributed architecture.

Based on the healthy development of digital finance, China should speed up the construction of the digital financial system and step up efforts to formulate digital financial systems such as blockchain financial supervision, digital asset market supervision, digital currency supervision, and legal digital currency issuance. Make overall plans and gradually establish a digital trust mechanism.

Digital currency will occupy a core position in the future global digital economic competition. It is necessary to step up research on the feasible path and implementation plan for the issuance of China-led global digital currency. It is necessary to further explore the feasible path of China's legal digital currency, including alternative range selection, controllable anonymous scale, offline operation technology, and so on.

Digital finance is bound to further strengthen the globalization of finance. In the construction of the global system of digital finance, China should actively participate in and strive for the right to speak. It is necessary to strengthen international regulatory coordination, promote regulatory consensus, and establish a unified international regulatory standard for digital finance.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Payoff 401K Loan or Other Debt first?,"Here is a question for you. For starters, please avoid passing judgement on the 401k loan. Our family needed some important cash in early 2018 and we decided to take out 50K from our 401K. The job is/was stable. The terms were a 6% interest rate, which I understand is being paid by us, back to us. We have a 35K balance remaining.

In 2018, we also took another 40K out in the form of a personal loan, from Goldman Sachs/Marcus. The rate is 5.99%. The balance is also ironically, 35K.

I realize that there is risk in the 401K loan, should I lose my job, in that we would have to pay all of the money back. But I also think, if my calculations aren't missing something, that it's a lot better to be paying off the Goldman loan where the interest is going to someone else, than paying off the 401K loan where at least it's going into our retirement.

In a sunken cost situation, assuming I now have enough to pay off one of these while still retaining an emergency fund, is it better to (A) pay off the personal loan entirely, (b) pay off the 401k loan entirely, or (c) pay half to each.

On the cashflow side, which is also a factor, the Goldman personal loan runs $665 a month, where as the 401k loan is about $980 a month. Paying off the 401k loan obviously provides an additional $300+ per month of cash, which using a snowball or avalanche approach, would allow for faster repayment of the other, but I believe, at a cost in where the interest will be going. Paying off half of each leaves us with less debt and 401k risk, but no more cashflow. Paying off the loan saves potentially thousands in interest over time.

Lastly, there is of course, returns on investment lost on money loaned from 401k. I have felt the market has been over-valued for quite some time now, but it continues to keep climbing to spite me. I'm sure, due to Murphy's Law, if I pay off the 401K loan now, the market will tank. Where as if I pay off the personal loan, the market will continue to climb for another year. In a situation where the market is tanking, my money being in a loan is actually a better scenario as it's not dropping. The reverse of course is lost gains if it keeps climbing and my money is in a loan.

Curious to your thoughts on the actual financial calculation side of all of this.",finance

Banking,Why can't a bank borrow money to itself or to a trusted person in case of a bank run and has to rely on the LLR instead?,"If I understand correctly, banks borrow more money than they have in deposits with the only limits being 1) market demand for credits 2) the very low obligatory reserve rate set by central bankers. If that's the case, why (in case of a bank run and following liquidity troubles) can't the bank borrow money to a) itself or b) a trusted person, that is somebody who would not withdraw the deposit immediately but hold it on the account in said bank. I guess it would require a 0% interest rate on the loan, but still...

Such an operation would increase the total value of stable deposits in the bank and could finance the bank run without relying on the LLR's help.

personalfinance,How do I fix my student loan situation?,"I really need some advice. I know very little about finances and loans and now i'm in a bit of a disaster. 

When I started college I applied for a student loan from Citizens bank with my father as the cosigner. The loan was a multi year approval loan so I every academic year I would apply for another loan of the same type. So now, I have four loans of:

$26,910 @ 7.24%

$13440 @ 7.24%

$27885 @ 7.74%

$5,915 @ 7.46%

Citizens bank uses a service called Firstmark that you log into in order to make the requested payment. For some reason though, every month the amount due is always different even though the loan had a fixed interest rate. The bigger problem is that now the monthly amounts due have gotten really high, up to about $700 a month. We called them and asked about why the monthly payments are always different and why it's so high, and they pretty much said that's just how it is.

How do I fix this? Can I transfer the loans over to another service for a cheaper, fixed monthly payment? I tried looking at refinance options from another place but even when I try to refinance the loan amounts, it's still doesn't seem to be much cheaper than what I am now paying.",finance
personalfinance,Would you Pay off car early or invest the money into an index fund?,"Hi all. I am currently stuck between a rock and a hard place regarding my car note/investing money. 

-I owe 9k on my Subaru BRZ. I have the funds to completely pay it off in cash, plus still have 10 months of emergency fund money available. My interest rate is 2.95%

-I max out my 401k contributions at work with 6 percent plus company match. 

-I also have aspirations to set up an index fund but to be honest paying my car note off early sounds more enticing than setting up an index fund (I’ve been working overtime 1-2 days a paycheck for a year now putting extra money towards my car, I’m now in a position to where I can pay it off completely and be comfortable). I am not much of a risk taker with my money, and would not be open to any high risk high reward investments. 

I wanted to get opinions of others. My thinking is that I would have $440 every month freed up that can be put either back into my savings or an investment such as an IRA. The thought of being this close to paying my car off sounds so great after all my hard work of overtime, but I also want to get other perspectives because I am pretty much only looking at this one way. I do have an open mind so I will consider any advice. 

I like to believe I live within my means and I am smart with my money, and I do not foresee this biting me paying my car loan off early and having 10 months emergency money still in the bank. But at 2.95% interest and from my research looking thru the internet, I would be better off investing this money. I just don’t like that idea for some reason. What would y’all do? 

Third option that would suck but I can keep doing it:  keep working overtime and making large payments and have it paid off by March I’m guessing (overtime different every week so it fluctuates, no direct timetable to the overtime needs being different weekly).

personalfinance,2019 Tax Year Help - Self-Employed Part of Year,"Hi! I have a question about how self-employment payments work. Here's my situation: Most of the year (January - Nov 1 2019) I was employed by a university in Michigan. However, November and December I am working remotely (in Michigan) on a fellowship (which is subject to self-employment taxes) based in Mississippi. From January 2020 to Nov 3rd, 2020, I will be working physically in Mississippi. I believe I have taxes figured out for the 2020 tax year. I'm wondering about how the 2019 tax year will work.

Since I worked for a university, part of my income was withheld for taxes. From my calculations, the withholding from the university job covers the federal, Michigan, and FICA taxes from the university income plus the fellowship income. The amount withheld does not cover the additional federal self-employment taxes (0.9235 times 0.153 times gross SE income). So the self-employment taxes will need to be paid to the IRS by mid-January for the Sept-Dec quarter. 

Here's my question: Am I probably all set on Michigan taxes for the 2019 tax year? Do I need to pay 4.25% of the fellowship income to the Michigan treasury? I don't know how the withholding amount is split because my W2 will be available in January. That is, I'm not sure if all of my Michigan tax burden was sent to the Michigan treasury.",finance

My wife (30) and I (31) are both nurses. In 2017 we had about $190,000 in combined student loan debt ( this is when we first met). Shortly after, her father died whipping out a lot of her debt and his life insurance policy dropped us down to about $80,000 is debt .  We were able to pay for our wedding at have lowered our debt to $50,000. We left a hospital we worked at for several years  to travel nurse . This allows us to make a good portion of our income through untaxed housing and food stipends. This extra income in the last year paid for our wedding and has us at $53,000 student loan debt. About $30,000 of this debt has an interest rate greater than 4.0%. 

We have about $20,000 total that we contributed to a 403b at the hospital that we originally worked at. This is sitting with fidelity that runs retirement savings with our old hospital. I log into this account all the time and look at it but I have no clue where it truly is or what it is doing. I keep getting told that people are pretty certain of a recession this next year. I just wonder if this money should be moved towards our student loan debt or perhaps to something like an IRA? If we move it will we only get a fraction of it? And how does that work, do they cut us a check?

personalfinance,Are 529 contributions by parent considered income for college/university in the US? 529 can be used for vocational schools as well?,"I've been reading some threads and just wanted to get clear on 529s as I am new to them.

Threads I saw,

Saw this one on grandparents contributing to 529: 
https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b1e6if/grandparents_want_to_setup_a_529_but_we_hear_it/

And this one:
https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cjixog/essentially_won_1100_a_week_for_life_how_do_i_set/

which mentioned:

&gt; This is correct. If the 529 plan is owned by the parents, only 5.69% of the 529 plan can be counted as assets. However, that's for federal funded schools. Private schools probably do something else.

Is that info accurate, on 5.69% of the 529 is counted as assets of the child for state schools?  I'm wondering if there are differences on that percentage when it comes to private and/or vocational schools.

Also, it appears for 529 I can pick up to like 7 stocks, or use a mutual fund, and then start contributing, but correct me if mistaken. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,How can I set up a personal loan calculator?,"A family member is helping me to consolidate some of my credit card debt by giving me a personal loan with a low interest rate. What I'm looking to do is essentially have a calculator that compounds the interest for me. Most of the calculators I've found online just show a general monthly payment/interest level across the lifetime of the loan, but I'm looking to make irregular payment amounts against the balance. Does anyone have any good solution to make sure interest is being calculated correctly?",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 2nd, 2019.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/december-could-be-good-for-the-stock-market-but-theres-one-big-risk.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have had a bang-up year so far, and they’re heading straight into the month that is often the best of all.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 25% for the year. Thanksgiving week was technically positive for the market, with the small cap Russell 2000 breaking out, joining other indexes in an uptrend.
*****
&gt; Stocks, however, were lower Friday in sluggish trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. Through Wednesday, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had all popped to new record highs, with consumer discretionary and tech names leading the market higher this past week. The Russell 2000 is not yet back to its highs, but it pushed above its previous 52-week high, in a healthy sign for the overall market.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investor focus will move more intently to the topic of trade, and that is what will make or break the rally at year-end.

&gt; President Donald Trump has promised that a preliminary trade deal with China is close, but there still is no agreement and the Dec.15 deadline for new tariffs is getting closer. Trump’s signing of legislation Wednesday supporting the Hong Kong protesters drew a negative reaction from Beijing and adds more uncertainty to trade talks.
*****
&gt; The health of the economy is also a factor for markets, and there is some key data, with the ISM manufacturing report on Monday followed by the government’s all-important monthly jobs data on Friday.
*****
&gt; # Best month of year
&gt; 2019 has turned out to be a very good year for the market, with the Jan. 1 to Thanksgiving Day period the 14th best for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928, according to Bespoke. The 25.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 was the best for the period since 2013, and now the market enters a typically strong period.
*****
&gt; “December is the best month of the year. The S&amp;P is up 1.6 percent on average. It also has the highest frequency of advances, up 76% of the time,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. December is also the least volatile month of all, but it could see some bumps.
*****
&gt; “The market tends to go through a mid-December low, which then represents a good buying opportunity, at least through the end of January,” Stovall said, adding he thinks the decline would be no more than 5%. “I don’t think we need a big pullback or a correction. A mid-single digit decline would be sufficient.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said 2019 was set up to win because of the way the year started, following the sharp sell-off last December. When the months of January and February are higher, the S&amp;P 500 has an average total return of 24%, according to data going back to 1945. If the following year does not see have a similar double gain in January and February, it still does fairly well with a normal average return of 8% to 9%, he said.
*****
&gt; The market’s performance for the entire year also bodes well for a positive move into year-end, according to Bespoke. Since 1928, when stocks are up 20% or more by Thanksgiving, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 usually ends the year even higher, with an average gain of 1.8% between Black Friday and New Year’s Eve, Bespoke noted.
*****
&gt; # S&amp;P Sub-industry sector performance
&gt; Stovall also looked at sector performance for December, going back to 1995 and found that some of the worst performing S&amp;P sub-industry sectors were retail oriented and are highly dependent on good holiday sales. On average, computer and electronics retailers were weakest, off 4.5%, followed by leisure products off 2.2% and department stores, off 0.9%. Specialty stores and apparel and luxury goods were also among the 10 poorest performers.
*****
&gt; While 87% of the sub-industry sectors were positive, the top performer was homebuilding, up 4.5 %, followed by home improvement retail.
*****
&gt; “You want to buy now what nobody wants to own,” said Stovall, noting the market is forward pricing so investors are looking ahead to building activity picking up in spring and summer when they dip into homebuilders. Companies that sell fertilizers also do well in December.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their best monthly performance since June. The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.4% to 3,140, and the Dow closed Friday at 28,051, up 3.7% for the month of November.
*****
&gt; Technology was the best performing sector for the month, gaining 5.2%. That helped drive the Nasdaq up 4.5% for the month to 8,665.
*****
&gt; Biotech was also a top performer, helping lift the Russell 2000, which gained 4% in November to 1,624. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up 11% for the month.
*****
&gt; # Trade tensions
&gt; The big risk to the market in December is the outcome of trade talks, but economic reports will be important as investors continue to assess whether the Fed was right in ending its rate cuts.
*****
&gt; The economy has shown some signs of picking up, and a string of improved data has led economists to look for better growth in the fourth quarter. But the critical driver of growth continues to be the consumer, so holiday sales will be an important indicator to watch.
*****
&gt; Employment data remains the most important of the economic reports, since a strong labor market is crucial for consumer confidence and spending.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the economy added 183,000 jobs in November, according to Refinitiv. The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, even with the negative drag of 46,000 striking GM workers and the reduction of 17,000 federal government jobs, due to the end of temporary employment for Census workers.
*****
&gt; “For the employment report, we think one factor that is likely to result in a slightly stronger headline payroll number is the fact we will now count the GM workers that were on strike,” said Barclays economist Pooja Sriram. “We estimated 36,000 to 40,000 were left out of the report in October. We think they’re to be counted as part of the November report. Much of that is going to be seen in private payrolls and especially in manufacturing payrolls.”
*****
&gt; In October, ISM manufacturing activity improved, and even though it remained in contraction, some economists said the slowdown may be showing signs of bottoming.
*****
&gt; The ISM index is expected to be at 49.4, still shy of 50, which shows expansion, but better than October’s 48.3. “We still think it’s going to be a sub-50 print,” said Sriram.
*****
&gt; October’s durable goods report showed a surprise gain in business investment when economists had expected to see contraction.
*****
&gt; Sriram said the speed of decline in manufacturing has certainly slowed, and she is watching the data closely. “I don’t think we’re comfortable saying we bottomed,” she said.
*****
&gt; OPEC and Russia hold meetings in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, and analysts expect them to extend their production cutting agreement. However, Russia may seek to change the rules for how it counts its petroleum output, so the meeting may not be as predictable as expected, some analysts say.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/29/19

&gt; Even with a holiday and a shortened session Friday leaving no US releases in the past 48 hours, it was a very busy week for economic data with 36 releases in the first three days. Most of this data came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading where there were no forecasts. While the bulk of the week's data was strong, manufacturing data, namely from the regional Fed indices, was mixed. We started off with a weaker Chicago Fed National Activity Index on Monday. The index fell from -0.45 last month to -0.71 rather than the expected improvement to -0.2. The Dallas Fed's index was also out on Monday and it improved more than expected as well as versus the prior month. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed's gauge on manufacturing was also worse than expected. On the bright side, other manufacturing hard data like durable goods came in much stronger than both the previous month and consensus forecasts. Housing data was also solid this week with better than anticipated home price growth shown in two of the three indicators: the quarterly Home Price Purchase Index, FHFA, and Case-Shiller (only the Case-Shiller index was weaker than expected, albeit up from the prior month). The second release of third-quarter GDP was the most notable indicator of the week with a much stronger than expected reading which showed the economy grew by 2.1% QoQ versus estimates of a 1.9% growth rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco1.png))**

&gt; We kick off December with another busy few days next week. Final November Markit and ISM numbers will kick off the week on Monday. While Markit is not expecting any change from the preliminary readings, ISM is expected to improve to 49.2 which would still be a contractionary print. In hard manufacturing data, later in the week we will see final durable and capital goods numbers for November. Vehicle sales figures will be the only release on Tuesday followed by the service counterparts to Markit and ISM indices on Wednesday as the rest of the week's main focus will be on labor data. After a surprisingly strong release last month, Nonfarm Payrolls is again expecting a strong print showing 190K jobs created in the month of November.

# Stocks To Be The Most Thankful For

&gt; Below is a list of the 25 best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tops the list with a gain of more than 100%. While no other S&amp;P 500 stocks have yet to double this year, another semi name, Lam Research (LRCX) has come close with a gain of 99%. Xerox (XRX), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Target (TGT) have also all risen more than 90%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Top-2019-2.png))**

&gt; Apple (AAPL) is the 19th best performing stock in the list above. But because of its trillion+ dollar market cap, Apple's (AAPL) 69% gain has a much bigger impact on the overall stock market than all of the other stocks that have seen a bigger price move this year. In fact, of the S&amp;P 500's 25% price gain this year, Apple has accounted for 2.24 of those percentage points (or roughly 9%).

&gt; Instead of looking at simple year-to-date price change, below is a list of the stocks that investors should be most thankful for this year because of their contribution to the S&amp;P's gains. Right behind Apple (AAPL) in first is the other trillion+ dollar company -- Microsoft (MSFT) -- which has accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 25% gain. After AAPL and MSFT are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Together these five mega-caps account for 25% of the S&amp;P's move higher this year. While this group of companies has been vilified in 2019 for a number of things, they're certainly still delivering for the stock market in a big way.

# S&amp;P 500 Industry Group Breadth Running Strong

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may be hitting record highs at a pace of more than once every other day, but would you believe that there are still Industry Groups trading below their 50-day moving averages? The chart below shows the rolling percentage of Industry Groups trading above their 50-DMAs over the last several years, and the current reading stands at 91.7%. Over the last five years there have been numerous periods where a higher percentage (and even 100%) of Industry Groups traded above their 50-DMAs, and the most recent was back in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112719-Groups-vs-50-DMA-Chart.png))**

&gt; So which are the two outlier groups that are still below their 50-DMAs? Well, when everyone seems to be taking an offensive posture in the market, it's only natural that defensive sectors would be lagging, and two of the most defensive-oriented sectors in this yield-hungry world we live in are Utilities and Real Estate. Even these two groups, though, are only about 1% below their 50-DMAs, so all it will take is one or two good days for these groups to get them back over the hump. On the upside, Health Care Equipment &amp; Services is the furthest above its 50-DMA at 7.72%.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is currently just over 4% above its 50-DMA. What's interesting to note here, though, is that just 9 of the 24 Industry Groups are further above their 50-DMAs while 15 are not above their 50-DMAs by as much as the S&amp;P 500. In terms of YTD returns, the S&amp;P 500 is currently sitting on a gain of more than 25% YTD. Leading the way higher this year, Tech Hardware (Apple) has rallied just under 48%, while Semis are up just over 40%. Behind these two leaders, four other Industry Groups are up over 30% YTD. While there is no downside on a YTD basis, Energy has been the biggest laggard and is just barely hanging on to a YTD gain. If Energy can't hang onto a YTD gain in a year where the S&amp;P 500 gains more than 25%, Energy investors may need to wear paper bags over their heads.

# Technology Sector P/E Highest in Ten Years

&gt; As equities run to all-time highs, valuations are at a fairly interesting point. As shown in the chart below using data from our Daily Sector Snapshot included with our Morning Lineup and The Closer, most sectors' valuations are at the upper end of the past ten years' range. Four sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Utilities, and Technology all have trailing P/E ratios in the 90th percentile or higher of the past ten years' readings.

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 established its first all-time high since July on October 28th, Health Care and Financials have been two of the strongest performers rising 6.68% and 4.35%, respectively. Despite these runs, both of these sectors still have reasonable valuations relative to the past decade. For Financials, the current trailing price-to-earnings ratio is in the 42nd percentile of all days of the past ten years. No other sector has such a low reading although Materials and Energy are on the lower end relative to other sectors. On the other hand, Utilities and Technology have some of the highest valuations of the past ten years with the current P/E in the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/PE2.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart below, most of the last 9-12 months has seen valuations for Utilities consistently in the uppermost range of the past ten years as investors chased yield in a low interest rate environment. But as risk-free rates have risen more recently, valuations for Utilities have pulled back a bit as price has slid. While there have been other periods in the past ten years where Utilities' P/E ratio was similarly elevated, arguably only 2016/2017 saw it remain at the upper end of the ten-year range as consistently as has been the case this year.

&gt; For Technology it is a whole different story. The P/E for the sector got crushed this time last year and after plummeting to the 31st percentile, it is has rebounded to the highest levels of the past ten years. The only other time that the sector traded at a similar premium relative to the past decade's range was back in early 2018.

# Thanksgiving through Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Everyone is talking about yearend seasonal strength this year, but it’s not news to us. 2019 has been tracking historical seasonal market patterns quite closely this year and that suggests it is likely to continue to track it.

&gt; Our good friend Larry McMillan (@optstrategist) trades seasonal yearend strength with the Russell 2000 from the close the day before Thanksgiving through the end of our Santa Claus Rally (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year).

&gt; So here we have run the numbers from 1979 when the Russell index data begins comparing R2K to the DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The small-cap index Russell 2000 is the best performer up an average 3.1% (median 3.2%) with an 80% win ratio up 32 of the last 40 years. Last year was the worst and it’s been down 3 of the last 5 years.

# Giving Thanks for the U.S. Consumer

&gt; This Thanksgiving, we’re thankful for solid consumer confidence, even though it has wavered in recent months.

&gt; Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November, according to preliminary Conference Board data. Even though the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has dropped from its economic cycle peak, consumer sentiment is still historically elevated, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/consumer-confidence_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve been pleasantly surprised by the U.S. consumer’s resilience over the past year as other parts of the domestic economy have weakened amid global headwinds. Strong consumer spending has helped the economy grow at a 2% average rate over the past two quarters, despite drags on growth from business spending, inventories, and trade.

&gt; “Consumer sentiment has been largely immune from global headwinds,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect consumer spending to power economic growth through next year, so we’d like to see consumer confidence pick up more with signs of trade progress.”

&gt; Consumers have several reasons to be optimistic. Employment is the primary driver of consumer health, and the U.S. labor market has been resilient. Wages are growing at a healthy rate, and consumers are reaping the benefits of tax cuts and record-high stock prices. As long as the job market stays solid and inflation remains in check, we feel good about consumers’ prospects.

&gt; Still, there are growing signs of concern. While survey respondents have remained optimistic about present conditions, their outlook on future conditions has soured, according to the Conference Board. If consumers are feeling less confident about the future, they may be less inclined to spend and invest. That loss of confidence in the outlook could lead to economic weakness over time if consumers step back.

&gt; Overall, we would need to see more significant deterioration in consumer confidence before we would start to worry about the economic outlook.

personalfinance,Should I buy my 2015 Kia Optima at the end of the lease?,"Hey all, I could use some advice on what to do about my car situation.

I'm in my mid 20's and have been leasing a 2015 Kia Optima since 2016, the lease is up in January and the end of lease purchase option is about $11k. I only have 35k miles on the car, just got new brakes in July, and own a set of snow tires for it.

I am going to have over $11k in savings by the time that comes, so should I just buy it outright? I make about $4k a month after-tax and only have monthly expenses of $1.5k. I originally built up my savings as an emergency fund, but I have a very stable job and would be able to build it back up to have an emergency fund again after buying the car.

However, I also have about $60k in student loans at 5.5%. I have the minimum payments on auto debit and I usually put all my extra money towards the loans each month once I had my 3 months of savings built up, but I figured I would start saving a bit more since I knew I had to make a decision about cars soon.

My parents were the ones who leased the car for me so I haven't had to make any monthly payments on it, but I do pay my own car-insurance, they have leased cars as long as I can remember and are the kind of people who always want ""their next car"" when the lease is over. They only really think of cars in terms of monthly payments, not really the overall asset value. My dad seems to think I should be leasing another car, but I think that's just a stupid idea.

I'm not very knowledgeable about cars, I'm the kind of person who just wants to get from point A to point B and have a high enough safety rating on the car.

Does it make sense to pay $11k for it with all those facts considered, or should I look for a different used car? I try to be as frugal as I can, but I also feel that sometimes paying a little more for lower risk is worth it. Does it make sense to buy it outright opposed to dumping the money into my loans and having some kind of auto-loan or payment plan instead? I'm not sure what kind of interest rates auto-loans typically have, so I wasn't sure if it would be more or less than my student loans.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to give this a read, I appreciate it!",finance
personalfinance,Looking for an alternative to Ally Bank Savings with one specific feature,"Hello, I'm new to this reddit and I apologize if this question has been answered a hundred times before. I've been using Ally bank for a few years now, I know there are online savings account that offer a better interest rate than Ally but I've been sticking with Ally mainly because I like the website and mobile interface better than the other online savings accounts I've used. One thing in particular that I'm looking for is the ability to edit a scheduled transfer but NOT the recurring series of transfers.

For example, I have a recurring transfer going into my Ally account every week and, if for whatever reason, I need to alter the amount going into my Ally account next week, I can go in and and edit the amount for that particular transaction without altering my intended recurring transactions for the following weeks. It just makes it easier for me to not have to remember to go in and change my amount back to what I originally intended every time I need to change something.

Basically, I'm looking for another online savings account that offers the ability to edit one transfer or edit a recurring series when it comes to scheduled automatic transfers. If anyone can recommend an alternative to Ally that has that feature and offers a better interest rate it would be much appreciated. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Car payments or charles schwab?,"Hello. We purchased a 2017 ford escape titanium six months ago. We have had issues with it and we received a 75,000 mile/5 year premium care warranty for free from ford. I’m already above the bumper to bumper factory warranty. We have been trying to financially educate ourselves. Recently we have started to listen to Dave ramsey. I like the debt free idea that he talks about . My goal to get out of the car payments as soon as possible. When we purchased this car, we did not have a good understanding of interest rates. We are now in a position that we might be able to pay $7,000 ( our savings) to the car payment. Which I was considering instead of opening a charles schwab account with the $7,000. I’m assuming thats what dave ramsey would say based on his book, Total Money Makeover. 
We dont have a house payment because we are renting. We would love to be able to do that in the nearish future. I would rather reduce the car payments amount and the term of the loan; hopefully, to save for a down payment of a house. Please give us advice on how to deal with this financial situation. Should we pay the $7,000 towards the current principal which will make the loan around $10,00? Or should I put the $7,000 into a charles schwab account ? Or should I get another 7ish years old Honda? In this situation the negative equity will be added to the new loan which might be less. Please don’t judge us, we are just trying to get what best of this options. 
The only one advantage of our current car is the free warranty that will last for 2 years of now, but I don’t know if it is worth it. 

Loan details: $19250 , interest of 6.21 percent over 60 months. 
I have made six payments of $400 each month, which is over the original payment of $374. 
The car has 37,500 miles.",finance

personalfinance,Should I use IRAs to help accomplish my 5 year goals?,"**Current financial position:**

* 23, just graduated college, making $70k/year
* $25k saved, no debt. 75% of savings are invested (experienced with active investing)

**5 year financial goals:**

* 40% down payment for house
* $25k emergency fund
* Save 20% pre-tax income for 401k
* New car

I've been learning more about 401(k) and IRA accounts and trying to decide how to use them to meet my goals. What I can't really figure out is if IRAs could be useful to achieve my 5 year goals even though they're viewed as retirement savings vehicles.  My takeaway is that after 5 years you can withdraw $10k from both a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA tax/penalty free to be used for a first-time home purchase while withdrawals the Traditional IRA can also be used for medical expenses. It seems like these would be useful to help me achieve a 40% down payment on the house because I could withdraw that $20,000 tax/penalty free. The Traditional IRA being tax deductible like the 401k would be nice because I could totally exit from the 22% federal income bracket to the 12% bracket. The ability to withdraw early for medical emergencies also cushions my emergency fund. My general portfolio for these accounts would be market index ETFs and I would aim to contribute about $2,500/year to each. 

Is there anything wrong with using the IRAs this way? Is this not the best way for me to save for a down payment and build out my emergency fund?",finance

personalfinance,Sensible Car Purchases,"I've struggled a bit with the Dave Ramsey-ish approach to cars.  I understand his advice, but I keep favoring buying gently used cars (a few thousand less than new ones and maybe two years old) as opposed to a car that is several years old and around half the cost of a new one.  We drive our cars until they die, pretty much.  My last Honda Civic had 300,000 miles and was 9 years old when I gave up on it (I commute 60 miles each way to work).  Car interest rates are low (we have two payments, both right around 3.5% interest).  Why buy an old car that is going to wear out in four or five years versus a more expensive, but still sensible, gently used one that can last eight or nine?

I agree with him on lots of things, but with cars and low interest car loans I fall off the wagon a bit.  If I can save up $20,000 in cash, why not invest that money and take out a $20,000 car loan at 3.5% for 60 months?  Low interest car loans don't seem the same to me as higher interest credit card debt and other loans.  I mean, sure.  Save up $5K for a vacation rather than putting it on a credit card at 15% interest, but I don't get it with lower interest loans.

I'm even looking at this with other debt we have.  I consolidated a bunch of things onto a HELOC, which I am aggressively paying down.  We are also paying a student loan for one of our daughters (3.75%).  Once she's off the payroll, do we blast through the HELOC, or are we being dumb by not putting the extra cash we have into retirement savings (I'm 53 and plan to retire at 62).",finance
personalfinance,Can my universities health insurance company deny me medication refills while I'm on a school study abroad program? (international),"Hello,

I'm currently enrolled in University in the US. Prior to leaving for a study abroad program in Europe, I had insurance through the state because I have no income outside of a stipend from the federal government.

When I was accepted into the program, I was forced to pay for insurance from the school. I took out student loans to cover it. I have Ulcerative Colitis and I take an injection medication every two weeks that I was prescribed by my doctor under my previous health care plan. When I was enrolled in my school insurance, I was removed from my state plan. I got to the new country, saw a local doctor, and was prescribed the same medication. After filling it twice, I'm now being told by both the school administration and the health care company that they only cover 60 days worth of medication - the program itself is well over 60 days.

Additionally, I will be enrolled in an indepent study for an additional 6 weeks after the semester, still through my university. My school has told me that the 60 day limit is for the policy year and that I will need to procure my own insurance for this period.

Can anyone give me any advice or insight? Essentially I'm stuck abroad and about to be out of medication cold turkey that will land me in the hospital within days with no taper. I'm feeling very lost and defeated.",finance
personalfinance,Vanguard roth ira... need some guidance,"I'm 20 years old and just recently opened up a roth ira and put $500 on it. I poked around my account yesterday for a bit and am a bit overwhelmed on what to do next. I have a few questions, any help would be greatly appreciated. 

\- I logged on today and somehow got a ""Dividend 							 								  
VANGUARD FEDERAL MONEY MARKET FUND (Settlement Fund)"" of $0.43... What? I haven't even bought anything yet... When setting up my account I chose to reinvest my dividends, so that $0.43 was reinvested and I now have $500.43.  Still confused as to where I received the $0.43 from. 

\- When I go to the buy and sell screen, there's three sections, and I click on the center one ""Trade ETFs or stocks."" But, when I enter what I've heard are great index funds, like VTSAX and VFIAX, it says ""The symbol you've entered is for a Vanguard mutual fund."" But, I've heard that mutual funds have higher fees and such... If someones had experience with vanguard, is the 1st of three options titled ""Invest with Vanguard mutual funds"" the right place to click to buy index funds? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just really don't know. 

\- Graham Stephan made a video on index funds and laid out this:

 \* US Stocks: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) 

\* International Stocks: Vanguard Total International Index Fund (VTIAX) 

\* Bonds: Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)

Should I follow this three fund portfolio for my age? What percentage of each do I invest in?

I plan on putting another $3,500 on my account soon, but need some help with getting started out. I just don't want to screw anything up, and want to ride the wave of the stock market until I retire. Any help or advice would be awesome, sorry for typing so much. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"I live on my own, but I have 2 student loans that’s killing me financially. What’s the best plan of action for my situation?","I have 2 student loans . One is with Nelnet ( formerly with Greatlakes ) . Due to some family situations, I been putting it on foreberance for years and years and over a decade to be honest. Now that I have come to by senses I am seeing that my loans have ballooned up to 59k and that’s just with Nelnet. What’s really getting on my nerves is the interest rate is $10/month. Don’t get me wrong- This is all my fault. I should have taken responsibility , but I didn’t . But I want to make it right , now. Do the right thing..

I have my 2nd loan with Navient. This one is not that horrific. It’s about 7k at 11% int. rate.

I was just speaking with a Nelnet customer service rep and she recommended that I put my account on a 3 month forbearance. I have used up ALL my forbearance so she was helping me out with a 3 months discretionary forbearance. I am thankful, but the interest rate is murder at this point. $10 / day = $300 / mo.

My monthly due for Nelnet is $433 and Navient is $100.

Now she advised that I consolidate my debt, but I don’t want to consolidate my Navient with Nelnet because Navient has as cosigner and I don’t want her on my loan. So I am trying to get her off my loan first of all. 

I guess my question is, is consolidation a good idea ? Will it help with interest rate or just with the monthly payment part? Also, would it be a good idea to consolidate both Nelnet ( 59k) and Navient ( 7k) or should I pay off Navient first and then tackle Nelnet with a passion? Can someone with experience let me know? I am sick of having this student loan hanging over my head.

I make around 85k per annum and I live in a $500 room so I can save money. But it’s not really helping when I have $300 /mo adding up just in interest alone.",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a HELOC from Figure.com?,"My home is currently valued at $130k and I still owe $68K on it. I currently make about $38k gross a year and am recently engaged. I've already put a deposit on the wedding venue two months ago and then my fiance lost his job. He hasn't found another job yet and and we are starting to panic. He had no personal debt or car payment, but I do. The past year was not great with having to put $7000 into my roof that the HO insurance wouldn't cover, then a new water heater and AC unit (fantastic month, that was) and two $3K root canals with caps. I had no dental insurance and have learned to just pay for a single plan. I already had a small amount of credit card debt before all this, so it is currently about $31K worth in credit card debt one two cards. One is 16.99% APR for 9K and the other is $22K for 14% APR. I pay over 1K a month toward paying them both down, but all it seems to be doing is keeping me afloat as gas, car insurance, and food for two people take up the rest of my take home pay. 

I got one of those offers in the mail from [Figure.com](https://Figure.com) and decided to fill it out to see what I could get. They are offering me 7.5% APR for a 10 year loan of $35K, which I could use to consolidate the debt of my two cards and finish paying for the wedding venue so I don't worry about it anymore. I would have a monthly payment of about $460 per month, which is way less than I'm currently paying on my cards and there is no penalty for paying it off early. I don't care if it impacts my credit score (Fico says 748, Experian says 706, I'm not sure why they're so different) because I'm not planning on opening any new credit cards or buying another house, ever. I don't want to postpone the wedding or do a courthouse wedding as I've already put money and planning into it. I know I'm being prideful about this.

My job is secure and it's just a matter of time before my fiance finds another job, so we'll be much better off after that, but the interest rates for my current cards are too high and they say they won't lower the APR while I have an open balance. I have too much of a debt-to-income ratio to get a new card with a decent APR and there's no way I can pay off a balance transfer in less than a year for a 0% APR offer.

Do you guys think I should bite the bullet and do the HELOC loan?",finance
personalfinance,Potential Downsides to Refinancing Student Loans Periodically,"From what I can tell based on my research, besides the hit from the hard check, theres nothing wrong with refinancing if you get a lower rate, even if it's only been a few months. Am I missing something? Why not just refinance every few months if you can shave a few tenths of a percent each time?

Numbers: refinanced my ~$100k in July at ~5% for 15 years, so ~$800/mo. Seeing new offers for 4.5-4.6% that would save me about $50/mo. I have a 760 credit score. My salary is ~$80k/yr.

I don't anticipate needing any new lines of credit for at least 5 years because I won't be buying a new car or house any time soon. I don't need any new credit cards either. I've read that the hard check only stays on my record for a year. Should I be refinancing again? If the market were to go up or down next year, would these interest rate offers also change in a way that would benefit or hurt my situation?

Just trying to wrap my head around the situation. $50/mo isn't much, but I'd rather have it than give it someone else.

Thanks in advance for the input.",finance
