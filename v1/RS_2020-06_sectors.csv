personalfinance,Understanding “standard allocation” of student loan payments during forbearance?,"Like many others, I’m in forbearance on my student loans through November. My servicer is Great Lakes. Thankfully, the pandemic hasn’t affected my financial situation so I am using forbearance to pay as much of my loans off as possible while interest is at 0%. 

I was looking at my May payment made while in forbearance (0% interest) and noticed that under “standard allocation”, my payments were still being applied across all of my loans despite them having no accrued interest. I understand why this would happen during normal circumstances, as it would stop a lot of interest from accruing. But now that interest is at 0%, shouldn’t my whole payment automatically be going toward the one with the highest interest rate? 

Since it wasn’t doing this under “standard allocation”, I changed my upcoming payment for June to “custom allocation” with all of the “excess” payment (I believe this should be all the payment during forbearance?) going toward my highest interest rate loan. 

Am I missing something here in the way that allocation and payments work during forbearance? Everything I hear is that the highest interest rate should be targeted first, and I’m surprised that the standard allocation from Great Lakes wasn’t doing this already.",finance
personalfinance,Money Markets v High Yield Savings Account,"Hello Personal Finance!

I've been saving money in a savings account with a credit union. It's been good so far, but only earns 0.14% interest. As the sum of money in that account has grown, I'd like to make my money work a bit harder than that - particularly for my emergency fund and near term goals that require liquidity (travel, future down payments, and the like). 

In my research I've found Money Market Accounts and High Yield Savings Accounts as high interest options that retain liquidity. Based on what I've read, money market accounts sounds like a great deal (high interest rate, access to money like a savings account, ability to contribute over time). I don't know anyone that uses Money Market accounts to save and I'm wondering why. Is there a problem with these accounts or some reason not to use them?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Are my NSQO taxes (estate) going to be a lot?,"My father passed away two weeks ago. He had 4.0 MM in his company stock (3.3 in Options and 700 in RSU's)

I was looking at financial advisors and interviewing a few. I just got an email from one saying most likely the 3.3 MM was untaxed and is considered NQSO where I would essentially not receive a step up cost basis for the stock. In short it would be a mix of standard income taxes and capital gains taxes.

The company requires me to sell within 18 months and the upcoming months may not be beautiful for the market (let alone one single stock).

Without trying to go into massive details about the exact taxation- my understanding is pretty much any income above 500/600 K and Im paying the full tax rate. Living in California between federal and state (37+13.3% +fica ) and Im looking at 52-55%. Thats basically 1.6 million gone down the drain in taxes.

**My question is- before I hire a financial advisor who claims they can help divide the sale of the stocks (with a huge risk of it going up or down a lot) over the next 18 months, how can they save me any money when I am already going to be crossing the max income tax bracket no matter what?**

How can capital gains even be involved (or is capital gains going to raise my tax rate even more)

ALSO- will moving out of state (CA) help me save the 13.3% tax I am about to have to pay in this case?",finance
financialindependence,Why I think people should strongly consider a 2% SWR (serious),"tl;dr Compared to historical data, inflation-adjusted interest rates on bonds and cash are at all time lows, about 2.5% below historic average. Given the lower expected returns on this portion of our portfolios, we should adjust our SWRs accordingly. Especially given the high CAPE ratios we're seeing in stocks.

[I created a chart that shows, by decade, inflation adjusted interest rates on treasury bonds, CDs, and 3-mo t-bills (which high yield MMAs track very closely)](https://imgur.com/a/ctkdL2v). Comparing interest rates from 1960-2000 with  2010-today, bonds are providing inflation adjusted interest rates 2% - 3% lower now than they used to, and cash equivalents (CDs and high yield MMAs) are 2.5% - 3.5% lower. Today, real yields on cash and government bonds are negative. [Go to the treasuries website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield) and you'll see that they're offering inflation protected securities with negative interest rates!

Additionally, CAPE ratios suggest stock returns over the next 10 years of 1.5% (-3% to 6% range). Check out [figure 3 in this Barrons article](https://www.brandes.com/docs/default-source/brandes-institute/2018/the-cape-ratio-and-future-returns-a-note-on-market-timing.pdf)to see what 10-year returns followed previous times when the CAPE was at this level (it's currently 28). CAPE isn't a perfect predictor, but it isn't terrible either. And it's worth noting that, despite the stock market having a long term average return of 7%, it has never returned over 7% during a 10 year period immediately following a CAPE ratio over 25 . This especially makes sense as the record low bond yields are driving money away from bonds and into stocks, which has driven up stock prices and lowers stock yields.

A 3.5% SWR is generally suggested for a 50 year retirement window. But, the most relevant data suggests cash, bond, and equity will all yield below their historic averages for the foreseeable future.  But if our portfolios are yielding 2% - 3% less than they historically have, then SWRs should be lowered 1.5% - 2% to account for it.

A few examples: let's say you want your portfolio to last exactly 50 years. If you were all cash in the 90s, you got a return of about 2%, and a withdrawal rate of 3.1% would last you 50 years; but today's rates are about -1.5%, and you'd need a withdrawal rate of 1.3% to last 50 years. If you were all treasury bonds in the 90s, you got a return of about 3.5%, and a withdrawal rate of 4.2% would last you 50 years; but today rates are about -0.5%, and you'd need a withdrawal rate of 1.7% to last 50 years.",finance

personalfinance,Please Help! Advice is Greatly Appreciated! (Phishing Victim),"A few nights ago, I fell victim to phishing. At the time, I thought that my actions were beneficial to my security; I thought that I was doing the right thing when in reality, I was doing the complete opposite. The scammer, claiming to work for a company, sent me several receipts in the form of emails for purchases that I never made. With each email, the scammer gave me a link to cancel these false purchases. The link sent me to a form that I was supposed to fill out to ""verify"" that I was who I claimed to be through a website that looked extremely similar to the authentic company's website. Looking back, there were so many signs that this was a scam, yet because of my anxious and upset stage, I didn't notice any of them until it was too late. After every page on the form, you had to click a 'continue' button. I gave away my first name, the first letter of my last name, my address, my email address, my phone number, and yes, unfortunately, my entire SSN. I clicked the 'continue' button, and that sent me to the next page, which asked for credit card information. I then exited out of the tab and never completed the form. I'm almost certain that the scammer(s) still obtained my information, regardless of whether I completed the form or not. I realized almost immediately afterward that I had been phished. I was very emotional for the rest of the night, trying to figure out what I could do to resolve the issue while trying not to mentally kick myself.

Now that you know the context, this is what I did to try to resolve the issue. I have changed any passwords that were affiliated with the authentic company. I tried to create an account with the Social Security Administration, however, because I *do not* have an employment history *nor* do I own any credit or debit cards, I could not complete an account with them. That is entirely my fault. After realizing this, I went to the Federal Trade Commission and received a recovery plan based on my situation and filed a complaint against the person(s) that are phishing. I understand that most people recommend placing a credit freeze (this is suggested by the FTC, as well), but because I *have never* had a bank account in my name, which means I *do not* have a credit score, I obviously cannot do that. Not having a credit score also means that I cannot file an identity theft report to any of the three credit bureaus.

I am hoping to have a job soon so I can create a bank account, finish creating an account with the SSA, obtain a credit score, closely monitor my monthly statements, and so on. My questions are: Am I doing all that I can be doing, given my circumstances? Am I on the right path? I've heard before that if you don't have much to offer (in other words, not much to lose) your level of severity with identity theft decreases. Is that true? I know that what I've done is still extremely dangerous, and as I mentioned earlier, I deeply regret my past choices. I have learned several things from this experience and because of that, I will always be vigilant and I will never let this happen again. I will follow the recommendations given to me by the FTC. I ask that everyone remains respectful in the comments. I apologize for such a long message. I truly hope that someone will offer advice. Thank you and remember to be safe!",finance

personalfinance,Are mutual funds too good to be true?,"Hey everyone.

I recently turned 18 so I’ve been investing in stocks a bit and opened a Roth IRA. 

After a bit of research, I decided that one of the mutual funds I should invest in is FOCPX, which has an average annual return of 17% for the past ten years, and a quarter-end average annual return of almost 15%. 

I pulled up a calculator and decided to be a bit more conservative and go with a 13% interest rate on $300 with an additional $750 yearly for 42 years (until I’m 60). The result was a little over a million dollars (though that interest rate may still be too high).

Now of course this could be inaccurate because the markets could change a lot and large company growth could slow compared to the rest of the NASDAQ, but this seems like a really large amount of money that I’d be able to pull out, especially once I start making actual money and can deposit to the max when I’m a bit older. However, this still kinda seems to be too good to be true. Is it? Am I missing something?",finance
Banking,"Navy federal, EIDL Loan Funds, Frozen Account.","# UPDATE: JULY 11,2020

# THIS MORNING ALL MY AND BROTHER IN LAW ACCOUNTS SHOWED BACK UP. UNFROZEN. 42 DAYS AFTER THEY FROZE THEM.

HI,

I live in TX and my sister and brother in law live in NY. I asked them to come and stay with us here in TX since NY was becoming hot spot for Covid-19 back in march.

They came to TX middle of march, April 1st I and my brother in law applied for EIDL loan/grant.

Fast forward to 05/18 both loans approved. Mine was $150,000. and his was $87,500, he is sole prop.

In SBA portal we both had our bank validation failed message even thou the information was correct.

we both changed the accounts to Navy federal accounts and it was verified in portal and the error message was gone.

On 05/21 we both got the deposits into out NFCU accounts , the loan amounts plus 1K grant for him and 6k grant for me in addition to loan amounts in separate deposit.

And this was all happening on my personal home computer, I and him used same computer to log into navy account to check if money has deposited. My brother in law immediately paid one of his client for $7000from nfcu account, and it went thru.

Next day i tried to log into my nfcu account and it was locked/frozen, brother in law checked his and it was also frozen, i called nfcu and call was sent to fraud dept. where i spoke to Worlds Last Unpleasant and rude lady.

she said my computer is being used for multiple accounts, i said YES because my brother in law used it and he is right here next to me , and explained why he is here, and handed the phone to my brother in law, The lady said she can not speak to him since he did not call, Okay ..back to me. She asked what are those large deposits and where they came from, I told her AS she can see they are from US govt. EIDL funds, she asked what is that... i explained what Govt. program it was, but she replied , that she has no idea what i am talking about, and she was being very suspicious of these funds.

Then she started to ask me about my business , where its located, its in NY, she said but you are in TX, i replied yes to that.( she thinks you can not live in one state and have business in other ).

By now i felt i was being grilled by some SBA investigator regarding my loan and business.

I told her to google EIDL or ask her superiors... she got offended and said SIRR i am going to investigate this matter , and you accounts will be frozen until it completes. I asked her time frame and she said there is no time frame, i tried to explain to her that these funds are very crucial for us, we need to pay our obligations, we been waiting for funds for long and such, She cut me off and said your accounts are in investigation.

so now both me and my brother in law are without funds and to make things worst she went ahead and cancelled the payment what my brother in law had made day before. Looks like we may survive this covid-19 , but wont survive because of this Lady.

Going into branch did not help, since she became the investigator on out accounts and no one but her can make changes to our accounts.

we both have great credit, no missed payments as of yet, and we both have credit cards from NFCU with $0 balance.

Sorry for the long post, wanted to explain full details. Anyone went thru similar situation?

Even if she closes our accounts , what happens to our funds? Looks like she has already made her mind that we are fraud, and we are trying to screw us govt. and her bank.

Thank you for reading and TIA for your input.",finance

personalfinance,Graduate School Loan Strategy Help,"Finished up grad school and will be starting work in the next month. I have a cumulative of $47,500 in loans that were provided directly by my university (so they are not federal loans). The nice thing about this loan when I took it out was that it has been interest free during school and will continue to be interest free for another 28 months that I am working. The bad thing is that it goes up to 7.5% interest after the grace period. I have separate federal loans is well that I will be paying with income drive repayment plan like REPAYE (and possibly looking to qualify for PSLF down the road). Regarding the university loan, should I aim to tackle some of it while it is interest free? I did some calculations to see how much I could save by paying principal down aggressively now vs not paying anything until the interest free period is over as well as shortening the payback period. A brief summary of the realistic extremes are in the table below and would appreciate any insight on a strategy, including if it's better to hold on to the money initially and put it towards low risk investments.

Initial Loan Balance: $47,500

Interest Rate: 7.5% (after the 28 month grace period with no interest)

Required Payback period: 10 years (after the 28 month grace period with no interest)

personalfinance,Advice for rebuillding credit for grad student,"I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program and I'd like to start repairing my credit. I got my Equifax report and my current debts are:

* $12,652 in student loans through Navient, which include $5.5k subsidized, 2 x $2.5k subsidized from undergrad and $2k unsubsidized from last year. They're not currently collecting interest since I'm still in school, though the $2k unsubsidized had some interest applied to it for what appears to be two months.
* $1,530 in outstanding credit card debt to Wells Fargo. It's been listed as 'charge-off' since June 2016. It is not in collections.

I have some money saved up beyond an emergency fund and I'd like to start making some payments and settling this debt. Here are my questions:

* I want to negotiate a settlement with Wells-Fargo, but I've heard that they typically don't do a pay-for-delete. I'm new to this and unsure - do I just call them up at their credit card department, ask to speak to their collections people, and say something along the lines of [this script](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/akfnjx/debt_collection_negotiation_script/)? When I ask for the offer in writing, am I supposed to wait for it to arrive in the mail before I send a check? Or can I bring it in to a local Wells Fargo branch?
* ~~Does that sound right that I was charged a little interest on my $2k unsubsidized loan? Besides that $152 (which appears to be two interest charges), there hasn't been any more interest on that loan. I've been continuously enrolled full-time in school since 2013.~~   
**UPDATE:** I was confused by the current interest statement that listed 0.00% interest for all of my loans. This was because Navient suspended all interest through September due to the pandemic. Thanks /u/aurora-_!
* I want to start making $100 repayments to the student loans through Navient. There doesn't seem to be an option to set up auto-pay through their website, and the federal loan calculator didn't seem to offer a way to do that. Am I supposed to just submit manual payments each month? And more, more generally, is this a good idea? Or should I look to get a credit card after settling with Wells Fargo instead?

Any other general tips or suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Large Student Loan Debt, which to tackle first?","Good afternoon all, long time lurker first time poster. So here is our situation. My wife and I have a crazy amount of student loan debt. We don't have any issues paying it but we are trying to pay it off as soon as possible. I have about $75k in refinanced private student loans. My wife has 125k in refinanced private student loans and $75k in federal student loans. My wife's $75k in federal student loans have the highest interest rate. 

We have have been putting money away in a seperate account to pay off one of these loans in one fell swoop and we are at about $70k so we are close. My question is, which one of these should we tackle? My initial thought it to go after the $75k Federal student loan because the interest rate is so high but with all of this talk about student loan forgiveness I don't want to kick myself because I pay it off and then in two years they forgive federal student loans.

Any advice would be very helpful. Thank you.",finance

stocks,Portfolio thoughts??,"For reference, I am 20 years old, from the UK, and planning to invest 2000 upfront and then add to this monthly.  


Thoughts and advice are much appreciated (weightings are approximate)  


Vangaurd FTSE all-world ETF (VWRL) 55%: I chose this ETF for global diversification, even though the returns on this are largely from S&amp;P500 and tech companies by diversifying it offsets risk and offsets if tech do badly. I know I have a weighting towards the US however, i'm not really that convinced about the strength of the UK economy/value of the £ in the next few years. So, not too keen on tilting towards the UK (but there is a currency risk). Returns are modest, but I wanted the possibility of making more so i've added the EQQQ. Big fund size, lots of liquidity etc  


Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF (EQQQ), 30%: I added this mainly for returns, growth and value, heavy on tech but has around 40% in other sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples and biotech, and with it including the biggest tech companies, I see it being able to innovate during this COVID-19 crisis, and beyond. Returns are what primarily boost the VWRL and the S&amp;P 500, Hence the inclusion. I don't see a lot of these companies going anywhere soon, and seem to have bounced back from the crisis very well. Big fund size, lots of liquidity etc  


Vanguard global aggregate bond, hedged to GBP (VAGP), 15%: Mainly to offset risk, worried about this since its only been around for a year so may not have great liquidity, (and the possibility of negative interest rates?). But would allow me to rebalance if a second hit to the stock market comes around. Added the global aspect just to get a wide range of yields, and if one country defaults it offsets the effect by having other countries in the bond etf. Also, yields may get a lot higher since governments have been racking up debt recently, so could offer some higher returns, hedged to gbp to offset currency risk

personalfinance,Annuity vs paying off mortgage,"I have a condo with a mortgage that I owe about $37k on. If I keep making payments normally, it'll be paid off in 6.5 years. The interest rate is 3.75% and last month $115 of my payment went towards interest. I have the money in savings to pay it off and if I do so now, it will save me about $4700. But, I can't cash out the $37k until I sell the condo, which I wasn't planning to do any time soon.

On the other hand, I can take that same $37k and put it into lifetime income annuity that will pay $111/mth. That will more than cover the interest for the life of the loan and the payments would be guaranteed until the principal is returned--about 27 years, and coincidentally about retirement age for me. I know annuity returns are poo poo, but so are rates on CDs and pretty much every other safe investment. 

So, thoughts on one vs the other, or maybe some other option that won't give me an ulcer worrying about the markets?",finance
personalfinance,Should I take a mortgage when I can pay in cash?,"I am 30 y.o., I am making about 30x more than the average salary in my country. I want to invest my money and buy an apartment, it costs about the same as I make in one year. I already have savings from the last year to pay in cash.

I can take a mortgage for 30 years with an interest rate of 2%, Then, I need to pay only 20% of the value in cash.

So I was thinking, that if I use my current cash to get mortgages on five similar apartments, and rent them, the rent can cover the mortgage payments, and in 30 years, I will have five apartments and no debts.

What would you recommend me to do? The math says clearly, that it makes more sense to go for a mortgage. But I never had any credits or any other debts, and it just feels a bit weird to me. Also, does it make sense to have a mortgage for an amount, which I can make in a year? I will buy 5 apartments every year. In 20 years, I will have 100 apartments.

Forex,If the American &amp; Canadian Stock Markets Crash.... Forex?,"Hello, I'm a newbie investor. I've been hearing a lot about how the stock markets are being supported by printed money in both USA and Canada, while they try to keep everyone afloat during these strange times. There are growing whispers that many other newbie investors are entering the markets and are being fed false hope about easy gains as the market recovers, when the real crash is potentially yet to come. Also, the printed money is going to lead to inflation, but there's a lag time before we feel the effects. So I've been wondering, with both a stock market crash, and the effects of inflation just around the corner, is using FOREX a viable strategy to protect my money?

For example, if I converted all my CAD to the South Korean Wan, before the inflation hits, and assuming business proceeds more or less as usual in South Korea, would that be a way to protect my money? I'm a noob so I'm hoping someone can point out any fatal flaws in this idea....

BTW, the only thing I know about south Korea is that their unemployment numbers are LOW, their covid cases are LOW, and their lock down restrictions, relative to Canada/USA are LOW, meaning their economy probably won't be hit as hard as others.

Is converting to a ""stable"" foreign currency a good way to protect my unstable currency?",finance

stocks,This is why stocks are going up,"I get it, many people are scratching their heads over why the stock market keeps going up, including professionals. They point to the terrible economic numbers and worsening social situation. But they are missing the point.

The stock market is going up because the value of the US currency, relative to productive assets, is going down. When the Fed prints trillions, and the amount of assets stays the same or declines at a rate lower than the increase in currency, this inflate asset prices. It's not captured in inflation numbers because of the way CPI is calculated and because of how these new supply of currency is distributed. We saw this after the financial crisis -- not much inflation in consumer goods, but massive inflation in housing and the stock market.

The stock market will continue to go up as long as the Fed continues to increase the supply of currency faster than the decline in earnings.

Source: me. I manage money.

\*\*\*

Edit: Also look at gold, for example GLD. It's going up. All limited assets are going up because the USD is losing value. Since the USD is a key reserve currency with \~ 2/3 share, a lot of foreigners are subsidizing US asset owners. I learned this from Ray Dalio.

Also, I don't like gold. Why? Because its value as a currency &amp; store of value has greatly been reduced by innovation in financial technology. What are you going to do, pay with gold? I don't think so. It is my view that equities of top tier companies, given it's liquidity and scarcity, is a better store of value and a better currency than gold.

Again, the world isn't crazy, most people just don't understand that currencies are being devalued relative to securities.

\*\*\*

Edit 2: So why are riots good for the market. One, it limits the US government's ability to escalate geopolitical issues, which means less screwing around with the supply chain, which is good for large cap stocks, which drives the indices that we call ""the market"". Two, unrest will incentivize the government to stimulate on the monetary and fiscal front.

\*\*\*

Edit 3: I read every comment and there are a lot of confusion out there. A big one is that many are still holding on to the traditional definition of inflation, as in the CPI, which is a basket of goods and services. Yes, CPI does not suggest we are having inflation in the narrow way inflation is defined by it. When the Fed, for example, buys treasuries, they create new money which is deposited in the bank account of the treasury seller. These treasury sellers tend to be large institutions and very wealthy people, so they are not spending that money on goods and services (i.e. CPI items) but instead using that money to buy investment assets (corporate bonds, stocks, gold, etc -- which are NOT CPI items). This is why price for goods and services are not rising as fast as the price of investment assets.

The second confusion is if the USD is losing value, why is it appreciating against other currencies. I am strictly talking about USD losing value relative to assets like corporate equity, so it is a totally different matter. The USD vs. other currencies is huge topic that I can't possibly cover here. Basically, the USD, as the dominant reserve currency backed by the biggest and most stable economy, is viewed as a safe haven so demand for USD increases when risk increases. So although the Fed is printing a lot of money, in the short term, demand for USD relative to other currencies still leads to the strengthening of the dollar. Also keep in mind that several other developed countries, for example Japan, have negative rates. So although the USD strengthens against other currencies, it weakens relative to investment assets -- hence asset price inflation.

financialindependence,Thoughts and decisions that led to debt free with paid off mortgage in early 30’s,"My wife and I are early 30’s, have worked hard, caught good breaks, delayed gratification, and have paid off student loans and our mortgage. We are now debt free and own our home outright. 

I realized if you want something different than everyone around you, you will have to do things differently. This may lead to people calling you frugal, or saying you shouldn’t pay off your mortgage. 

Each choice I have made to attack debt or not take on new debt has led to the next, and once you pay off debt it impacts your decision making moving forward. You really don’t want to take on any more debt. It is too much work to pay it off to go through it again. 

I realized after graduation that paying off my student debt in 3 years instead of 15-30 will save $100k +. Lifetime earnings are finite. I turned down my ego, moved in with my parents, worked and worked overtime and put everything I made towards my student loans for 3 years. 

Sacrifice: living with parents for 3 years and driving a $3,500 car while most people in my cohort were living on their own and driving nicer cars

Luck: having parents willing to let me live with them.

I met my now wife, bought an inexpensive home. We continued to drive inexpensive cars and contributed to 401ks / HSAs. Extra money was put in stock for down payment for next house. 

$100k more or less on a new mortgage at ~3% does not change the monthly obligation drastically- it is so easy to take on a big mortgage with today’s rates. I realized the true game changer for us is not having a mortgage. We decided to use the money saved to payoff our current house instead of upgrading to one that would take us 15-20 years to pay off.  It is amazing how much money you pay in interest on a $300k-500k mortgage over a 15 or 20 year period, even with low interest rates. If you think that this is “free money” you probably have not met a banker. Banks are rich off this. 

I don’t necessarily want to retire early. I don’t want a second home. It just puts a huge smile on my face knowing that I am actively choosing to go to work every day and I have no debt / financial obligations. It is really a much more carefree existence, and exponentially more so than when I had “most” of my mortgage paid down. Being grateful for what you have every day and realizing that even owning a car is a luxury in this world is helpful in getting there and avoiding upgrade-itis. Marie Kondo is also helpful- sell the stuff you don’t use and need. Ask yourself- is this item you have or want something you want to take with you into the next part of your life?

Hope this inspires others to do the same, or whatever makes them happy

Edit: this forum cracks me up. I posted here because this forums definition of financial independence is “not having to work for money.” To me, this is different than debt optimization or leverage. If you have a huge mortgage and are choosing not to pay it off despite having significant investment income, the markets will dictate your level of FI at any given time. Are you wealthy? Maybe. Will your money earn more this way over your lifetime? Possibly, or even probably. Do you own your house? No, the bank does. Does a large market downturn mean you are walking around with your pants around your ankles, like a clown? If so, then no, you are not financially independent.",finance

personalfinance,"Advice needed for couple needing to purchase a vehicle AND looking to buy a home in 6-12months, HELP","Hi all finance geniuses.  I feel like I am in a conundrum and do not know what is the best route forward and would love some financial advice..

**Set-up**:   
My longterm live-in boyfriend and I (not married but together for 5 years and serious) are both 30 years old and we currently share a vehicle.  The vehicle is very old (ie. 2008 with 120K miles on it)  It's still running but...she's rough and there is a clearly front-end axle issue I've had to get fixed a couple times in past 1.5yrs. Because my boyfriend is frequently on the road (in normal times), he decided to sell his car last year and paid off some remaining debt, thus why we only have one car and it works fine.  Given the nature of the world right now and me having a good secure full-time job during all of it, my biggest thought/goal is I feel like it would be a wasted opportunity to not purchase a house.  It would be my first home purchase as I've always rented and something I've always desired.  I've also ALWAYS been interested in investment properties/real estate/flipping houses.

**Next, our Financial landscape:**  
Me:  I have a full-time job making 70K at a creative agency.   
Boyfriend: works in the music industry for 3/4 of the year touring with a big artist (obviously COVID brought that all to a screeching halt) and normally makes around $1,500/wk the months he's working (ie. 8-9 months of every year) so he makes around 50K/yr.

**Savings:**   
We are not great at saving (oops)   
Me:  I have around 5K in my savings and do have a 401K and such but personal savings, only 5K.    
Boyfriend:  My boyfriend has about 2K in savings, no 401K or retirement

**Debt**:   
Mine: I have a one time loan sitting at 17K (this was a 20K loan to consolidate 3 credit cards worth of debt) with a fixed interest rate of 5% which I'm aggressively paying off. I also have around 6K left in school loans and that is all my debt. (paid off my 2008 car last year and do not have a mortgage or anything)  
Boyfriend:  zero debt other than around 12K or so in college loans.

**Credit Scores:**  
Mine: 805  
Boyfriends: 587

**Conundrum**:  
Obviously we would use me to purchase a home as my credit score is way better.  But here is our issue..We really need a different car in the very near future.  So what do we do?  
Do we go to a dealership, negotiate (I'm thinking 20K max) for a new small SUV that we know won't cause us issues for years and fits our adventurous/outdoor lifestyle and put the loan in my boyfriend's name even though his credit isn't great.  
We would also trade in my car (we've been told we'll get about 3K for it and can put down probably 2-3K) We can then split the car payment.  
*Positives*: I keep my debt low which makes me look better to a bank for a loan and my boyfriend's credit score ideally goes up with the car loan in his name. We have a great car with most likely no issues for a while.  
*Negatives*: High car payment that will affect our aggressive down payment saving goals for a house plan.

OR

We go to a used car lot or facebook or wherever (my bf is good at wheelin' and dealin') and we trade in or sell my car to buy a used car for almost pure cash (ie.  6-8K) that is better condition than mine but old and then keep aggressively saving for a down payment on the house.  We worry about a nicer, newer car in a year or two.

OR

I purchase a vehicle in my name (15-20K max) and get a great interest rate and me and my boyfriend still split the payment.  
*Positives*: we get a great interest rate bc of my credit score and have a great car with ideally no issues for a while.  
*Negatives*: My debt increases and I possibly look unattractive to a bank for a house loan and the car payment could affect saving as much as we wanted.  


HELP. I don't know what is the best move financially to make knowing that I'd like to potentially buy a house within the next 12months and I'm also desperate to help my boyfriend improve his credit score.. but maybe that should be as simple as signing him up for a credit card?

Also something to note: my boyfriend is currently on unemployment due to COVID and will be until probably mid July?   We're obviously unsure when tours and stuff will start back but he does have enough skills to go get jobs in the landscaping or golf world when needed but the money will obviously not be as good.

**Any thoughts or advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED.**  


*TL;DR*  
My boyfriend and I need a car AND would like to purchase a home within the next 6-12 months.  I have a way better credit score than my boyfriend with a steady job (he however, works in music and COVID is causing us problems there) so I'm unsure who should purchase what.",finance

personalfinance,$20K balance on 22% card -- disagreement over whether to transfer to other debt,"Situation: 
$20K balance on 22% CC w/ $25K limit; 
$0 balance on 7.98% credit union CC w/ $7K limit;
$0 balance on 9.78% credit union personal line of credit w/ $5K limit

A few questions:
*note: balance transfer would be free with my credit union

- If we move the debt from one spot to the other and max out both credit union lines of credit, would that negatively impact our credit score? The overall utilization is the same, but two lines would be used at max rate.

- Is this a good use of a personal line of credit? What are the drawbacks?

- Would it be smart to get a personal loan for the rest of the balance if I can secure a good interest rate? Specifically, is there a difference on your credit score having a credit card debt vs a personal loan?

On filing, i listed this as “any moneys received that have not been disclosed.” I wrote that i received a check as a result of an audit

I have since not received unemployment for almost 2 weeks now, with zero communication until today, when i finally called. Guy i was speaking with didn’t seem very knowledgable, but speculated that the amount i received was nearly 3x the amount of my unemployment, so i might not receive unemployment for up to 3 weeks...

How does that make any sense? This is clearly money i had earned while i was working and am entitled to, and should have received before this point. So now that my job has been audited i get punished? Even then, how does that affect multiple weeks of unemployment, when i only listed it for one week on my claim?

Any help would be great. Is this normal? Should this affect my state unemployment and not the $600 federal sum? Will three weeks of unemployment be affected or just 1?",finance

Let me be clear; I plan to make changes. Many very comfortable senior execs have already made it clear they do not intend to make it easy for me to disrupt the ease of their current situation, and have already taken steps to delay my start date.

My questions are these: how do I politically approach the changes I wish to make? How do I ensure my promotion start date is not postponed indefinitely? Most importantly, how do I do so without seeming like the silver-spoon-fed daughter of the CEO?

TL;DR: Advice for the daughter of the CEO soon starting work in the corporate office. How do I handle improving the culture without making the VPs angry?",finance

politics,Megathread: President Donald Trump Mobilizes Military Amid National Unrest,"President Trump announced from the White House Rose Garden Monday evening that he is ""mobilizing all available federal resources, civilian and military"" to stop violent protests across the country, decrying ""professional anarchists, looters, criminals, antifa and others"" whose actions have ""gripped"" the nation.

In order to deploy U.S. active-duty personnel to conduct law enforcement on American soil, the president must invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act. It has been used several times in U.S. history, including by President George H.W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.

Economics,Fed Balance Sheet Exploding !!,,finance
personalfinance,I've slacked on doing my taxes and have an issue I need help with regarding the state taxes sheet.,"I've had an issue regarding TurboTax which I've been having for at least a month now, but have only recently realize why exactly it might exist. Under the subcategory in which you square away all of your state taxes, I messed up by not realizing the difference between my literal home and my ""home of residence."" I, physically being housed in NC, should actually have been filing for WA.

Now, the big issue is that TurboTax in not letting me go back and fix my errors. I have scrounged around, going over each document and link, and have had no leeway in undoing these tax sheets. I finally decided I would resort to ""starting over"" by means of the ""Clear and Start Over"" button hidden under the Tax Tools tab, but for some reason it will not let me (it says once you register your tax return you can't start over. I don't remember ""registering"" anything. Does this mean it's too late to go back, even if I tried some alternate method like going to a physical office - would they find out about that?)

There is one other very large problem I'm facing (though I'd be very happy alone just for now to have the above solved): when trying to file (as I have ignorantly tried this before realizing my state taxes were done wrong (perhaps to my benefit)), the site stops me, directing me to my federal form W-2. It says my zip code is incorrect. I don't know why this is. I'm using the zip code of the place I'm living at right now. If I were to be able to edit this document (which I wish I could but it isn't letting me alter it directly - I've searched everywhere on the site) should I use my Home of Residence address or my current one. I believe I looked into this before and this time I should use my current address, right?

Please help. The anxiety I feel daily about not having my taxes done while everyone around me does is getting worse and worse. It's the biggest issue I'm facing right now.",finance

Normally I would use the one on studentloans.gov, but because the CARES Act set federal student loan interest rates at 0% for March–September the calculator assumes that your interest rate will always be 0%, making it worse than useless.",finance
investing,Rally leaves Jeremy Grantham’s GMO nervous,"The firm founded by famous bear Jeremy Grantham is worried equities are looking expensive as investors underestimate the coming hit to earnings. 

If there’s one number that Ben Inker is finding particularly hard to wrap his head around amid the COVID crisis, it’s this one – 6 per cent.

That is the amount by which analysts expect Wall Street’s earnings per share to fall in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier.

Just 6 per cent. That’s it. That’s how mild the market expects the impact of the biggest global economic hit in a generation to actually be.

“The fourth quarter in 2019 was one of the best quarters ever for large companies,” Inker tells Chanticleer from his home in Massachusetts, sounding more than a little incredulous.

“I don’t know whether investors believe the forecasts they are looking at. I don’t know how long it’s going to take it for the market to wake up to reality. And I don’t know exactly what reality is going to look like.”

But what he does know is that he’s nervous.

Inker is the head of asset allocation at GMO, the firm founded by legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham, who is credited with warning of Japan’s sharemarket bubble in the 1980s, the tech bubble in the early 2000s, and the conditions that led to the global financial crisis (GFC).

A bit of the inherent scepticism of the investors they call the Perma Bear naturally flows through the value-oriented GMO and it’s no surprise that the sharp rally in US equities – the S&amp;P 500 is now up 36.5 per cent since the market’s low on March 23 – has forced Inker’s hand.

So in the midst of the fastest bull market in history, GMO is retreating from equities.


Jeremy Grantham's GMO fund is pulling back on equities. Domino Postiglione

For its un-correlated funds (which don’t use a benchmark to measure relative returns) Inker has reduced the net equity exposure to 25 per cent from 55 per cent. The equity exposure of benchmarked funds has been cut in a similar, albeit smaller way. Grantham is completely behind the decisions.

“This was a big move for us and makes our portfolios look very different to most big portfolios,” Inker explains. “Which is a scary thing to do.”

But he says his team was guided by the simple principle that they wouldn’t invest their own money in the market at these levels.

“We’d rather take the risk of looking stupid than … be in a position where we lost the clients 30 per cent or 40 per cent because the equity market took another leg down.”

Inker acknowledges that GMO, which reportedly manages about $80 billion, has had a difficult year, like many investors. Its value orientation meant it underperformed the market as it went down, but Inker says the firm’s funds have largely kept up with the rally, which has limited absolute losses.

GMO increased its equities position when the market was down 30 per cent in mid March, believing stocks were fairly prices for a downturn that would be about twice the severity of the GFC.

Where GDP fell 3.25 per cent during that period and took seven quarters to reach a new high, GMO expected the COVID-19 crisis to wipe between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent from GDP, which would not be back to the new high until the end of 2021.

As such, GMO was banking on steady returns over the course of several years from its equities bet. What it got was what Inker describes as “a monumental rally”.

“We got the returns we were expecting, we just got them an awful lot faster than we were expecting. And that started to make us nervous.”

GMO’s view is that it is dealing with incredible uncertainty caused by “a virus of which the world has a grand total of five months of experience” and it cannot make post-rally stock valuations, even in the most optimistic of scenarios.

Small business key to cashflows
Yes, the Federal Reserve has taken incredible, and Inker argues justified, steps to save companies that would have otherwise become bankrupt through no real fault of their own.

But he doesn’t believe it can stop the hit to earnings that will arrive when the US government’s massive but limited stimulus runs out. “As we see it, the Federal Reserve can do a lot to help investor confidence, but it can do little to help corporate cashflow.”

The big problem is small business. The business models of many retailers and restaurants won’t work if they’re only allowed to operate at a percentage of their pre-crisis capacity. Those small businesses employ a lot of people, and it will take a long time for laid of workers to get new jobs. That surge in unemployment can’t help but hit corporate cashflow.

Inker faced another problem in retreating from equities – cash offered now risk, but also no reward.

His two bets are on emerging market stocks and particularly value stocks.

If GMO is wrong about the economy, and the recovery is V-shaped, then these value stocks should do well. And if the downturn is prolonged and ugly, Inker thinks he can still win.

“We think we do have a pretty nice margin of safety here. Value stocks can withstand quite a bad economic outcome and still outperform over the next several years because there just so much cheaper.”

personalfinance,Now What? a question about my personal finances and retirement.,"I am an overprocessor. When I think about retirement I get anxiety feeling like I am not doing enough or not diversified enough. I know that I am fortunate to be in the position I am in but it was also a lot of hard work. He is what I am working with.

I am a 38yom with a city job that provides a pension. I am engaged, no kids, never been married before. I have currently worked 15 years at my current job and am retirement eligible after 25years regardless of age(each extra year just adds to pension %). I currently max out my 457 account and my Roth 401k(19,500 each this year).  My only debt is my mortgage (330K with an interest rate of 3.2%) and my rental which is a single family home( owe 92k, mortgage is $815 and collect rent of $1300). I have  6 months worth of emergency funds in a HYSA.  After monthly expenses there is still money left over. What would you do with it? 

My Options that I can easily see

1) The state pension offers a savings plan that guarantees a ROR of 4.5% and he can contribute up to 5% of his salary after tax. This can be pulled at any age (retirement) as an annuity, lump sum or yearly payment 

[https://doa.alaska.gov/drb/pers/employee/plan/voluntarySavingsPlan.html#.XtW0nS85RQI](https://doa.alaska.gov/drb/pers/employee/plan/voluntarySavingsPlan.html#.XtW0nS85RQI)

2) Pay down the Mortgage

3) Taxable stock account

4) IRA and convert

Open to other options. 

I know the extra money just sitting there is a waste. I have been told by many I should pay extra on my mortgage and by an equal number that is dumb and I should invest it. Just looking for some guidance.   


Thanks

personalfinance,T Bill Laddering + HYSA Double Dipping?,"* HYSAs go on a month by month basis, or 30 to 31 days. For the purpose of this example, say it collects interest on the 1st of every month.

* T-bill maturing is every 4 weeks or 28 days.

My question is: Can't you set up a T-bill to mature within every 28 days, and still collect interest from the HYSA (basically double dipping?)

For example, let's say I collected interest on 6/1. Immediately afterwards, I purchase a $1000 4 week T-bill.  It matures on 6/29, and I collect T-bill principal + interest, and it deposits immediately into my HYSA. I'll still qualify for the HYSA interest. 

It's a lot of work, especially since T-bills have extremely low interest rates right now. But if T-bills and interest rates ever go back up to 2%, then can't I theoretically collect 4% each month?",finance

personalfinance,Should we get a HELOC to help pay off our credit cards?,"We own our own home--bought in 2008, refied at 3.25% APR in 2011-2012. Original loan was $255K, current balance is around $190K.

We had some legit cash flow issues while I finished up a professional degree, namely tens of thousands of dollars in licensing and testing fees over the five year course of my degree, and much of those fees went on credit card--either we lacked the actual cash, or checks weren't accepted. The fees and licensing and testing just nickel and dimed us. I'm taking the last test this summer. Yay.

But we have probably $30-35K in credit card debt over 4-5 cards now; and I'm fairly sure that all but about $10-15K is from my professional fees and other degree expenses. We sill have quite a bit of credit left on our cards, but we're definitely using more than 50% of available credit on 3 cards. I calculated what we paid on five cards last month, and it was just over $1800.

We need to make some headway with these cards, and a couple of our cards are high interest (above 15% APR). I briefly looked into a HELOC at our credit union. We have enough equity, and the rate is 4.59% fixed (lower than any card we have right now). If we took out $30,000 to pay off our credit cards, we could pay the entire $30K off in about 30 months (maybe less). At 30 months, our payments would be just above $1,000 a month. We could pay more or less (even $1800!), as our budget allowed. We aren't really making any progress on the credit cards right now because of the high balances and the interest rates. I feel like a HELOC would allow us to really make some progress and get the cards paid off sooner than if we just paid the cards themselves.

We are generally pretty good with our credit cards, and this was definitely a unique and one-time experience--we aren't always in a crap ton of credit card debt. And it's really the only debt we have besides our mortgage. We have no car payments, and our monthly utilities are fairly reasonable for four people. Would it be worth it (would it be wise) to get a HELOC, pay the cards , then pay the HELOC over the next 2-4 years? I'm not familiar with HELOCs so I'm wondering if that would be a wise use of one.

If you can provide me with some direction or general information on where to start, I would be more than happy to do the legwork--I just don't know where to start. Thank you in advance!",finance

USD remains the global reserve currency, and its strength often determines the performance of other markets across the globe. However, US monetary policy has been under the microscope lately, and increasing tensions between the US and China has caused the USD to weaken as a result.

Unemployment rates in the country have reached the worst levels since the Great Recession, consumer spending is at an extreme low, and the Federal Reserve continues to grow its balance sheet by trillions to prevent the superpower from faltering from its leadership position.

investing,"Can you convince me the Fed is really ""creating money digitally""?","Okay. Powell went on 60 minutes and straight up said that their programs are the same as printing money. No other Fed chair has come close to making this statement - ever. The bond market is certainly not showing any signs that any money printing is going on. Yield curve flat as a pancake and not really showing signs of selling off or reverting back any time soon. Large companies seem desperate for liquidity and are drawing down all their revolvers to get cash money. That doesn't seem to line up with impending inflation and ""flooding the markets with liquidity"" either. Credit spreads are getting better, but they are far away from pricing in a ""recovery"". If the Fed was really priting trillions of dollars - would they really need to go on national television and tell the public that they are - wouldn't the liquidity speak for itself?

investing,Why I believe we are going to see a deflationary spiral and that Dollar weakness right now is temporary. Any thoughts?,"We saw Jerome go on 60 minutes and talk about ""creating"" money and giving the illusion that he is printing money.

The Fed targets the financial services industry with their public words - they want the financial services industry to think that there is inflation in the economy as the major fear right now is deflation and that debt fueled bubbles are popping. Liquidity doesn't matter if the economy is shattered and if liquidity isn't in the hands of working people and small businesses.

Liquidity doesn't fix mass insolvency without causing massive inflation. But the Fed isn't doing that, they are just backstopping banks to provide liquidity that working people and small businesses aren't going to get access to. The Fed has also been careful to keep interest rates in the United States a bit higher than the rest of the world, and I believe they will continue to do that. That helps the USD keep its world reserve currency status. Gold will do well versus all currencies - but USD is the strongest currency of the bunch.

To get severe inflation we would need massive UBI implemented (unlikely without major change in government policies) without any economic recovery. Without UBI, there is no liquidity for individuals and small businesses, and that combined with a crash in economic output and bankruptcies = mass liquidation and deflation. [The velocity of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) is crashing right now. (I support $2000 a month in UBI to all citizens for note)

Another reason why the USD is weak right now is because the market keeps roaring upwards. And most of the gains are overnight - which is really odd. PPT? Bond market isn't buying it, treasury yields are still very low.

**Other ominous signs beyond the obvious economic catastrophe and social unrest:**

* [The Fed is coiling up volatility like we have never seen before.](https://twitter.com/LizAnnSonders/status/1267786935751323648)
* [PPT at work overnight every night lol](https://twitter.com/KeithMcCullough/status/1267754055520182273)
* The Dollar has broken trend to the downside - make or break time.

In my opinion, winners are UUP and TLT as they are both investments in the U.S. dollar which represents liquidity. Gold is good during deflation because it is an asset that has value, and during deflation there are few assets with value. However - when the market crashes again you may see all assets go to 1 like you saw in March. So even UUP and TLT have downside risk during deflation.

investing,What's Yield Curve Control?,"ELI5: Central bank will buy or sell bonds to target specific yield for a designated tenor in the yield curve.

Bank of Japan pioneered it targeting a yield of 0% in the 10-year tenor.

Just recently, Reserve Bank of Australia announced a target yield of 0.25% for the 3-year tenor.

Why the Fed thinks this approach is better than the quantitative easing?

Injecting liquidity through bond purchases only influence bond yields so much but Fed's efforts might be thwarted if pure market forces will drive the yield curve down the negative territory. The Fed sees YCC to orient yields to their desired level which is likely a low positive level.

Following Fed Williams' hint of ""augmenting monetary policy"" for YCC, I am sensing that the Fed's control will be on the 2-year yield, which is the typical market gauge of monetary policy stance. But the more liquid 10-year yield might also be considered being the most known in the yield curve.

The heists are fairly dull and unrealistic, as well as not particulary satisfying and the setup gets old pretty quickly (UNLIKE THE BADASS Three leaf clover- my favourite of all time) Every mission is the exact same, and although there was a lot of that in GTA IV, it was super cool and massively realistic, so I enjoyed it, as I honestly felt attached to the protagonist.

I mean they removed the pool minigame from GTA SA and 4. wtf, I spent hours on that.

Credit Card 2 :       $2.6K    @ 9.25% (\~$60)  


My Car is my highest required payment but also my lowest interest rate. Does it make sense to kill that bill now and use the 'put aside' money to pay off other debts afterwards?

My Personal Load is my highest interest rate but has a fixed end date. Should I avoid the interest and put the money towards it?

I currently have 8k in open credit and 7k in credit card debt, should the money go towards my higher rate card?

Should I just invest the money into my Acorns account or in a high yield saving account?

I need to do 15-20k worth of work on my house - Electrical work, fencing, new floors, etc... and I need to finance all of this.  I have my options down to refinancing the house, or opening a Home Equity Line of Credit.

My current mortgage is a 30 year fixed at 4.375%.  I still have 76,800 due with 319 months remaining.  My current Escrow payment works out to $402 a month.

Zillow currently puts the Zestimate of our value at 138k, our household income is @$150k, and my wife and I both have credit in the 675 range

The bank is pushing us to the HELOC option, which has $50 a year in fees, and a variable 7.59% interest rate, assuming we open the line for $35,000.   If we only open the HELOC for the $20,000 we ""need"" our rate starts at 8.34%.

If we do a re-fi though, for a 20 year fixed rate they said today's rate is 3.65%, and we'd have to pay closing costs for a mortgage, so... fees.

I guess my question is what is the smartest way to do this, financially?  I really like the flexibility and constant safety net of the HELOC, but I feel like refinancing, between the shorter term and the lower rate will save me huge $$$.   Anyone have any thoughts or guidance for me?",finance

Student loan default

Due to a super long story involving my in-laws lying to my husband, he is defaulted on a bunch of student loans in his name. We are doing loan rehabilitation but won’t be done until January. His credit had always been thin so we’ve put everything in my name: house, cars, etc plus I have my own student loans that I’ve been paying on for almost 10 years. We had planned to start adding him to stuff when our income was a little higher so we could afford the higher interest rates. Then this student loan thing happened. So. How do we fix his credit? I was thinking of getting him a secured card but I doubt he will qualify for even that until the loans are rehabilitated. 

I don’t make the income so getting a mortgage loan with his income and terrible credit would be challenging. Our house is old and falling apart but it’s what we could afford when we bought it 5 years ago.

worldpolitics,The Rise of White Labor,"Settler Amerika got the reinforcements it needed to advance into Empire from the great European immigration of the 19th Century. Between 1830-1860 some 4.5 Million Europeans (two-thirds of them Irish and German) arrived to help the settler beachhead on the Eastern shore push outward.(1) The impact of these reinforcements on the tide of battle can be guessed from the fact that they numbered more than the total settler population of 1800. At a time when the young settler nation was dangerously dependent on the rebellious Afrikan colony in the South, and on the continental battleground greatly outnumbered by the various Indian, Mexican and Afrikan nations, these new legions of Europeans played a decisive role.

The fact that this flood of new Europeans also helped create contradictions within the settler ranks has led to honest confusions. Some comrades mistakenly believe that a white proletariat was born, whose trade-union and socialist activities placed it in the historic position of a primary force for revolution (and thus our eventual ally). The key is to see what was dominant in the material life and political consciousness of this new labor stratum, then and now.

The earlier settler society of the English colonies was relatively ""fluid"" and still unformed in terms of class structure. After all, the original ruling class of Amerika was back in England, and even the large Virginia planter capitalists were seen by the English aristocracy as mere middle-men between them and the Afrikan proletarians who actually created the wealth. To them George Washington was just an overpaid foreman. And while there were great differences in wealth and power, there was a shared privilege among settlers. Few were exploited in the scientific socialist sense of being a wage-slave of capital; in fact, wage labor for another man was looked down upon by whites as a mark of failure (and still is by many). Up until the mid-1800's settler society then was characterized by the unequal but general opportunities for land ownership and the extraordinary fluidity of personal fortunes by Old European standards.

This era of early settlerism rapidly drew to a close as Amerikan capitalism matured. Good Indian land and cheap Afrikan slaves became more and more difficult for ordinary settlers to obtain. In the South the ranks of the planters began tightening, concentrating as capital itself was. One historian writes:

""During the earlier decades, when the lower South was being settled, farmers stood every chance of becoming planters. Until late in the fifties (1850's - ed.) most planters or their fathers before them started life as yeomen, occasionally with a few slaves, but generally without any hands except their own. The heyday of these poor people lasted as long as land and slaves were cheap, enabling them to realize their ambition to be planters and slaveowners as so many succeeded in doing...But the day of the farmer began to wane rapidly after 1850. If he had not already obtained good land, it became doubtful he could ever improve his fortunes. All the fertile soil that was not under cultivation was generally held by speculators at mounting prices.""(2)

While in the cities of the North, the small, local business of the independent master craftsman (shoemaker, blacksmith, cooper, etc.) was giving way step by step to the large merchant, with his regional business and his capitalist workshop/factory. This was the inevitable casualty list of industrialism. At the beginning of the 1800's it was still true that every ambitious, young Euro-Amerikan apprentice worker could expect to eventually become a master, owning his own little business (and often his own slaves). There is no exaggeration in saying this. We know, for example, that in the Philadelphia of the 1820's craft masters actually outnumbered their journeymen employees by 3 to 2 - and that various tradesmen, masters and professionals were an absolute majority of the Euro-Amerikan male population. (3)

But by 1860 the number of journeymen workers compared to masters had tripled, and a majority of Euro-Amerikan men were now wage-earners.(4) Working for a master or merchant was no longer just a temporary stepping-stone to becoming an independent landowner or shopkeeper. This new white workforce for the first time had little prospect of advancing beyond wage-slavery. Unemployment and wage-slashing were common phenomena, and an increasing class strife and discontent entered the world of the settlers.

In this scene the new millions of immigrant European workers, many with Old European experiences of class struggle, furnished the final element in the hardening of a settler class structure. The political development was very rapid once the nodal point was reached: From artisan guilds to craft associations to local unions. National unions and labor journals soon appeared. And in the workers' movements the championing of various socialist and even Marxist ideas was widespread and popular, particularly since these immigrant masses were salted with radical political exiles (Marx, in the Inaugural Address to the 1st International in 1864, says: ""...crushed by the iron hand of force, the most advanced sons of labor fled in despair to the transatlantic Republic..."")

All this was but the outward form of proletarian class consciousness, made all the more convincing because those white workers subjectively believed that they were proletarians - ""the exploited"", ""the creators of all wealth"", ""the sons of toil"", etc. etc. In actuality this was clearly untrue. While there were many exploited and poverty-stricken immigrant proletarians, these new Euro Amerikan workers as a whole were a privileged labor stratum.As a labor aristocracy it had, instead of a proletarian, revolutionary consciousness, a petit-bourgeois consciousness that was unable to rise above reformism.

This period is important for us to analyze, because here for the first time we start to see the modern political form of the Euro-Amerikan masses emerge. Here, at the very start of industrial capitalism, are trade-unions, labor electoral campaigns, ""Marxist"" organizations, nation-wide struggles by white workers against the capitalists, major proposals for ""White and Negro"" labor alliance.

What we find is that this new class of white workers was indeed angry and militant, but so completely dominated by petit-bourgeois consciousness that they always ended up as the pawns of various bourgeois political factions. Because they clung to and hungered after the petty privileges derived from the loot of empire, they as a stratum became rabid and reactionary supporters of conquest and the annexation of oppressed nations. The ""trade-union unity"" deemed so important by Euro-Amerikan radicals (then and now) kept falling apart and was doomed to failure. Not because white workers were racist (although they were), but because this alleged ""trade-union unity"" was just a ruse to divide, confuse and stall the oppressed until new genocidal attacks could be launched against us, and completely drive us out of their way.

This new stratum, far from possessing a revolutionary potential, was unable to even take part in the democratic struggles of the 19th century. When we go back and trace the Euro-Amerikan workers' movements from their early stages in the pre-industrial period up thru the end of the 19th Century, this point is very striking.

In the 1820's-30's, before white workers had even developed into a class, they still played a major role in the political struggles of ""Jacksonian Democracy"". At that time the ""United States"" was a classic bourgeois democracy - that is, direct ""democracy"" for a handful of capitalists. Even among settlers, high property qualifications, residency laws and sex discrimination limited the vote to a very small minority. So popular movements, based among angry small farmers and urban workingmen, arose in state after state to strike down these limitations - and thus force settler government to better share the spoils of empire.

In New York State, for example, one liberal landmark was the ""Reform Convention"" of 1821, where the supporters of Martin Van Buren swept away the high property qualifications that had previously barred white workingmen from voting. This was a significant victory for them. Historian Leon Litwack has pointed out that the 1821 Convention ""has come to symbolize the expanded democracy which made possible the triumph of Andrew Jackson seven years later."" Van Buren became the hero of the white workers, and was later to follow Jackson into the White House.(5)

Did this national trend ""for the extension and not the restriction of popular rights"" (to quote the voting rights committee of the Convention) involve the unity of Euro-Amerikan and Afrikan workers? No. In fact, the free Afrikan communities in the North opposed these reform movements of the settler masses. The reason is easy to grasp: Everywhere in the North, the pre-Civil War popular struggles to enlarge the political powers of the settler masses also had the program of taking away civil rights from Afrikans. These movements had the public aim of driving all Afrikans out of the North. The 1821 New York ""Reform Convention"" gave all white workingmen the vote, while simultaneously raising property qualifications for Afrikan men so high that it effectively disenfranchised the entire community. By 1835 it was estimated that only 75 Afrikans out of 15,000 in that state had voting rights.(6)

This unconcealed attack on Afrikans was in point of fact a compromise, with Van Buren restraining the white majority which hated even the few, remaining shreds of civil rights left for well-to-do Afrikans. Van Buren paid for this in his later years, when opposing politicians (such as Abraham Lincoln) attacked him for letting any Afrikans vote at all. For that matter, this new, expanded settler electorate in New York turned down bills to let Afrikans vote for many years thereafter. In the 1860 elections while Lincoln and the G.O.P. were winning New York by a 32,000 vote majority, only 1,600 votes supported a bill for Afrikan suffrage. Frederick Douglass pointed out that civil rights for Afrikans was supported by ""neither Republicans nor abolitionists"".(7)

These earlier popular movements of settler workingmen found significant expression in the Presidency of Andrew Jackson, the central figure of ""Jacksonian Democracy"". This phrase is used by historians to designate the rabble-rousing, anti-elite reformism he helped introduce into settler politics. His role in the early political stirrings of the white workers was so large that even today some Euro-Amerikan ""Communist"" labor historians proudly refer to ""the national struggle for economic and political democracy led by Andrew Jackson.""(8)

Jackson did indeed lead a ""national struggle"" to enrich not only his own class (the planter bourgeoisie) but his entire settler nation of oppressors. He stood at a critical point in the great expansion into Empire. During his two administrations he personally led the campaigns to abolish the National Bank (which was seen by many settlers as protecting the monopolistic power of the very few top capitalists and their British and French backers) and to ensure settler prosperity by annexing new territory into the Empire. In both he was successful.

The boom in slave cotton and the parallel rise in immigrant European labor was tied to the removal of the Indian nations from the land. After all, the expensive growth of railroads, canals, mills and workshops was only possible with economic expansion - an expansion that could only come from the literal expansion of Amerika through new conquests. And the fruits of new conquests were very popular with settlers of all strata, North and South. The much-needed expansion of cash export crops (primarily cotton) and trade was being blocked as the settled land areas ran up against the Indian-U.S. Empire borders. In particular, the so-called ""Five Civilized Nations"" (Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles), Indian nations that had already been recognized as sovereign territorial entities in U.S. treaties, held much of the South: Northern Georgia, Western North Carolina, Southern Tennessee, much of Alabama and two-thirds of Mississippi.(9)

The settlers were particularly upset that the Indian nations of the Old Southwest showed no signs of collapsing, ""dying out"" or trading away their land. All had developed stable and effective agricultural economies, with considerable trade. Euro-Amerikans, if anything, thought that they were too successful. The Cherokee, who had chosen a path of adopting many Western societal forms, had a national life more stable and prosperous than that of the Euro-Amerikan settlers who eventually occupied those Appalachian regions after they were forced out. A Presbyterian Church report in 1826 records that the Cherokee nation had: 7,600 houses, 762 looms, 1488 spinning wheels, 10 sawmills, 31 grain mills, 62 blacksmith shops, 18 schools, 70,000 head of livestock, a weekly newspaper in their own language, and numerous libraries with ""thousands of good books"". The Cherokee national government had a two-house legislature and a supreme court.(10)

Under the leadership of President Jackson, the U.S. Government ended even its limited recognition of Indian sovereignty, and openly encouraged land speculators and local settlers to start seizing Indian land at gunpoint. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Cherokee sovereignty vs. the state of Georgia was publicly ridiculed by Jackson, who refused to enforce it. In 1830 Jackson finally got Congress to Pass the Removal Act, which authorized him to use the army to totally relocate or exterminate all Indians east of the Mississippi River. The whole Eastern half of this continent was now to be completely cleared of Indians, every square inch given over to the needs of European settlers. In magnitude this was as sweeping as Hitler's grand design to render continental Europe ""free"" of Jews. Under Jackson's direction, the U.S. Army committed genocide on an impressive scale. The Cherokee Nation, for instance, was dismantled, with one-third of the Cherokee population dying in the Winter of 1838 (from disease, famine, exposure and gunfire as the U.S. Army marched them away at bayonet point on ""The Trail of Tears"").(11)

So the man who led the settler's ""national struggle for economic and political democracy"" was not only a bourgeois politician, but in fact an apostle of annexation and genocide. The President of ""The Trail of Tears"" was a stereotype frontiersman - a fact which made him popular with poorer whites. After throwing away his inheritance on drinking and gambling, the young Jackson moved to the frontier (at that time Nashville, Tenn.) to ""find his fortune"". That's a common phrase in the settler history books, which only conceals the reality that the only ""fortune"" on the frontier was from genocide. Jackson eventually became quite wealthy through speculating in Indian land (like Washington, Franklin and other settlers before him) and owning a cotton plantation with over one hundred Afrikan slaves. The leader of “Jacksonian Democracy” had a clear, practical appreciation of how profitable genocide could be for settlers.

First as a land speculator, then as slavemaster, and finally as General and then President, Jackson literally spent the whole of his adult life personally involved in genocide. During the Creek War of 1813-14 Jackson and his fellow frontiersmen slaughtered hundreds of unarmed women and children - afterwards skinning the bodies to make souvenirs*.(12) [* While some of Hitler's Death Camp officers are said to have made lampshades out of the skins of murdered Jews, the practicalities of frontier life led Jackson and his men to make bridle reins out of their victim's skins.] Naturally, Jackson had a vicious hatred of Indians and Afrikans. He spent the majority of his years in public office pressing military campaigns against the Seminole in Florida, who had earned special enmity by sheltering escaped Afrikans. U.S. military campaigns in Florida against first the Spanish and then the Seminole, were in large part motivated by the need to eliminate this land base for independent Afrikan regroupment.

The Seminole Wars that went on for over 30 years began when Jackson was an army officer and ended after he had retired from the White House - though he still sent Washington angry letters of advice on the war from his retirement. They were as much Afrikan wars as Indian wars, for the escaped Afrikans had formed liberated Afrikan communities as a semi-autonomous part of the sheltering Seminole Nation.(13)

The first attacks on these Afrikan-Seminole took place in 1812-14, when Georgia vigilantes invaded to enslave the valuable Afrikans. Afrikan forces wiped out almost all of the invaders (including the commanding Georgia major and a U.S. General). Two years later, in 1816, U.S. naval gunboats successfully attacked the Afrikan Ft. Appalachicola on the Atlantic Coast; two hundred defenders were killed when a lucky shot touched off the Afrikan ammunition stores. The next year, in 1817, army troops under Jackson's command invaded Florida in the First Seminole War. The Afrikans and Seminoles evaded Jackson's troops and permanently withdrew deeper into Central Florida.

The decisive Second Seminole War began in 1835 when the Seminole Nation, under the leadership of the great Osceola, refused to submit to U.S. removal to Oklahoma. A key disagreement was that the settlers insisted on their right to separate the Seminole from their Afrikan co-citizens, who would then be reenslaved and put on the auction block. When the Seminole refused, Jackson angrily ordered the Army to go in and ""eat (Osceola) and his few"". Fighting a classic guerrilla war, 2000 Seminole and 1000 Afrikan fighters inflicted terrible casualties on the invading U.S. Army. Even capturing Osceola in a false truce couldn't give the settlers victory.

Finally, U.S. Commanding General Thomas Jesup conceded that none of the Afrikans would be reenslaved, but all could relocate to Oklahoma as part of the Seminole Nation. With this most of the Seminole and Afrikan forces surrendered and left Florida.* [* Even in the Oklahoma Territory, repeated outbreaks of guerrilla campaigns by Afrikan-Seminole forces were reported as late as 1842.] Those who refused to submit simply retreated deeper into the Everglades and kept ambushing any settlers who dared to follow. In 1843 the U.S. gave up trying to root the remaining Seminole guerrillas out of the swamps.

The settlers lost some 1,600 soldiers killed and additional thousands wounded or disabled through disease. The war - which Gen. Jesup labelled ""a Negro, not an Indian, war - cost the U.S. some $30 Million. That was eighty times what President Jackson had promised Congress he would spend in getting rid of all Indians East of the Mississippi. By the time he left office, Jackson was infuriated that the Seminole and Afrikans were resisting the armed might of the Empire year after year. He urged that the Army concentrate on finding and killing all the enemy women, in order to put a final, biological end to this stubborn Nation. He boasted that he had used this strategy quite successfully in his own campaigns against Indians.(14)

Time and again Jackson made it clear that he favored a ""Final Solution"" of total genocide for all Indians. In his second State of the Union Address, Jackson reassured his fellow settlers that they should not feel guilty when they ""tread on the graves of extinct nations"", since the wiping out of all Indian life was just as ""natural"" as the passing of generations! Could anyone miss the point? After years and decades soaked in aggression and killing, could any Euro-Amerikan not know what Jackson stood for? Yet he was the chosen hero of the Euro-Amerikan workers of that day.

While Hitler never won an election in his life - and had to use the armed power of the state to violently crush the German workers and their organizations - Jackson was swept into power by the votes of Euro-Amerikan workmen and small farmers. His jingoistic expansionism was popular with all sectors of settler society, in particular with those who planned to use Indian land to help solve settler economic troubles. Northern workers praised him for his opposition to the old colonial elite of the Federalist Party, his stand on the National Bank, and his famous ""Equal Protection Doctrine"". The later piously declaimed that government's duty was not to favor the rich, but through taxation and other measures to give aid ""alike on the high and low, the rich and the poor..."" of settler society.(15)",finance
personalfinance,Renting vs Buying in Boston,"Hi all! I’m posting this on behalf of my mom. I’m 18, and living with my mom, grandmother, and younger sister. We are leaving our rented house within the month, and my mom has been considering buying instead. 

We live in a very high COL area, within our state’s capital. We have to stay for at least 2 more years (my sister is a sophomore at the best high school in the state, and must be a resident of our current city in order to attend). Rent here is about 3k a month, and my mom makes around 18k a year. As such, we can’t afford to rent without digging a hole of debt.

Until the pandemic, my mom had very little in the way of savings. However, she is receiving a very big tax return (federal and state), and food stamps from our school which cuts down on expenses. As such, we’re in a better position than before. Unfortunately, she has poor credit.

My grandmother is rather wealthy (multi million stock portfolio and a couple hundred thousand immediately available), and she is willing to help since my dad passed away (she’s paying the remainder of my college costs that aren’t covered by financial aid), and may co-sign if necessary on a down payment.

In this scenario, does building up a down payment on a house make more sense than renting?",finance

personalfinance,Is it better to contribute to my HSA or pay off student loans?,"Currently, I (31/M) have ~$75k in student loan debt, at an interest rate of 6-8% (allocated among a few different loans).  Right now, I'm not making any payments on them because of the freeze (I'm putting the same amount of money I'd normally pay in a HYSA so I can attack the highest-interest loan when the freeze lifts).  

I've been holding off on contributing to any retirement accounts (other than to get employer match) because the common wisdom on this sub is that paying down moderate-interest debt is the better investment.  The wisdom goes that a payment on a 6% interest debt is equivalent to getting a guaranteed 6% ROI on an investment, which is far from certain in an actual investment scenario.

But by that logic, isn't maxing out my HSA contributions for the year the equivalent of a guaranteed [effective tax rate]% investment on that money?  Plus the HSA itself also gets some interest?  Or am I missing something?

The only downside is obviously that the money is earmarked for medical expenses.  I'm not currently incurring anywhere near $3500/year in medical expenses (the annual contribution limit), but it makes sense that I will *some day*.  Is that the downfall of prioritizing HSA contributions over debt payment?

personalfinance,Should I take a 401k loan,"I am debating whether to pay-off my current 401k loan and consolidate my credit card debt into a new 401k loan for 65k. I have made some unwise decisions in the past, so that's why I have credit card debt.

My main concern I have too many cards and am making mostly minimum payments, so it's difficult to pay off one card. I have 65k over 6 cards with 0% balance transfer offers. When the offer expires, I transfer money to another card. I've been doing this process for a few years now.

The 401k loan would be for 5 years at 4.25%. $ 1,204.42 payment per month.

Is this a bad decision ? I have looked into personal loans, but the interest rates are too high.

**Income**

* 120k a year. Net pay is $7,000 a month (before 401k loan). I am located in Texas

**401k Balance**

* 152k (includes outstanding loan balance)
* I am contributing 8% each pay-check

**Savings**

* $22k in savings account
* $5k in stocks

**Current Debt**

* $375k mortgage at 3.5% APR. 26 years left. $3k monthly payment for P&amp;I, taxes and PMI. (PMI is $200 a month)
* $18k on a 401k loan (1 year left to pay-off). Monthly payment is $1,370
* $65k in credit card spread out over 6 cards with 0% interest offers. They all expire 2-10 months.
   * 20k, 17k, 13k, 6k, 5k, 4k
* $9k on two other cards with 0% interest. These I just opened and I have 12 months still to pay-off. I had to get my roof replaced and my insurance deductible was 10k.

I am also debating whether to refinance to a 20 year mortgage at 2.875%. This would be $3k a month, same as I do now with my 30 year mortgage but I believe I can avoid PMI due to new a new appraisal. Values have gone up and I've had some home improvement work done, such as a new roof.

personalfinance,Home loan refinance,"Currently paying on a 30-yr fixed conventional loan @ 4.125%. Put down 10% on the home when we bought it 5 years ago @ 270k, and don't have PMI (well, I believe it was baked into the interest rate). Have not had the house appraised recently, but we live in a very desirable neighborhood that has seen housing prices gradually rise each year. The wife is the only one on the mortgage, as she had better credit (around 850) than I did at the time (I ""gifted"" her the down payment $, as we weren't married then). 

Now that my credit has improved (FICO score in the low 800s) and we both are making slightly more money, would that improve our chances at lower rates? The wife is currently going to school part-time &amp; working full time, I have about $3600 (about 1 yr of payments) left on a car loan, and we have less than 2k in CC debt that will likely get paid off in the next month or two.

I got quotes from one place already, assuming the wife is still the sole person on the loan. We would have to pay 3k in closing to mostly take care of escrow, with the current loan's escrow being refunded (so it'd likely be just a net out of pocket of 1k-1.5k).

personalfinance,Is there a break-even between AMT &amp; Long vs. Short-Term Cap Gains on ISO?,"I have an ISO package and I'm trying to sort through the tax implications. I've read a lot about AMT and I **think** I understand it fairly well but want to be clear before I start exercising a bunch of options. I'll try to lay out a similar situation to mine using nice, round numbers:

Suppose that my taxable income calculated on form 1040 (after everything including standard deduction of $24.4k because I'm married filing jointly) is $100k. My marginal tax rate is 24% and I'll owe \~$13.5k in federal taxes (these numbers may not be exactly right, but bear with me. I don't think a slight error in this section will affect the outcome of my ultimate questions).

Suppose also that I have 10,000 options with a $2 strike price and the current FMV is $20. If I exercise all 10k options, the $18 spread would be included as taxable income in my AMT calculation, adding $180k to my taxable income. I've always been of the impression I need to hold shares for 366 days or longer - why pay short term cap gains, right? Additionally, if I think the value of the stock will appreciate over time, I may not want to sell any time soon.

In this scenario, under the AMT calculation, my taxable income would become $100k + $24.4k (add back standard deduction) + $180k = $304.4k. The 2020 AMT exemption for my filing status is $113.4k, so my AMTI would be $191k - almost double my original taxable income, setting me up for a hefty tax bill.

Assuming everything I've described so far is correct (it may not be - please help me if so): 

* Would my federal tax bill be 26% of $191k = $49,660 ? If so, that's an additional $36k I have to pay in taxes this year, which equates to 18% of the value of the shares I hold post-exercise.
* if I exercise additional options in 2021 and everything above follows (I exercise and hold, income stays the same, etc.) then I'll have another AMT bill next year and can't use the AMT credit, right?
* 366 days after I've held the shares, I sell them all. I will still owe 15% capital gains tax on the $18 spread (i.e. 15% of $180k) - maybe more if the stock has gone up. My total tax bill on the exercise of these 10,000 options is $36k (from the 2020 AMT) plus $27k in long term cap gains, totalling $63k or 32% of the value of the shares.
* If I exercise the options at $2 and sell them at $18 in 2020, I'll have to pay short term cap gains (ordinary income tax of 24%) on the $180k spread, or $43.2k. 

If I'm thinking about this right, won't my tax bill be lower if I just pay 24% short term cap gains on $180k now (also having gotten the cash from the sale of the stock) vs. having to shell out money for an increased tax bill and then paying 15% long term cap gains later? The obvious downside being again, the value of the stock could increase, resulting in more cash, but still an even higher delta on the tax bill.",finance

My current mortgage interest rate is 4.25%, monthly payment around $2100 which includes principal, interest, taxes and insurance. In addition to the regular monthly payment, I make an extra $1500 payment towards the principal WHENEVER POSSIBLE which is almost every month.

Now during this pandemic, since interest rates are low and there's a lot job instability, I was thinking of refinancing my loan.

The company I'm refinancing with has a closing cost of around $5500 and interest rate of 3% for a 20 year refinance.

Now my question is - if my job situation stays the same where I would have the ability to make those EXTRA $1500 to $2000 payments every month, would be a good idea to refinance to get the lower interest rate plus low monthly payment AND continue you to make those extra payments? I'm really confused...",finance

personalfinance,Why would anyone agree to pay higher monthly mortgage payments than they need to?,"I’ve been living in my current house for 2 years. The initial interest rate was quite high (just under 4%) and we paid £700 pm on the 35 year mortgage. We have now remortgaged and from next month we will be paying £550 pm with just under 2% interest rate fixed term for 5 years which is a huge saving. 
We considered keeping our payments at £700 to pay off the principal faster but decided to make the minimum monthly payments needed for the 33 year mortgage. Our reasoning for this was that we have other debts we would like to prioritise and we anticipate having a lot more expendable income in a few years as our earnings increase and childcare costs decrease. 

A friend of mine remortgaged a few months ago and agreed to very high monthly payments of £1000 to pay his house off faster (I think it meant paying the rest of his house off over 10 years instead of 20). Unfortunately due to the covid-19 shutdown his pay has been decreased because he is a sales manager who earns a lot of his money through sales bonuses and his partner who is self-employed hasn’t been able to earn any money at all. Obviously this has been terrible for them and having sky high mortgage payments hasn’t helped matters. 

I’m sure my friend’s decision seemed sensible at the time but it seems to me the interest savings from making larger mortgage payments would be quite modest and wouldn’t outweigh the risk of being stuck with big monthly outgoings if things go wrong.

Why would anyone agree to pay higher than the minimum rather than just stashing excess money in a savings account every month and using that money to increase your deposit every time you remortgage?

I am starting my real estate journey and I am in the process of contacting lenders for pre-approval. The company I am pre-approved with still hasn't provided me with rate options. Today I emailed 5 local lenders stating that I am currently pre-approved for a loan with another bank and I am rate shopping. I provided my credit score (805), Purchase Price range ($75k-$150k), and property type (SFH or Duplex). The one response I got was for 20% down, 0 points, at 4.875%. This seemed really high considering how low mortgage rates are now. I keep hearing people getting 3.125% on their personal residences.

personalfinance,I am thinking about a financial goal and it made me think about a problem.,"Say you have 300 units (300u) of money as your principal capital which you are keeping in bank for interest rate of 7% for 10 years. Interest is calculated/compunded daily but credited to your account quaterly. You do not do any credit/monthly deposit to your account, but you do debit of 30u per year or 2.5u every month at the end of every month for 10 years. This is like your monthly expense and it will increase with inflation in 10 years, so let's consider the inflation rate of 4%.

So what I am thinking about, rather the question is, what will be your interest earned/acrued and what will be your total maturity amount at the end of 10 years?

The debit factor with inflation is the only complicated part which I am not able to figure out else it is a basic compound interest question.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Breakeven Confusion,"I'm looking into refinancing and I was a bit shocked to hear that my first payment would be in September even though it's on track to close in July (4-6 weeks, I guess). I now know that that is normal I guess but now I'm left confused on my break even calculation- Does it move a month back?

I've googled the subject and I understand that some of the interest for the month of July will be paid to my previous lender and some will be paid on a pre-paid basis to my new lender- but a mortgage payment also includes a principle payment and we throw in an extra $200 on top of that normally- Is that skipped entirely for the month of July?

The way I was calculating my break even on the refinance was to assume that the same month of closing (so July) would be the start of my full new loan payments (P+I). With that, I would break even in 11 months total- So, 11 months with the first payment/month being July would be May 2021. Now, I'm wondering if mathematically I'd need to push that to June 2021, since it seems like I might not be making a full, true new loan P+I payment in July.

Thoughts from an adultier adult? This is my first potential refinance.

solar,Solar Lease or Purchase with Homebuilder?,"Hi /r/solar 

I am in the process of purchasing a condominium from a home builder in San Diego. Solar is mandatory now in California (I believe with home builders) and the company the home builder works with is Sunpower - which offers an option to lease or purchase. I am trying to figure out what is the best option for me as I am not too familiar with Solar and what comes with it. 

Some information on the solar specs: The system size is stated to be 2.8 kWp (DC) and 8 panels. The solar panels are X21 series and 350 Watts.

Lease Info:

* Lease duration is 20 years
* Fixed payment of $82 a month + (whatever the remaining utility bill is)
* If I were to sell the condominium before that 20 years, I will need to either have the buyer take over the lease or work with Sunpower to buy out
* Energy production is monitored and guaranteed

Purchase Info:

* System price: $13,640 which is included in the monthly mortgage payments
* Est. 26% Fed tax credit - $3,546
* System is property tax exempt in the State of California

Some information about me - I don't plan on living in this condominium for more than 3-5 years. I'd most likely sell or lease the place then. My worry is really the lease part and if I were to sell the condominium it might cause some issues trying to have the buyer take over the lease. But at the same time, I'd have to consider adding the purchase cost to my home mortgage as well. 

Any information/guidance would greatly be appreciated!

personalfinance,"For mortgage loan, 10/1 ARM or 30 year conventional?","Hello, 

I'm searching for a starter house at the moment that I plan on living in for 10ish years, maybe a little more or maybe a little less.

I've talked to multiple venders for a loan and have been preapproved for a 30 year fixed loan with a rate of 4%. This is a bit higher than I was expecting, but it seems to be what I will get with the money I have to put down.

personalfinance,"Parent has 60k credit card debt, is it a bad idea for me to pay it off with a loan?","One of my parents has about 60k in credit card debt, with upwards of 20% annual interest. Her credit is ""good"" but not in the great or excellent range. She is able to pay off about 500$ or so each month after her other expenses. This payment barely covers the interest, and is not really decreasing the principle. Additionally, she owns 1/2 of a \~700k home, and is trying to sell it. However, given its size and the world right now, it may take a year or multiple years before they find a buyer. Once it is sold, she will easily pay off all of the remaining debt. However, until that happens she is losing about 10k each year in interest.   


I am a full time salaried employee with a very steady and reliable job, and I save around 4k per month after all my personal expenses. I have a 797 credit score, no real estate holdings, and about 120k in savings and assets. I think I can get a personal loan with an interest rate of 3-5%, and then I would use that to pay off her other debts while she pays me to pay off the loan each month until she sells the house and is able to pay it all off.   


This way, she will save roughly 7-8k per year on interest, which should help her start to eat away at the principle quicker. I have also thought about using my savings to directly pay off her debt, but I think that I stand to gain more than she would save by investing my savings in the stock market. Should I pay off the debt directly, or try to get a loan for this?

Edit: my parent has been dealing with this debt for the best part of the last 3 decades. The decisions that got her here were in the past, and I feel very confident she will not wind up in the same scenario again. However, I did tell her that my help would be contingent on full financial transparency from her and she would have to work on a budget with me and stick with the budget.

Edit 2: I think it's also worth noting that my parent is against this idea and doesnt want to adversely affect my life. It's something I am trying to convince her of, not something she asked me to do. I have a great relationship with her and wholey believe her intentions are the best.",finance
Forex,You Wanted Macro? Here's A Macro View On Current Market Conditions,"In my earlier post, folks were asking for a macro view. I write macro newsletters on a weekly basis with my co-chief investment manager and business partner. Here are our thoughts regarding what's going on right now:

Here’s one of my basic trading principles…

The market tends to do what will inflict the most pain on the biggest number of investors.

Today, the disconnect between the economy and the market’s powerful rally flies in the face of logic. But more importantly… it’s creating a huge amount of pain for investors.

Let me explain…

## Ripe for the Next Leg Lower

Since the low on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has been rallying relentlessly. It closed last week up 36% from the March low.

Many medium-term, trend-following trading advisors have been caught short. They’ve been steamrolled by this rally.

The rally is also creating a lot of pain for the private investors who waited for more attractive levels to buy.

At the same time, a lot of people who were suffering from FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), finally couldn’t stand it any longer and they’ve plunged in with both feet.

The corrections have been minimal since then, and the economic data has been awful. This is a perfect combination for a gigantic short squeeze.

A short squeeze is when the price of a security goes up so fast, short sellers are forced to rush in and buy to cover their losses. Their short covering pushes the price up even higher… and forces still more short sellers out of their positions.

It becomes an ugly snowball effect, with layers of buyers rolling in to cover losses, one after another.

Now, many traders have been forced to capitulate in recent weeks. But my bet is that this capitulation will be over soon.

At that point, the market will be ripe for the start of the next leg lower. I believe this down move in stocks will come soon.

## Ready for a Meltdown

This same cynical thinking convinced me in January that the stock market was getting ready for a meltdown.

Back then, I called for a dramatic sell-off. The epidemic turned out to be the catalyst for the stock market’s collapse.

But it wasn’t the coronavirus that created my bearishness. It would have been something else instead if the virus hadn’t come along.

The market was too bullish. The fundamentals looked too good. Everything good was already discounted in the price, and the market needed a big cleansing.

The Fed’s insistence on trying to micromanage every little dip in the economy seemed foolhardy. In retrospect, the Fed’s hypersensitivity to any sort of economic slowdown is what landed us in this predicament.

For example, normally the Fed can lower interest rates to stimulate the economy during times of extreme economic weakness.

But before the pandemic hit, the Fed had already lowered rates to historically low levels. So the stimulus of lowering interest rates had been stripped from the Fed’s arsenal.

Companies had built up far too much debt, and this over-leveraged situation still needs to be cleared out.

That is what bankruptcies accomplish – both at the corporate and personal levels.

Do I think the markets are overly optimistic about the pace and magnitude of the economic recovery? Absolutely! Here’s why…

## This Optimism Won’t Last

In just 10 weeks, we’ve witnessed something we have never seen before.

Last week’s jobless claims numbers showed another 2.12 million people applied for unemployment. That doesn’t include the 1.2 million claims filed by gig workers – such as drivers for Uber and Lyft.

That puts the total number of jobless claims since the pandemic struck at about 48 million people. This is a truly staggering number.

Major companies are firing workers right and left… long-standing businesses – like car-rental company Hertz – are declaring bankruptcy… and we’re living in fear of an invisible enemy that already took more than 100,000 American lives.

As I’ve written before, taxes are going to rise sharply in the near future. The massive deficits are going to create a long-term drag on economic output.

Under the best of circumstances, hiring tens of millions of people would be an enormous undertaking. In the current “work from home” environment, this process is even more challenging.

And yet, if you look at the price action in the equity markets, you’d think we have a booming economy with full growth, a balanced budget, surging optimism, and modest inflation.

Talk about forward-looking investors!

But as I explained in a recent issue markets can behave irrationally for a long time…

## What to Do Now

I see this as a time to slowly build positions that will make large profits once the markets become more sensible.

In fact, what we really want to do is unwind our current positions once the markets have turned sharply lower. At that point, there will be an overly pessimistic attitude among traders and investors.

But it is WAY too early for that. We are still in the exuberant phase. Many traders and speculators are celebrating the end of the lockdowns and looking forward to happy times again.

In the short term, we need to pay close attention to new statistics coming in.

This is important now that people are moving about more freely, and in many cases ignoring the constraints of social distancing, mask-wearing, and so on.

For sure, we will see an uptick in the number of people getting sick.

Trump already informed us he won’t shut down the economy again, even if we have a second wave. The states and governors may have a very different view about that. Barring extreme steps by the President, states will have the final say.

Either way, I believe the current optimism is supported by faulty logic and premises. I don’t think it will last.

So we simply need to be alert to news that can shatter the illusion and bring people back to reality.

At that point, the next leg of the market’s down move will start, and it will drop with a vengeance.

stocks,Fundamentals contradict the market. I'm worried.,"Hello all,
I see that the market has been going up. During the lows of the recent Covid 19 I've bought several stocks, I do have great performance on my portfolio today as there seems to have been a great increase in prices. However, I was expecting this to be a longer recovery run as the issue is still not solved and mostly Covid 19 is not under control yet. I expect this is the calm before the real shitshow that is about to come as people have not yet lost their ability to delay payments for credits, unemployment is still very high, the political spectrum is going bananas and order is not granted short term.
With this said, I worry about what will happen to the supply chain and would like to get more opinions on this.

The main reason I wanted to move was to get closer to work (1hr 15 minute commute vs 20-minute walk). Now that this isn't an issue, I'm rethinking buying now and planning on waiting until I need to be in the office.

Is it worth it to pull the trigger on this condo since I really like it? or would you advise to wait and look for another place to close around February? I really like the place, interest rates are so low right now, and I would like to live alone (though I don't mind staying with my dad). Also, some of my payments will be going towards building equity in the condo so it isn't like I'm throwing the money away.

What would you guys suggest to do? Anything I'm not considering here?

investing,Thoughts on investing in XLF in the current enviornment?,"I've been doing extremely well the last few weeks buying into beaten up companies that are still down a lot from their highs prior to COVID. I've seen some darkpool activity come through on XLF recently and it got me thinking about banks.  Problem is, I don't know enough about banks and how they profit.

I'm aware that a low interest rate environment is bad for them and interest rates aren't going up anytime soon.  Trading activity is way up and that will help out banks who also own brokerages.  I would imagine spending will return to normal, but not sure if revenue from card transactions is significant.  I assume they make a lot of money off loans when interest rates are in their favor, but they won't be for a long time.  Yet the darkpool activity has me wanting to know more.

Thoughts on buying into XLF around these prices and selling at $30?  Anyone who is knowledgeable on banks, I would appreciate some input.

personalfinance,Am I planning my finances in a smart way?,"OK, so I am 24 years old and I just want to make sure I'm smart with the money I have. I plan on going to graduate school, most likely Fall 2021. Thankfully, because I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, I have access to the Coverdell Fellowship, which is a scholarship program for RPCV's. I am hoping to go to graduate school with zero student debt, with the Coverdell Fellowship combined with the money I have saved up. I am also very fortunate that Mom and Dad paid for my undergraduate degree.

When I initially opened it back in October the interest rate was **2.15%**, but it was lowered to **1.9%** in December, **1.75%** in February, **1.55%** in April, **1.4%** in May, and just yesterday they lowered it to **1.2%**. 

It feels a bit like a bait and switch, since I got the account specifically because of its generous interest rate. 

That being said, when I started looking around I noticed that HSBC's interest rate dropped from **1.4%** to **1.3%** just a couple weeks ago. If that trend continues, I could go through the hassle of opening a new account and moving my money only to have the interest rate drop to lower than what I would have gotten if I'd just left my money alone.

So my question is, is this normal? Should I switch to another bank, or are interest rates going to go down everywhere and it's not worth the effort? If I do switch, are there banks that have a reputation of keeping a good and stable interest rate?

personalfinance,Easiest way to take care of self employment estimated taxes?,"Hey Folks, in Q3 2019 I formed a partnership LLC with my brother &amp; left my regular W2 job as well in Q3 2019.  We started a business venture that showed no profit until now, 2020.  We are hoping to do our own taxes but this estimated quarterly tax thing is getting me a little confused.  The state is NE, so my understanding is that we don't only owe quarterly fed taxes to IRS but we also do the same thing to the state of NE.  Our business varies significantly but I can probably calculate my net income within 10k most likely.  Right now it's looking like maybe 2020 Net income of 48k.

In 2019 I was filing single, this year I am filing married &amp; jointly.

I read that I could just take my last year return (2019) and divide the total taxes due on that puppy by four, and pay those 4 payments to the IRS to avoid penalty and keep things real easy.  However can this be done when 1.) I left my W2 job that was mostly accounting for those taxes, and 2.) I am now married filing jointly?  Spouse has a regular W2 job doing the standard withholding, etc.

Next up, does the state estimated tax allow the same safe harbor rule (if I did that?) or does that vary by each state?",finance

personalfinance,"Need advise. 587 credit score, no collections, just high utilization and 98% payment history.","I need advise. I used to have an awesome credit score a few years back - but it’s gone downhill after some overspending and bad decisions. It keeps me up at night and I need and want to finally take control. I’m currently at a 587 based on credit karma. I have nothing in collections; my credit card utilization is high which is what I think is hurting me the most. I have/had 2 Bank of America credit cards which were closed by BOA because I was late on 2/3 payments (my assumption). One has a balance of 14k and the other 7k. Those are also their respective limits so I am at 100% utilization. They’ve had around these balances for the last 2 years with me typically making a minimum to a bit higher than minimum payment on them ($500-1000 each month). But I always did pay on time. I felt like I couldn’t get anywhere because the interest rate was so high so I never made a huge dent in the payment. The closing of accounts made my credit age decrease significantly which was super annoying because I had the one credit card for 11 years. Both cards were always always in good standing and paid on time (just not in full) except for the last few months (January-March). I will admit I intentionally didn’t pay because I was in fear of losing my job because of COVID and I wanted to reserve as much as possible in the bank. 

Now I finally put a huge chunk of payment to them. $8645 to the 14k one and $1500 to the 7k one. I also have a Nordstrom card with $1802 balance ($3500 limit) which I plan to pay $1000 off next week, and a Crate and Barrel credit card with no balance. 2 closed credit cards, 2 open (Nord and C&amp;B are open). 

I need to raise my credit score not just to raise it in general, but because I need to buy a new (used) car soon. I owe nothing on my current car. I have a very expensive German car that is too pricey to maintain and I want to get rid of it (took it in for service last week and they basically told me I need to do all these things to it totaling to $4000). I will probably trade this one in for about $10K, and I am looking at a car for about $26k (hoping to negotiate down to $23-24) so looking for a $15K loan. I can put about $3000 down at the moment, but would rather not put more than $2000. 

Will the payments I just made on my BoA accounts help improve my score? Or will they need to be completely paid off? I ask because since they’re closed...I no longer have those limits as part of my revolving credit and my utilization is a lot more than credit limits. 

Here are my stats based off credit karma (I know some people say it’s just average and not to really rely on it):

-98% positive payment history
-50% credit card utilization ($1800/$3500 on Nordstrom) but actually more with the Bank of America accounts
-0 derogatory remarks 
-3 years credit age
-13 total accounts**
-1 hard inquiry 

-***for the 13 accounts - 7 are open (2 credit cards, 1 student loan, 4 small personal loans - again bad decision that I am working towards paying off and have exceptional payment history on). 6 are closed (2 Bank of America credit cards closed because I guess I didn’t make payments, and 4 other credit cards closed because I simply did not use them for years - I also didn’t know that this happened - that if you didn’t use it, you lost it)

I make about $4K a month I am just going to keep paying as much as I can off on the cards with reserving whatever is needed for my fixed monthly expenses. I’ll be living extremely frugally. 

I am part of 2 credit unions. If my credit score were to stay the same, and I applied for an auto loan with them today, would I likely be denied? Or approved with a very high interest rate? 

I’m willing to wait a month to apply to see if my credit score gets better with my recent Bank of America credit card payments and next weeks payment to Nordstrom, but I just want to know what kind of journey I’m looking at. Thankfully I’m working from home due to COVID so I’m not driving to the office every day, but with a the state I live in opening up, I could be back to driving daily soon. 

I am so embarrassed and ashamed after writing this. I feel like I made so many stupid mistakes and it’s making me feel like such a failure. But I want to make things better and I need to.

There is no way companies will be able to justify such high valuations when they can hardly produce a percentage of there output months ago.

personalfinance,Is Williams &amp; Fudge scamming me? Questions on student loan repayment from a remorseful newbie,"Hi all, longtime lurker, first-time poster. I've taken some of the mental space and time afforded to me due to Covid to really sit down and analyze my financials and get real about making a dent in my student loans and rebuilding my credit score. I don't have any credit cards so they're my only debt.

A few years ago, I graduated from an Ivy university with a relatively low amount of loans — around $42K (note again the ""relatively"" &amp; thank god for scholarships). Unfortunately, due to being young and stupid, I buried my head in the sand when it came to repayment and defaulted on my federal loans.

It took  8 months after graduating to find a full-time gig and despite ""knowing better"" (but, again, young, dumb, and first time with cash in my pocket), poor money management  + helping out with unexpected family expenses = a perfect combo for screwing over my future self. Few payments were made, interest racked up, and now I'm looking at $64K in federal student loans — fml.

**Here's why I'm writing:** one of my smaller loans (\~$3K) was directly through my university and when I defaulted, it went into collections with Williams &amp; Fudge. I didn't know anything about dealing with collections at the time so after a bunch of harassing calls and threatening letters, I set up a payment plan that I've been paying off dutifully each month for about two years now. HOWEVER, as I've been researching lately on how to best start digging myself out of this hole, I've read up on how to deal with collections agencies and wonder if I did the right thing.

Looking at my credit report in Credit Karma and I have no derogatory marks on my report, nor does it reference this acct as actively in collections. Instead, it notes the private uni loan as ""Collections/Charge-Off"" and the account closed. This is super confusing to me and now I wonder if I did the right thing with the payment plan or if W&amp;F bluffed and I fell for it.

Any advice for a debt repayment newbie? I'm turning 30 at the end of this year and I'm hoping to aggressively pay down 1/6 of my debt. Grateful for any advice and I hope to reach out to my uni to confirm the collections debt and W&amp;F themselves to potentially settle for a lower amount in the next few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I defaulted on my student loans and now am working to repay them. One of my loans is collections with Williams &amp; Fudge but they aren't listed on my credit report (Credit Karma). Am I being scammed and if not, would it be possible to talk to them about settle my account for a lower amount?",finance

CryptoMarkets,TON Explained: What Was TON And Is It Really Over?,"One of the most striking phenomena of the crypto industry is the struggle of the SEC with the GRAM cryptocurrency and the TON blockchain network. There were tons of theories and forecasts built, and a great future was predicted for the project. But something went wrong, and the US authorities declared war on Durov's system.

In this review, we will figure out what was TON, what happened to it, why it happened, what are the chances to revive the project after its official closure, and whether the new Free TON network has chances.

# What was TON

The TON blockchain network project was officially presented at the beginning of 2018 by Pavel Durov, the mastermind of the famous VK social media and the Telegram encrypted messenger.

TON was developed on Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain basis but was targeted to surpass them in flexibility and transaction speed. This network had its own cryptocurrency, which was called Gram. But TON and Gram lasted only 2.5 years.

# Why did something go wrong with TON

The first alarm bell rang six months before the TON ICO — in July 2017. Then the SEC [published](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131) the results of the investigation of the crypto project The DAO, which for the first time in SEC regulatory history called the cryptocurrency “securities”. It was a direct warning: all such ICOs in the USA would be prohibited.

On January 18, 2018, Durov announced that he intends to attract a billion US dollars with ICO. It was ICO that ultimately ruined the whole idea of ​​the project. But let's take it in order.  

At the preliminary stage of the ICO, it was phenomenally raised $ 850 million, while applications were submitted for $ 3.8 billion.

On September 10, 2019, Telegram developers started the testing of the TON. The archive with the source code was placed on a specially created site test.ton.org. In the future, this will help with the chance for the revival of the project in a slightly different form.

On October 11, 2019, the SEC filed a lawsuit in the US federal court against two Telegram companies. Official position: this ICO is an unregistered securities.            

On October 25, 2019, the NY Court ruled that Pavel Durov and two other Telegram employees, should stand trial and testify. Then it became clear that the TON project is unlikely to succeed. Meanwhile, Durov launched Gram testing service.

March 24, 2020, the NY Court [agreed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448.227.0.pdf) with SEC and recognized Gram tokens as unregistered securities.

May 12, 2020, Pavel Durov posted in his official Telegram channel the TON did not survive this war. In this letter, he emphasized the paradox of the US justice that decided the TON has no right to work not only in the USA but worldwide. Allegedly, because US people can get access to bypass the ban and get into TON. The main conclusion of the letter: almost the whole world depends on US decisions, which means that fighting with them is pointless.

At the same time, at the end of the letter, he officially distanced himself from any projects that operate or will operate under the TON or Telegram brand.         

# What about the return of funds to investors and what they think about it

In his letter, Durov promised non-US-investors they would receive 110% of the funds invested in cryptocurrency even if Telegram repays the debt to them ahead of schedule. Some TON investors have already agreed to these conditions, but there are hardly a most of them.

Telegram [proposed](https://ru.ihodl.com/digest/2020-05-07/ton-zapustili-bez-uchastiya-pavla-durova-i-telegram/) to convert investments into a loan at an annual 52.77%. After that those who will make this conversion can expect above mentioned 110% of their initial investments in 2021.

At the same time, Telegram [offered](https://thebell.io/durov-ne-razreshil-amerikanskim-investoram-zhdat-zapuska-ton-eshhe-god) only one option to American investors — to withdraw 72% of the initial investment.

Regarding investments, there is a [prevailing](https://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/400315-pavel-durov-poshel-na-ustupki-investoram-v-kriptovalyutu-telegram) mood of distrust amongst investors. Many of them don't believe that Telegram will issue any shares or tokens, or issue debt instruments, or return 110% of the investment. Investors are also worried that Telegram will have to pay the SEC lawsuit.

The head of Tokenbox, Vladimir Smerkis, [said](https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/5ebb999b9a7947d0b3163088) most participants in the TON ICO intend to sue the founder of the project.

Today, almost no one expects TON to officially revive, but many people look at alternative systems on the TON blockchain with interest. But at the same time, they do not particularly trust.

# What is Free TON and what to expect further from TON

On May 7, 2020, an alternative version of TON called Free TON was launched. The declaration on the launch of Free TON at the time of the creation of this review [was signed](https://freeton.org/) by more than 5.1 thousand companies and individuals. The Free TON Community is made up of TON developers and potential users. The participation of US citizens in the project is prohibited.

The most authoritative network members:

* Ton labs
* Certus.one
* P2P.org
* Kuna
* Everstake
* Chorus
* Bitscale capital
* Simplex
* Ceo.io

Free TON members will receive tokens named TON Crystal (abbreviated as TON) without any charge. 5 billion tokens are [generated](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/05/2020/5eb3f1429a79470728554a3f) in the system:

* 85% goes for Free TON partners in the referral system;
* 10% goes for developers;
* 5% goes for potential network validators.

As [Dmitry Goroshevsky](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/05/2020/5eb3f1429a79470728554a3f) (TON Labs CTO) and the founder of Kuna crypto exchange, [Mikhail Chobanyan](https://vc.ru/crypto/125570-soobshchestvo-free-ton-zapustilo-sobstvennuyu-blokcheyn-platformu-bez-uchastiya-telegram), say Free TON doesn't discuss TON trading, but technically such an opportunity is available.

In our previous review, we wrote that it is highly possible that Durov closes official TON, and some external (or not so external) organization like Free TON Community makes its TON with blackjack and... And here we are. And so it happened. No one, except Durov himself and some main persons of the Free TON Community, knows whether they have agreed on that. The community also actively denies any involvement in ""old"" TON.

A number of investors [consider](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/05/2020/5eb3f1429a79470728554a3f) this project as a means to earn money, and not to support the blockchain development.

Another TON investor, EXANTE Executive Director Anatoly Knyazev, [said](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/05/2020/5eb3f1429a79470728554a3f) that investors are not interested in TON technology without integration with 400 million Telegram users.

The community invited other messengers with their audience to cooperate. If this happens, it's possible to predict the certain success of the project.

Now any integration of Free TON with the Telegram messenger is impossible. But someday we'll probably see a possibility that there will be some ways to fully or partially integrate it without legal consequences. And then the project will be strengthened.

An important note: SEC [can officially consider](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/05/2020/5eb3f1429a79470728554a3f) the start of Free TON an attempt by Pavel D. to circumvent a court decision prohibiting the first TON iteration. That could mean some new sanctions to the Telegram and Free TON both.

# Summary

TON was the open-source project, therefore, any number of networks can be started on its basis. It means Free TON may not be just one of many alternative TON clones. And in the shadow of them, perhaps, Pavel Durov will stand. You never know.

economy,Adam Smith removed economics from moral philosphy and turned it into a pseudo-science of the bourgeoisie.,"Adam Smith removed economics from its proper rooted place, in moral philosophy subordinated to the moral order and turned it into a pseudo-science. Since economics was deracinated from its roots in morality, no proper reference point(morality) exists to judge an economic action right or wrong. Therefore managing the economy successfully becomes impossible. All other reference points ie. 'profit motive' become subjective, relative and irrational and outright occultic(invisible hands). This explains why the economy has been experiencing perpetual boom-bust cycles over the past 300 years. Deflation, inflation, 20% interest rates, negative interest rates, wild swings in employment, gold standards etc.

Economics at least in the English speaking world has been turned into a pseudo-science over the last 300 years in order to justify 3 things:

1. Stealing of Church property and privatization of common lands under King Henry VIII. This formed the initial 'seed capital' of the Whig oligarchy at the time. In order to rationalize this action away we've had all the 'private property' 'freedom' 'individual' blah blah blah taught ever since. Free market economic theory has its roots in justifying plunder and theft of common property.
2. Apologizing for usury or a irrational belief in magic. Once the monastaries were looted and common properties gated off, the thieves decide to lend their riches at interest. We've heard countless of justifications for the existance of compound interest since. People who believe that money multiplies because of an artithmetic formula believe in irrational magic. Once the magic gets out of control we get debt crisis. Debt grows faster than productivity, so economics turns back to 1. Theft. What do they steal to repay irrational bondholders? Retirement funds and common property. Capitalism begins and ends with theft.
3. Fortune telling. Forecasting the future is how the vast majority of 'economists' make their living. Producing one failed model after another is no different than tarrot card reading. Once the thieves began multiplying their stolen wealth they turned to fortune telling ie economists to help 'protect wealth' and manage 'risk'.

So this is in a nutshell why the economy is such a disaster everywhere. You've got an entire legion of 'experts' trained in a pseudo-science that is based on an irrational belief in theft, magic and fortune telling.

Fixing economics means placing it back where it belongs under the realm of moral philosophy. Until that is done, forget any progress, it will be chain reactions(socialism, communism) to chaos(capitalism).",finance

- Fed pumping trillions in stimulus
- rates so low, nowhere else to go
- big companies who make up majority of the indices shrugging off virus, while mom n' pop's are suffering the most, and market doesn't care about mom n' pop

Could an additional factor be that since China has a head start in having the virus and now recovering, how their economy reacting is giving reassurance to other economies?  The vibe is that no one really knows the long term economic impacts of the virus imposed lockdowns, but since China was first by a couple of months, they can be looked at as a future model for what can happen.  If China so far hasn't completely collapsed, it gives US markets more confidence? 

Also, ignoring the trustworthiness of economic data given by China.  I think there are certain things smart people could infer on closer truth for how China is really doing, from other data.  If it get's so bad in China to where the economic impact can't be hidden anymore, maybe then US markets will react?",finance

""The U.S. Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report has yet to reflect at least half a million filings for a federal pandemic program, with data reporting lagging behind payouts.

Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii and West Virginia are among 18 states that showed zero initial claims under pandemic unemployment assistance, or PUA, in the Labor Department’s weekly report last Thursday. But the same states have actually received at least half a million in combined claims through the program -- established by the CARES Act -- which is aimed at helping those typically not eligible for regular state benefits, including the self-employed and gig workers.

The gulf between the Labor Department’s data and state numbers -- compiled by Bloomberg News through state press releases, comments by officials and related data -- indicates the labor-market hit from the coronavirus may be more widespread than thought. While it doesn’t significantly alter the overall picture of mass unemployment as tens of millions of Americans have filed for benefits since mid-March, the undercounting further complicates closely watched data already beset by other errors and distortions.""",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Credit Certificate - Recapture Tax? (Virginia),"I am a first time home-buyer purchasing a condo in northern Virginia and my lender is recommending that I get a mortgage credit certificate. The upfront cost in VA is $750 and it will provide a tax credit for 10% of the mortgage interest that I pay every year as long as the home is my primary residence. Seems like 
 a good deal. However, I don't understand how to capture the benefit of the tax credit, and I am nervous about facing the recapture tax. I would appreciate any advice on whether to sign up for this! 

If I do not owe any taxes on my federal tax returns, can I still receive the tax credit? 

According to VHDA, all three of the following must be true for you to owe any Recapture Tax:

You’ve lived in your home for less than nine years before selling or disposing of it; 
You’ve profited from the sale of your home; and
You’ve had a rapid, significant increase in household income since closing on your mortgage — causing you to exceed the allowable limits for the tax year in which you sell your home

I will likely sell within 9 years. Currently, I'm single and my income is fairly close to the max. If my income increases, or if I get married and we have two incomes, will I face the recapture tax? My lender says that no one will know that my income has maxed out, but isn't the MCC applied during the federal tax filing process? How much does one have to profit on thee sale of the property for it to trigger the recapture tax?",finance

personalfinance,Backdoor roth now or move traditional ira funds into 2020 and try next year?,"First time creating a traditional and roth ira. My income doesn't allow me to max out Roth IRA and I landed up adding a few hundred $ into my traditional ira account. I'm not able to claim any deductions from the IRA contributions. Wasn't aware of the backdoor roth option until I found out 2 days ago and although I technically have 10 days to do it, don't know if that's sufficient time to complete the backdoor account conversion and refile taxes. As I look at it, my options are:

1. Keep roth and traditional as is for 2019. However in 2020 if I do a backdoor conversion, then the tax and transfer will be prorated based on all the amounts across traditional IRAs. So my 2019 contribution will always cause ""complications"" in the future

2. Complete backdoor conversion now and refile fed and state taxes. Any insight into conversion process and how long it takes, considering I'm 5 days away from the filing deadline. Seems like a lot of work vs option 3.

3. Move traditional IRA funds from 2019 into 2020 contribution and send IRS an updated basis for 2019 using f8606. This way I wont have to refile taxes and this wont cause complications when I do the backdoor conversion in 2020. I'm not maxing out 2019 contributions, but saves a lot of hassle in the short term. Would this plan work and can I still update my basis for 2019?

What do you think is my best option?

Investors increasingly believed that in a crisis or downturn, the Fed would step in and inject liquidity until the problem got better.

btc,"Inflation may grow as the US prevents negative interest rates, boosting Bitcoin bull case","One of the biggest Bitcoin catalysts over the past few months has been the introduction of negative interest rates into economies in Europe and Asia.

The idea goes that if consumers have to pay banks to hold their money, they will seek assets that provide relatively better yield. BTC fits the bill: it costs no money to hold, or it can even yield upwards of six percent yield if coins are held on a platform such as BlockFi.

Unfortunately for the Bitcoin bull case, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been hesitant to let its policy interest rate go negative. Chairman Jerome Powell said in a recent speech that negative interest rates are something the Federal Reserve is not looking at as a viable monetary policy lever.

Yet the fear is the economy will eventually demand it. That’s to say, to keep the cogs of Corporate America turning, it will need more stimulus. And that stimulus could be massive for Bitcoin.

The Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate could soon double

To respond to the ongoing recession caused by the end of the business cycle and the COVID-19 lockdowns, the Federal Reserve has been forced to take record action, dropping its policy interest rate to 0-0.25 percent just months ago.

But with the worst economic outlook in modern history as both the Bank of England and Federal Reserve have said, it may not be enough.

A 2017 study from two individuals on the Federal Reserve Board — which is arguably more relevant today than before due to the macroeconomic backdrop — found that due the tendency to keep rates and inflation near zero, economic performance will be poor. Low inflation will beget low inflation and output will be low.

So what’s the solution?

According to an op-ed authored by former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke in 2017, a solution may be to increase the central bank’s inflation target to four percent, double the status quo of two percent inflation.

This would give the Federal Reserve more flexibility with monetary policy, especially in recessions like the one we’re going through today. It would also be relatively easy to implement, he postulated.

Bitcoin Stands to Benefit

Max Bronstein of Coinbase recently wrote in response to the Bernanke’s post that we could see another “wave of debt monetization,” whereas treasuries issue new bonds and/or central banks create money:

“IF YOU’RE WONDERING HOW THE FED IS GOING TO TRY AND STAVE OFF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, HERE’S A POTENTIAL PREVIEW, AUTHORED BY BEN BERNANKE HIMSELF. THE INFLATION TARGET IS GOING HIGHER, EXPECT ANOTHER WAVE OF DEBT MONETIZATION.”

It’s a trend that could benefit Bitcoin.

Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund billionaire, explained in a recent report that Bitcoin is the “fastest horse” in a world where there is an “unprecedented expansion of every form of money, unlike anything the developed world has ever seen.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has echoed this as well, writing in a recent tweet:

- Mechanical engineer by profession.
- $74k salary (recently cut from $92k due to the oil crash recently; I do expect to gradually increase back to $92k+ and more over time). ~10% cash bonus and sometimes $2k worth of stocks bonus. Also an additional $20k net income from 1099 work.
- $0 debt outside of mortgages.
- Driving my first vehicle, fully paid from the day I bought it for $6k back in 2013.

Investments and Portfolio, so far:
- Recently cash out / refinanced my house I bought for $265k back in 2013 I had for a 15 year loan to convert to a 30 year loan, cashing out ~$100k cash and maintaining around the same interest rate, but restarting the loan with 80% principal to equity beginning on 02/2020. Mortgage plus HOA is ~$2,100. Have a tenant living with me paying $400 a month.

- Own a second home I bought for my parents. Net income from converting their home (home I grew up in) into a rental, plus cash revenue from a tenant that lives with me is paying for that mortgage. This had 25% down, purchases on 12/2018 on a fixed rate 30 year loan.

- 401k is currently around $82k. I currently contribute 6% of my salary, while my employer matches up to 3%.

- Roth IRA is currently at $11k. I recently started maxing this out.

- Don’t qualify for HSA due to the low deductible insurance I have and need due to my chronic illness (glaucoma)

- Taxable accounts (Fidelity, SoFi, Robinhood, WeBull) consist of around $60k is mostly low-cost mutual funds and ETF’s. I have been aggressively investing ~$1-2k per week (sometimes more) into purchasing the same mutual funds and ETF’s in hopes to build enough of a portfolio that allows me to protect myself in the event my chronic illness eventually overtakes my ability to work (I’m deeply worried I may lose my sight before 50; but I’m hopeful for new innovations to restore and/or to preserve my eyesight).

- I max out my ESPP and currently have $12k worth of my employer’s stock.

- I have ~$5k of cash in my safe. I have ~$80k cash in high yield savings account I’ve been recently moving back and forth to cash in on checking and savings account bonuses. Most of this money is apparently from my recently cash-out.

My immediate thought is: Should I increase my 401k more towards maxing that out, or does it make sense to take a tax hit on heavily investing in a taxable account due to my circumstance?

I have a budget for myself until the end of the year where I basically put away $1k into my HYSA each month so I could hit my goal of $8k in savings for the end of the year ( $1.5k apartment down payment, $3k car down payment, $3.5k general e-fund) and then put $500/month towards paying off the variable rate loan so I could have it totally paid off spring next year, and then start attacking the next private loan. I will look into refinancing those private loans but I'm going to wait til my credit report reflects my paid off debt/I hopefully get a better paying job because so far I haven't been offered better rates. (Anybody know the ideal circumstances to start applying to refinance student loans?)

Ultimately, I really, really, really need to move out. My living situation is abusive and makes me depressed, which makes it really hard to look for a better job. I had plans to move in with my long term partner next year but that relationship just ended, and finding a 1BR for the $700 I could ""afford"" is not possible where I live, and roommates are not an option. Ultimately, I could move out on my income with some luck, but it'd be really tight. I am learning web dev/design as a second income I want to potentially pivot it into a full time thing. Everything effectively hinges on the chance of me increasing my income. 

**TLDR; Should I just pay the $80/month minimum payment on the private loan and put the $420 in my savings to have a bigger cushion when I eventually move out or should I take advantage of my minimal living expenses now to try and pay off my loans early?**",finance

personalfinance,High Yield Savings Accounts,"I would like to share my experience with online banks and the higher interest rates they offer, because it’s not a common one. Once my wife and I accumulated enough wealth, we took some of our savings and deposited it into Ally, as it offered 1.5% higher interest rates than our local bank. We still kept a decent amount in our local bank. As the interest rates kept dropping, that gap kept shrinking, so I just decided to close our Ally account. 

A month later, the PPP program comes out. It’s a nightmare. Business owners who used online banks because of their higher interest rates can’t get a loan because the banks are overrun with applications and servicing the largest costumers first. Small businesses are starting to fail because they can’t make payroll. Meanwhile, I had my money almost immediately because I am able to walk into my bank (figuratively since the lobby was closed) where I know the tellers and lenders and have an established relationship with them. While others are struggling to get the money the desperately need, my bank account was now 5 figures larger. That personal relationship was worth a heck of a lot more money than what I lost in smaller interest rates. 

I’m not saying this is a typical experience, as these are unusual times and most don’t own a business. I’m not saying that online banking is bad. I just wanted to share my experience where finances went beyond numbers in a spreadsheet.",finance

Elantras I’ve found have been the same or less. 

I went ahead and applied for a pre-approved loan through Navy Federal just to see my top range. They offered me $16,500 on 60 month term at 5.99% APR on 2018 or older vehicles. They told me the high rate is due to my credit and used vehicles. At that rate I definitely want to stay in the $13k or under range.

Of 3 things in collections. My family ruined my credit when I was young and I’ve been working hard to rebuild it and waiting for those things to fall off in another year and a half. 

I’ve tried credit cards with chase and have been refused every time because of stuff in my credit report. I’ve never missed any payments, never pay interest on my cards, yet continue to be beat down by my credit report at every turn. I originally wanted to check out dealerships to see if they could offer me better stuff on new cars but I now think that’s out of the question. From my research I’ve read that those 0% APR loans are for credit scores 700+. So it feels like a waste of time. However I will ask the place today what they can offer me. 

I’m going to take the next week or so to look at cars but I’m wondering if this is a decent offer in my situation? My credit score is about 680-690 but collections gets me denied. I have $5100 in savings so most I feel comfortable pulling out is $1500 for downpayment. I have a crummy 1998 explorer valued at $100-400 so I doubt it will help much but it will help. 

Is there anything I can do to get a better outcome from this situation?

Edit: for anyone wondering my gross income is $3863 a month and expenses are no more than $1100-1500. I’ve only chosen a 60/mo loan to get wiggle room on lower payments while continuing to build my emergency fund. I will pay well more than the minimum monthly payments on average.

**Edit2: I went to test drive a 2017 Toyota Corolla and the salesman was really nice and non-pressure. I asked him just out of curiosity what APR would be available to me. I didn’t mention the collections but I said credit score between 680-690. He said with it being my first car I was looking at an 18-21% interest rate. My partner who went with me said when they were looking at similar cars a couple years ago with a credit score of 750 with clean credit report they were offered a 10% interest rate since they were a first time car buyer. Their dad ended up getting the loan for them at 0% and letting them make payments on the loan. So I’m surprised I was offered 5.99%. I thought it was bad but now I feel better. Hopefully this is helpful info to others wondering about APR offers. Thank you everyone for you feedback!**",finance

Thank you for all your help.


Edit to update post: I called them. They offered me 3.45 so I told them another agent offered me 2.95 in March. They said the interest rate went back up, so I said never mind. Then he said he can try to get that rate for me, there’s no fee from lender, only one government fee 1.75 of loan term which 3900, closing cost is pay by lender, they asked me if that okay, I did a quick google search for interest rate, the lowest is 2.75 for 15 years fixed, so I said my husband has an offer from the bank for that. But I would like to keep my term which is 26 years 11 months. They said they call me back. So they did and also have documented ready for me to sign. Over the loan term we save 40k.

This is mind-boggling to me. If inflation ticks up even a little a 2.75% loan will become a losing proposition for the bank fast. They're basically giving money away. This explains why one of the bankers I was working with had over 100 refinancings on her desk!",finance

I'm torn right now about refinancing my mortgage. I'm not sure if my existing Lender is telling the truth. Please see info below.

    Type: FHA 
    Origination Date: 10/2018 
    Current Balance: $292,000

    Current Rate: 5.1% 
    Estimated Value: $500,000
    
    Loan Estimate by Lender based on 710 Middle Score
    
    Primary Residence
    Loan Type: FHA
    Rate: 2.75% with $752 buydown
    Closing Costs: ~$8000
    
    Loan Type: Conventional
    Rate: 3.875%
    Closing Costs: ~$5000 
    
    Investment Rental Property
    Loan Type: Conventional
    Rate: 4.38% with $1,980 buydown
    Closing Costs: $7270
    

Questions:

1.) The rate he is giving me is quite high compared to an online lender (aimloan) and two local credit unions which all gave me a loan estimate document with 3.375%. He's saying that all those other lenders are just bait and switching and that the rate for my credit score couldn't be that low. Is this correct? Not sure if there are existing lenders out there that could confirm?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) He's saying that if I go with these credit unions and online lenders that I most likely won't be able to close my loan because these are all either too understaffed or are handling volume in loans and I would be better off to go with him. The credit unions and online lender are offering to lock for 60 days with an estimate of around 4-6 weeks to close. This spooked me a bit. It's just that their rates are just too low compared to what my loan office is saying.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) For the Investment property. He said he will try and get my family member into the loan with me as a co-signer and that he could package it up and make it so that it can be considered as a primary residence for the family member. Is this something that's OK in the industry? I talked to one lender that said this could be flagged as Fraud? Also, my loan officer told me that even with this family member as primary residence owner, they could still use my middle score as the main credit score to use for estimating the rate which seems contradictory to what I've seen so far which is if there are two co-signers wouldn't the lower middle score be used to determine the rate? Or is it different because I won't be the primary residence occupant?

Why might this happen? 

---

I'll start by saying, I have excellent credit. Depending on the credit bureau, I have 750 to 790. However, I notice that all of my scores will drop randomly about every other month by about 5-10 points. I've been on a steady climb for a while despite the drops, but I can't shake the feeling that I'd be higher If I knew what the heck was going on. I'm not worried about it, but I'd like to understand it and potentially stop it. 

I have an open auto loan, a shared line of credit, and a personal line of credit. I've never missed payments on any, always pay more than the minimum on my auto, have *not* taken a deferment plan due to covid, and both of my credit cards are paid off in full every month. 

My shared credit is with my mother who has a near perfect credit score. My personal credit is a little cash back card with a small 500 dollar limit that I use to exercise my credit by purchasing gas once or twice a month. All other purchases are debit. 

My credit utilization is always below 30%. In fact the highest I've ever seen it was 15%. It is most often 5-6%. My personal line of credit is relatively young, but I can't see why that would cause recurring small dips. Additionally, I have no inquiries against my credit since securing my auto loan almost 18 months ago.

My lowest score with experian is right on the border of crossing from ""very good"" to ""excellent"", but it keeps hopping back and forth across the line. I'm saving for a small house and expect to buy in September or November when I have 20%. I feel like that score could be even the slightest damper on my interest rate if it's considered ""very good"" and not ""excellent"".

What could the possible cause be for this random drop? It occurs across all bureaus, though in different amounts, despite my cards and loan not reporting to all bureaus.

Forex,"As America Burns, Market Irrationality Reaches New Highs","Originally published June 2: 

The U.S. is experiencing widespread violent protests, riots, and looting across dozens of major cities, with thousands of arrests.

The country hasn’t seen unrest like this since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

Yet the impact on the markets has been negligible.

Speculators continue building their risk-on exposures with wild abandon. Stocks continue to rally. They’ve surpassed the highs of the market when the first several Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. were announced.

Likewise, investors are ignoring our country’s heightened tension with China. In fact, the relationship with China is devolving more and more into a Cold War. The world’s two largest economies are no longer even pretending to get along.

We’ll examine all that, and the market’s disconnect, in this week’s update below. 

Let’s start with the U.S.-China tensions…

Tensions Ramp Up at Home and Abroad

China is exercising its muscles, and the U.S. is not reacting well.

The removal by the U.S. of Hong Kong’s special rights is just the tip of the iceberg. The relationship between these two great nations is getting more and more tense.

The President has blatantly accused the Chinese of unfair trade practices, corporate espionage and technology theft, fraudulent accounting practices, flagrant violations of human rights, and a host of other unpleasantries.

He’s even claimed China willfully spread the coronavirus to the west, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Sanctions against leading Chinese companies and individuals, including blacklisting and blocking from access to the U.S. capital markets, are likely to follow. There is even talk about blocking access to China from the U.S. dollar system, a very serious move.

The Chinese have responded to America’s “interference in its domestic affairs” by canceling a number of agricultural purchases. This puts the Phase I Trade Deal at risk.

Still, the market is shrugging it all off as irrelevant.

The 45 million unemployed workers in the U.S. are also irrelevant to the market. The 40% economic collapse in the second quarter is irrelevant. The 105,000 U.S. deaths from the coronavirus are irrelevant.

The only thing that seems to be relevant is the de facto put option from the Fed, so the gulf between Wall Street and Main Street continues to widen. In the minds of stock buyers, the Fed is going to continue providing support and economic stimulus.

In reality, the economy is a mess, and the civil unrest is only going to hinder the recovery. Damage to property and extensive curfews are not helpful to economic growth, to say the least. 

The idea of the President actually calling in the Army to squash the protests is something that I hadn’t formerly considered, but I guess I have to add that to the equation.

Moreover, the mass riots and protests provide a perfect breeding ground for the virus to spread, as tens of thousands of shouting people are bunched together for many hours.

The likelihood of a second wave of Covid-19 infections is growing stronger by the day… even if that’s something people don’t want to consider. 

Something else people don’t want to think about is higher taxes. But the fact is that tax rates will absolutely go up sharply over the coming years.

None of these things seem to matter to the markets, however.

People are relying on the astonishing assurances of Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the Fed is not going to run out of ammunition… and that the Fed will provide essentially unlimited lending to support the economy.

Hmm. Let’s put this in perspective…

Federal Reserve’s Sleight of Hand

If the Fed’s support for the economy is essentially unlimited, why should the government bother collecting any taxes?

That seems like a gigantic waste of time and effort, not to mention a huge bother for those of us who pay taxes. Why not let the Fed just cover any and all obligations and allow us to not pay taxes?

Yes, eventually this logic breaks down into a stinky pile of nonsense. In fact, the rights and powers of the Federal Reserve Act have been codified into law.

The law is clear that the Fed is allowed to make loans against collateral to avoid losses to the American taxpayer. But nothing more.

There is nothing in the law to suggest that the Fed is allowed to make purchases of anything, let alone junk bonds and junk bond ETFs.

The Fed’s emergency lending authority was outlined in the original Dodd-Frank legislation from 2010. It said emergency funds have to be broad-based. According to Dodd-Frank, they should be used to provide liquidity to the financial system… not to aid failing financial companies.

The law also restricts the Fed from establishing “a program or facility that is structured to remove assets from the balance sheet of a single and specific company.” It also mandated that any Fed facility “be terminated in a timely and orderly fashion.”

Since Trump came into the White House, there have been some changes to Dodd-Frank.

The Fed’s wishful interpretation of the changes is that as long as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin gives the green light for what the Fed is doing, none of the other prohibitions apply.

But that’s not how the law reads. The law clearly indicates that all of the prohibitions apply and, on top of those, the U.S. Treasury Secretary must also give his approval.

You should note that $500 billion of the Treasury’s recent funding package were earmarked for the Fed. Why? Because Mnuchin and Powell agreed that the Fed would leverage up that $500 billion ten-fold and create an additional $5 trillion of funny money.

But how can the Fed get around that law? Well, with a little sleight of hand.

It’s going to make a loan to an entity called a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). That entity will buy the corporate bonds WITH OUR MONEY. That’s how the Fed will get around the prohibition that it can only make loans, not purchases.

Again, our money will underwrite the purchase of these risky assets. And the restrictions are frankly a little frightening.

The SPV can purchase up to 130% of the issuer’s maximum outstanding bonds and loans on any day between March 22, 2019 and March 22, 2020. Really? Here’s an example…

Say a company had $200 million of outstanding debt. Recently, this company lost the ability to tap the bond market for funding.

The SPV can be the sole investor in a bond issuance of $260 million – WHEN NO ONE ELSE WILL LEND THE ISSUER ANY MONEY. Remember, they’re investing in that bond issuance with taxpayers’ money.

Call me crazy, but that sounds very dubious, to say the least.

Distorting America’s Economy with Funny Money

Clearly, the Fed has not reduced its emergency lending facilities in anything remotely timely or orderly.

In fact, as you will see in a moment, it just keeps blowing out its balance sheet, pumping ever more money into a weak economy to trick people into thinking that things are alright.

In any event, counting on the Fed to keep up the stimulus indefinitely is a very foolish proposition that is doomed to fail.

The system is not seizing up right now. The banks are working efficiently. No, they are not lending easily, but they always prefer to lend to companies and people who don’t need the money.

If companies don’t have the strength to survive a few months of limited income, it is clear that they are not very strong. Companies that are weak can realistically be expected to go out of business, not get bailed out by taxpayers. That is not the function of government in a capitalistic, democratic society.

Those companies’ liquidity issues have become insolvency issues, and those companies can be expected to go bankrupt. That is how the system clears out the dead wood in a capitalistic society.

That is why stocks are theoretically considered “risky” assets. Companies can go out of business and fail. They aren’t supposed to get propped up and supported due to some sort of shady cronyism.

So, instead of following Dodd-Frank’s requirement that loans have to be collateralized “sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses,” the SPV will be established with $50 billion of taxpayer money. The other $450 billion will be used to provide massive amounts of suspect, or at least unnecessary, loans.

The express purpose of using those taxpayer dollars is to absorb the first $50 billion of losses in this gambit. This is not supposed to happen. In fact, it is a clear violation of our rights as citizens and taxpayers.

Alright, let’s have a look at the real economic growth in the U.S. since 2007. I think you will find some of this information quite interesting.

In 2007, the nation’s GDP was $14.45 trillion. It rose to $14.75 trillion in 2008, and then dropped back to $14.45 trillion in 2009. That doesn’t look so bad.

By 2019 the U.S. GDP had grown to $21.4 trillion. That seems alright, although it is probably on pace to generate about $20 trillion in GDP by the end of 2020. That means the annual GDP has increased by $5.2 trillion.

The Dow Jones during this period hit a high of 13,924 in 2007, then dipped to a low of 6,470 in 2009, before surging to 29,568 in 2019.

Wow! The U.S. economy must have been doing great during this period. But was it?

In 2007, the Fed’s balance sheet was $870 billion. Then the Great Recession struck, and the balance sheet quickly ballooned out to $2.2 trillion.

The Fed was pumping money into the system like crazy. It didn’t stop there though.

By 2015 the Fed had blown out its balance sheet to $4.7 trillion. Why? Well, the economy wasn’t really growing very well, so the Fed kept pouring in money to give the appearance of growth.

The balance sheet got reduced to $3.76 trillion in 2019 when the Fed tried raising rates. That didn’t last long. Since the onset of the coronavirus, the Fed has grown the assets in its balance sheet to $7.1 trillion. Yes. $7.1 trillion!

So the economy’s annual growth rate has grown by $5.5 trillion during this period, while the Fed’s assets have grown by $6.2 trillion.

Interest rates have been driven down to 25 basis points, and the economy is in shambles. (The last time rates went this low was in December 2008, during the financial crisis.)

So the apparent growth in GDP is clearly not as strong as it seems. But there is more to consider. Let’s look at the federal deficit during this period.

In 2007 the Treasury owed $8.9 trillion. The total federal debt now stands at $24.9 trillion! The Federal deficit has ballooned out by $16 trillion.

The Fed has increased its assets by $6.2 trillion, the nation’s annual GDP has grown by $5.5 trillion, and the federal debt has grown by $16 trillion.

That sounds a bit scary. If I just keep borrowing money so that my balance sheet is getting bigger and bigger, am I getting wealthier?

Of course not. That is not a creation of true wealth. It is a creation of true debt.

Borrowed Money = Market Bubble = Growing Wealth Gap

This is what I am referring to when I talk about funny money.

The huge injections of borrowed funds simply pushed up the value of assets like stocks, without the underlying economic growth that should really be driving the stock market.

It led to the bubble conditions of the stock market as well as a massive increase in wealth inequality. What do I mean by that?

Only 53% of Americans own stocks, and the greatest percentages of stock ownership are concentrated in the wealthiest 10%. So the giant rally in the stock market since 2007 only helped out a very small segment of society.

Today, the stock market’s valuations are truly extraordinary. The P/E ratios – which measure how much investors are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings – point to fantastic growth rates and an economy that is humming on all cylinders.

They are not discounting an economy that just needed over $5 trillion of emergency bailout spending. They are not discounting an unemployment rate that will still be in double digits at year end.

For example, take employment in New York City, the hub of the largest metropolitan economy in the country. The only industry that will see an increase in net employment over the next 18 months is the education/health industry.

By the end of 2021, leisure and hospitality employment rates will still be 30% lower than in January of this year, according to Alexandre Tanzi from Bloomberg.

Manufacturing will be about the same as leisure and hospitality. Mining will be down by about 15%, transportation will be down by 13%, IT will be down by 6%, and financial services will be down by 6%.

This means that consumption will be better than today for sure, but it will be much lower than at the end of 2019.

Borrowing Has Limits… Avoid the FOMO

In closing, the central bank and the Treasury do have limits, as much as they may not want to admit it. At some point borrowers will resist any further debt issuance by the Treasury, and that would be a very scary point.

Savings rates will be higher, consumption lower, and taxes higher. Unemployment will remain stubbornly high.

Federal borrowing will start to crowd out money that would otherwise go towards investment. The Fed will finally have to restrain its balance sheet and start to reduce its size. And the trajectory of long-term economic growth will be more modest.

This is not a great environment for risky assets, so please try to be patient. Try to avoid the FOMO, the fear of missing out.

At a minimum, we will see a correction of 10% from current levels in the S&amp;P 500. Potentially, we will see a second wave of violent selling that will melt down to new lows.

The currencies should eventually start to behave more rationally as well. They are stretched out to ridiculously mispriced levels, but we need to respect the market – even when it is irrational.",finance

It's not a secret that the hottest trade for Institutions over the course of the low interest oughts, has been the Carry Trade. 

A trade that works just fine if the Home currency goes down, but gets all but wiped out if it goes up against the carried currency.

Carry Trades are implicitly tied to debt. Almost every crisis we have surrounds debt in some way - its why the Fed focuses on QE and the like.

But you can protect debt 2 important ways right now: buy debt on the market, and make sure the existing debt doesn't default.

If the Fed and major Institutions worked together they could (and in my opinion have) artificially hold down the Dollar, even in the midst of a crisis that calls for all a crash, and a dollar surge.

investing,[FT] Hedge funds fear another reckoning for global stocks,"&gt;**Investment managers say asset prices are too detached from harsh economic realities**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hedge funds are getting ready for another slide in stock markets after growing uneasy that surging prices do not reflect the economic problems ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some managers fear that equity investors — used to buying the dips during the decade-long bull market that ended in March’s sharp sell-off — have become too complacent about how quickly economies can recover from the pandemic and how effective stimulus packages from central banks and governments can be.  
&gt;  
&gt;The S&amp;P 500 index completed its best 50-day run in history on Wednesday, said LPL Financial, closing within 8 per cent of its record high of mid-February.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The markets are priced to perfection,” said Danny Yong, founding partner at hedge fund Dymon Asia Capital in Singapore. “The stability in equity markets does not reflect the job losses and the insolvencies ahead of us globally.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Yong has been buying put options — which protect against market falls by allowing their owner to sell at a predetermined price — on stock indices and also on currencies sensitive to risk appetite such as the Australian dollar and the Korean won.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I believe we will see new lows in global equity markets later this year,” he added. “As March . . . has shown us, prices cannot diverge from fundamentals for too long.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Other hedge fund managers have expressed concerns about the sharp rebound in stocks from the March lows.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller, a protégé of George Soros who stepped back from managing outside money a decade ago, recently said he expected a wave of bankruptcies and that a V-shaped economic recovery was a “fantasy”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which has $40bn in assets, wrote in its most recent letter to investors that, since the impact of the economic downturn was greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis, “our gut tells us that a 50 per cent or deeper decline from the February top might be the ultimate path of global stock markets”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fund made money during the first-quarter crash from hedges in stocks and credit, and said it was trying to find new ways of protecting itself against another market fall after some hedges became more expensive.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite bleak economic data — including more than 40m Americans filing for unemployment benefits and an expected record contraction in the eurozone economy in the second quarter — the S&amp;P 500 has surged almost 40 per cent since its trough in March, leaving it down just 3 per cent for the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The index is now trading at more than 22 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet figures, taking the common valuation measure back to levels not seen since the early 2000s.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Yong believes investors could soon discover that the so-called “Fed put” — the concept that the central bank will step in to support markets — may be reaching its limits.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Some people believe the Fed’s unconventional measures are limitless but this is not the case,” he said. “It's now about the “Trump Put” — how much more stimulus can he push through? I think he \[President Donald Trump\] will be constrained by Democrats in the House.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that its hedge-fund clients held a net short position of about $40bn in Euro Stoxx 50 futures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Global macro hedge funds have sharply reduced their exposures to stocks this year, according to JPMorgan Cazenove.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It is entirely possible that there will be a fourth-quarter reckoning, where a second wave of job losses and a prolonged period of business failures tests equity sentiment,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;Francesco Filia, head of London-based hedge fund Fasanara Capital, is holding 70 per cent of his fund in cash and also using put options and other instruments to hedge his portfolio while he waits for a “severe rupture” in markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;He sees threats in the trend towards “deglobalisation,” which could drive inflation higher, and growing political interference in the technology sector, which could hurt shareholder returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;He expects a potential “2008-style . . . daily liquidity crisis” as investors try to pull money from exchange traded funds that may not be able to meet those redemptions.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, many fund managers are reluctant to bet outright against stocks in the face of stimulus efforts from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, both of which have argued they have firepower in reserve.  
&gt;  
&gt;The market hitting new lows “is possible”, said Tom Clarke, who has a low exposure to stocks at a macro fund at William Blair in London.  
&gt;  
&gt;But he added that government and central bank stimulus packages have “taken on almost mythical proportions. There’s no doubt in which direction policymakers want markets to go.”

For living in the south, it’s not really that bad and I can live well within that budget (I already have housing signed, bills in order, $5k emergency fund)

I think my total reimbursement (tuition + stipend) is under my schools maximum semester refund amount and I’ll be allowed to accept and use this fed loan money for “living expenses”.

personalfinance,Forbearance: am I f'ed??,"I have a question / concern I'm hoping to get some clarification on. Here is the background:

TL;DR: filled out form for info on forbearance, after not hearing anything for 6 weeks said I was approved, have made all payments on time and am now selling the house. Will it keep me from buying a new house?

The end of March my wife was furloughed. We didn't know any details as to how long so out of caution I filled out a form for forbearance options with our mortgage company (Ameris).

We continued to make our mortgage payments as usual.

6 weeks after I filled out the form with Ameris I got an email saying I was approved for forbearance. They never sent anything and I never signed any forms related to it. At this point we had already moved cross country (my wife got a transfer with her company) and listed our house for sale.

I just looked at our credit report and the mortgage account is listed as:

Open / never late. Deferred, payment date not reported.

Then it shows ""current on payments"" for each month

And at the bottom it says, ""comment: affected by natural or declared disaster""

We're scheduled to close on selling our house next week and were hoping to start looking for a house out here shortly after. But I read something about not being able to get a mortgage for 12 months if your previous mortgage was approved for forbearance?

Anyone have any insight about our situation -- kinda freaking out that I really f'ed things up even though I was just trying to explore my options!

Due to the current interest rates, I thought I might poke in to refinancing my house for a better rate. When I called my mortgage company, they suggested the best thing for me is to change from a 30 year to a 15 year loan as I already apparently have a pretty good rate (conventional mortgage at 3.75%). I purchased my house for $95,000 approximately 5 years ago with a USDA loan. Currently my balance is at 85,000. I pay more in interest than I do the balance according to the letter I get each month detailing payments. I currently have everything rolled in to my monthly payment: taxes, insurance, and mortgage. My monthly payment is $750 and some change. I pay $800 a month to chip away at it a little more. I inquired what my payment would be if I switched from a 30 year to a 15 year. He told me my payment would only go up $50 from the extra I'm paying now (so $850 a month). We plan on staying here about 5 more years before purchasing our dream home. (My husband pays $600 a month in child support so we are sort of waiting that out so we have a better idea of what our finances will be once it's complete.) As a side note, my husband brings home about 1400 bi-weekly and I currently stay home with our 1 year old. I'm trying to grow my design and farm businesses but they don't bring in much $$$ right now because they are both ""babies"".

Now, my husband owes about $20,000 in student loans. It's not a private loan so the interest rates aren't insane or anything like that. I owe about $3,000 in my own loans. Same situation, public/government loans.

personalfinance,Refinance from 3.625% to 2.75% with points?,"My wife and I just recently bought our house in November (6 months ago). We got a good rate at 3.625 and the monthly payment is $3300 (adding a little extra to principal because round numbers are nice). I've been considering refinancing and just got some offers today.  One saves $124/month and the other $84/month, but both use points to drop the rate. The plan would be to continue paying $3300, just paying the additional extra to the principal. This is likely our ""forever home"", so we're staying here for the foreseeable future. 

Essentially, is it worth it to refinance to drop the monthly payment while significantly increasing the loan amount?

personalfinance,"Personal Loan Opportunity - good interest rate, should I use it to invest","So I recently got a notification from my bank, a small online based bank (which I love btw) that I was pre-qualified for a loan, advertised with 4.99% APR. I was curious, so I followed the prompts, it let me know that I qualify for a loan up to $13,000 with different APR depending on how much of that amount, and payment plan I choose.  So here are three examples, however they gave me like 6. 

 $1314/mo if paid in a 1yr @ 8.16% APR interest about $582 **(shortest commitment)**

$415/ mo if paid in 3yrs @ 9.42% APR interest about $2K

$261/mo if paid off in 6yrs @ 10.16% APR interest about $5.8K (**longest commitment)** 

The APR given in all the ranges are lower than one credit card I have with a balance, so there’s a positive thing already. I’ve considered just getting the amount of that current debt to just get a 10% lower APR, but I’m also trying to think ahead.  Like why not invest in something that could potentially give me a return to where I can pay off the required balance and make some extra $.

personalfinance,Reverse mortgage maximum - principal limit factor question.,"Age 62, House value 330k. No spouse.  I found that HUDs Principal loan factor seems to be around 47% for current interest rates, for age 62, yet when I go to estimators run by lenders they usually limit it to under 100k fixed rate loan. (But higher for variable rate lines of credit.) So 2 questions

\-why is max loan so much higher for variable rate lines of credit vs lump sum

\-why aren't lenders offering the 47% of 333,000 as lump sum, which is closer to 165,000, less large fees so perhaps 145,000?  They are offering under 100,000.

Here is one example. Note that for variable rate you could borrow 85k up front, and then have immediate access (or 1 year wait?) for an additional 69,000 for a total of 175,000 vs. only 68,000 upfront for a lump sum....over 100,000 less!

personalfinance,Could use advice paying credit debt in the face of an uncertain future.,"Hello! I currently have $3,150 worth of debt outstanding on a card with a $4000 line of credit. I pay it currently at a rate of $200 per month (minimum due is $97) until I can figure out a real strategy, but monthly interest adds $64, so realistically it's not going away quickly. My main reasoning for wanting to get rid of it is the detrimental effect it's having on my credit score. I don't need a line of credit for anything right now.

Here are my current checking/savings finances, as of the beginning of June and projected for the end of June:

1st June Checking: $2,444.45

1st June Savings: $3,500

June Income: $3,086.50

June Expenses: $2,634 (this includes a $400 transfer from checking into savings)

1st July Projected Checking: $2,896.95 (+452.50)

1st July Projected Savings: $3,900 (+400)

My monthly income is... in flux right now, since I'm back at work part time. I work in a restaurant in Texas that is operating at half capacity right now, and the results are mixed. Due to a general decrease in business, I only work 2 or 3 shifts per week. It seems to vary as to whether I qualify for the federal $600/wk unemployment. The projection above assumes a worst-case scenario, where I make just baaaaaarely enough at work to not qualify for the federal unemployment for either of the last two weeks of the month. In a best-case scenario, add at least $837.50 to the July 1st checking projection.

Hopefully this is enough information to get some advice: how and when should I pay this credit debt down? I've been spending radically less money during COVID than I used to (alcohol, eating out, frivolous bullshit), which is wonderful as well as sustainable for me, so I definitely have less expense going out on a monthly basis than I'm used to. My total income hasn't been too radically affected from pre-COVID days thanks to the current federal +600.

My inclination to plan for some sort of worst case scenario in July (when the federal unemployment expires, and if our business hasn't picked up) has kept me from taking any kind of dramatic action against my credit debt. I have a few possible plans of attack now that I've sat down and really figured out all the numbers, but I'd really love to hear from y'all.",finance

When I was around 13, like many gamers, I toyed with the idea of getting into game design and they started yelling at me and crying because they didn't see it as being any different from someone who works on an assembly line in a toy factory screwing in plastic parts, and they thought that was beneath me. They also scoffed whenever I mentioned that games could have stories as good as any novel or film, because they thought that all games were just ""get points, go through levels, beat the bad guy,"" and had no intellectual value.

personalfinance,Traditional IRA conversion and after tax contributions,"I have some questions about (i) converting to a Roth IRA after contributing to a Traditional IRA with after tax dollars, and (ii) converting the entirety of my Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA in the same year.

Background:

* Currently I have both a traditional IRA ($6k) and a Roth IRA ($13k), both held at Fidelity.
* My FY19 MAGI is just entering the phase out range for the Roth IRA contributions ($124k).
* I expect that for the next 5 years, my salary will continue to increase.
* I'm 29 years old and plan to contribute to a IRA for the rest of my working career (at least 20 years).

Situation:

Based on my understanding, to contribute the full $6k this year to my Roth IRA, I will need to contribute those funds to the Traditional IRA using after tax dollars and then convert that contribution to a Roth IRA. Upon doing this conversion, I'll have to go through the pro-rata rule which would mean that \~32% ($6k/$19k) would be considered pre-tax and I would be taxed on this amount. Given that I'm close to the phaseout already, and I plan to contribute in the future, I think it makes sense to convert the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA at this time.

My question are - Tactically - how do I do this?

1. What is the correct order of operations here? Do I make my current year contribution ($6k) to my Traditional IRA and then move over the entire Traditional IRA account ($12k)? Wouldn’t this result in higher taxable amount since I'd be close to 50/50 taxable/total IRA balance?
2. The pro-rata rule is only IRA balances correct? I have a 50/50 split in my Traditional 401k and Roth 401k, and believe it is only IRA balances but would like to confirm.
3. Can I do this conversion today, and have it apply for FY19? Both my state and federal have changed the contribution deadline to 7/15, but I can't seem to find that conversions are explicitly stated as allowable during that same window (State is NY if it makes a difference).
4. Is there a way for me to figure out how much tax I will owe on all of this ahead of time?
5. How do I pay taxes on this? I think I do the conversion through IRS form 8606, and the current year contribution/re-characterization wouldn't be applicable. Is that correct?

We have been told that QE doesn't cause inflation because too much money went into the hands of the wealthy and fuelled asset bubbles.

But, the 4 most hated words in finance are here: this time is different. There are 2 reasons: money given to the people (PUA/PPP) and supply chains being broken.

So many supply chains have been disrupted worldwide. This is something that did NOT happen with the 2008 crisis. All these people at meat plants getting infected with the coronavirus, the shutdowns of manufacturing plants earlier in China, etc...not to mention the looting in the US. All of these factors reduce supply and therefore raise prices.

TLT was cliff-diving today, and if my prediction is right, the crash is just getting started. Much, much more is to come. Yields can spike back to pre-COVID levels and the 10 year can yield 2+% again. People who hold long bonds will lose double digits real quick in this scenario and you would have a TLT bear market (-20% from recent highs).

This will force the Fed to end QE and let bonds roll off their balance sheet as they mature while even inducing them to raise rates again. Because remember the 1970s, once inflation takes hold, it would be insanely difficult to control it.

My parents suggested that I put it into a CD, though it is pretty much risk free the interest rates right now are stupid low. I thought about the idea of investing it into the stock market but that is also high risk and I don't have much experience. Obviously I don't want to have too much risk involved but I'd like to see if I can use this opportunity to grow that money while I wait to buy a house. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance
investing,My investment journey (plus: a way to ride out a volatile market),"I know there are a lot of people scared, a lot of newbies wanting advice as they enter the market (with some overlap with the first group), a lot of people whose retirement accounts have suffered a hit (ditto), etc. There's a lot of angsty stress in discussions between bulls and bears, not only on this sub but on sites like SeekingAlpha. Hedge fund managers and other pundits are preparing for the best and the worst. Who do you believe? What do you do?

You keep a level head. You don't worry about how you'll be perceived by others or opportunities you may have missed, in particular opportunities that may take technical expertise or risk more than you should pragmatically support. You realize that the market is uncertain and deal with it. 

I went through an expensive divorce which essentially wiped out my assets, and afterward was not in a position to save much. I had no retirement assets whatsoever until early 2019, when I started aggressively saving in a Roth 401k at my current job. My wife was in a better position, having saved in her pension plan and 403b for many years (like a 401k, but for public employees), but as it turned out when I investigated her fund had been badly mismanaged to the point of barely offsetting inflation (this was not her fault but her negligent plan administrator's). She also had a Roth IRA but without much money in it. I had a couple of small retirement accounts left over from prior jobs, plus a Roth 401k to which I was maxing out contributions. We also had some cash from a divorce settlement and some other odds and ends. This was in late 2019. 

I have a runway of 15-20 years until retirement, and decided it was time to take charge of the situation and ensure that our retirement plan was sound before it was too late. I began studying investing in earnest. I've taken these steps: 

* Made sure I was maxing out my Roth 401k contributions at $19,500 per year

 * A Roth 401k lets one devote a larger percentage of one's compensation to retirement saving, and all growth is tax-free after that point. It also lets one roll the entire amount into a Roth IRA, the gold standard of retirement accounts. Since I was wanting to accelerate my savings and take advantage of my current high earnings anyway, I was willing to take the hit on current tax savings I'd experience with a traditional 401k. My retirement plan hinges partly on getting as much money into my Roth IRA as possible. 

* Chose TD Ameritrade to consolidate our accounts 

 * I highly recommend this broker. They have zero fees on most trades, low latency even during peak times, excellent screening and tracking tools, and few restrictions on what you can do within a tax-advantaged retirement account. 

* Established a traditional IRA for my wife, and one for me

* Made maximum contributions to the traditional IRA for my wife and me, for both 2019 and 2020 

* Created a Roth IRA for both my wife and me

* Transferred all the money from the traditional to the Roth IRAs for both my wife and me (this is called a backdoor Roth conversion, and was necessary because of our income levels)

* Established a brokerage account with our remaining cash

* Began increasing my investment knowledge, including research on a wide array of stocks, funds and options strategies

 * In addition to the screening tools at TD Ameritrade, I subscribed to simplywall.st (this is an interesting site that does a good job of visualizing aspects of a company's performance for stocks only)

 * I now have a Google Sheets spreadsheet of stocks I track, and another for funds (ETFs, mutual funds and CEFs)

 * I also began boning up on day and swing trading strategies, including a wide array of predictive metrics

* In late February of 2020, I was lucky enough to realize there was going to be a correction. I got lucky enough to credit some authors and indicators I was just learning about at the time.

* I moved our 401k and 403b completely to high-yielding bond funds in February. By March I was moving my wife's 403b in installments back to stock mutual funds, and my 401k in one fell swoop back to 80% in a large-cap growth fund similar to QQQ (I'm restricted in that account to one rebalancing per quarter). 

* Our Roth IRAs were created just in time for the lows in March. By this time I'd done a lot of homework and was tracking various companies with steady dividends like LNVGY and IBM, plus a lot of REITs. With COVID-19 such a concern, I'd done a lot of research on how to tackle this market, which I'll explain more about in a moment. 

* Though I'd never traded options before and was apprehensive, I options-enabled our Roth IRAs. I have managed to boost our returns by selling puts in some cases before entering positions, and selling covered calls after taking them. 

* I started buying stocks in March with a high degree of fear and uncertainty. This led me to fragment our portfolio to a large degree; if anything, we were over-diversified, if that's possible. There were certain stocks that were ""flight"" securities at the time, and at least temporarily solid (GEO being one of them as an example--at the time it was offering a solid dividend with no downturn in the immediately foreseeable future, and trading at fire-sale prices, so I bought despite the long-term regulatory risk). I bought those and many others which I spread across sectors as well as possible, and I tracked all of them obsessively and daily. 

 * I did not invest in any funds at all outside of our 401k/403b at this time, because I wanted to hand-pick stocks with the highest chances of recovering quickly and/or paying reliable dividends in the short term, and many funds were tanking. (I am not anti-fund in the slightest.) 

* This was followed by a period where, as certain of the stocks would go up in volatile fluctuations, I'd actively rotate money out of them into the best of the undervalued stocks. This period of active trading coincided with more research, and as I deepened in my knowledge of all those companies (about fifty of them to start) our holdings narrowed further.

As it stands right now, we're about 60% up on our IRAs and brokerage account since the start of the year, and about 20% up on our 401k/403b. I feel lucky and wanted to pass on a point of view to anyone wondering about dipping a toe in the market. I am not bragging--after I bought some stocks in March, they experienced a bounce, after which I continued to hold due to my basic strategy which I'll mention briefly below, but I second-guessed myself endlessly when they declined again. 

**Our short-term strategy**

In essence, we've bought REITs and some BDCs focusing almost entirely on past performance and pre-COVID projections of future performance. But we did so while knowing that the coronavirus and its consequences, including the Fed stimulus, would have ongoing effects that we couldn't predict. We realized that REITs are in essence the perfect short-term solution to this because of a few factors:

* REITs are the first to be sold during a panic, and among the last to be rebought. We figured this would happen again based on the 2008 recession, which was a lucky guess. But high-quality REITs are actually much more strongly positioned than in 2008 to ride out a much longer downturn. 

* REITs have higher dividends even during a good market than other dividend-paying companies due to their corporate structure, which requires passing on 90% of profits as dividends. This is heightened during a downturn, when even solid REITs may feature double-digit dividends. (And this makes them even better for a Roth IRA, of course.)

* By picking REITs undervalued because of panicky sentiment, inflamed by less astute ""analysts"" at places like SeekingAlpha, but well-positioned to survive, we could lengthen the period when DRIP would expand our investments even in a sideways or down market. As long as the dividends were paid in a majority of cases, a continued market depression was to be welcomed; with DRIP, the REITs would blossom like a field of tulips. 

* Since the REITs were so undervalued, they were all looking at 2-3X price upside as well, whenever the market as a whole began to recover. At that time we could sell and decide on the next phase of our plan, as we want to grow our retirement savings faster than the 14% average yield REITs tend to offer. 

We have a different aggressive growth strategy for use when we exit this downturn, by which time we'll have sold most of the REITs off, but we're not quite there yet. In any event, I hope this helps someone in some way. There are stlll some good REIT deals to be had, especially if you back into them by selling puts. Funds which increase returns by modest options trading may also be of interest during a volatile market, for those not interested in REITs.",finance

personalfinance,Taking out student loans to pay off my car?,"So here's the long and short of it. My car is bleeding me dry right now. I owe around $13,000 on it still, at a 9% interest rate. I've looked into refinancing, but since it's a 2011 model year, no one is willing to refinance it. And at $400/month, that's 25% of my monthly income, which is making setting aside an emergency fund nearly impossible (I've managed to get it up to $1,000, but even that took months to get). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm contemplating taking out the equivalent value in student loans, at an interest rate of 5%, and paying off the car. That will give me an extra $400/month to set to an emergency fund so I'm not sitting at the knife edge of disaster, and it's at a 4% lower interest rate, so it won't be nearly as painful to pay back. Other upside is that student loans tend to be more workable, with IBR, and that sort of thing, in order to help if caught in a bind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Downside of course, is that that will put me at around $50,000 in student loan debt. That being said, since I'll be working the whole time, I intend to take the money I'm paying towards the car, and put that towards my student loans whilst in school, and since I intend to graduate with an accounting degree, I should ideally be earning around $50,000 when I graduate, keeping me in line with the 1x entry level salary guideline by the time I graduate. So tell me, is this an awful idea like some people have told me, or not? 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Need some real advice,"Hi everyone. Looking for some real advice to start cleaning up the financial mess I've been making for myself pretty much my entire adult life. Without going into too much detail about all of the poor decisions I've made over the years, I'll just dive into my current situation. 

I'm a single 35 y/o guy looking to finally set things right with my finances. My biggest concerns at the moment are:

* **An upcoming tax bill.** I withdrew too much from my IRA when buying my condo last year without fully understanding where the taxes would be applied, which has caused me to owe approx $9400 between my federal and state taxes. I've plugged in all my numbers but I'm waiting until next month to file. I don't have $9400 readily available to pay. A painful, painful lesson learned--but a lesson learned nonetheless. 
* **Paying off some debt.**   
I have one credit card, with a balance of $6500. (22.9% APR)  
My student loan balance is an embarrassing  $101,937.79 (part of this is because of my uncertainty about what I wanted to get my masters in, and the other part is taking out more money than I actually needed) These are federal loans that have been consolidated and are with Navient. 
* **Building my savings account.** I currently only have about $1600 in a savings account. 

A little information about my budget:

My salary from my full-time job is **$70,000**  
After taxes, healthcare and retirement deductions, my take-home pay is $4032.44 monthly. I'm also bringing in $300-400/month for a consulting gig I recently picked up for a few months. 

Currently these are my expenses:

Mortgage	$888.39  
HOA		$532.00  
Electricity	$112.00  
Groceries	$200.00  
Gas		$50.00  
Car Insurance	$145.28  
Car Note	$203.00 (Car note will be paid off at the end of next year)  
Verizon		$206.45  
Comcast		$125.00  
Personal Loan	$435.14 (I have two more payments on this personal loan)  
Student Loan	$556.00  
Credit Card	$200.00  
Google Drive	$2.00  
iCloud Drive	$2.00  
Spotify		$10.00  
Netflix		$12.99  
Amazon Prime	$6.49  
Gym		$10.00  
Savings		$100.00  
Spending	$500.00

&amp;#x200B;

Because I can't pay my state &amp; federal tax bill when I file next month, I was thinking about taking out a loan in order to pay them in full (and possibly to pay off that credit card). Based on my research, I should be able to get a loan with a 10% APR. Is this the smartest approach? 

  
And are there any other suggestions you all might have for me going forward? Admittedly, I did not grow up in a household that gave me a foundation for finances, and I've been trying to figure things out on the way--often, making more mistakes in the process. I've been a reckless spender and have routinely lived beyond my means which has put me in the situation I'm in now. I've had to take a hard look in the mirror at myself and take ownership for where I am. It's very embarrassing being around my friends, who I know have been smarter with their finances than me. And honestly, my situation makes me not even want to be around them because I feel inferior. 

There are things that I really want to have the flexibility to do in the coming years, including renovating my condo, traveling and somewhere down the line buying a larger home. But at the moment I have more pressing financial obligations. And I just need some help prioritizing. My finances have been one of the biggest sources of stress, and with this pandemic I'm even more nervous of what would happen if I were to lose my job. Thanks for all the help you can provide.",finance

personalfinance,How can I find out if an IRA contribution in 1985 was deductible or non-deductible?,"My wife has on IRA with Citibank that contains a 2-year ""retirement"" CD earning a measly 0.70% APY.  The IRA account was opened 1985-04-16 and the account has been left to have the CD auto-renew again and again for 35 years.  From what I understand the interest rates were better back then.  The next maturity date is 17 months away and Citibank will assess an early withdrawal penalty of 180 days simple interest on the CD if she should choose to withdraw the funds.  Considering the opportunity cost of waiting until maturity, and the risk of forgetting again, we have decided to immediately roll over the funds to a new IRA to be opened at an outside investment firm and invest the funds in something better.  Citibank will charge $75 fee to create a check and they don't offer direct-rollover.  The receiving institution has offered to reimburse the $75.  We are trying to decide whether we should rollover the funds to a Traditional IRA or convert to a Roth IRA.

Here's my question: How can I find out if the original contribution in 1985 was deductible or non-deductible?  She has no idea and I'm guessing it was deductible, given the account opening date and I've seen the suggestion to open an IRA at tax preparation time.  But how can we find out?  I am considering filing IRA Form 4506-T to request a Form 5498 series transcript, hoping they will include information about whether a Form 8060 filed, but Form 4506-T says that transcript information is only available for up to 10 years.  Is there another approach I could take?  Does anyone know if tax code allowed for non-deductible contributions back then?

Also, anything to know about the paper check process?  Assuming the IRA contained deductible (untaxed) funds and we decide to rollover to a traditional IRA, I read that 20% taxes will be withheld -- is there an option to avoid that (Citibank does not offer direct rollover)?",finance

Infrastructure investment has received renewed interest as of late, with both President Trump and some Members of Congress discussing the benefits of such spending. Infrastructure can be defined in a number of ways depending on the policy discussion; in general, however, the term refers to longer-lived, capital-intensive systems and facilities, such as roads, bridges, and water treatment facilities.

Over the past several decades, government investment in infrastructure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has declined. Annual infrastructure investment by federal, state, and local governments peaked in the late 1930s, at about 4.2% of GDP, and since has fallen to about 1.5% of GDP in 2016. State and local governments consistently spend more on infrastructure directly than the federal government. In 2016, direct federal spending on nondefense infrastructure was less than 0.1% of GDP, whereas state and local spending was about 1.4% of GDP. However, the federal government transfers some funds each year to state and local governments for capital projects, which includes infrastructure projects, equaling about 0.4% of GDP in 2016. The United States also lags many other developed countries with respect to annual infrastructure spending. Spending on infrastructure, as a percentage of GDP, is higher in all G7 countries, except for Italy and Germany, than in the United States.
Infrastructure is understood to be a critical factor in the health and wealth of a country, enabling private businesses and individuals to produce goods and services more efficiently. With respect to overall economic output, increased infrastructure spending by the government is generally expected to result in higher economic output in the short term by stimulating demand and in the long term by increasing overall productivity. The short-term impact on economic output largely depends on the type of financing (whether deficit financed or deficit neutral) and the state of the economy (whether in a recession or expansion). The long-term impact on economic output is also affected by the method of financing, due to the potential for “crowding out” of private investment when investments are deficit financed. The type of infrastructure is also expected to affect the impact on economic output. Investments in core infrastructure, defined as roads, railways, airports, and utilities, are expected to produce larger gains in economic output than investments in some broader types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and other public buildings.

Changes in economic output are expected to have subsequent effects on employment; as such, infrastructure investments are likely to impact employment as well. Recent research suggests modest reductions in the unemployment rate in response to increased infrastructure investment. Again, it is expected that the method of financing and state of the economy will alter these impacts. Recent research has suggested that deficit-neutral investments are less likely to affect employment, whereas deficit-financed investments are expected to reduce unemployment in the short term. Additionally, recent economic research suggests that during an economic expansion, with a relatively strong labor market, infrastructure investments are unlikely to have any sustained impact on the unemployment rate. However, during a recession, the same investment is likely to reduce the unemployment rate to some degree, research suggests.",finance
investing,What to Make of the Rebound in the U.S. Jobs Report,"Many of the gains came in restaurant work as 2.5 million jobs were added in May and the unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent. 

“The economy is still being very much buffered by stimulus,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “When that starts to wane, we will learn a lot more about the underlying health of the recovery.”

The Labor Department cautioned that data-collection issues troubling the agency throughout the crisis continued last month. Some temporarily jobless workers were characterized as employed in May; had they been counted correctly, the department said, the unemployment rate would have topped 16 percent.

The official unemployment rate also leaves out many people who are not actively looking for jobs or are working reduced hours. A broader measure of unemployment and underemployment, which includes those groups, was 21.2 percent in May, down from April but higher than any other month on record. 

More than half of the month’s job gains — 1.4 million — were in restaurants and bars, many of which received assistance under the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Friday’s report suggests that the program, along with other elements of the government’s response, helped offset at least some of the economic damage caused by the shutdown, which should allow for a faster recovery.

The first column seems to show this, I’m thinking aloud here so please correct me 

The bond ratings on the right of bonds, from best credit to worst, a time series of dates from before covid to 6/1. showing yield going up compared to treasury yield. This is the yield of corporate bonds compared to treasury bonds. Yield of corporate bonds compared to 10 year treasury is going up, meaning the difference between corporate bond yield and 10 year treasury yield is HIGHER, indicting that there is less trust in corporate bonds.

This chart does not show the actual corporate bond yields going up, right? When yields go up; prices come down. I don’t understand why bond prices would come down. Is it due to sell off? Is it due to interest rate change? Wouldn’t prices go UP in a crisis and thus yields would go down? 

Second column; even more confusing. It says yield on treasury. I have no ideas what this yield on treasury is supposed to mean. Is it the yield US treasuries are producing? If so, how is there B rated US treasuries?

I’m assuming it compared the corporate bond yields to US treasury yields in some way, but I don’t understand how, since didn’t we do that in the previous column?",finance

Looking at the last jobs report ‘household data’ it seems the US gained c.2m jobs but the actual method is actually surveying 60k householders and extrapolating the number according to different ratios to the whole population (that what I understood, correct me if i am wrong). 
On the other hand we have the jobless claims which I consider hard data (we dont have alot of those in term of quality since most data points are lagging and survey-based while this is not) since people actually get something and claiming benefits.
I would actually weigh the jobless claims data over BLS data, but apparently the market sees it differently maybe because of the size of the surprise + fomo + fed.

I feel this is an overreaction. Happy to hear your thoughts.",finance

investing,Warren Buffett might still be right about the airlines,"*""In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but, in the long run, it is a weighing machine"" -Benjamin Graham*

Warren Buffett has taken some heat recently over his decision to sell all of his airline stocks near their lowest point. Amid investor optimism for the return of  ""normal"" travel behavior, airline stock prices took flight, so to speak, as a primary beneficiary of this exuberance. This has every investor with a Robinhood account sitting on his couch thinking he is smarter than perhaps the greatest investor of our time. But is he?

* Warren Buffett is not a short-term swing trader, he is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. He looks at the prospects of a company 20 to 30 years down the road, not 2-3 months
* Airlines represented a significant, but relatively small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Taking a loss on an industry that is in turmoil for the chance to redeploy in another industry with clearer skies ahead is more in line with the investing philosophy that made him a success
*  Armchair investors think to themselves, ""Well, people won't stop flying"", I'll buy AAL, UAL, and DAL. While that is certainly true in the broad sense, think about the practical sense. Airlines need to squeeze every dollar out of every flight to remain profitable. Under the ""new normal"", not only might the incredibly important Middle Seat be in jeopardy, but the ridiculously profitable Business Class seat is also going to see massive declines as more and more business is conducted remotely.
*  With cash burn rates in the double-digit millions of dollars PER DAY, many major U.S. airlines are only in business due to federal government bailout money -- one of the conditions of which was that they keep paying their employees that are not doing much flying (or revenue generation) these days.
* While it is a near certainty that ""people won't stop flying"", there is no certainty about who will be doing the flying. When the bailout money is gone, the cash is depleted, and the revenues are a fraction of where they need to be, a company goes bankrupt. It is entirely possible that one or even two of the major U.S. airline carriers never get their head above water again. Which ones? (\*Casually glances at American and United\*) I'm not sure, BUT, what I am sure about, is that Warren Buffett has access to way more information about the companies he invests in than you or me.
* Last Thursday, while AAL stock was almost doubling, 14 of its top officers VOLUNTARILY took buyouts to leave the company. Now, ask yourself -- why would anyone in their right mind in a leadership role at a prominent U.S. company with a huge salary and comfy corner office voluntarily leave that company and deny themselves the personal glory of being part of a turnaround story? 

**My advice:** Take your profits now and buy yourself something nice -- like stock in a company that actually has massive future growth and profit potential. And do not think that you are smarter than Warren Buffett.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.

# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there’s a drop in continuing clams, after May’s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.
*****
&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.
*****
&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.
*****
&gt; “I think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “With cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody — all facets of the financial markets — are sort of suggesting the same outcome.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.
*****
&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.
*****
&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.
*****
&gt; “When GDP is minus 30%, other issues don’t matter. There’s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,” said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. “I think we’ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn’t quite there but I think it’s coming.”
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.
*****
&gt; “Whey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?” Paulsen said. “They’re still going to support the economy. They’re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They’re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.”
*****
&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.
*****
&gt; “We think right now they’re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,” Harris said.
*****
&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. “I think it’s too early for that,” said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.
*****
&gt; “Yield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,” he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it’s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. “We’ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,” he said. “In my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.”
*****
&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.
*****
&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.

# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets

&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.

&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.

&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!

&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.

&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run

&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**

&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.

# Big Gains From Smaller Tech

&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**

&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the ""Big 5"" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.

&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the ""big 5"" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the ""big 5"" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).

&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!

# Best 50-Day Rally Ever

&gt; In many ways, what we’ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.

&gt; “There are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,” exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Here’s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What’s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.

# 2020 In Charts

&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we’ve ever seen. “2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.”
&gt; 
To best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.

&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don’t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We’ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn’t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.

personalfinance,I need help with Student Loan payments.,"So this is my current situation:

Private Student Loan

Total Principle Amount: $12,000

Interest Rate: 13.44%

Balance Remaining: $6070

Minimum Monthly Payment: $218

Extra Monthly Payment: $82

Notes: I’ve had the loan since 2016 and I’ve paid over $6000 in interest already. 

My question is, it does make sense to take out a personal loan for the remaining $6070 at 6.99%, right? The minimum monthly would be $118 a month for a 60 month term and the total interest paid would only be $1140 comparatively if I did only minimum payments. 

Any help or input would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,I (21) am confused about how to optimize my credit score and not bamboozle myself,"Hi!

I just got my first full-time, well paying job a few months ago and have been saving pretty religiously. I just got my first credit card to start building credit (DiscoverIT Secured) and am starting to use it for utilities to build credit. Here's where my problem comes into play. I am going to be purchasing a car in the next couple of weeks and am planning on putting a down payment on a house midway through next year. I want to finance the car even though I know I'll get a horrible interest rate bcz no credit so that I can start building credit so I don't get fucked next year when I get a house loan.

So here's my question, am I doing this right? Would it be better to just buy the car with cash and let my credit score increase with normal use? Would a car payment even increase my credit score (613) enough to get a good interest rate on a house in a year? Should I even be buying a house in this economy? Any answers or insight would be super appreciated, Thanks y'all!

personalfinance,Buying Rental Properties on Margin,"Hey everyone,
I’m looking for some feedback on an idea I’ve been having. For some context, I’m a 26 year old software engineer making approximately 140k a year plus some start up options that are worth some very speculative amount. I currently have around 160k invested in a personal brokerage account, around 40k in retirement savings with a 401k saving rate of 7% per pay period roughly, and no large debts. 
I’m currently with a broker that gives margin loans at 5%, which was too steep a rate for me to think of much creative to do with it. However, I found another broker that would offer me an interest rate of 1% on margin. My idea is to use this margin to buy a fully managed house on roof stock yielding roughly 4% a year after expenses and prior to any price change in the underlying. 
It seems to me like this is a no-brainer way to earn decent returns on other people’s money at a fairly low risk. In the chance that the house burns down or something, I could sell part of my portfolio to cover the margin, so I don’t go underwater even in the worst case. 
Is there something I’m missing here, or is this a good way to earn some additional passive income? Perhaps I should be weighing other options like low-vol shares with that money.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Apex token (CPX): My pick for moonshot and why,"Edit: for a good view on the current situation of the project I would refer to the latest update (which is very bullish) :

https://medium.com/@APEXTeam/apex-network-development-update-may-2020-561670c56735

and

https://medium.com/apex-technologies/apex-technologies-uses-blockchain-technology-combined-with-ai-to-achieve-cross-enterprise-data-7e75052b2aa7

So I wanted to make this post purely to inform people of a nifty chance to get in before this project fires off. Of course there always are risk and even this project can eventually be a failure so ofc, this isn't any financial advice...
That being said, I do think this is one of the few remaining projects that has the potential to really moon and I'll give my explanation here below. 

So first off, what is CPX and why blockchain?
CPX is basically the currency of the blockchain of apex technology. Apex technology is a company that has offices all around the world and is based in Shanghai (China) that focuses on consumer data technology. It uses its own proprietary ai technology to do this (NEXUS) and with CPX as it's base layer it introduced decentralization towards the consumer data market. Remember Facebook and Cambridge analytics? And the gdpr? With CPX apex decentralized and anonymizes consumer data. It also creates a market for both consumers to sell their data (which now is given freely!) And companies to buy/trade data (with permission from the consumers). Companies can get their data while complying privacy laws, consumers (finally) get a (financial) reward for selling data. 

Now the cherry on the top is, that CPX also involves AI technology to make all of this happen. Data gets encrypted and sorted out by AI, the data companies get are still useful for marketing purposes while - once again - complying to privacy laws. This is called AI federated learning. 

Now I haven't ofc explain it 100%, best is to go to the website of CPX and read the white paper and the many medium posts that has been released ever since then. And that latter is a thing. 

Even during the bear market, CPX has been evolving and has been sharing it's development with the public. It has seemed that even while prices are WAY below ICO prices, it hasn't affected development. Reasons for that is that CPX technology already was a company with clients and a good flow of income. So it isn't 100% reliant on the income through their crypto department, instead crypto is added as a new service to deliver consumers data while adjourning privacy laws and simplifying getting consumer data for companies. 

Now again I Implore to do some own research on their website and medium posts:

https://apexnetwork.io/

https://medium.com/apex-network

Edit: latest update and a good one to give you an idea on the current status of the project: https://medium.com/@APEXTeam/apex-network-development-update-may-2020-561670c56735


Here is a medium post on the golden goose of CPX:
https://medium.com/apex-network/apex-network-federated-learning-general-development-progress-cce61a6f96d3

CPX has a mainnet but the tokens are still on the NEO network. CPX mainnet can be seen working through their website though, Including an explorer. 

With that being said, what If you don't care about all that? What if you only think about the price? Let Me first sum up the cons I perceive:

* Mainnet is launched but only internal (sort of test net). Tokens still are on the neo network. Tokens swap is still duo without a precise date. 
* Price has fallen enormously. It went even below it's ICO price. This has killed any enthousiasm early investors had as they saw their money vaporize away 
* CPX has been in development and a lot progress has been made - according to them. While pilots have been run according to the dev team, it still is waiting for the product to fully launch. 
* CPX is not on major exchanges and so volume is very low.
* It has a centralized team as it's basically a company product (though the blockchain itself is decentralized as is it's consensus protocol). 


Now why is CPX interesting for price appreciation?
* Price has double bottomed out and now is on a rise. 
* Price is still very much below ICO price and all time high
* CPX was launched at the cross point of the bear to bull market, so it never really reached it full 'bullrun 2017' price increase, meaning its ATH is actually not it's ceiling
* CPX token swap still has to occur (this usually leads to a pump - followed with a dump moment)
* CPX is not on any major exchange! Any listing would mean a huge price increase. Think in the old days of ICO tokens buying on ether delta to sell it when it got listed on a major exchange. 
* Company behind CPX already has working products with clients, and some of them have run a pilot on the blockchain project. This increases the chance of CPX being used once everything (especially federated learning) is launched

A TL:DR
CPX is a legit project with a good use case that currently is severely underappreciated. It currently has no major listening, is low in volume and has double bottomed out. It's market capitalization currently is barely 2 million, giving it a huge grow potential. I personally think this is a hidden gem and it has a much higher potential in price appreciation then most other (crypto) assets. It's risks are semi mitigated since  the company behind CPX already has a flow of income through it's regular consumer data technology products. CPX will be a part of their product line up. Once mainnet is launched to the public and it gets listed on a major exchange, this token has the potential to basically 'moon' (ie. 50x to even 500x). 

A disclaimer, I do own CPX of course but its less then 5% of my portfolio. I just think the potential in price increasement of this token is really amazing and I wanted to share this to crypto community on reddit. It's a crypto where 50 bucks could become $5000 or it could become  20 bucks (around it's previous bottom). I think that risk is definitely worth it with CPX.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Oh man oh man car finance,"Okay so I recently bought a vehicle. I make $19.60/hour and I was approved to finance through the dealership for a ~22,000 car which was great because I didn’t have a co-signer.

stocks,Bears be gone! Why the markets recovery actually makes sense.,"I made this post after seeing a lot of people exasperated at the market because. ""the market doesn't make any sense"" or ""WTF THE FED IS BULL SHIT"". I'll do my best to explain whats happening through my eyes.

Record unemployment levels, loss of production. jobs that will never return, civil unrest across the country! The bears must be out licking up the tears of dead bulls on their way to being millionaires right? WRONG, as someone who has been a converted bear after years of conversion therapy let me explain why the market has risen in such a historic fashion. 

people who point to the money machine going BRRRRR, and jerome powell's infinite liquidity as the reason for the temporary inflation of the market, are largely missing the bigger picture. the real truth is that THE MARKET DOESN""T REFLECT THE ECONOMY. the market truly represents perceived future value of large market companies. The scary thing is, that whats driving up the market is actually bad for the economy.

[https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence#:\~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20we%20estimate%20Consumer,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20we%20estimate%20Consumer,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.)

that graphs shows consumer sentiment (measures confidence of the consumer in the market). note that it has been in steep decline over the course of the pandemic and is still at near lows. this is one of the largest gaps between consumer sentiment and market value in recent history. This is because the consumers ability to generate income for those companies doesn't match its perceived value .

one might be asking, ""so if its not inflation, and its not revenue returning due to the reopening whats brought the market back to near record highs?""

The sick reason why the perceived future values of many S&amp;P500 companies is due to one thing, the mass extinction of small businesses.

I'll be using Costco as an example (up 25% on the year) because they have been in a sneaky position to take advantage of the pandemic due to their unique business model. Costco's ability to secure large shipment deals directly from manufactures allows them to secure unbeatable deals for their customers, which is great in a time where consumer sentiment is low. on top of that their business venue allows them to provide an environment with 6 feet wide aisles, and enough PPE for their employees+. So this makes sense that Costco is well suited to thrive in the new environment. compare that to some small or even medium sized businesses in the same market, who not only already struggle to compete with their prices but also have to deal with new limited consumer spending due to social distancing and economic instability. 

These businesses get phased out because no one is able to compete with the larger companies, and this is happening all across the economy. It's not so much that theirs MORE money in the market, just that more of it is trickling into the companies that make the S&amp;P500 go up. All thats happening is the mass redistribution of wealth to large market companies. most notably the tech sector which now sees 5 companies making up 17.5% of the total S&amp;P [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/sp-500-dominated-by-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/sp-500-dominated-by-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook.html). So the V shaped recovery maybe a reality but it also means some grim stuff in the future.

TLDR: economy and market are 2 different things. small business will go out of business, and people go to companies that are best suited to provide  their services in the new world. With a future lack of competition the future perceived value of those larger companies goes up.

personalfinance,Buying a car with a credit card...is there any reason for me not to do this?,"My wife and I are looking to buy a new used car. Since we have the cash on hand, and the interest rate is not great for used cars, we had planned on paying for the car in cash. However, a dealership told us that paying for the car with a credit card is an option, and they do not charge any fees.

The idea of paying for the car with a credit card in this situation is attractive, as we’d get the points. We have a card with a high enough credit limit to cover what we’d want to pay for the car (though it would be close). While I understand our credit scores would take a temporary dip as we’d be utilizing a much higher portion of our credit than usual, our credit scores are high (low 800’s), and we don’t anticipate being in a situation where we’d need to have a good credit score (ex. taking out a loan of any kind) in the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,Dealing with old 401k recursive distribution hell,"I had $6000 in my 401k with my previous employer. They had a warning that if my balance went below $5000, they would distribute it. I procrastinated on rolling it over to my current employer 401k. On March 31, my balance in this account dipped to $4990 which caused them to issue a distribution after withholding state and federal taxes, about $3800.

I talked to them and asked if they could cancel that check and issue a rollover check. They asked me to send the check back. When I did, they put it back in the account and called it a ""rollover in"". Over the last month, I have called them multiple times and finally seemed like I was making headway towards having them reclaim the taxes and issue a rollover check to my current 401k trustee for the full $5000ish amount.

Yesterday, I received another check, this time for $3100, after withholding taxes from the $3800 balance. It looks like I'm stuck in a loop where they will keep issuing distributions taking more and more taxes out each time.

My concerns are as follows:

1. Looks like I may have already missed the 60 day deadline from the first distribution to even indirectly rollover the full amount. However, since the trustee treated my check sent back as a rollover in, I guess, I'll only owe taxes and penalty on the taxes withheld? Is that correct?

2. Do I owe penalties? Does the CARES act somehow allow me to avoid the early withdrawal penalty?

3. Do I have any recourse? Is there any agency like CFPB that I can go to?

cardano,All in Cardano!,"Cardano Monetary Policy - https://docs.cardano.org/cardano/monetary-policy/

There is a difference between the monetary policy of Bitcoin And Cardano.

1 BTC = 10^8 Sats
1 ADA = 10^6 Lovelaces

Interesting point to note is that all that will ever be are Sats and Lovelaces to buy and sell. We just call a dollar to be 100 cents for the sake of simplicity. 

Makes more sense to exchange in day to day life by buying food for $10 than 1000 cents. You won't have to take care of zeros for multiplication etc. 

Not knowing that there are less number of Lovelaces in 1 Ada than the number of Sats in BTC, creates a misconception that the total circulation of Cardano is greater in times than the total circulation of BTC. 

My thought - This misconception will render anyone not choosing Cardano as a better investment than BTC. Cardano is in an early stage where it is heavily undervalued. Anyone would be able to hold more share in the supply switching from BTC,ETH etc. 

Fact - more share you have in a confident supply, the better off you are than the rest. 

If, it solves decentralisation with scalability and security, which it is most likely to do sooner than later then, Cardano will gain more price action relative to bitcoin or even break Bitcoin's dominance because Bitcoin is only a store of value. 

Cardano is a buy for anyone looking for an investment in a revolution. ;) 

I sold 5 BTCs and went all in Cardano today as shelly launch was previously confirmed in July and it seems that Cardano will have Goguen launching sooner too with entering in rest of the Eras following it. 

I'd appreciate logical criticism.

personalfinance,Turning 30 in two weeks and I am far behind due to some bad decisions 2 years ago. Need advice to get back on the right track,"Disclosure: Discusses Gambling Addiction

Some background: I had a cushy job up until I was 27 and I left it after I made a lot of money trading. Prior to leaving I had $120k in my savings and $60k in my 401k. I was between jobs for about a year and I ended up getting in heavy debt while I was unemployed. Since I willfully resigned from my previous job I was not eligible for any unemployment. Long story short, I lost pretty much everything except the shirt on my back and my 401k as well. 

Over the past year I managed to pay off all debts and I now have about $50k saved up. My credit is in a healthy spot again and is currently 825. I only have $5.5k in my new 401k and about $600 in a ROTH IRA. My current salary is $90k and I did not receive a raise at my job since we had big layoffs. I don't think there is much upward mobility at this point and I'm looking on the side for a new job to increase my income. 

What do you recommend I do to get back on the right track with retirement? I am frugal with my monthly expenses and I have about $4k left over each month to work with. Is it worth it to contribute a larger amount to my 401k with the current state of the market?

I've thought about buying couple years used one but price difference is only about 1.5 to 2k and used ones have little above 20k miles so I thought the new was worth it.

The interest rate seem high so I asked them why the interest rate was so high and I was told that

since I have pretty short credit history and this loan being my 1st loan, the interest rate will be high due to no previous loan payment history. And I was also told that starting on my 2nd loan, interest rate will be much lower(around 2 to 4%) because there will be a loan history to back my credit score.

personalfinance,How to plan stock/real estate investments in light of anticipated inflation,"Forgive me if this has already been discussed, I couldn't find anything via the search bar. We are selling our home and anticipate we'll have enough for a down payment on a home for ourselves with some cash leftover to invest, but we can't decide whether to put the extra money entirely back into real estate or park it in an index fund like VTSAX and let it grow. Tentatively, we'll probably spend half on a down payment and invest the rest (either buy a second home or put it into VTSAX).

In addition to a general, ""how would you approach our situation?"" question, we have three questions for our own learning:

How will inflation affect real estate appreciation/investment over the next 5 years in light of the federal government's bailout? We assume that this (in addition to the low interest rates) means that taking out a mortgage now is probably a good idea if we were looking for a single family home that will appreciate for us over the next 10 years.

MachineLearning,[D] Is this a new technique? Aka Permutation Invariant One-Hot Encoding,"I'm making a neural network directed automated theorem prover. The theorem prover has state, a tree, that gets fed into the neural network and the network responds with how likely it believes that the current state is completable.

I've been toying around with different ways of representing variables. I would like the neural network to treat [alpha equivalent states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence) (that is, states that are the same except that different names were used) to be treated equivalently. For example, if your goal is to prove X and you know X, this is should be equivalent to the goal being Y and knowing Y.

The technique I've hit upon for doing this is using a one-hot encoding, but factorizing the matrices of the operations that operate on these variables. This means that there's a particular section of the hidden state that deals with storing variable information.

Semantically, the only useful information that you can derive from two variables is whether they are the same or not. So, if you are doing a linear operation, there are two different weights to capture: the weight between an input and output that represent the same variable and the weight between different variables.

In a bilinear operation, there are 5 weights to capture:

Assume i != j != k

| input 1 | input 2 | output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| i       | i       | i      |
| i       | i       | j      |
| i       | j       | i      |
| i       | j       | j      |
| i       | j       | k      |

You can also have operations that operate on variables together with regular state and produce variables and regular state. When you do this, you apply any incoming data to each of the labels equally and take the sum of the outputs of the labels for data that is escaping the variable section.

If you scale things correctly, I believe you can even change the number of variables that you might have, in the same way that you can apply a convolution neural network to different sizes of images.

I haven't found any papers doing anything like this. Is this a well-known technique or have I discovered something novel?",technology

personalfinance,$40k in CC debt with no assets,"Hi all,

Apologies in advance for the long text.

Current Income: Varied (less than 30k after tax and expenses)
Debt: $40k CC at 22.5%
Savings: $0
Assets: $0

I (M,34) am in need of some advice. I’m not financially illiterate although I’m sure the title of my post would make you think otherwise (if anything I’m bad at paying attention to the real situation).

Long story short, a couple years ago my father got diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer. We tried everything from Immunotherapy to chemo, radiation, and alternative medicine. Insurance for most of the conventional treatments but I paid for all of the other things we tried. 

14 months later my father passed. You could say we got all the outcomes we didn’t wish for. As the dust settled I was left with a CC debt of close to $40k (interest rates at 22.5%) I have no regrets but now I’m very aware I need to take care of this.

I walked off my career job (contractor) to work with my brother on our father’s small business. We’ve managed to make a profit on our first two years of trading, albeit a very small one (23k on year one, and about 40k on year two). We are a service-based business. All of our profits have been re-invested, and we don’t pay ourselves a salary because our cashflow wouldn’t currently support it. We live together and put as much of our expenses as we can through the business.

I do still contract on the side when I can and get around $700/week after tax. This isn’t all year round (probably 1/3) and because of Covid I’m unsure when I’ll be able to do that again.

I pay around $800/month in interest alone, and really only manage to make the minimum payments.. I have no savings, no assets, and no income guarantee.

I applied for a debt consolidation loan last year but was denied because I didn’t make enough the previous year (and have no collateral). Am I simply screwed out of options here??

I budget as best I can and work as much as I can. Seeing all my friends buy houses and going on overseas holidays makes me feel inadequate even though I know everyone fights their own fight. Being in my mid 30s I’m aware I’ve obviously been reckless and should’ve made better decisions 10yrs ago.

If anyone has any advice I’m listening. I’m not not to shy away from hard work but I need help identifying the best way forward on how to tackle this debt.

Thanking you in advance.

personalfinance,"Begin to snowball/avalanche my student debt while in school, or wait to see if some sort of forgiveness comes about?","I'll try to keep this short. I'm about to turn 33; my 20s were spent making stupid educational and financial decisions. Fortunately the only financial trouble I got myself into was student debt; unfortunately it is *massive* financial trouble-- Lesson learned: Don't choose an expensive, out-of-state, unfunded program.

Thankfully I'm done with debt: I finished my Masters; I'm still in school but my PhD is fully funded with a relatively generous stipend (for the area I live in) and because of the Masters it should only take 2 more years. The salary differential and opportunities between the Masters and the PhD is significantly large to be worth 2 years.

I live very frugally, my entire monthly expenses amount to ~650 dollars on a ~31k/year stipend.  In this first semester I've had I paid off my two small private loans, leaving only federal loans left. However, those federal loans amount to ~192k between undergrad and the Masters! 

My intent from the beginning was to take advantage of PSLF; the nature of the work I intend to do automatically qualifies as public service (I'd be a government employee) and I know that can be ""iffy"" right now. I've heard no one's getting it, I've heard people who do it right have no problems getting it, etc.  So I'm ""crossing my fingers but not holding my breath"" that either that or the lesser IBR eventual forgiveness kicks in.

But I'm also a relatively recent Dave Ramsey fan and I know he would say to not rely on forgiveness. However, when I think about how much I could stand to have forgiven if either form of forgiveness does pan out, it seems silly to save nothing and pay back ~210k over the coming decade instead of pay the income-driven minimum, get a large chunk forgiven, and save everything else for retirement. (I mentioned my age to indicate that i won't be truly entering the workforce until my mid-30s, meaning I'm behind the eight ball on retirement savings as well.)

Essentially, I realize I've made a mess and am dedicated to conquering it to the best of my ability with budgeting, frugal living, and using my stipend as well as I can. But I'm not sure what's best in light of possible forgiveness schema.

**TL;DR** I can ostensibly pay off ~20k in debt of my 200k student loans per year for the next two years if I save nothing. Is this the best plan, or should I save what I can and utilize minimum payments + forgiveness options further down the line?",finance
personalfinance,"In the process of making a budget, would love advice on what I have so far","Hi, I am trying to put together a budget that will take me through the end of this year. I am using YNAB to manage my budget.

I don’t make a lot of money (about $31k a year), but I have a unionized research job with a multi-year contract, so my income is very steady and not likely to change even if we go into a recession. I also have about $13,000 in an emergency fund at the moment, as well as about $8,500 in a Roth IRA. Finally, I have $17,900 in federal student loan debt. *However*, that debt is deferred with 0% interest for the next four years, since I am also in graduate school. 

If I add up my current account balance (not including emergency fund and Roth IRA) and my income for the rest of the year, I am looking at $20,700, or about $2,958 a month. As I mentioned, I am using YNAB and am trying to follow the philosophy of “giving every dollar a job”. My ""immediate"" expenses (below) come to $1543 (though I am open to adjusting the amounts). Thus, I am trying to figure out the best use for the remaining ~$1400/month.

---

With this in mind, I've drawn up the following budget: 

**Immediate obligations**

- - Rent: $1238/month (I realize this is expensive given my relatively low income, but this is cheap for the area where I live)

- Electric: $25/month

- Internet: $25/month

- Groceries: $255/month

**Savings/Debt**

- Roth IRA: $420 (this is all I need to do to max it out by end of year)

- Emergency fund: $200 (not sure if I would be better off just investing this since I have a lot in savings)

- Tax: $75 (I will likely have to pay $4-500 in taxes for this this year)

- Student loans: $250 (as mentioned above, these are deferred at 0% interest, so I put this into a separate high-yield savings account for now)

**True expenses**

- Clothing: $30

- Gifts for others: $25

- Household goods (soap, toilet paper, deodorant, etc.): $30

- Haircuts: $25

- Technology fund (mostly for replacing stuff like my cheap headphones or my phone charger if they break): $15

- Medical (small items, like annual checkup, etc.): $20

**Fun**

- Dining out: $75

- Hobbies: $15

- Transportation (I use Uber about once a month): 15

- Saving up for big items (TV/bike): $130

- Gym membership: $25

- Plane tickets for visiting my family four times a year: $25

- Miscellaneous outings (think museum tickets): $15

---

I would really appreciate help with figuring out how much I should adjust each category. Similarly, I would love to know if I am putting enough towards my student loans, whether I should continue adding to my emergency fund, etc. Finally, if I have too many budget categories or something, please let me know.

Summary below for those that prefer that and for those interested in a link, let me know - happy to share:

I'm in heavy cash because I definitely see tremendous downside potential. Between the rally we've see while still being in a pandemic, the fed's intervention that will eventually have to cease, and my perception that we likely will see another serious wave of COVID as things open back up. I'm absolutely okay maintaining small exposure here.

VRM - IPO. I typically like to watch IPOs, they're interesting events to me and typically offer a volatile trade for those interested. I am not necessarily passionate about online car sales however, so I personally will be waiting until options are available to trade this one.

AAL DAL. AAL made a 70% run up, DAL a 35% run up. These are both short candidates for me due to the price extremes in conjunction with the fact we are still quite a ways from completely opening up.

BETZ. This was a neat ETF I found that offers exposure to online betting. Overall, a market I imagine will continue to expand so I'm hopeful that this will have options on it soon.

For the haters that there's a video - I still don't sell anything and have no affiliates. If you don't want to see the video, don't go to it. I've been having awesome interactions with people on the channel so I absolutely will continue to do what's more helpful for our community regardless negativity.

personalfinance,Advice if investment plans are going in the right direction,"Hello everyone,

I am new to investing and was hoping to get a bit of guidance if my plans are going into the right direction. I just want to be prepared for the future and have a few questions. Thanks in advance for anyone to give me some advice here.

**Personal Info:** 26F, no debt, income around 45-60k CAD after tax (mixed income from Germany and Canada).

I live relatively frugal, my savings rate is between 55% and 75%, depending on how much money I earn with my second job. Every month I have between 1000-2500 CAD left over (with the savings for my down payment already deducted) to contribute to my investment accounts. Additionally I also have a lump sum of around 20.000 CAD I can contribute, 4500 of that is in my Canadian TFSA (like a Roth IRA), the other amount in my savings account, mostly in my german account. The money will be pretty stable for the next 2,5 years, after that I will move countries so income could change a bit.

**What is your intended goals/purpose for this money?**

I want the money to make money instead of just having it in a savings account and to put away part of my earnings for my retirement. I also save money for a down payment, but that will be separate from my investments i think. The plan is to stay in Canada for the next 2,5 years, after that I will probably go back to Germany for a bit, depending on the situation. I will get my PR in Canada in late 2021/early 2022. I want to buy a house in the next 5 years together with my partner, but right now it is not sure yet in which of the countries we will buy.  I want to be prepared for my future and have the money to do the things that make me happy and just worry less.

**What is your timeline, and what is the earliest you expect to need this money?**

My plan is to retire in 40 years and have enough money to be able to take out 4% every year. I do not plan on retiring early, I enjoy working. If I will have kids one day I will open up separate accounts to save for their college and stuff. So depending on my life I will move around my monthly contributions quite a bit and want to stay flexible with how much I put into each investment account.

**Have you invested in the markets before, and how would you feel if your investment lost a lot of value?**

Never invested before. I would be sad to see my investments lose value but I know I have lots of time before I actually need it. 

**Is this the right first step? Do you already have an emergency fund, and have you considered whether it is sufficient? Do you have any debts that should be paid first? Have you fully utilized any employer match plans?**

I do have two rainy day savings accounts (one in Canada and a smaller one in Germany) with a balance I leave untouched. No debts. Next plan on my list is to set up an RRSP (401k) and find out how much my employer will match. Didn’t do it before because I thought I could not because of my status.

**Finally, we need to understand whether you want to be involved with this portfolio and self-manage purchases and rebalancing it, or if you'd rather all of that was dealt with by your chosen institution?**

I would like to share the involvement. On one hand it feels good to have someone taking care of my account but on the other side I am also excited about making my own decisions, so maybe have multiple accounts.

**These are the steps I was planning on doing:**

**Canada**

· Open RRSP and contribute/ invest

· Open second TFSA with Questtrade/ Wealthsimple (I opened up a first one with a bank but I am not sure if that’s the way to go)

· Maybe Invest money in first TFSA (mutual funds, 1,36% management fee)

**Germany next steps**

· Open investment depot 

· Put down payment money into savings account and keep it there until needed

**These are the questions I have:** 

1. Is it better to spread my money over different investments brokers and companies or stick to one? I would have to do seperate ones in germany and canada anyway, but i was wondering if i should open up my RRSP with one company here and have another TFSA with a different or the same company.
2. I talked to a financial advisor at my Canadian bank and he advised to invest the money in my TFSA into mutual funds, fees would be 1,36%, which after reading a bit more on here it seems quite high. Any thoughts? The alternative would be to move the money over to a second TFSA with for example Questtrade or Wealthsimple. Is a move like that done easily?
3. Should I invest my down payment money? Right now a savings account in Germany doesn’t have much of an interest rate, but I am not sure if transferring my money to my Canadian accounts would be a good idea.
4. Should I just contribute the maximum I can to the RRSP and then put the rest into the TFSA?
5. How do I know which company would be best for a TFSA or the RRSP?

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Why do mortgage interest rates scale inversely with the size of the mortgage (so far as I can tell)?,"I am getting my toes wet with reading and thinking about the home purchase process, doing some basic things like fiddling with mortgage calculators and whatnot.  I had been typing my details into 'instant quote' type aggregators and getting annoyed as my income, credit, planned down payment are all superlative ($85k, 800+, and 20%), but I was receiving quotes with interest rates at 3.9-4.0%, well above today's average 30-year fixed rate of 3.4%.  I then noticed that when I fiddled with the size of the mortgage that I submitted, the rate changed.  I get 3.9% when I enter a mortgage size of $300k (basically as low as it goes for bargain basement starter homes in the neighborhoods I'm shopping), but when I kick the loan amount up to $500k it spits 3.1% APR out at me.

* Aren't interest rates correlated to the risk profile of the loan (riskier loans warrant more interest charges to make them worthwhile to the bank), and if so, why would a plus-sized loan merit a lower interest rate - isn't it inherently riskier (more likely to default on) versus a smaller sized loan?

* Or is the interest rate related to the maximum amount I would be approved for?  If I went in to a lender and they told me 'here's pre-approval for $500k at 3.1%' and I got back to them and told them I'll only need $300k, would I keep that interest rate?

I'm feeling a little salty that the dynamics of loan rates seem to be encouraging me implicitly to 'buy more house' to get better rates, even though that is risky and unneccessary behavior.  (Not that I would ever buy $200k more house just for that reason, of course... but if I was torn between two properties it show up as something that could affect my decision)",finance

investing,6/7/2020: Weekly Wrap Up &amp; What to Expect,"Positive, market-driving economic news and activity continued rolling in last week. Airlines announced increasing summer flights as passengers slowly return and states continue to reopen. Furthermore, the surprising decrease in unemployment announced by the Department of Labor on Friday and continued oil production cuts announced by OPEC on Saturday will likely provide fuel for this rally to continue into the beginning of the upcoming week. However, with COVID cases slowly increasing again and the impending end to the $600 government support checks in July, will there be another dip? Here are the details:

1. **The unemployment rate unexpectedly decreased by 1.4% in May as employers added 2.5M new jobs.** Last Friday, the Department of Labor announced an unexpected drop in unemployment from 14.7% to 13.3% in May. The report noted employment rose sharply in leisure and hospitality, construction, education and health services, and retail trade - areas depressed most by COVID. This unexpected decrease in unemployment drove stocks up significantly towards the end of the week. However, some of this increase in employment could be attributed to employers rehiring employees that were laid off.
2. **Airlines increase summer travel routes as they've begun to see increasing demand by passengers.**[ ](https://www.wx.capital/so/1dNAGHYv8/c?w=0EKBx0JRL7ro9Kq7nDrTNlakJ7xs3E8Renr3qDEbTdM.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mb3ItZWNvbm9teS13b3JzdC1vZi1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1zaHV0ZG93bnMtbWF5LWJlLW92ZXItMTE1OTA0MDgwMDAiLCJyIjoiZjc0ZjY0MTktNmQ4NC00ZjhmLWFiMDktYjFlYmMzNjY2ZDNmIiwibSI6Im1haWwiLCJjIjoiMDVkMGUxNWEtMzQzNC00ZWJjLThkYWUtMTQ1ZTc1MTY1YjE4In0)Airlines expect to fly at \~50% of their normal schedules during the summer as passenger demand has been slowly increasing. This is a dramatic increase from May, when they were operating at \~20% of their schedule. This optimistic and quick recovery by airlines drove investors to invest heavily in airlines, hotels, etc. driving up their share prices significantly. See which airline stocks we like here.
3. **OPEC extends oil production cuts through June in efforts to bring up the price of oil to help battle oil oversupply.** In efforts to continue increasing oil prices, OPEC has decided to cut 9.6M barrels of oil until the end of July. This reduction in supply, along with increasing demand for oil as economies open, will likely be a large driver in stock prices for oil companies in the coming week. Small oil companies will likely be the greatest benefactor of this news.
4. **However, investors are wary of the fragile economic state of the U.S. with the end of stimulus checks impending in July.** With all the positive news around state reopenings and decreased unemployment, investors are worried about the conflict in Congress around passing the fifth and final COVID relief bill. McConnell has already said Republicans won’t extend the $600 per week supplemental unemployment benefit, which they say is taking away the incentive for people to return to the job market. If a bill does pass, it'll likely be &lt;$1T.
5. **Furthermore, select states saw a rise in COVID cases upon reopening, raising concerns for a second wave of COVID.** Last week, Johns Hopkins University observed an increase in the five-day moving average for confirmed cases. Public health officials are concerned that widespread protests may be contributing to the increase in COVID cases. While this is concerning, the overall picture has been mixed as other states have demonstrated significant progress in decreasing COVID cases after reopening. The U.S.'s overall daily COVID cases count has been decreasing gradually, hovering around 20K new cases per day.  

**Overall, WX Capital is comfortable maintaining our current market positions for several reasons.** Firstly, the majority of our investments is in biotech, which is less dependent on consumer discretionary spending and therefore less impacted by unemployment and economic downturns. Secondly, federal support for COVID as the U.S. transitions into a more ""normal"" state, will likely continue, though at a much lesser degree given the drop in unemployment last month. Lastly, U.S. COVID cases are now dropping steadily. Even if there were another spike in COVID cases, the U.S. hospital system is better prepared to identify and handle COVID cases at earlier stages. Later stage COVID can be supported by Gilead's drug, remdesivir. As usual, don't ever hesitate to reach out with questions!",finance

personalfinance,Rolling over a balance on Credit Cards,"My friend fancies himself to be a finance savvy person. The other day he gave me a piece of advice for raising your credit score. He said to leave a balance of $50 on each of your credit cards to roll over each statement (to show you’re using the card to the CC company). He acknowledged that you will
pay interest, but overall it will help you in the end, as your credit score will rise and your future loan interest rates will be lower  (thus paying for the CC interest payments),

Is there any sound logic to this? It sounded absolutely insane to me, and I have no intentions what so ever of following this practice. I’m just curious if he misheard some sort of advice in his life and ran with it? I cannot fathom a world where rolling over a balance to pay interest for no reason is a good idea.

personalfinance,Looking to get my first FHA loan this year but I have federal defaulted debt. What do i do?,"Hi reddit! 

My fiance and I are looking to move into our first home at the end of the year. I just recently learned I can't apply for an FHA loan if I have federal student loans in default, which I do, about 17k worth. My credit score is in the mid 500s and steadily climbing. I was looking into consolidating my debt to  mitigate this and be able to get the FHA loan but most companies require a credit score of 650. I've paid off all my other debts/ no credit card debt to improve  my credit score as much as I can. The only mark left on my credit score is my defaulted federal student loans.

What do yall recommend my course of action be? Do my federal loan accounts that were paid off by wage/tax collections affect my credit negatively? 

Thank you for your time and best to you all!",finance

stocks,Healthy skepticism can save accounts,"I recently shared a post of a segment I do called market musings. I essentially just run through some current news and tickets that look interesting to me. (Check out BETZ). In that video, I shared that I’m currently largely in cash (99%) and some folks made it seem like that was the dumbest thing they’ve ever heard. Which made me nervous for my fellow traders. 

They don’t need to agree with my assessment but to completely dismiss the notion that we may possibly be overextended is dangerous. I’ve been trading since 2007 and I’ve learned quickly markets crash down - not up. I caution those that don’t consider the SP500 went through a 36% drop and we are now just 6% off those same all time highs. Unemployment is still high. The fed is still maintaining low interest rates, still buying bonds that should be counted as government debt - which is expected to top $3.7 trillion this year - 18% of our GDP. We’ve yet to see the true damage for individual companies being shut down for an extended period of time, that will come out in the next few quarters. 

Despite all that, I’m still bullish in our economy long term and by no means think it’s doomsday. But the complete disregard some folks had towards the topic of the market being over extended and being dumbfounded why I’m heavy cash made me extremely nervous for the thought process our peers are applying here. Again, not saying anyone knows, or that any thought is correct. But to not even consider another perspective is dangerous. Gotta have skin in the game to grow the account but healthy skepticism can save your account. 

- side note, I came into cash as of Friday. I had 80 lots out start of the week, closed out with 10. I will maintain exposure but won’t exceed 10% for the next week or so. Then will scale to normal allocation based on where things sit.

personalfinance,Investing while in Pharmacy School! Am I doing this right?,"Whats up guys, I'm a longtime lurker and just started my journey into personal finance. I'd like to hopefully achieve go fuck myself-ness (financial independence with or without early retirement) in about 25-30 years. I'm making this post in part to document and throw it out there for critique and review to the minds of r/PF (and from a quick search, it seems unique enough).

I'm finishing up my first year in a public pharmacy school in California where things are expensive. I'm lucky and got financial assistance from the school one way or another and looking forward to set myself up to be in a good position to succeed in school and do better in life.

**Basic Information**

Current Age: 26, Year 1 of 4.

Current Job: CVS @ $19/hr as an intern at 8-25 hours/week variable

Current Savings: $16,000 in Savings/Checking at 1.20% APY (liquid money)

Current Roth IRA: $4,400 in Vanguard VDIGX

Current Credit Score: 752

Current Car: 1

**Current Debt**

Federal Direct Loans Plus @ 7.080%: $11,396 ($45,584 in 4 years)

Federal Direct Loan Stafford Unsubsidized @ 6.080%: $33,000 ($132,000 in 4 years)

Housing: $850/month accounted for by loans

Credit Card: paid off in full from work, I don't dip into loans to pay this off.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I am debt-free except for federal loans for pharmacy school. I'm expecting to graduate with 180-200k of debt and then spend 1-2 years in residency or fellowship (reduced income for you non-clinical folks). In a perfect world I'll be on an income-based repayment plan and do loan forgiveness after paying \~120k over 10 years, otherwise the plan is to pay off loans over 10-20 years and do a refinancing ladder to step down on interest rates if I don't get into a non-profit for loan forgiveness.

At this rate I am able to maintain about 1 year emergency fund in case anything major happens while paying off non-school debt and investing the remainder into Roth, and maybe even more into my 401k or IRA.

**The Plan**

The current plan is to **max out my Roth IRA** at 6k/year over school and residency. The two biggest reasons are: 1. It's generally sheltered from calculations of income/savings when considering investments and savings, and 2. I'm trying to save up some ""excess"" money into an investment vehicle and when out of school, dropping the principle as a down payment on a house and possibly do a house-hack and rent out for rental income.

I am also maxing out work match to 401k (5%) and stock purchase plans (15%) at a 10% discount. I'm planning to ride out 401k to retirement and re-sell stock purchase plans for an immediate profit and re-invest.

Starting my career, I'm planning to max out my 401k as well and possibly moving around around budgets towards real estate, in any case 25k/year minimum will be directed towards investments.

**Roth IRA**

I think vanguard seems legit. There's been some controversy around their company and plans but I am a bit old-fashioned albeit high risk. I chose VDIGX as a mutual fund because I did some research and saw their portfolio rides out big dips very smoothly and I love the word dividend, but I'm planning to split it into 33% VTSAX-VIGAX-VGSLX because 1. VTSAX lol, 2. I like big growth and %, and 3. I like real estate and feel that I can take advantage of REIT's in a tax-sheltered Roth.

**The Question**

Does this seem like a reasonable method to reach FI? Am I missing something obvious I should be doing first? I have enough of a money gap in case anything happens. Otherwise I can attempt to pay down debt at \~10k/year but at the cost of an early down payment and future investments.",finance

personalfinance,how to qualify for more federal student loans? please help!,"Hi all, I am an incoming freshman and first generation college student going to a 4 year in state university majoring in business. For my first year, I am looking to take out around 20k in student loans to cover for the “billable” costs (tuition, room and board, etc.) I plan on working part time to cover the “non-billable” costs (transportation, supplies, entertainment, etc.)

My school is only allowing me to borrow $5,500 in federal loans for the 2020-21 academic year. $3,500 subsidized and $2,000 unsubsidized. Unfortunately my parents are unable to take out parent plus loans since they are not citizens. However, looking at studentaid.gov (https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#how-much ) under the “how much I can borrow section” it seems I am eligible for $9,500 in loans for my first year. It states that to qualify, I must be an “Independent Students (and dependent undergraduate students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans)”

Now, obviously I am a dependent student according to my FASFA however my parents are unable to obtain PLUS loans. We are also low income and made ~35k according to the 2018 tax return form. 

I would obviously like to exhaust all federal loans before moving to private due to the record low interest rates at 2.75%. Under the “How do I apply for a loan?” section it simply states to file my FASFA which I have already done. 


My question is, how do I apply for the full $9,500 in federal loans? Do I contact my school? 

Also please do not give me the “you cannot afford 20k a year, please go to a community school” talk. I have been a long time lurker on here and r/personalfinance. I have been dual enrolling at both a community college AND a private local college and have obtained 25 transferrable credits. I will essentially be a sophomore before I even step foot on campus and have the opportunity to graduate a year early. The school also has a top 5 program in the nation in my intended major. Since I do not plan living on campus after my first year, costs will be significantly cheaper. I do not plan on accruing more than 45k in student loans for my bachelors degree.

Anyways, all the help and advice is needed. If there is any confusion I’d be happy to clarify in the comments below! Thank you so much, I hope everyone is doing well during these unprecedented times!",finance

personalfinance,Debt accumulated while unemployed - not sure how to move forward,"Hi reddit. I'm a bit stuck right now on how to move forward, and quite honestly overwhelmed with everything going on. Ultimately I would like to get out of debt with a path out, rather than just guessing what to do as I go.

Right now, I am about $34k in debt from credit cards. This is the scariest one to me, as these credit cards have 20%+ APR. The number skyrocketed when I became unemployed and could only pay the minimum payment. But even while employed, it always felt like I was throwing as much money at these cards as I could in hopes of clearing them, but never succeeding.

In addition to that, I have a $15k loan form LendingClub that I used to consolidate some debts at some point. At least this is locked interest rate and it won't go up more as I pay, unlike the credit card and interest rates.

I have a job again now (albeit one that pays less than before). However I don't see how I'll ever ""beat"" my credit cards at this point. Should I look into another loan, or perhaps contact the card to ""freeze"" it?  


EDIT: I just checked to confirm, the credit card with the most debt on it is also the one with the highest interest rate (coming in at almost 24%).",finance

personalfinance,Made late payment at direction of mortgage company. Credit score tanked. Options?,"Tldr: Middle of refinancing our mortgage. Got told by several people to not make a payment. Something got delayed and the old mortgage went delinquent. We paid and got them to waive the late fee, but our credit has tanked by over 100 points.

Ill try to keep this short. We decided to refinance our mortgage for a lower interest rate. The loan officer sent us all of the loan docs for us to e-sign, which we did right away, and told us not to make any more payments or else it could screw up the new mortgage. Pretty standard stuff, as this is our 3rd or 4th refinancing. We got the confirmation email that all of the docs were signed and we should hear from the loan officer in a day or two. 

Well a week goes by, i call the loan officer and leave a voicemail. Another week goes by, another voicemail. Another week, and i call the 800 number. They give me the number to loan officers manager, and reiterate not to make a payment since we are in the middle of a refi. Account is still current.

Call loan officers manager, leave a voice mail. Another week goes by, i call 800 number again. They basically said they couldnt do anything, its all up to the loan officer and them, but are ""pretty sure"" we shouldnt make a payment and offered to transfer me to loan officer. Left another voicemail.

Another week goes by and account goes delinquent. I call 800 number and now all of a sudden she says we were supposed to have kept making payments on the old loan. Whatever, we make the payment, and she waa nice enough to waive the late fee. At this point i had pretty much given up on the refi.

Fast forward a month later. They call and want to send a notary to finalize the refi. I check my credit score and both mine and the wifes tanked by over 100 points due to the late mortgage payment. We called the 800 number and we were told theres nothing they can do but ""it should bounce back up pretty quickly"".

Im pissed. We have never had any issues with these people in the several years theyve had our mortgage and sever refis with them. What options do i have? I could dispute the credit report, but i highly suspect that will get no where, since by all technicalities we DID make a late payment. Furthermore, all of this was done over the phone, so i have no paper trail of them telling me not to make a payment.

Do i just chalk this up to a painful learning experience? I have been diligently working to get my credit score up for the last decade, and this really hurts.

Thanks all.",finance

personalfinance,What exact standards should I look for in a fiduciary/investment advisor to really make sure they are looking out for my best interests?,"Im a 25 year old with a good sized windfall thanks to my father's hard work. I am still working on the calculation of taxes with CPA's and a tax attorney (as well as a house in probate) but after all said and done we are looking at 5.2-6 MM. (3.5 MM was outside of probate). I asked for advice on reddit and was told to reach out to financial advisors- which is what did. 

I have a guy who has been offering me financial advice (he is registered as an IA and a Broker) since day 2-3 of my father's journey from stroke recovery- passing away. Great guy- always around on the phone, but I am just a bit worried.  The worries I have are

1) Around march I received the advice to sell my personal portfolio and book the losses  ( I went from 120 K down to maybe 70 K. I didnt do this because I have an uncle who is a hedge fund owner/manager and always always told me to hold, hold, hold. And low and behold my uncle was right, I am back up to like 113K today. If you are wondering why I cant ask him what to do all the time 1) He is usually an asshole 2) My aunt divorced him like yesterday 3) He doesnt have time for advising me besides one or two holistic statements/advice pieces a year

2) Back to this financial advisor, wants me to put all my money in the market with him. I had to really push back and say 1 million, anything else would be dollar cost averaged. He did fight against that although again, dollar cost averaging over time seems to be the way to go. 

3) When it comes to buying a home I am being advised to take a loan at the low interest rates today (2-3%) This still confuses me because the homes we want are around 600 K which means about 18 K in interest/annually. I dont see how this helps on my tax deduction what so ever. My income right now should be around 70-80 K annually, and if I got what my financial advisor is sort of promising me (6-8% on every million), then I dont see how this tax deduction would help at all

4) Registered as a broker and mentions where he would park my money (other money managers)- my understanding is brokers make commissions off my investments.

5) I keep asking for data on returns, and how the portfolios do during downturns, havent gotten any. Other financial advisors have shown pretty clear graphs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now rather than raise my suspicions about this guy who helped a lot I do want to understand what certs I should be looking for to make sure someone really is looking out for my best interests. At this point I feel like cutting this guy a check for 10 K , saying thank you for your advice and just keeping my money in cash in various FDIC high yield interest accounts 

&amp;#x200B;

I am far too poor myself to waste my father's hard earned money and while I hope the person I have been talking to is an honest genuine person, I need to make sure from a crowd sourced answer I am speaking to the right guy.

investing,Is the market really that irrational right now like some people claim?,"1. Retail:  
I personally know a lot of people, even some that can't tell the difference between a stock and a bond, pumping money into the markets.  
If you have a job and you can't go out, you save a lot of money every month, what's the best thing you can do with it besides expending it (can't go out)? Investing!  
Everywhere I go on the internet there are ads about opening a brokerage account and even some people that haven't talked to me in years asked me how to open a brokerage account.  
2. Major market discount:  
Buying at a discount is the best way to earn a high %. How many people have lost money buying the market when it is -20% or -30% and then hold?  
3. What else are you going to do with your money:  
Bonds? How many of us actually have access to the bond market? Most retail traders only have stocks and options as financial instruments at hand.  
4. The Fed has your back:  
No explanation needed here, they are pumping trillions into the (market) economy.  
5. The market is forward-looking:  
Even if the real economy is in shambles today if you could invest right now knowing that the market will be 5 or 10% higher in ONE year, would you do it? Where else could you get that rate of return in one year?  
The only reason not to invest today is that:  
a) You think that the market will never go up again, or at least in 5-10 years  
b) You think that the market is heading for a downturn and you want to buy at a discount, that requires skill to time the market (and it already happened back in March)  
Maybe because there are a lot of retail participants right now the market may seem irrational, but it makes sense to me.

personalfinance,Forgot to add my 1099-INT while filing my taxes.,"My taxes are super simple. I'm a single guy with no deductions, no assets, no investments, etc... I usually just type in my W2, press next a bunch of times, and I'm done in five minutes. 

I get a 1099-INT from my bank, but it's always something like $3 and I don't even bother typing it in. However... last year was different. I got three $2000 savings bonds that my grandmother had been saving for me and used them to buy a new (used) car. 

I did my taxes like two months ago and already got my refund (about $2500 fed / $400 state).

personalfinance,Mortgage Re-Finance Advice...sort of lost...,"Oh Wise Redditors, could someone give their opinion on the below situation and offer your thoughts on what makes most re-finance sense.  I really appreciate your advice or any direction/resource you can point me to. According to the lender our FICO is 770 (which I think is the middle score of the 3 credit bureaus).  Home market value, approximately: $420,000

**Current Loan Situation,** we just finished year 3 of our 30 year fixed mortgage (so we have 27 years left).  Balance: $313,681.00  Rate 4.0%.   Monthly Pmt: $2,638.84.  

* Principal &amp; Interest (Next Pmt) =  554.93 (P) + 1,045.60 (I) =  $1,600.53  
* Escrow: $696.45 (Taxes) + $244.08 (HO-Insurance) + $97.78 (PMI): $1,038.31 (PMI will drop off)

**Proposed Refinance:**

**30 Year -  Quoted Rate: 3.375%,**  but this requires payment of a ""point"", quoted at $3200 + Loan Closing Costs of $3600, so approximately  $6,800 for the refinance. 

**25 Year** \- **Quoted Rate: 3.25%** (requires payment of a point also).  

Apparently, without the point our interest rate for the 25 year would be around 3.65% for the 25 year. 

Of course the lender mentions the payment of a ""point"" right before moving forward.  We cant decide which scenario to do and whether we should do a ""point.  I know it will take a few years to pay the re-finance fees etc off.   We plan to pay the same monthly payment of $2,638.84) with the new loan.  We plan on being in the house for another 3-ish years...is there any clear advantage?  Should we continue shopping...or is it basically the same everywhere...?",finance

personalfinance,Creating budget to determine student loan needs,"I just received my graduate loan package. I got a whopping $75,4xx in Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loan and $20,5xx in Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan for an estimated cost of $106,2xx for four quarters of the 2020-2021 year. Cost of tuition for the program is estimated at $112,xxx total or $18,6xx per quarter for six consecutive quarters. 

I'm trying to figure out if I need to accept the entire amount because it scares me. It is for a nursing program and regardless of what I take out, I will get a job and pay it back, however I'd like to make sure I'm not taking out more than I need to.

personalfinance,Looking to buy investment property in another country,"About me:

I am a married 29 year old male with no kids. I work in M&amp;A in a fairly low risk industry. I was born an raised in the USA (this is important). I max my 401k, HSA, IRA, and have a brokerage account for excess savings. I have no debt except for my car. I have 6 months of emergency expenses saved, and I currently live in a apartment but may consider purchasing a home in 5 years (I have 50k set aside for a down payment ). 

I want to buy an investment property in Greece for the investment income. I wouldn't visit (for leisure) it except for 1-2 weeks every few years and maybe several years (10+) down the road I would consider turning it into a family vacation home. Because I was born and raised in the USA, there are several restrictions that I have to overcome if I am to purchase a property, so my wife who was born and raised in Greece would put the home in her name.

After all of my expenses/savings for retirement accounts are out of the way, I have about $50k that I'm willing to part with and put into the property as a 20% down payment. I have zero practical experience with investment properties, and I don't know a single thing about properties in Greece and/or how to inspect them and I will only be in Greece once per year. That being said, I do have family in Greece who are willing to inspect the property during the search process, and inspect regularly and make repairs as needed (of course, I'd also hire property/rental managers to book and maintain the property) if I do decide to purchase a home there.

I've started my process by researching things to know about overseas investment properties, and by building a model that shows me expected income, payback, IRR, and a few other metrics based on purchase price, leverage, interest rates, tax rates, daily rental rates (these change based on season), occupancy rates, etc. However, I feel like I'm not getting the answers I need to make me feel comfortable about doing something like this. Right now I just don't know what I don't know.

My question is, what are some things I am not considering? I figure if I'm going to do something, then it's best to do it now before I have kids, but I'm concerned that I may be making a huge mistake. Please let me know if more information is needed.",finance

Current Objective: I want to buy a used car for commuting to work/all other essential stuff.

Some info about my current situation:

I have $9k saved up, expecting $3k from tax returns (Keyword in the sentence is **Expecting**), and another $3k from next year's tax return.

I also have a $2.5k loan that has an interest rate of 11%. (I know its bad, I didn't know it was bad at the time, but whatever). I pay $50/month on this loan (\~$20 goes towards interest)

My current plan is to save up for a car, and whatever money I get from the taxes goes towards paying off that high-interest loan.

One last important detail: I am expecting to leave work and go back to school in 4\~5 months. So no income

My question to you:

Should I pay off my student loan immediately right now with the $9k savings and use the expected tax return money to buy a car? or should I buy a car right now and use whatever money I get from taxes to pay off the high-interest loan?

Currently Work in Building Systems for Local Library, bringing home bi-weekly $951.86 (or $1903.72 monthly)

The House I am looking at, that is nice, and in this area pretty cheap, is $96,900, 2bd/1 bath, 850+ sq ft, with a basement (partially finished), and renovated kitchen. Mortgage, for a First Time Home buyer, and at 3.5% down and a 3.0% Interest rate, would be $678.24, as per my lender (with PMI, insurance and Taxes)

My personal finances are as followed:

Expenses: Amazon ($13), HBO ($15), Spotify ($15), Funimation ($7), Codeanywhere ($3), Local Gym ($22) &lt;--going to be canceling here soon, Hulu ($12), Disney+ ($7).

Bill Wise: Internet (Currently $125 because of extra, but if I move, I would just have internet) $75, Student Loan ($165), Phone Bill ($130), Dentist ($50).

I do have three credit cards, but I am not factoring those in at the moment, as they will be paid off within a month, but those are: NewEgg ($2386.56), Bank ($644.86), Home Depot (Joint account with Sister and Brother-In-Law, current balance is theirs).

Now, I also factored in a Gas Budget of $100 a month, and a grocery budget of $100 (I truly do not eat that much. Bowl of cereal for breakfast, because of my job, i grab something quick and cheap while out for lunch and that ties me over till late night, so maybe a sandwich or bowl of cereal for dinner)

Utilities for the area: Talked with a friend that lives not that far away, so utilities would be roughly close tot he same, but you are looking: Electricity (Summer/$120, winter/$45), Gas (Summer/$45, Winter/$120), Water (45), Sewer ($40), Trash ($52 every 3 months).

Now, this does not include Car insurance at all.

Now, i have gone through this math multiple times, and even when splitting up my house payment to go Bi-Weekly, as per my check, I am still sitting with roughly $220 left over a month.

• $140k set aside in savings for a downpayment on a house

• We are considering buying a house soon (around $700k) and am wondering about some of that money in the business account.

Knowing that around $200k of the business account money won't need to be touched for a couple of years, I'm feeling stressed about what I should do with those funds. They are basically doing nothing in the account now due to the interest rate cuts, and with the market recently, I've found myself wondering if I should just put that $200k on a single blue chip stock that is performing well, and sell once there is a small gain, and repeat that process. Obviously there is the possibility of the price going down, but 1%-2% changes on $200k start to add up fairly quickly, especially on good dividend aristocrat companies that are undervalued at the moment.

algorand,Exploring Central Bank Digital Currency development on Algorand,"Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital currency issued by central banks of countries where the power of money issuance and monetary policies are still in hand of the central bank. It is analogous to the uncollateralized stablecoin of the crypto sphere in that they are not backed by any assets though the community backing it is the central bank and financial policy makers.

*What prompted countries and central banks to explore CBDCs? Was* it the challenge to financial stability and to the dominance of national fiat currencies posed by digital currency issuance by private companies such as global social media giants, technology specialists or is it a cheaper method to print money with minimum overheads or is it to mitigate corruption and counterfeits. The short answer is that it is a combination of all as well as to keep evolving to utilize the available technology.

**What are the check points to implement CBDC successfully?**

The check points that have to cleared for a CBDC implementation to be considered successful are as follows:

* The underlying technology and algorithm design which is utmost important for scalability and developing a level of trust 
* Enhanced security features for transparency, traceability, Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
* Supply limits to moderate the inflation and interest rates to keep the financial norms in check
* Ease of access as well as usage to allow users to start using them without any confusion
* Regulations imposed by central banks and policy makers, which depends on the design of the CBDC, for the availability and acceptability of the CBDC globally 

These checkpoints will serve as challenges to the central banks of each country which they have to overcome in order to not only keep the payment and financial system updated with the latest technologies but also not concede any further space to cryptocurrencies.

**How will DLT play a role in it?**

The technology being used, whether with centralized or decentralized ledger, and the algorithm design of a CBDC will be detrimental to define its effectiveness as a monetary policy instrument and whether it may cause any financial instability. Blockchain,the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the front runner on the technology front to be used as the platform to build CBDCs but the consensus mechanism and the algorithm to be used to create the perfect CBDC is still uncharted territory.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Blockchain will have a role to play ](https://preview.redd.it/0kkp9ws66v351.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41fe54c5db852e04519432984ec210331f5702b)

 

Here it must be said that DLT is by no means at the optimum levels to be adopted which is causing existing technologies to evolve or be replaced. With issues such as scalability, privacy and lack of interoperability with other DLT networks still being worked upon, there is some work still left. Moreover, consensus protocols do not offer absolute finality required for payments rather only probabilistic finality. But DLT is still way ahead of the other available options in terms of providing transparency, immutability, traceability and security. CBDC creation has been tried on *Algorand*, *R3 Corda, Ethereum*, etc. as some of these blockchains have worked to tackle the issues mentioned above.  


**How is Algorand placed to be used as the underlying tech for CBDCs?**

The assets to be created and/or issued on the Algorand blockchain will have the advantage of a secure, scalable, transparent and highly accessible blockchain network making it the one of the better options for countries which are in economic distress to issue digital currencies in a standardized and regulation compliant format. Moreover, with asset spam protection that prevents unknown assets that may have tax, legal, or reputational risk from being sent to users without their explicit approval (users must opt-in to accept new assets), the privacy and security of users using have been taken care off.

Marshall Islands’ Marshallese sovereign (SOV), built using Algorand technology will circulate alongside the US dollar and help the Marshall Islands efficiently operate in the global economy. 

**Market Opportunity**

The position held by cash as the primary mode of financial transactions had already been taken over by online payment systems and with the launch of digital currencies the challenge has been heightened even further, leading the central banks of many countries to respond.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Will paper currencies become obsolete? ](https://preview.redd.it/v2er2frb6v351.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1baa2b5c7fb11617e691441b1778636cf2858126)

 

Exploratory research, pilot testing and in some cases  even implementations are being worked upon currently by Central Banks in China, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Venezuela, South Korea, the United Kingdom, UAE, Senegal, etc. with majority of them using blockchain and pegging the CBDC to the fiat legal tender of their respective countries while some are using are experimenting with pure blockchain based algorithmic token currencies. Digital currency exploration was mentioned even in the US stimulus package issued but never made the cut to the approved bill.  This clearly shows that central banks across the globe are not only aware of the forthcoming challenges as well as the glitches in the existing financial and payments system but also are decisively working on developing CBDCs. 

**Future insights**

In the next few years, we will see developed as well as developing economies using CBDCs, more so for practical reasons to eradicate money laundering, to curb inflation and most of all to improve the payment system. For sure the number of blockchains will either merge or fade away to enable interoperability and scalability to produce a solution that can cater to the requirements of true global presence. CBDCs will gradually become the accepted legal tender in place of fiat though the journey sure will be interesting.

With features of interoperability, scalability, increased security, simplified usage, transaction finality, no forking, asset spam protection, etc. the Algorand blockchain platform is placed very strategically to be used for creation and issuance of CBDCs.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"No, the market is not really ""manipulated""","Lots of posts here refer to the market as ""manipulated"" ie there's a belief that the Fed is propping up the market. Fine, but what does this really mean?

The Fed are not buying equities. They cut the Fed funds rate down to 0.25 (giving you what are very close to zero short term rates) and they are doing QE buying longer term debt.

To the stock investor, this really has two practical consequences:

- stocks (especially dividend paying ones) become more attractive vs short term interest rates or bonds, and
- companies with previously poor prospects (missing payments on their debt) are now able to refinance their debt at lower cost, allowing them to stay in business.

The latter is what prompted Druckenmiller to admit ""I've Been Far Too Cautious"" and lead to Buffet's ""phone not ringing off the hook (washtubs or teaspoons didn't apply because the Fed ran in first and raided the whole swimming pool).

In the interim, this kind of backing is obviously tremendously important (once you mitigate the bankruptcy risk significantly, the whole landscape changes) and will lead to a short term recovery in the stock price of a company. What seems to have subsequently happened with e.g. travel and energy stocks is that short term price recovery has triggered a retail driven FOMO rally. However, in the long run, the thing that drives the price of a stock is earnings, not optimism, hope or news.",finance

solar,Special interest group trying to end net metering,"The New England Ratepayers Association filed a petition to FERC to end net metering, which in case anyone doesn't know, is an important solar energy policy that pays solar owners for the excess clean energy they put back into the grid. It's been an important policy for local businesses and solar owners who install solar... because it literally just fairly compensates them for energy they're providing to everyone's benefit.

I tried to get someone on the phone here in IL for a few weeks with no luck, but finally was able to submit my claim online. I was denied, not surprisingly, but needed to get a claim in before I applied for PUA.

I was very surprised when I was denied PUA. I thought that PUA was aimed to help gig workers like me. “You cannot have received W-2 wages outside of Illinois since 1/1/2019”. But I have W-2 wages in 15 different states. So- which state to I qualify in? The payroll company that most of my out of state W-2 wages came from is in California. So I’m trying to start from scratch with them, but can’t file online and I can’t get anyone on the phone there either. 

Worried that I’m going to do this whole process again, only to be denied because I made out of state wages. How can a federal act be denied because of state income? So confused. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated!!",finance

Fast forward, after being so excited to finish engineering school.. I planned to live it up.. Being from NJ/NYC area, going out very often, drinks, food, some more drinks and uber uber everywhere lol..

And after having 10k worth of cc debt and just not being disciplined i always had cc debt that I wanted to prioritize but I kept going out..

I think late 2018 I got all of that under control..

So now its 2020 and I am making about 95k and only 12k left in federal student loans (i beat myself up about this because I could have been finished a while ago) and about 8k cash saved up.

I make about 5k a month, so my plan is to save 60% of that each paycheck until Sept 1st. Pay 1k towards my loans each month and then pay the remainder with my company stock shares I get each year.

I will then be around 16k saved up with no loans and want to move out, the goal is a September 1st move in. On Sept 1st, I should be free of student debt if I stick to this plan.

In terms of moving out, I am aiming 1.8-2k per month for rent + utilities.. With no loans and no debt, I think it is doable to save 1.5k each month when moving out. Mind you a deposit to move in would cost me about 3.5 months of rent due.

personalfinance,(GERMANY) Should I take a student loan as an international student?,"I am an international student in Germany just starting my bachelor's in Economics. Even though there are no tuition fees, living expenses are around 800€/month (including insurance and other expenses practically exclusive to int'l students). I receive some financial support from my parents but before moving to Germany I was told that they could only support my studies for a year and after that, I would have to cover my expenses.

Most scholarships, credits, and student loans in Germany are either for Master's students or EU-nationals, of which I am neither. However, Germany is giving a one-time chance for international students to apply for a federal loan, with a current interest rate of ~4.3% p.a.

**So now I have two options:**

1\. I *don't* take out a loan:

I will have to work around 20 hours a week to cover my living expenses. I am afraid that my grades will suffer as a result of not being able to study that much. I have been told that German companies, especially in finance, pay a lot of attention to grades.

2\. I take out a loan:

At the end of my bachelor's I would have around 30 thousand Euros of accumulated debt and on a 10-year plan paying 320€/month, it would amount to 11K€ in interests after all is said and done. That's a scary number. I don't want to feel cumbered by debt when I finish my degree. On the other hand, it would allow me to study without so much stress and working just few hours + internships during the summers.


The way I see it, one could think about it as an investment since I'm studying a major with good career possibilities. But the main reason for me to study in Germany was to avoid financial burden and I don't want to mess it up.

I appreciate any advice, thanks in advance :)",finance

gaming,When Discussing Weapon Balance - Why do You Think There is Always a “Get Gud” Type Comment?,"I don’t get it. Seems in every game from Destiny To Call of Duty to others there are weapons that are objectively better than others.

But no matter how weapons are brought up there is always some variation of “well how you use THAT weapon is.... and then it’s great”

It’s such a bullshit line of logic because games aren’t balanced perfectly and when money is on the line or it’s serious - pros and everyone else use meta guns - not “high risk high reward” guns. 

For example - The best in the world are using the Graus and M4s in Warzone - but asking how to bring other guns into the meta for variety will AWAYS have someone saying that you must not know how to use LMGs or Marksman rifles or whatever. 

Like get better than pros?

We all know TeePee or Shroud can shred with an Odin. How does that mean that a Grau isn’t better?

Same for Destiny Meta weapons and other games - I just can’t think of a good example right now. 

Do you think it’s people not wanting meta guns nerfed? 

Do you think it’s people not understanding that a good player can beat a worse player with a worse gun but not someone that as good as you? 

Do people want to explain game knowledge?

It’s so confusing how there are weapons in Games that are objectively better but bringing that up always seems to have someone argue it.

cybersecurity,Logical problem?,"Hi all,

Really not sure if this is the right place to post this but I really don’t know where else to go...

I’m faced with a bit of a problem which I’ll try and put into a real life situation (it won’t sound technical but bear with me, maybe less technical people can have a go as well)

Imagine Lucy, an air traffic controller. Lucy is in charge of a small airspace that’s rarely got any flights going through it so there doesn’t need to be anyone else— she’s the only ATC. Whoever is in the control tower has full control of the airspace- they can do anything they want. 

It’s not plausible to identify Lucy every single time she enters the tower, e.g. when she goes home, for lunch, to the toilet, etc. so she’s given a key. That’s because she goes in and out quite often but it can take quite long to confirm her identity. 

We only want Lucy to have access to the tower. How can we trust that it’s Lucy entering the tower with the key? Keep in mind that—

- There’s no way that we can trust that Lucy will keep the key safe. She could lose it on her way home, leave it in an unsafe space, accidentally give it to someone, etc. 

- The complexity of the key doesn’t affect the difficulty of copying the key— even if it’s the most complicated key, it can still be copied with ease

- There will be people trying to get into the tower and will do everything they can to steal or copy the key without Lucy noticing

- As soon as you get access to the key, you get access to the air traffic control tower and hence the whole airspace

The reason I’m asking this is to do with session hijacking and cookie spoofing. If someone gets a hold of your authentication cookie (key), for instance for your online banking (control tower), they can control your accounts (airspace). How can we make sure that the cookie wasn’t spoofed?

Imagine that we’ve taken all precautions against man-in-the-middle attacks, Cross Site Scripting, etc. 

Let’s say that we have a scenario where people are out to get that cookie. Maybe it’s a person with a high level of access to customer information at a bank. Or it’s a government official with access to confidential information about national security. Just any scenario where there’s a lot of sensitive information at stake, we can’t trust that the user’s computer is secure enough and there may even be people who would go as far as copying and spoofing the cookie manually (with all the headers and everything). How can we make sure that it’s the intended person making HTTP requests to my server and not an attacker that has spoofed the authentication cookie?",technology

I was thinking maybe I could negotiate better terms ( such as dismissing fees) if I could pay the smallest of them in full.

sign up for rehab before my raise takes affect and wait 9 months to apply.

sign up for a consolidation( does this mean I eat all the fees?)

 * estimating that renting is better if rental is less than $2.1k /mo leaving the “future” section alone and estimating 3% annual maintenance and $0 closing costs.

After down payment and before reimbursable relocation expenses, I could potentially be starting in seattle with $21k starting - $1k living &amp; rent for july -  $13.5k non reimburse expenses - $7k reimburse expenses = **~$100 to my name by the time I hit Seattle at the beginning of august** (this is discounting 2 - $2k credit cards that could be used for holding expenses)


**The Rules-of-thumb, unknowns, and observations I'm aware of:**

* I might hate living in Seattle/ hate my new workplace

* “renting cost is the max I’ll pay, buying is the minimum I’ll pay”

* My parents have told me, before I have the keys, could range from 30-90 days after starting the buying process  so I will incur temporary hotel costs beyond what’s reimbursable (looks like $2900/month for extended stay hotel - $1300 for first 2 weeks covered by relocation.)
* The first paycheck is is expected to be around ~$10k after taxes before relocation reimbursements. potentially ~$13k with the reimbursements if tax calculations are correct. rough guess for w/ reimbursements. So the bounce-back from first paycheck leaves me better than broke but feels like im betting on future income. (which is a no-no)
* Having potentially ~$100 only to my name before first paycheck is hardcore breaking the emergency fund guidance and would leave me extremely “house poor” (recent college grad, no furniture to my name).

As I was writing this out, the last observation above has me leaning towards the idea I'm not ready to buy a condo despite current world timings and the relocation help from the company.

I really want to ask the community is there any intricacies that I’m overlooking which drives that I cannot buy a condo and should proceed renting for the foreseeable future and ignore the closing cost help, or the opposite situation.

personalfinance,How to tackle debt,"Hi there, I know this gets asked a lot but I wanted to see what people think regarding my thought process.

I have 3.8k in savings right now, earning roughly 2.5k a month with expenses around ~1.2k a month. As a side note, it’s a new job I started in May and beforehand I was making 1.2k a month.

I have a bunch of debt:

Open accounts:

Capital one platinum - 2.3k @ 22.99%
Capital one quicksilver - 1.5k @ 22.99%

Closed accounts:
Barclays - 900 @ 21.24%
Nordstrom - 2,000 @ 22.99%
BoA - 2,300 @ 23.15%
PayPal - 1,200 @ 0%
Synchrony - 900 @ 0%

Currently my credit is around ~580. It took a big hit late last year since I was in between jobs and missed 7 cc payments (but I’m back on track now).

I also have student loans but I figure I need to tackle my cc debt beforehand because of the outrageous interest rates. 

——

What should I pay off first? I think the obvious choice are my opened accounts, paying off 1.5k @ 22.99% first (avalanche/snowball method) then once I do that I can pay for the other Capital One account.

In this case, should I take out money from my savings (save 1k for emergency fund) and just wipe out the cc debt I can with the remaining 2.5k that I have?

Or another thought, should I pay off the higher interest rates regardless of whether the account is open or closed? I use my debit card as much as possible so having any available credit doesn’t matter to me that much at this point. I just want to be able to get rid of my debt aggressively to improve my credit score.

personalfinance,Real estate investing vs. long-term stock investing. What's your opinion?,"Hello All,

Looking for some advice on how to most effectively utilize my income to build wealth and potentially retire early.  Let me give you some background info...

I have been doing monthly deposits into a Betterment account for several years and invested about 10K since December into an Ameritrade account.  I plan to only invest in strong companies/ETF's (no speculative stocks) and have used the wheel options strategy on and off.

I recently bought my first home, and plan on acquiring several rentals.  It's a great neighborhood and plan to continue to buy there.  The homes range from 205K to 225K.  With a 20% downpayment and current interest rates, my monthly conventional mortgage payment would be approximately $800.  The rent rate in the neighborhood is $1400.  I have educated myself via the biggerpockets books and from my understanding most landlords typically net about $200 on a rental home, so acquiring rentals in this neighborhood would far exceed the average industry net income.

Now for my dilemma.  I have a decent job with a very ""average"" salary for my state.  However, my employer has a great 401K match.  I currently pay 6% of my paycheck and they match 9%.  It would be strenuous for me to be fully committed to both real estate and stock investing (outside of my 401K).  Basically I would be a super frugal minimalist, but life is also meant to be enjoyed a bit, right?  

If you had to choose between committing to either real estate or stock investing, which do you think is best for wealth building and gaining financial freedom?",finance

personalfinance,Replace roof or waterproof basement,"Hello all, not sure if this is the correct sub or not. Partner and I just bought a house in Michigan. Some known issues are that the roof had a leak through the vent in the upstairs bathroom and the basement had some water from flooding, both within the past 2 years. (Basement had some bowing as well that was corrected with bracing by the sellers and is likely more secure than it was before).

We're planning to get both the roof replaced and the basement waterproofed within the first year or two of home ownership, but I was kind of curious as to what matter is considered the most urgent in terms of avoiding costly repairs if not taken care of sooner. I expect we will pay for one, save up for another 6-8 months then take care of the other. The house is pretty small so the price for the renovations is pretty comparable. Considering what we got it for, $15,000-$20,000 in repairs that improve the quality and resale value of the home seems very reasonable to us.

personalfinance,Using Affirm to build some credit?,"My boyfriend has a really hard time getting approved for loans because he doesn't have any installment loan credit. For example, we tried to get him approved for a new car when his died, but he was denied even though he has zero debt, decent income, solid credit card payment history, and a low 700's credit score. The sole reason for his denial every single time is due to limited credit history and/or specifically calling out no installment loan history.

I got lucky when I was 18, my mother co-signed on my first car loan, so I was able to get started easy. However, without a cosigner, how does one get a loan? I do not want to cosign for him on anything, and he doesn't have any family with good credit.

We've been looking to buy a Purple mattress soon, and realized that he could use Affirm to finance it. He was pre-approved (with a high interest rate of course), but approved nonetheless. The way we looked at it, the $150 he would spend in interest over the course of one year (assuming he does not decide to pay it off early) is not a *terrible* price to pay to get *some* sort of installment loan history on his credit. He would pay tons more in interest on something like a high APR car anyway (which I would not let him do). For comparison, $150/mo for 12 months to Self Lender would cost him $146 in interest/fees.

I come here seeking advice and strategies to tackle my school loan debt. I feel so stagnant and lost.

I come from a very poor family where I am a first-generation college student. I don’t have family to live with- everyone has moved or passed away. (No parents/grandparents/siblings)

I was not really taught about loans but just knowing I needed them to go to school then get a good job to pay them back. In hindsight, I wish I would have worked a lot more to offset the cost of taking out so much. But que sera, sera. I am trying my best to tackle them now.

Fast forward, I graduated with my doctorate degree in physical therapy of December 2019. I am no longer a student but I do not have steady work either.

I have not been able to secure a job yet due to the pandemic and test centers closing. Figuring out whether to keep Ubering to have money to live on or...to stay home and study for a licensure test I can’t even afford to sit for because I don’t want my credit cards to not be paid has been a constant struggle. (Credit score poor to fair)

-1bedroom apartment with utilities (800all in/month)-no internet or cable.
-Own my car- no car payments. 
-A few credit cards to pay off ($8k total) debt to income ratio=close to 90% (had to use for school expenses)
-Phone/gas/car insurance/food/phone bill~$400/month

I budget and skimp as much as I can(rice and beans)- I don’t go out to eat. Make everything at home.

Attached are what I have accumulated in loans from undergraduate and graduate school:

Basically- there is a mix of federal loans and private

Private loans: $49,863 @ 8.375% and $29,882 @ 8.375
Fed loans: varying rates and amounts:

A) The best type of strategy to take and a timeline of what to expect? I have heard different aspects of loan forgiveness. 

B) I know I have to work on my credit score to get better refinancing rates going forward. My only income at the moment is ubering/donating plasma. Any way to boost that score more quickly?

C) any other strategies to help my financial situation while having the degree knowledge that I do?

D) What do you think is the best thing to set myself up to not only have a respectable credit score but manageable school loan debt? 

I need to have a long term solution that I can stick to since I’m fairly new out of school. I need to start correctly and not have to double back.

I believe I am able to help people but feel like I can’t if I’m so stressed into what I have going on. 

I got into this field with a passion to be genuinely grateful for the opportunity of helping people but I feel defeated every time I login into that loan screen for trying to do the right and responsible thing.

A bit of background: For personal family reasons which are probably outside the scope of this sub, I am currently footing a mortgage and as much as i would like to get all the nitty gritty details from the bank (as to make responsible financial decisions) I am not on the mortgage and I have yet to secure a power of attorney from either of my (divorced, not friendly)parents as to allow the bank to disclose that information to me (I'm working on these things, but as with all things family heated tensions and stubbornness of mules gets in the way, but I love them all the same). 


So that leaves me in the meantime to attempt to figure out the missing pieces with the information I have at hand... To note, I have been/can continue to foot the current mortgage, but where I am currently (financially speaking, still have college/CC debt i'm working on) I'm unsure of my prospects to get good refinancing (hence me doing research and attempting to figure out the current mortgage, which i suspect is not a great one)

At the time of writing this post I only have available the first bank statement I received from my mom when i originally started paying in oct 2018 (I can probably get a more recent statement, but that may take me a day or two). I thought with that information I could calculate the original loan amount (or ""good enough"") so that i could view the amortization graph of the current loan and with that be able to look into refinancing options or decide to just have my parents cede the property to me and continue the payments as they are.

So without further ado here is the information I have at hand (The statement is pretty limited with the information, so please let me know if this is not enough):

* Statement Date: 10/01/2018
* Principal Owed: $181,262.70
* Interest Rate: 5%
* Monthly Payment: $676.00 
* Interest Paid (Statement Month): $516.69
* Principle Paid (Statement Month): $120.83
* Line item labeled ""reserve"" (Statment month, description says it's taxes and insurance): $38.48
* Interest Paid (From Jan to Spet 2018): $5189.18
* Principle Paid (From Jan to Sept 2018): $1186.02
* Reserve (From Jan to Sept 2018): $444.80

I suspect that at some point this house was refinanced (I've asked, but it is fervently denied) since we moved in upon finishing construction circa 2006-2007, which compounded with my lacking knowledge on mortgages and money over time calculations could be why I fail to obtain a correct amortization table. This high of a interest/principal ratio just doesn't seem representative of a house that has been making payments for almost 15 years.",finance

I'm from Denmark and I am relatively deep into US stocks at the moment. All my stocks are green, but I am a bit afraid of want the FED's pumping of the market, the unrest in the US and potential election year etc. is doing to the dollar. Is it inevitable that with the current monetary politics carried out by the FED, that the dollar won't take a hit? The 20th of March, (I know that the price of the dollar was particularly high that time, but still) the dollar has fallen 7% compared to the Euro, which means that all my US stocks, have lost 7% of its value essentially. What are your ""predictions"" for the future price of the dollar compared to the euro?

personalfinance,Car loan suggestions,"Hey folks, 

As with a lot of you I recently lost my job to the pandemic. As a result, I sold off my stock positions to immediately pay off all of my credit cards.

The only other major commitment I have (aside from obvious things like rent) is my car payment. It's around $370/mo and I have $21,000 left to pay on it. The car's trade in value is only around $11,000.

$370/mo will be doable for a little bit, but with things being so uncertain, should I be exploring the option of trying to trade in my vehicle and rollover the $10k difference/go upside down on a cheap but reliable beater?

I'm not sure if I'm better off just riding out my current payment and continue paying at my ~5% interest rate, or if the trade is the way to go to lower my payments.

Any suggestions? If I did the trade would it hurt my credit (aside from maybe the hard inquiry)?

That's all assuming my credit union would let me do any of this while unemployed, but still...",finance
CryptoCurrency,"I have an opinion on Nano and I'm going to spend up to $25,000 to test it. I'll post the whole thing here if anyone is interested.","First, a VERY brief crypto background of me. I've been a bitcoin person for about a decade now. I have a solar bitcoin mining operation and a fruit and veggie farm that is, oddly, integrated with my bitcoin mining operation. I have been trading crypto almost since the beginning. I write trading software for crypto. And I'm going to start a logistics software company that piggybacks off of the bitcoin blockchain. I started seriously acquiring Nano, recently, under $0.80 as a highly speculative bet.

 I have been following Nano for a couple years now. I think the idea is very clever. Fast and free does kind of seem like a dream. But I don't understand the psychology or the economics behind a currency that is peer-to-peer and doesn't require mining. Maybe it'll work...maybe not...I just don't know.

If mining turns out to be the problem then I think that bitcoin will just fork to a non-mining version. Even if Nano is faster, better, more clever, etc...it wasn't the first. Bitcoin was. Satoshi did all the heavy lifting. Nano, while SUPER clever, is just a derivative copy of what Satoshi figured out. The main difference is the lack of mining and the DAG.

Anyhow, you wanna know how I'm gonna spend $25k on Nano, right? Remember how I said I own a farm? Well, my farm grows SUPER fancy produce for people with too much disposable income. We're based in Southern California. They order it from us, we pick it that day from our SUPER FANCY, state-of-the-art greenhouses out in the middle of the desert and we deliver it to your door about 8 hours later.

Most people can't afford our produce because it costs a lot to grow, it's organic, we grow in these crazy greenhouses that cost us a fortune to build. Our stuff is perfect. Anyhow, I want to test home delivery using FedEx so that I can ship anywhere in the continental US instead of our drivers delivering to Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego.

So, since I am about to test home delivery, I thought that I could also spend some of my recent earnings on the trade I just made this evening of Nano.

Ok, I know you had to read a lot to get here. And I'm sorry for that. But, here is what I want to know: IF I TELL THE NANO COMMUNITY ABOUT MY BUSINESS, HOW MANY ACTUAL HOLDERS OF NANO WILL BUY MY FRUITS AND VEGGIES...USING NANO? ARE THERE REALLY ENOUGH HOLDERS OF NANO TO SUPPORT SOME PART OF A BUSINESS? IS NANO REALLY THAT GREAT? IS IT REALLY EASY TO USE LIKE THEY SAY? IF I OFFER YOU A HIGHER QUALITY VERSION OF SOMETHING YOU ALREADY PURCHASE OFTEN, WILL YOU ACTUALLY USE YOUR NANO TO BUY IT? OR...IS EVERYONE JUST TRADING NANO AND HOPING TO GET RICH CUZ THEY MISSED BTC WHEN IT WAS $1?

Also, you should be asking yourself, by now, how is this guy gonna spend $25k? Here's how: this produce costs me a lot to grow because it is grown in glass clean rooms in the middle of the desert, with a costly off-grid solar array and giant battery banks; we only sell to high end restaurants and people who are kinda rich; our tomatoes are $12 per pound. Our strawberries are $12 per pound. Our cilantro is $4 per head, Romaine lettuce is $4....you get the idea. It's expensive. Anyhow, I'm going to create a totally separate site for Nano ONLY customers. I'll pay the shipping fees for orders. And I'll sell the produce at the same price as a regular grocery store, instead of our extremely high prices.

We grow about 30 different things, the most common veggies you would buy at your local grocery store in the US, plus about 7 different tomatoes and 2 types of fancy strawberries.

Ok, now you think that I am just trying to use this subreddit to trick people to going to my site and then tricking you into buying stuff. I'm not. I just made a good amount from Nano nearly doubling on a bet I recently made and cashed in. I'll give all the Nano I make from this test to whomever impresses me the most on this subreddit. I'll make the whole thing public. You can watch the wallet publicly. See if anyone is buying stuff.

I kinda think that very few people are gonna use their Nano to buy something that a real currency should be used for: fruit and veggies. My fruit and veggies are way too expensive for the average family so I am going to subsidize this test (the test is to see if I can get $10-20k in Nano sales by just telling the Nano community on Reddit). I know it's not the best test, I am kinda giving my produce away at cost, I'll have to pay the FedEx overnight shipping costs myself....AND THEN I'M GONNA GIVE SOME INTERNET PERSON ALL THE PROCEEDS INSTEAD OF BUYING A JSG BOGGS PIECE OF ART (LOOK HIM UP, CRYPTO NERDS MIGHT DIG IT).

But I just made a bunch of money on FUCKING Nano of all things! I'm gonna give back up to $25k to test something. I test stuff all the time with crypto, by the way. You should read my posts over the last few years if you're bored one day.

Would anyone be interested in even following this? Do other people think Nano has a use case? Anyone got a better idea for my $25k (other than me giving it to you cuz you're lazy)?

personalfinance,Should I Invest or Refi for a 15 Yeat Mortgage ?,"I am seeking some insight on what the best way to build my long term wealth.  With interest rates very low I am considering turning my 30 year mortgage into a 15 year.  In order to do that I would have to take away from my IRA investments.  

I plan to be at my house 8-10 years but used 5.5 years as a conservative estimate for these calculations.  Let me throw some numbers at you.

My current mortgage is $345,000 at 4.0%.  In the next 5.5 years if I keep that mortgage I will pay:

$37,000 - Principal   
$77,000 - Interest

If I refi to a 15 year at 2.75% then in the same time my allocations look like:

$113,000 - Principal   
$45,500 - Interest

So that is a difference of $76,000 more principal and $31,500 less Interest.  But at what opportunity cost?  

The payment is an extra $700 per month which I can afford but would have to invest less.  

$700/month \* 5.5 years = $46,600

Should I just keep investing this money?  Or would I be better off long term to pay less interest on my loan and build more equity?

This was the first year that I didn't use TurboTax to do my taxes. Instead, I used an accountant that a friend highly recommended (won't go into detail). He claims it was accepted by the IRS, but I still haven't gotten my federal refund, just my state refund. What gives?

He told me that due to things like COVID-19, things may be delayed but my refund status online just says ""in process"" and no official date. We sent it in early to mid March. Accountant said to be patient and I could call the IRS if I need further explanation (he claimed there was ""no staff"" to take calls until June 1) but I'm really worried that he might've messed up my tax return.

It's too early to get audited right? Or they would've told me if there were any errors? I've been trying to think if there might've been anything we did not or I forgot to submit to him but I'm not sure. And he claims it was accepted.

personalfinance,(VA Loan/credit) Timing of refinancing and applying for a mortgage for new home.,"My wife and I are currently considering renting out our current home (mortgaged with a VA loan) and moving closer to where she will be taking classes and i will be working. From what I understand we need to refinance our current loan to rent it out (which should also lower our interest rate). 

There is a chance that she will be taking her classes online due to the pandemic so we may not ""need"" to move quite yet but would still benefit from the IRRRL refinance.

I know we shouldn't do anything to change our credit for a while before applying for a mortgage but wasn't sure about refinancing. Is it ok to refinance and then a couple of months later apply for a new mortgage or should we refinance at the same time that we apply to prevent separate hits to our credit?",finance

personalfinance,VA Loan While Collecting Unemploymemt,"Not sure if the right place but seemed like the best bet.

My live in boyfriend recently returned home from a deployment. We have been together for a few years and the goal for this latest overseas adventure was to create a nice financial buffer for a hopefully productive year of home purchasing, wedding, starting a family. 

We are both first time home buyers and our plan has always been to use the VA loan through USAA.

My SO and I are not currently married and chatted with a loan officer to see if we should do a justice of the peace sooner so my name, credit score and debt to income ratio could be included in the approval process. He said this is not necessary because my SO has great credit and ultimately we can refinance down the road post-marriage if we choose to in order to get my name on the mortgage (aware of risks such as fluctuating interest rates, and my sister is a family law attorney so am aware of implications if we separate).

Question:
My SO returned 3 days ago. The plan was for him to take 2-3 months to wind down before going back to his old job. He is currently collecting UI through the military. 

Does the fact that he is quite technically unemployed have any negative connotations on his ability to be approved for the VA loan? The additional concern is that with Covid-19, he may be furloughed for a time with his civilian job. I know law protects his job in a standard scenario, but this is a bit of an outlier so he is still waiting to hear back from his boss on what the work load looks like / if he will have FTE to come back to when he is planning to go back.

So either way, he may be collecting unemployment for the foreseeable future. 

Follow up question: even if we did a quick wedding just to get us legit on paper so my finances can support the loan, does his unemployment and the fact that he is the benefit holder render my potential involvement null? Or alternatively, would the loan need to be 100% in my name instead?

Have posed these questions to our loan contact but have not heard back. We are done with our lease in 4 months so really hoping to get moving / existing with little patience currently. Any insight is most appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,"Unsure if refinancing is worth it: lower rate, but higher PMI?","Hello everyone,

Despite buying a home just this past September, I have requested and received loan disclosures concerning an opportunity to refinance with a local credit union (previously worked with a mortgage company that sold it to a big bank) that's offering a lower interest rate, from 3.625% to 3.000%. We have about 88% equity. The closing costs, from what I understand, are low (less than 0.75% of the loan), and the new monthly mortgage payment (P&amp;I) comes out to ~$80 less.

The catch is that their listed PMI is ~$50 higher than what I pay now, and the real estate taxes deducted are a little higher, too. They also have Hazard Insurance listed on the monthly payment and no home insurance (different names for the same thing? - I shot the loan officer an email asking)... In any case, with all the adjusted fees and taxes, the total monthly payment on the new mortgage appears to be a mere $7 less.

Putting just the P&amp;I into PMI and savings calculators seems to indicate all is well ($100+ saved per month), but I feel the extra from other items are throwing things off a bit. The calculators all say I'd basically be done with PMI around the same time (57 months on current track v. 60 months with the new loan), but I'm unsure of if the new loan would be a better one since PMI will be higher until then, but then payments would be much lower after.

* $10,000 credit card, 0% interest rate until December, $50 a month minimum
* $5,000 credit card, 0% interest rate until December, $50 a month minimum

I can afford to put down $1800 a month towards paying these down. I also get a yearly bonus in December around $10-15k that I can put towards this at the end of the year.

My initial thought it to pay as much down on the loan until December, considering the interest rate. And then re-consolidate the leftover amount on the loan with the credit cards before the new interest rate hits. But I'm afraid that opening a new loan might really really hurt my credit score.

I was thinking I could also take my new savings plus a few extra months of payments, and just quickly pay off the credit cards now. I would end up spending more money, because I'm not paying off that loan with interest quicker, but at least I wouldn't have to open up a new loan in December.

personalfinance,Hopeful homeowner concerned about IRD,"Hello,
I will be a new homeowner but with the current global pandemic, I have certain anxieties. I would like to be able to calculate penalties for early prepayment of mortgage. Is there a formula for the following statement (appears on contact)....

If you are prepaying all of the outstanding principal amount, the interest rate differential amount is the difference between the following two amounts: 
1. The interest costs on the amount you are prepaying calculated over a period of time equal to the period of time from your last scheduled regular payment date that that is on or before the date of prepayment, whether or not it was actually paid, to the maturity date of your mortgage. Interest is calculated at your existing annual interest rate, plus any discount you received on your existing annual interest rate. Interest is compounded semi-annually, not in advance, and is calculated using your principal and interest payment amount in effect on the date we prepare the payout statement. 
2. The interest costs on the amount you are prepaying, calculated over a period of time equal to the period of time from your last scheduled payment date that falls on or before the prepayment date, whether or not it was actually paid, to the maturity date of your mortgage. The interest costs are calculated at the interest rate posted by us on the date we prepare the payout statement for a Simplii Financial brand mortgage product which we determine to be similar to your mortgage. Interest is compounded semi-annually, not in advance, and is calculated using your principal and interest payment amount in effect on the date we prepare the payout statement. In determining what mortgage product is similar to yours, we will consider the following: 
● the remaining term of your mortgage; 
● the features of your mortgage; and 
● whether you have a conventional or a high-ratio mortgage",finance

Pullback ahead of the Federal Reserve's updated policy statement,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/signs-of-panic-like-selling-emerge-in-the-stock-market-wednesday-morning-even-as-tech-shares-surge-2020-06-10](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/signs-of-panic-like-selling-emerge-in-the-stock-market-wednesday-morning-even-as-tech-shares-surge-2020-06-10)

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. stock market on Wednesday morning is facing a pullback ahead of the Federal Reserve's updated policy statement. However, a measure of the market was showing signs of panic-like selling behavior, even as a rally in the technology-related sector was helping propel tech-pegged indexes to new records. The Arms Index, a volume weighted breadth measure that tracks the ratio of advancing stock to declining stocks over the ratio of advancing volume over declining volume, was showing a reading of 2.318 for the New York Stock Exchange-listed shares. Many technicians say a rise to at least 2.000 suggests panic-like selling behavior. At last check, the ARMs index showed that declining volume was 91.4% of total volume on the NYSE, with declining shares outpacing advancers at a ratio of 4.7 to 1. The Arms Index reading comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.38%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) was down 318 points, or 1.2%, at 26,976, while the S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **-0.17%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) was off 0.7% at 3,185. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **0.52%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) was up 0.1% and an index tracking the largest 100 of that benchmark, the Nasdaq-100 [**NDX,** **0.95%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/NDX?mod=MW_story_quote) was up 0.6%. Both the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq-100 were trading in record territory.

investing,"Fed sees interest rates staying near zero through 2022, GDP bouncing to 5% next year","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html

The Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and indicated that’s where they’ll stay as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.

Along with the rate decision, central bankers projected Wednesday that the economy will shrink 6.5% in 2020, a year that saw an unprecedented halting of business activity in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. However, 2021 is expected to show a 5% gain followed by 3.5% in 2022.

The central bank repeated its commitment from the April meeting that it “expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”

The Fed also said it will continue to increase its bond holdings, targeting Treasury purchases at $80 billion a month and mortgage-backed securities at $40 billion.

The Federal Open Market Committee met this week as states begin to reopen and after unemployment saw its worst monthly drop in history followed by its biggest gain. In addition, the meeting comes the same week the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that a recession started in February, ending the longest expansion in U.S. history.

Fed officials skipped releasing their quarterly economic projections at March meetings as uncertainty permeated over how long the U.S. would remain in stay-at-home mode and how deep the damage would be.

They did release their forecasts this week. Here are the key numbers for 2020, followed by the next two years and the long-run projection:

Fed funds rate: 0%-0.25% through 2022, with the long-run rate at 2.5%

GDP: -6.5% in 2020, 5%, 3.5%, 1.8%

Unemployment: 9.3%, 6.5%, 5.5%, 4.1%.

Headline inflation: 0.8%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 2%.

Core inflation: 1%, 1.5%, 1.7%.

Markets reacted positively to the news, with stocks coming well off their lows of the day and edging toward positive territory.",finance

Forex,"Wednesday, June 10, 2020. -52.7% (S&amp;P Futures)","DISCLAIMER - *The following post is for logbook/note taking purposes and not intended for anyone to follow my trades or as ""signals"".*

Today with FOMC meetings I didnt want to take forex trades, and I was constantly checking my US500Cash positions. I was stopped out and taken out basically all of last Friday's gains. Here are the details:

**EURUSD Long:** This trade was taken yesterday when a pending buy stop at Monday's high was triggered. I adjusted to a larger TP and tightened SL. This morning at NY open I saw some exhaustion and a reversal coming so I closed manually and booked a +3.27% profit. 

[EURUSD Long](https://preview.redd.it/q5akm36fw4451.png?width=3338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aaa4730354ca4a35f504cd4ec66be68307e714e)

**US500Cash (ES/S&amp;P500 Futures):** This position was triggered on Monday, my basic play was just to long the S&amp;P500 to previous highs. I was expecting the price to range after the spike from May 22nd, and then for my order to get triggered. FOMC news expectancy took out my positions this morning. I do have pending orders to be triggered if markets decide to start retracing and also if they continue to last years high.

P/L: -52.7%. This just takes out all profits from last Friday and just basically puts me back at break even.

Does that mean,

By Maintaining the status quo (Zero % interest rate), JPowell essentially says,

Times are bad, there will be virus for years to come

there will be no job, no money, and also no much freedom ( due to Virus) and,

Dollar value is sling south = prices will go up (inflation) = we all will be poorer,

Trump will not be elected and he will create chaos all the way till November (cos there is no -5% negative interest rate Trump asks for... unless miracle happens)

In another word, things not gonna be happening (if not disasterous along the way)?

And they say current stock price is a reflection of the future, and the future has been confirmed by JPowell... Not pretty at all.

What now? Sell?

personalfinance,Credit Score Tanked Because of Loan I was Unaware of,"The other day I received a rather scammy-looking email in my spam folder from ""Unisa"" stating I owed money to the University I graduated from 2 years ago. I shrugged it off as spam because I've never heard of them, they have a lot of complaints on BBB, and all my student loans are in one spot and I've been making normal payments on them. 

I called my University and they said there are no holds, nothing has gone to collections, and all looked good.

I then checked my credit score and saw it dropped 86 points! The cause was a 60+ day overdue payment to an account with the name of my University. 

I immediately called Equifax and told them it was fraud, because I knew nothing of any additional loans.

After digging some more, I come to find it was a federal Perkins loan that had all of my old information (old address, old phone number) on file and had no way other than their suspicious email that went straight to my spam folder to tell me that I owe money to them.

What do I do about my credit score tanking? Can I dispute that I was never notified of the loan being due? Do I just have to suck it up?",finance

personalfinance,Trying to refinance - can't prove income - suggestions please!,"I am trying to take advantage of the low interest rates and refinance from 4.75% to 3.125% (comparable APR). The savings both monthly and long-term are immense, and the break-even point on cash-to-close is about 11 months. 

Current mortgage is shared as joint tenants between my girlfriend and I. We are college students again and as such our part time income is approximately 22K/year each. We have fantastic credit, and the only remaining step in the refinance process on our \~$235k outstanding principle balance is INCOME VERIFICATION.

We are both restaurant servers. My girlfriend declares her tips to her employer at the end of the night, and employer taxes this income and it is reflected on her pay stubs.

I recently transitioned (6 months ago ish) to another employer (same job title and industry I've been in for many years). My pay stubs have been delivered electronically, and I hadn't gone over them until I started this process (most of my income is cash tips! - CHECK YOUR PAY STUBS, I know.......).

I have a very long history of regular cash deposits to support my stated income, but because my paychecks only reflect 1/4 or so of my income, I am having a hard time getting the bank to verify my income. I absolutely make the whopping 22k/year I told them I do, but because my employer doesn't tax it (yet), the bank is pushing back. This refinance is an incredible opportunity to save many thousands, and I don't want to miss out on it. 

For the record, I have been claiming the tips i make in our scheduling software at work, so I \*assumed\* (oops) that appropriate steps were being taken on the back end. I was instructed to do this by my employer.

I have a great relationship with my employer and have, without discussing how much savings is at stake for me, mentioned my situation. Outside of reworking their payroll to properly reflect income (which they will do), I am at a loss.

The bank *may* count my long history of cash deposits as income, but they've become really slow since this issue arose. So I need advice on how to prove my income!

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Refinance will save thousands. Need to prove my income. I work for tips @ a very small business. Tips haven't been properly taxed. Only proof of this income is history of regular cash deposits. Need something more formal (willing to pay back taxes, i just want it to be done correctly). Please lob ideas at me to help me verify my income.",finance

Seller then agrees to pay 5k in closing if we raise our price to 205. Whatever that’s fine. Initially our cash to close was 14k including DP. Before we accept this new offer I email my LO and ask, since seller is paying 5k in closing, and we are raising purchase price, are we now only going to need to bring 9k to close? And he says yes. Today we get the commitment letter stating we are approved for 205k with loan for 190k. Aka we now have to bring 15k just for down payment because our loan is for 190. Our LO never told us that and when I asked him about it he hasn’t replied. Is this weird? I feel cheated? Why would I want to raise purchase price to include CC if that would require me to pay more?

personalfinance,What should I do with my modest inheritance?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.


I just inherited $10,000.00

I currently have a decent savings. I pay my credit card debt off every month.

I do have crippling student loan debt, but bc of COVID my loan payments have been suspended, which I’m enjoying.

I was thinking about putting the whole 11K in my retirement (403b). My retirement fund isn’t that great right now, like under 20k. 

My employer does match, I think 6%. So I’ve been putting away about 10% of my income towards the retirement for the past few months.

Would I be remissed if I put it towards retirement?

I do have just under 200K in student loan debt, average interest rate is about 5%.

Reasons  why I’m not currently dumping it all into student loans is:

1. I applied for the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness, so theoretically my loans will be paid off in ten years regardless.

2. I’m currently in a civil suit against my graduate school for damages related to my tuition. I’ve already paid my attorney and going forward we will basically split the awarded money, with what I’ve already paid deducted from the final amount he gets . Not sure how much we’ll get or when. He seems to be very confident that we’ll get a decent amount (enough to pay back my loans). But who knows.

Should I put all of the 10K in retirement or should I spilt it up? Put some into savings?

I live in California and make about 95k/year before taxes, if that makes a difference.

Bitcoin,How to Explain Bitcoin: 3 Tips to Have Better Bitcoin Conversations,"BTC Friends,

Let’s be honest, Bitcoin is confusing. Not to you (you are on this /r/ after all), but to the people who have no idea what it is. Trying to explain Bitcoin is even harder. I’m sure we’ve all had those long, complicated, drawn-out conversations which leave people more confused than when it started. 

To aid its adoption **WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT EXPLAINING WHAT BITCOIN IS.** 

Here are a few tips that should, hopefully, help you manage a simple and easy to understand discussion about Bitcoin. 

Before we get to that, a few things to remember:

**Bitcoin is a** ***fundamental*** **change from what most people believe.** An explanation about Bitcoin shouldn’t be about “being right” or “winning the argument.” Instead, it should be about helping someone explore a new idea and begin to understand that there are actually different alternatives to the only “money” they’ve ever known.

**Bitcoin is complicated.** It’s important to remember that this is as much of an emotion transformation for someone as it is a logical one. A CONFUSED MIND ALWAYS SAYS NO. If you leave a person confused or frustrated about what Bitcoin is, they are more likely to build up a resistance to it and become close-minded because “it’s just too complicated.”

**Adoption is a marathon, not a sprint.** Don’t feel the need to word vomit all of your intense 1337 cypto-knowledge in a single conversation. Slow and steady. Like a good story-teller, keep them wanting more. 

Now, some tips to consider:

**1. Start with ‘WHAT is Bitcoin?,’ not ‘WHY is Bitcoin?’**

A fundamental mistake that people make is to try to justify WHY something exists before even explaining WHAT something is. Your explanations need to act as a building blocks of knowledge which means you have to have a very clear, very easily understood, fundamental premise:

*Bitcoin is…:*

*Digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.* 

*An alternative form of money than what you are given by your local government.* 

That's it. That's Bitcoin. While I’m sure we can, and probably will, argue about what that base, fundamental definition is, it’s important to start with WHAT, not WHY. 

While hyperinflation, store of value, scarcity, the Federal Reserve, and how the printing of fiat devalues currency are all important, it does not answer the question of WHAT is Bitcoin. If you start with WHY, you are skipping a major building block in the mind of the listener and are on your way to creating confusion. And remember, a confused mind always says no!

Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7l4A5DSYas). (Now, don’t go full-internet on me. I’m not degrading this person or this video THANK YOU PERSON FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO. This video is awesome! I only bring it up because it is a recent video that got some attention. It also demonstrates this point.)

When asked to explain Bitcoin, here is the opening line:

“The FED…is out of control with printing money…”

This is a ‘WHY is Bitcoin’ response. Already, the listener is probably thinking, ‘what the heck does the FED have to do with anything? I just wanted to know what Bitcoin was…’ and you may just lose your listener right there. 

Furthermore, this video never actually says “Bitcoin IS…” While there is an implied comparison to gold, there is never a fundamental definition of WHAT Bitcoin is. 

Start with a clear, concise definition of WHAT Bitcoin is before moving on to WHY Bitcoin is. 

**2. Let Them Lead / Gauge Their Interest / Know When To Stop**

When explaining any topic to someone who doesn’t understand it, there is a very strong temptation to TELL everything you know. This is human nature. We are proud of what we know. We want to display knowledge and proficiency. We must, however, understand that it is counter-productive to the learning process. Imagine that certain math teacher going over that certain math problem. They explain it. They are enthusiastic about it. They write it on the chalkboard. Yet your eyes glaze over. It’s too much too fast. You are just waiting until the end when they finally tell you the answer. All logic and reasoning and understanding is gone. This is similar. 

Instead of telling them everything you know, **LET THEM ASK!** Allowing your listener to ASK demonstrates two things: an *understanding* of the last thing you said and, more importantly, *interest!* Ultimately, that’s what we want and need; their interest.

Believe me, just like that little kid asking, ‘why, why, why…?’ They will give you every opportunity to share a little bit more, and a little bit more.

For example:

Bitcoiner – “*Bitcoin are digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.”* 

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob – *“Oh…ok…well…why do we need that? What's wrong with the money I have now?”*

Bitcoiner – *“Well, there is a risk that, over time, the money that you keep in your wallet or bank account will actually be worth less and be able to buy less stuff.”*

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob – *“Wait, what do you mean?”*

And we are now on our way to a discussion about these messy and intense concepts of inflation vs deflation, printing of fiat currency, fractional reserve lending, etc. And through it all, **LET THEM LEAD**. 

Now this is the tough part. If their eyes glaze over, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** When the questions stop, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** The last thing you want to do is ramble on once they’ve stopped listening. Instead, ASK them a question:

“*I’m sorry, did you not understand something I said?”*

*“Did I answer your question?”*

*“Is this interesting to you?”*

By doing this, you will give them an opportunity to ASK you another question: *“…back up…what did you mean when you said ‘store of value’?”*

Or maybe even make a comment: *“…wow…this stuff is pretty complicated…”*

In either case, this actually helps keep the conversation going. Just back up, explain it again, keeping in mind your base concepts and definitions, and see if you can talk them past where they got stuck. 

Maybe they shut you down entirely: *“you know what, this is crazy, it can’t be true, let’s change the subject…”* To which the ONLY correct response is, *“Ok!”* (we’ll get to this later). 

Keep in mind that letting your listener lead will allow you to carry the conversation much further than you trying to push it along on your own. 

**3. Know Your Role / A Little at a Time / Don’t Overcorrect** 

So, what’s the end goal? Is it to have them whip out their phone, download an exchange, and make their first Bitcoin purchase right then and there?! No, of course not. 

The role of these conversations is to **LEAVE THEM WANTING MORE.** Your goal should be to spark *interest* and *curiosity*. If after talking with you they end up on The Google or The YouTube looking for more information, then *you’ve done your part!* 

Movies and TV condition us to want the big payoff at the end: the parade, the teary embrace, the triumphant symphony. That is not real life. Really, the best ending to a Bitcoin conversation might just be your listener making an audible, but clearly deeply contemplative, “…huh…”. You’ve done your job. You’ve got them noodling something they have never noodled before. 

Even once you understand Bitcoin, there is still an entirely different conversation about what the technology is, how it works, and how people interact with it. And let’s be honest, it’s complex and confusing. Exchanges, blockchain, forks, difficulty adjustments, miners, cold storage… More complicated ideas. More jargon. Make sure you throttle yourself back and explain just **A LITTLE AT A TIME.** It’s ok to have one conversation about the fundamentals of Bitcoin and then an entirely different conversation about blockchain technology or how people acquire BTC or the difference between storing Bitcoin on an exchange versus a cold wallet. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to tackle all of this at once.

While all this is happening, **BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCORRECT.** People know what they know, right? And what people know is always correct, right?? Be sensitive. If your listener makes a comment that isn’t true or is off track, don’t scold them or forcefully correct them. **If your listener feels attacked or threatened, conflict will arise, and once that happens, their minds will be completely shut off.** No one listens during an argument. Don’t attack. Explain.

For example:

Noob – *“Well, the USD is backed by gold, so that will prevent it from ever devaluing!”*

Bitcoiner – *“You know, it’s pretty interesting, a lot of people think the same thing. The truth is that while the USD was backed by gold for a long period of time, it isn’t anymore. You see, back in 1971…”*

Keep it simple, factual, and non-confrontational.

Going back to our example from before, even if your listener shuts you down entirely, **THAT’S OK!** They have now experienced a Bitcoin conversation that will percolate around in their brain. And perhaps next time they hear the word Bitcoin, whether on the news or on the internet, they’ll think back to your conversation and what you shared with them. Hopefully you didn’t over-press and their memory of your conversation isn't a negative one which leaves them feeling negative about Bitcoin: *“Bitcoin is stupid and people who believe in Bitcoin are arrogant and rude.”*

Finally, **ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH.** The journey doesn’t start and end with you. You are simply a stepping stone along their path. Know that you are playing a part in their story; you are not the main character. 

Adoption of Bitcoin will occur over a long period of time. The conversations we have with our friends and family will create the buzz, attention, and understanding that is needed, but please be mindful that you are doing it in a helpful and productive way that leaves people wanting to know more.

Anyway, I will soon be in a new job and making about (at least) 30% more than I am now by the end of the year. I'm currently living in mom's basement and as you may be able to guess, I am not thrilled about it. I've worked through my budget through the end of 2021 and given my projected income and expenses I can either:

A) Afford to pay off my car by August or September of 2021 and then move out at that time.

OR

B) Afford to continue making my minimum monthly car payments through November, put a lump sum of about $5,000 toward the car payment in December, and then make extra loan payments to pay my car off no later than the end of 2022. 

I can afford to make extra car loan payments beginning next year because I won't have to withhold any extra on my taxes anymore. I'm currently withholding a few extra hundred dollars per month to make up for underpayment of subsidized health insurance premiums (based on income) during the first half of the year as well as to cover taxes for a Roth conversion I did in March. 

The current balance on the auto loan is $15,995 and the interest rate is 5.94%. Minimum monthly payments are $312.69. I can get that down to about $9,200 by the end of the year (including the $5,000 lump sum). I should then be able to start making payments $558 per month (or more, if my income continues to increase) until it's paid off.

My question is... Which option should I choose and why? Should I live at home longer and pay off my car sooner? Or should I get out of mom's place by January 2021 and take a little longer to pay off my car?

Once my auto loan is paid off, regardless of when that is, I plan to roll that payment into my student loans and begin making extra payments on those. Thanks for your input!",finance

personalfinance,Should I save and build my savings account up or pay off my student loans aggressively?,"A little bit of background, I put myself through school and ended up with around $80,000 in student loans. Breaking that out, it's about $53,000 in private loans and $27,000 in federal loans. I got my first full-time job out of school in May of 2018 and since then, I've worked two jobs and paid off the private loan aggressively since then, putting those paychecks toward the private loan. Today, at the age of 25, I only have $11,000 left on that loan. 

With the whole COVID crisis, I have been putting all of my stimulus toward the loan. Thankfully, the federal loans aren't gaining interest and payments aren't needed until September so I've been focusing on the private loan. I was offered my job back on August 3rd and will be returning.

My question is, should I keep putting this money toward the loan? I'll have the private loan paid off by September if I do this, then I plan to tackle the federal. However, I'm worried about my savings account, thinking if I should save up for something like a house or new car. I also contribute to an IRA. I have a little over $11,000 in savings, but I'm worried I should have more.

personalfinance,Question about mortgages and refinancing,"Hi everyone. 

First, let me start by saying I apologize if this question has already been answered. I did search before writing this post, but it's possible I missed something because I don't think I have the right terminology/vocabulary.

Anyway, here's my scenario and corresponding question:

I currently own a house and have a mortgage to go with it (interest rate is 4%). As everyone here already knows, a few months back, the Fed slashed interest rates in an effort to head off  the potential economic damage caused by COVID. Naturally, mortgage interest rates have dropped as well, but the biggest impact has been for NEW Mortgages, not Refi's. Right now I'm showing 2.875% for a 30 year fixed on a new purchase vs. 3.875% for a 30 year fixed on a refi. Since my current interest rate is 4% - a refi wouldn't really be worth it.

My question is: Say I were to write a check and pay off my existing mortgage and then 30-60 days later apply for a new mortgage - would that be considered a ""New"" mortgage (with the ""new"" mortgage interest rates) or would the banks still consider that to be a refinance and apply the higher Refi interest rates?

Thank you for your time.",finance
stocks,"After today, there is only one thing you should be doing with your money...","**...investing in the stock market.**

Hi, nice to meet you. For context on who I am, I was the guy who on March 12th, 2020 said the worst is behind us in the market, with an error rate of 5%. IVV (S&amp;P) was at 248.96 that day.

( [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhoud7/weve\_seen\_the\_worst\_of\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhoud7/weve_seen_the_worst_of_it/) )

IVV did go on to drop more than 9%, so off by 4 basis points. But, if you would have taken my advice, by simply putting money into the S&amp;P, the safest stock move you can make, you would have made a return of nearly 30% in 3 months.

How did I know that was the bottom when this whole website thought we were entering a massive depression?

Well, let's check out what I said...

*""....but I find it crazy to assume the market will keep selling. Where is the money going?!?!* ***With rates as is, the best bargain still is in stocks and until rates rise that’s the only logical location your money should be parked in.*** *""*

And that leads us to today when the Fed announced that interest rates will REMAIN at ZERO for the next TWO years.

Boys, we are about to face a MASSIVE economic expansion. And if you sit on cash waiting for the market to go lower you are sorely misinformed, my friend.

With rates at 0, gravity does not exist. There are no bounds to economic expansion, so for the well-run companies that hopefully all of us are invested in - they just got approval for free money for their next two years. For a great company, that is enough to catapult themself into the future.

Many of today's parallel machine learning algorithms were developed for tightly coupled systems like computing clusters or clouds. However, data volumes generated from machine-to-machine or human-to-machine interaction, such as mobile phones or autonomous vehicles, surpass the amount that can conveniently be centralized. Thus, traditional cloud computing approaches are rendered infeasible.

In order to scale parallel machine learning to these amounts of data, computation needs to be pushed towards the edge, that is, towards the data generating devices. By learning models directly on the data sources - which often have computation power of their own, for example, mobile phones, smart sensors and tablets - network communication is reduced by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it facilitates obtaining a global model without centralizing privacy-sensitive data. This novel form of parallel, distributed, and federated machine learning has gained substantial interest in recent years, both from researchers and practitioners, and may allow for disruptive changes in areas such as smart assistants, machine learning on medical or industrial data, and autonomous driving.

This workshop is the third edition of the successful DMLE workshops at ECMLPKDD 2018 and 2019. We decided to rename the workshop to broaden the scope and integrate novel directions in the field, for example, privacy-preserving federated learning in the medical domain. The workshop aims to foster discussion, discovery, and dissemination of novel ideas and approaches for parallel, distributed, and federated machine learning.

We invite participation in the 3rd Workshop on Parallel, Distributed, and Federated Learning, to be held as part of the ECMLPKDD 2020 conference. This year we invite two types of submissions to the workshop:

* full length papers (16 pages)
* short papers (8 pages)

For all accepted papers, we invite the authors for a presentation as a poster. Moreover, for 4-6 papers, we invite the authors for a presentation as a talk during the workshop. We issue a Best Paper Award with certificate and a prize. The main topics are, including, but not limited to:

* Federated learning
* Parallel machine learning
* On-device machine learning
* Edge computing for machine learning
* Decentralized deep learning
* In-situ methods
* Communication-efficient learning
* Privacy-preserving learning
* Black-box machine learning
* Distributed optimization
* Theoretical investigations on parallelization
* Large-scale machine learning, massive data sets
* Distributed data mining
* Fairness in Federated Learning
* Distributed Training of Generative Models
* Resource constraint machine learning
* Hardware aspects of distributed learning

We are looking forward to your contributions!

personalfinance,Some simple questions about mortgage refinancing,"I bought my first house six years ago. At that time, I put down 10% in cash, took a first mortgage for 80%, and took a second mortgage at a higher interest rate for the other 10%.

Due to some career changes, my income fluctuated a lot over the past several years, and I had to take out the equity that I'd earned by paying down some of the second mortgage. Basically, I'm at square one.

However, three things are currently working in my favor:

(1) My career has stabilized and I expect my earnings to grow steadily over the next few years, starting a few months from now.

(2) The property value of the house has increased substantially - it's now worth about 20% more than my purchase price.

(3) Interest rates appear to be bottomed out. I suppose that they might go lower, but not my much.

So it looks like this is the right time to refinance. However, I have three questions:

(1) Given the new equity value of the house, I believe that a refinance mortgage would cover the principal of both the current first and second mortgages. This would not only consolidate the payments, but since the total value of the refinance mortgage would be below 80% of the equity value, it would significantly lower the rate on the principal that's currently covered by the second mortgage. Is that correct?
 
(2) Would there be any way to cash out a bit of the equity in the process? The HVAC just died, and I don't have the cash on hand to pay for a new unit. I'd prefer to finance it using equity rather than high-interest debt.

(3) Any recommendations for finding a new lender? I've tried using LendingTree before, but I got bombarded with an insane number of calls and email messages. I don't want 30 offers; I only want the best two or three offers. How do I go about finding that? (Also, should I just call my current lender and see if they're willing to refinance at the lower rate?)

Thanks in advance, everyone.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage holder wants to lower my Interest rate. Why?,"I am trying to figure out what my current mortgage company has to gain by making me a recent offer.

A quick rundown: I currently have a fixed 3.75 rate, have had this loan for just over 10 years with the same company. That company sold my loan earlier in the year to Freedom Mortgage. Ok no problem nothing changes except who gets my payment.

Last week Freedom called and wanted to offer me a 3.125 interest rate stating nothing would change in how many years we have left to pay off, no home inspection, etc. I told them to send me the documents and I would look at them. I noticed the charges being added to the back end of my loan of about 2000 over what I currently owe. Although my monthly payment goes down per month and I still have 19 years until its payed off. I said forget it because we may be selling next year and I doubt I would recoup that money in that time period.

They called again today with ""better"" terms of a 2.75% fixed rate and about 800 less being added to the back end for costs. I currently have a VA loan this one is also a backed VA loan.

My question is what is going on here? We have never been late or missed a payment but I doubt this is being extended to me because we are great customers. There has to be something they are gaining, which is fine but to what extent at my expense are they gaining?

personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off auto loan to make private sale easier?,"Hey guys,

Would there be any downsides to taking out a personal loan to pay off my car so that I have the title in hand to make a private-party sale easier? 

I have positive equity in the car, I owe around $20K and the car is worth about $45K in a private sale. I'm not in a hurry to sell it, but I'd think it'd be a much smoother transaction with the title in hand. I have a great credit score, and from what I can tell the interest rate would likely be only a couple points higher than the existing rate on the auto loan and since I'd only have the loan for a two or three months until the car sold, I think it'd only cost me like maybe a couple hundred bucks more than the existing loan would be for that same period of time (assuming the loan has no outrageous fees or early payoff penalties, which I obviously wouldn't do). 

Seems like a no-brainer, but I haven't used a personal loan before, so just curious if there are any potential issues with this approach that could bite me in the ass.

Before you react to the title, I just want to preface this by saying that I have been paying a large portion of my parent's mortgage in the last few years even since their business went under. I currently live with them, so this can be looked at as rent. I understand the risk of what happens if they cannot pay for the mortgage, but I know I will cover it if my parents can't pay for it either way. 

Currently, the home is worth about 300k, and the remaining principal amount is about 100k. The interest is 4.375% fixed on a 30 yr, and I want to take advantage of the lower interest rates to reduce the monthly payment. I was looking at a 15 yr refinance, which I am hoping to get under 3.0%. Would this be the best solution, or are there other ways to handle this?

personalfinance,Update: I fell for a scam last night.,"Here’s my original post if you want to read it. https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/g0np8u/i_fell_for_a_scam_last_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

TLDR; Someone called me pretending to be my bank, I’m dumb, and they took $1897 from me. 


So I had filed a complaint with my bank. They gave me a provisional credit for the money that was taken. However, they decided that no error occurred and took the money back. 

I filed a rebuttal with them and sent screenshots of parts of the EFT Act that said I can only be held liable depending on how long it takes me to notify my bank. I had notified them within HOURS when it happened. Tonight I checked my bank account to make sure I had enough to buy milk and the money was back in my account. According to the email I received, they’ve determined that an error DID occur and I got all of my money back. 

I don’t remember who it was, but someone on my original post recommended bringing up the EFT Act. Whoever you are, thank you. I wouldn’t have gotten my money back without you. I had no idea the EFT Act existed. 

I still feel stupid for falling for the scam in the first place. I’m much more careful now. But a huge weight has been lifted knowing that I got the money back.

Edit: This post got much bigger than I ever thought. 

The advice is all great. If your bank calls, hang up and call them back. Y’all are literally just saying the same exact thing over and over. lol Chill out a bit. 

Also, because there has been quite a few questions around this.. The person who called me spoofed my bank’s phone number. I did not just answer a call from a number I didn’t know. They scared me by saying that my card had been used elsewhere and then used that fear to get me to do what they wanted. I’m a grown ass woman and should have known something was wrong. But they were really good at making sure I was scared enough to do what they wanted. 

For those of you who wanted more info on the EFT Act, there’s some really good links and info in the comments. But you can read the EFT Act here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2008/0807/08-07_attachment.pdf

personalfinance,Graduate School expenses worse than expected.,"Hi y'all, 

I'm actually here on behalf of my SO. She is trying to find funds for living expenses in graduate school in Texas next year. We have some questions about the intricacies of pulling from retirement funds early (specifically a 401a vs 403b). She will not have a job during school (it is virtually not permitted to do so). 

If she waits to pull from her retirement on January 1st, so that she will have 0 income for the year - what tax penalties would she incur? I understand it depends on how much she pulls - as it will count as taxable income (plus whatever penalty for withdrawing early) - whats the highest amount she can pull from either or both to keep her in the lowest income bracket? Is there an option to transfer to an IRA first (with her current employer) to incur a lower penalty?

personalfinance,Getting $20k in cash and not sure how to invest it,"TL/DR: We’re getting about 20k in cash and I’m not sure how to invest it. My initial thoughts to satisfy living in the moment and saving for retirement, is to use that money as a down payment to invest in an AirBnB property in a fun vacation spot. But short term I’m thinking now is a good time to invest in a mutual fund or the stock market. I appreciate any and all advice! 

Little back story, my wife and her brother were given a duplex by their father when he moved away to live that retired life. The duplex isn’t in the greatest part of town and we tried doing the renting thing for a few years but it was more trouble than what it’s worth. 

To back track a little further, my wife and I were a little confused on how the transfer of property went down. She never signed one single document or seen any title on the house. When we check the county auditor website it’s just in her brother’s name. This is all fine and has been a non-issue. We’ve been splitting the rent 60/40 because her brother is doing all the backend work and we’re just collecting the paycheck. 

This brings us to today. A few months ago we made the decision to sell the property and yesterday we finally received an offer. Obviously there is still a bunch of hurdles to cross before it sells; inspection etc. But if everything goes through my wife and I will be getting about 18-20k in cash. Which ultimately leads to the question of how to invest or use it. 

Our situation:

- Our take home is about $130,000 a year (this is after my 401k contribution)
 
- I dropped all our 401k contributions to meet the company matching to aggressively put money in to an emergency fund. I made a mistake in my younger years and thought that if I ever had an emergency I’d take a 401k loan so I was putting a huge amount in to our 401k, not realizing that if you lost your job you cannot take a 401k loan. We're almost to our emergency fund goal, one 1 July we'll be starting our contributions back up again to 15%.

- Mortgage: Interest Rate 2.75 % Balance: $173,000 Minimum Payment is $1200, we pay $2000

- Car payments: $1300 a month - One car is a lease which we'll be turning in next month because my wife is deploying and the other car's interest rate is 3.24%

- No credit card debt or any other debt beside cars

- Emergency Fund: $20,000 Goal: $25,000.00

Our mindset is save for retirement but we’re also big in living in the moment. We don’t want be frugal with our money to save for the future just to get cancer at 60 and die, if that makes sense (morbid I know). Hence the larger car payments because I like nice, new, shiny cars. 

To bring all this home and the TL/DR: we’re getting about 20k in cash and I’m not sure how to invest it. Our goal for the emergency fund is $25k so $5k will be going to that. My initial thoughts to satisfy living in the moment and saving for retirement, is to use that money as a down payment to invest in an AirBnB property in a fun vacation spot. But short term I’m thinking now is a good time to invest in a mutual fund or the stock market. I appreciate any and all advice!

personalfinance,Protecting 401(k) value - Want to move into risk-averse assets,"Hi,

By and large, it appears we've returned to pre-COVID valuations for equities. That said, the data doesn't lie -- the Federal Reserve has orchestrated an asset bubble where we are reaching ATH, despite record unemployment, an unstopping virus and compounding US-China trade tensions.

I want to move my 401(k) over to the most risk-averse option for the remainder of 2020.

I'm aware you're not supposed to time the market. I'm willing to sacrifice the remainder of the year's gains in order to move my 401(k) over to safer options until there is a clearer path ahead. I'll consider those losses temporary 'insurance.'

With that said, I'm a novice when it comes to the offered ""safe"" options like fixed income and bond options. I don't understand those markets as well as someone who's been familiar with them for years.

Can someone share with me what might be the best option? My 401(k) is with Principal. If I could just convert it to cash penalty free and hold it in the account, that would be the most preferred, but clearly not an option.

The most risk-averse options appear to be:

* Fixed Income Guaranteed Option (ranked as the ""most risk averse"")
* PGIM Total Return Bond Z Fund
* PIMCO Total Return Instl Fund
* Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Admiral Fund
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Institutional Fund

Thank you

investing,Is The Fed Driving An Asset Bubble?,"**Asset valuations**

There is a growing school of thought that the Fed and other central banks are driving an asset bubble when the evidence is wanting. In fact, I’d go further than that and suggest that the Fed can stimulate away and should tolerate richer asset valuations yet.

* First, on stocks, traditional relative measures that were recapped in yesterday’s note showcase how stocks are not cheap but there is nothing particularly out-of-sample going on here. Yet investors are buying on a price relative to forward earnings basis over multiple quarters ahead in anticipation of a rebound. They’re not buying stocks to get a claim on earnings this quarter (or lack thereof…) or last quarter or even this full year’s earnings that will be depressed by the first half experience. In fact, for the S&amp;P500, price compared to 2021 earnings expectations sits at about 20 times (chart 1). If the earnings rebound turns out to be anything close to analysts’ expectations, then maybe….gasp…stocks are cheap and nobody wants to say as much.

* If so, then daily gyrations aside, stocks could have considerably more room to run. This runs counter to the common narrative that the Fed’s stimulus is driving ridiculous stock valuations rather than viewing such valuations as based upon post-COVID-19 earnings expectations in a recovery (I’ll come back to recovery evidence in a moment).

* Second, given that the Fed looks at broad asset markets, we also need to do so. When I look at commodity valuations, we’ve got a long way to go yet before we get to over valuation. Talked to the oil patch lately? Enough said.

* Housing also doesn’t seem over-valued. One gauge is homebuyer affordability that before the COVID-19 shock was only slightly more affordable than the two decade average. Another is repeat sales home price indices that were climbing by 4.4% y/y before the shock and well below the recent peak rate of growth in early 2018.

* And then of course we have the Fed’s preferred core PCE gauge of inflation that is likely to decelerate sharply over the faces downside risk over the duration of the year. Not only is evidence of asset inflation often overstated, it principally matters when it shows up in broad price signals and that’s not likely to happen for some time.

**Rebound expectations**

* Equity analysts’ earnings expectations are based upon underlying expectations for an economic rebound. In my opinion, there are already signs that the global economy is recovering and quite possibly going V-shaped which should inform a cautiously optimistic bias at the Fed. Heck, that’s not even entirely a forecast as there is evidence that conditions are already headed there such that by the time GDP growth returns to the black in Q3 we’ll already be well into recovery mode.

* Look at the evidence. German restaurant bookings are soaring (chart 2). Chinese air travel has already recovered to well above where it was at the start of the year (chart 3). Global air travel is gradually recovering (chart 4). North American retail foot traffic is starting to recover, albeit out of a deep pit (chart 5). US homebuyer foot traffic is slowly inching higher (chart 6) and mortgage purchase applications have not only recovered the COVID-19 shock but are at levels seen well before the US economy shut down in mid-March (chart 7).

* Is all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we’ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn’t be so sure. As for second-wave COVID-19 risk, yes it’s real, especially as reopening efforts gain speed and social inhibitions toward large gatherings so obviously decline. But will that stop the economy again? Probably not. One reason is that governments can’t afford to do that all over again; to take on balance sheet the shut down economy again could risk deficits rapidly soaking up excess world saving and impairing the ability of companies and households to roll over debt from the last cycle. Governments across the world were running procylical fiscal policy with varying shades of abandon before the shock and this limited their flexibility to address this one.

Is all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we’ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn’t be so sure. As sophisticated as humans like to think we are as a species, we are not. We never change, or maybe we just adapt and move on by doing things differently, spending money in different ways or on different things with varying time periods toward a full recovery. History offers abundant evidence. I’ve been doing this gig in one form or another for about a quarter century which is just barely enough time in the grand sweep of history’s humbling lessons to have learned that every time a shock arises, we’re told we’ll never be the same again and things will never return to some sense of normalcy. We do. Every time that view turns out to be dead wrong. One of my favourite examples was when demographics best sellers told us during the early 1990s recession that an aging population meant fundamentally changed behaviour and we’d never have another housing boom after the 1980s. Oops.

stocks,Is share borrowing fee for a short position recalculated on a daily basis?,"I.e. do I pay the interest rate per each day based on that day's value of my position based on previous closing price and the interest rate of that day. Or are the fee and price fixed on the day of initial transaction. The first scenario makes much more sense but I can't find any info on it.

Example:

* Day 0. Stock  closes at $10.
* Day 1. I open a short position for 100 shares at $9, total value $900. Borrow fee rate at the moment of transaction %200. Stock closes at $7.
* Day 2. Stock closes $5. Average fee 100% for the day.
* Day 3. Stock drops to $3. Avg fee 50%. I close my position.

But then, I thought: ""Maybe it's the way things are explained on that site that makes me unable to absorb much from it?""


Fast forward to February and I've read through a bunch of investing sites. But still, I find myself skiming through the ""confusing"" parts because I just don't feel the content 'click' with my mind."" 


Then Covid exploded in the US and Europe. Stock prices are free falling. My money in the robo investor starts falling too. Lost 10%. I was afraid it dropping further and so changed my allocation to mostly bonds. Told myself to watch for the market's bottom before reverting my portfolio allocation (mostly in equities) for g a i n s. 


End of March and the market passed the bottom and starts to rise. Told myself the covid thing still looks really bad in the US while the fed turns on the printer. Watched S&amp;P almost up to 2.9k and I get frustrated with ""unemployment high cases high but why stocks high!!1!??""



And so end I told myself: ""fuck it, maybe I just need to be more hands on about it. Didn't understand shit reading those sites anyway. Also this covid thing caused airline and cruise stocks to go down low. Reddit says its a good buy. I should jump into it before it recovers fully"" 


So I brought LUV and CCL based on reddit threads around mid and late May respectively. Both rose up and I had around 25% gains until around 2 days ago. Felt good about it so changed my robo investor back to pre covid allocation at the same time. 


Then today happened.


Right now, looking at LUV and CCL dropping around 10 and 15 percent respectively from yesterday as I'm writing this, I realised this whole time I have been putting my head in the goddamn sand. It's not that the learning stocks is confusing (it might be) , it's just that I want the easy way out. I want to have my cake and eat it too. I want only gains and no losses.  I want to make money without putting in the effort to learn how to do it. It's like that dog meme no take only throw only it's no risk only gains. The emotional gremlin in my head only wants the good and none of the bad no matter how much I read up that it is impossible. There is a tradeoff. I can repeat that phrase a thousand times and that gremlin still won't get it. Because he is a irational and lazy fuck. And because of this I'm literally buying high with my robo investor portfolio.


Now then do I start to understand why do all those investing websites chanting dca, time in market more than timing in market, learning fundamentals, learning how to read financial records etc. Because those are tried and true ways/principles/whatever that many people has used to grow their money. And here I am thinking I could get away with dumping all that and just jumping on the bandwagon. Fucking ignorant cunt. What does the emotional gremlin in me think he is? A fucking magical crystal ball?? Go suck a dick you gremlin. 


On the bright side, I only dumped in around 30% of my savings to invest with the rest kept in my bank account. The only reason that I didn't dump everything in like the goddamn fool I could be is that those savings are locked in sort of a fixed deposit account. So I'm not actually ruining my future due to that stupid gremlin. 


What I'm actually doing is probably paying for an overdue lesson from the stock market. A lesson that some of you reading this might need. That you might think you could get away with it doing what I did. And you might be able to. Maybe this once? Twice? And maybe if you that lucky few in the world to quit and retire from the market with millions in your pockets doing that. Given enough time a group of typewriter monkeys can write Shakespeare too. But statistically are you going to be that book by Shakespeare? I'm certainly not. 


If there is anything you can take with this post is that some people can learn how to invest by learning the fundamental principles, while some people like me learn best by getting myself burn in the market before learning the principles. Granted, it's no millions but that's enough of a burn to be a wake up call for me. 


So, am I going to sell my stocks? No. I still think airlines are going to come back in the future and I'm prepared to hold them for at least a year from now. Holding on to cruise stocks for maybe a few more months and checking hows their cash flow is like because they don't get the government loans to help them like airlines do. But then again I'm basing this on reading reddit threads and clicking on the first link on Google so maybe it is the gremlin talking here. Not going to touch my robo investor except to dump in money every month. Afterwards selling those stocks I'm probably going to dump the cash into tech etfs and not touching it until I'm 50 or something. For what you should do now? I don't fucking know what I am doing so do whatever you want. Maybe you are like me and want to strangle that gremlin of yours too after having this realisation too. Anyway I'm going to sleep off this. Happy investing and have a nice fucking day.",finance

- 1 child and I’m a SAHM

    Credit-market feuds getting uglier, dirtier and more vicious
    Weak covenants open door to asset transfers, other moves



A massive wave of corporate distress is pitting beleaguered companies against their lenders in brawls that are shaping up to be nastier than ever before.

Desperate firms and their private equity owners are seeking to take advantage of years of weakening creditor protections to help cut obligations and raise cash after the coronavirus outbreak brought businesses to a standstill. Be it via allowances written into borrowing documents when times were good or simply loopholes in deal terms, they’re siphoning collateral and transferring assets while pushing deeply discounted debt swaps onto investors, who risk seeing the value of their bonds and loans plunge if they don’t go along.

Still, money managers aren’t just rolling over. Credit powerhouses like GSO Capital Partners, BlackRock Inc. and HPS Investment Partners have lined up scores of lawyers and financial advisers to defend their interests, often finding themselves at odds with one another as they fight for the biggest piece of a shrinking pie. As the gloves come off, industry veterans say tensions are as high as they’ve ever seen.

“You have more and more aggressive people holding this stuff and private equity firms have gamed every nook of credit agreements,” said Dan Zwirn, chief executive officer of Arena Investors, which manages $1.4 billion. “As people get desperate, there are going to be a lot more of these.”

The conflicts underscore how the legacy of the last crisis is being felt as the current one unfolds. The Federal Reserve’s relentless interest-rate cutting and quantitative easing spurred a surge in demand for higher-yielding assets, helping risky companies sell debt with fewer lender safeguards. Now, amid a fresh bout of economic pain, the effects of those policies are coming to bear.
Corporate Stress

Global corporate default tally spikes as pandemic takes hold

Source: S&amp;P Global Ratings

One such fight recently played out between Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. and its creditors.

The company through a subsidiary sold $1.8 billion of unsecured notes last year to fund the acquisition of Walt Disney Co.’s regional sports networks. Those securities have plunged as the pandemic left stations with no professional sporting events to televise.

Relatively loose provisions in the bond documents helped embolden Sinclair to pursue a debt exchange that asked holders to take a 40% haircut and swap into debt secured by the company’s assets.

Lenders late last month balked at the terms, and a group led by Shenkman Capital Management organized to block the exchange. The response from Sinclair was ominous: the company said it was weighing other options including a possible maneuver that would shift company collateral out of creditor reach if the exchange offer was not successful.

The potential moves were “threats” that appeared designed to pressure lenders, according to Covenant Review, which called the outstanding bond’s safeguards among the weakest it had ever seen.

“Issuers are being more aggressive in the way they are going about debt exchanges; they’re looking for additional ways to coerce bondholders that haven’t been interested in participating,” said Scott Josefsberg, an analyst at the debt research firm. “But investors are putting up a fight so far.”

Sinclair ultimately exchanged around 3.6% of eligible notes.

A representative for the broadcaster had no immediate comment, while Shenkman declined to comment beyond confirming its role leading the creditor group.

Sinclair’s exchange offer was hardly the only one to provoke the ire of investors in recent weeks.

SM Energy Co.’s efforts to get creditors to swap their bonds into new securities at 50% to 65% of face value have faced significant pushback. With only about 10% of note holders agreeing to tender last month, the oil and gas driller struck a separate agreement with a group of creditors led by BlackRock.

The side deal was designed to backstop the exchange, and the BlackRock-led group got better terms for swapping its debt versus what was offered to other creditors. The move infuriated other lenders, who organized with law firm Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges to oppose the deal.

Bondholders that accept the exchange must agree to eliminate almost all restrictive covenants on the existing debt, which would hurt anyone who doesn’t participate. The deadline for the tender has been extended to June 12.

SM Energy, BlackRock and Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges didn’t respond to requests seeking comment.
Revlon Clash

Analysts have been warning investors for years that weakening protections would ultimately have costs as investors ceded more and more ground to borrowers. Yet despite the recent surge in corporate stress, a Moody’s Investors Service gauge of bond covenant quality remained near the weakest on record in April. A similar tracker for loans reached its lowest ever in the fourth quarter, the most recent data available.

Lender safeguards played a major role in Revlon Inc.’s contentious $1.8 billion debt overhaul last month.

Creditors including Brigade Capital Management and HPS had organized to block the company’s refinancing plan because it allowed the firm to siphon off collateral and use it to back new debt. Supporters of the plan included Ares Management Corp. and Angelo Gordon &amp; Co.

The deal needed more than 50% of the holders signed on to close. At first, opposing lenders held a blocking position with a majority of the outstanding loan amount opting out. But Revlon secured a new $65 million revolving credit facility from the supportive lenders -- which the company says was permitted under its covenants -- ultimately giving it enough backing to push the deal through.

Some lenders continue to contest the transaction, arguing that Revlon needed the majority of debt holders of every tranche to agree, and maintaining that the company breached covenants when it moved certain intellectual property to secure a $200 million loan last year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Still any creditors that chose not to participate in the refinancing were demoted from having a first-priority claim on company assets to a third-lien claim.

“Revlon is strengthening its balance sheet and increasing liquidity to better deal with the issues at hand, including Covid-19,” Chief Financial Officer Victoria Dolan said in a statement to Bloomberg. “This group of objecting lenders is trying to block that. We are confident that we will overcome this effort to hurt our company.”

Representatives for Brigade, HPS, Ares and Angelo Gordon declined to comment.

Transactions involving collateral transfers have been among the most fiercely contested between creditors and private equity firms scrambling to protect their investments.

Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. last month became locked in a fight with lenders of global bookings operator Travelport, which Elliott bought last year with Siris Capital Group. The owners shifted intellectual property estimated to be worth more than $1 billion to an unrestricted subsidiary -- putting it out of reach of the creditors -- to help it raise cash.

Lenders led by GSO demanded that Travelport unwind the transaction for violating indenture agreements, and declared the step a default. The owners, who argue it was permitted, told them they would reverse the asset transfer if the creditors provided roughly $500 million of new financing and rolled up some existing debt holdings at a discount.

The dispute has gotten so heated, Bank of America Corp. last month surrendered its role as administrator of Travelport’s loan to avoid taking a side in the feud, while Kirkland &amp; Ellis recently resigned as the company’s legal representation, according to people familiar with the matter.

With the sides at loggerheads, the private equity owners supplied the financing themselves in a loan backed by the disputed collateral, a move that’s likely to further inflame the situation.

Representatives for Travelport, Elliott, Siris, GSO and Bank of America declined to comment, while Kirkland &amp; Ellis didn’t have an immediate comment.
‘Fight Like Dogs’

Industry veterans say creditors should no longer be surprised when private equity sponsors use asset transfers, spinoffs, carve outs and other such moves following a number of high profile and hotly contested maneuvers in recent years.

“Anyone professing to be shocked by it probably hasn’t been around very long,” said Philip Brendel, a senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Yet with creditors so far showing little appetite to push for stronger covenants in borrowing documents, market watchers warn to expect more brawls in the months and years ahead.

“Rates were suppressed long after they should have been; it drove yield hunger and a non-bank explosion that created misalignments,” Arena Investors’ Zwirn said. “Now they’re learning once again, there are consequences. We are at just the beginning of this thing. They’re going to fight like dogs to avoid those consequences.”",finance

Bitcoin,[Change my view] Bitcoin is not succeeding because you don't want it to (in some form). 10.000$ per coin is a problem.,"I have been somewhat critical in CCs but see their potential. I see the appeal of not having a central bank, I however also see the problem if there is no central bank (e.g. enacting monetary policy will be much much harder). 

For me the largest problem is that ""Bitcoin getting up in value"" and exploding to 10,15,20k € in value is seen as a good thing. I think that's a problem. You're basically basing the whole intrinsic value of Bitcoin on its exchange rate against fiat currencies. Sure, FX is important economically later but shouldn't the focus be on using it as actual money? I feel like a lot of hype and focus is based on the value of Bitcoin translated as ""how much US$ do I get when I give my Bitcoin away again"". If you don't (or can't) use it to trade goods, it basically is just some overhyped speculation instrument and all that bull around decentralized, etc doesn't matter, you could just as well trade some stock. It seems like the absolute majority of people try to  ultimately get more fiat money through CC trading, I still haven't seen much of a primary use as a currency so far. 

But maybe I'm no seeing something. So enlighten me - why is the by far primary focus revolving around the exchange rate rather than the use as an actual means of payment, why is it seen as a good thing when Bitcoin explodes in value measured by fiat exchange rate (that just seems to make it more difficult to use it as a means to pay for goods...?) and why is the effort not focussing on enabling and creating an economy around the currency rather than ""trying to get rich quick"" efforts?",cryptocurrency

We both just graduated college and I've been an RA so I've never had to pay rent or internet or anything like that.

Rent: $1000/month (It's actually $2,000 but we will be splitting it equally)

Utilities: $100/month (Neither of us are sure what a reasonable utilities bill is, but we will have in unit AC)

Groceries: $400/month (I've been on a college meal plan my whole adult life so this is just an estimate)

Eating out: $100/month ( I'm not going to be naive and pretend that I will never eat out, I figure $100 a month means I can eat out for 1 meal a week which is pretty reasonable.)

Alcohol: $100/month (Since I'll be in a new town I figure I will want to go out to the bars and buy a couple of bottles of wine a month)

Gas: $200/month (This is a very vague guess, I have not regularly driven a car since I graduated high school, I work about 15 miles away from my apartment.)

Student loans: $350/month ( My estimate payment is 200/month and I have just over 16 thousand in loans, however I want to try and pay my loans off as quickly as I can)

Car Insurance: $104/month (this is what I pay. I own my car so I don't have to make payments on it.)

Renters Insurance: $8/month (Small amount I know, but I figured it would be best to be thorough and include it.

Phone: $45/month (I've been paying my own phone bill since I was 16 and I have a prepaid phone service so I can't get unexpected charges.)

Retirement: $350/month (I was thinking 10% of my take-home salary would be reasonable)

Savings fund: $350/month (Once again using the 10% rule)

Shopping: $100/month (I am not so naive to think that I will suddenly kick my clothes shopping habit.

Entertainment: $75/month (This includes Netflix, Disney plus, Hulu, HBO, and internet. We have estimated $100/month for internet. then we split all of the entertainment subscriptions between the 2 of us.)

Once all is said and done using this budget I would have just about $300 left over at the end of the month.

personalfinance,Getting a mortgage on a paid off home to invest the money in index funds,"My $300k home is paid off. Since interest rates are so low (under 3%), does it make sense to get a mortgage on it again to invest the money in an index fund once I’m sure the market is on the road to recovery? 

My hunch is that the market might drop again once the true numbers come out for businesses that went under. So I would keep it as cash until I know we’re past that point. It is timing the market, which I’m not really for, but we are living in odd volatile times.

To avoid risk, I would put 2 years worth of mortgage payments in a savings account in case some bad event happens in my life.",finance

Going to break down the troubles @ hand. See what I can tackle. (everything as of today)

**-Student Loan Debt: $35,000** (Both Private &amp; Federal)  
**-Credit Card Debt: $6,700** (Consolidated with a Counseling Service..3% APR)  
**-Healthy Stock Portfolio** (**10%** contribution from paycheck)  
**-Strong 401(k)** (**10%** contribution &amp; employer match at 6%)

I have a past due balance ($4,000) hold on my Student Account at the College I attend (Senior Year, Bachelors)  and I am unable to pay that without assistance. Therefore, I took this last year off, so the Loan payments have started, $700/mo.

My idea was to sell a few shares to pay off that past due balance and be able to register for classes this Fall, to avoid paying my loan payments, and can put that money towards my CC debt. Re-enrolling in school will require me to take out $30,000 for my last year of school. (I will be looking in FAFSA/Grants/Aid.) And perhaps reduce my contribution amount to stocks and 401k.

Once graduated, I will refinance them with a student loan financing program my employer offers.

personalfinance,"Confused by a concept in ""The Latte Factor"" personal finance book","Hi everyone, I'm sure quite a few people here have read this book. I hope someone can explain one of the concepts to me. 

Toward the end of the book, the author advises to maximize the 401k contribution, because paying tax on a large amount of money (after several years of compounding interest) is better than paying the tax right away and then letting the post-tax sum accumulate interest. This is the part that I don't understand. 

Say you have a yearly income of $100, and a tax rate of 50%, and the interest rate is 10%. 

You put $100 every year into your 401k, over 20 years you will accumulate $6,300, after taking it out of the account and paying 50% taxes you're left with $3,150. 

If you pay tax before investing, you're left with $50 to invest per year. Over 20 years and at 10% interest rate this will turn into $3,150. 

What am I missing?",finance
stocks,Part of the Plan,"Is it just me or does anyone else think this is a ploy to get all of the newbie investors out of the game? Not saying I’m an expert investor or that there isn’t economic uncertainty ahead, but the institutional investors are winning in the fact that they have all of Reddit flipping their $hit. All they have talked about the past week or two on various media outlets are all the RH investors surging into the market and buying speculative stocks (penny stocks, cruises, airlines). 

To me this seems like a calculated move from the Institutional side to fear monger and make people panic sell, which clearly is working as half the sub is asking whether they should sell their entire portfolios now. I personally think the Fed meeting was good news in the sense that interest rates won’t move for a while, thus offering the bigger companies cheap debt to make moves with. The correction was overdue since we have came up so much so fast, but stop being sheep and stay the course. The Establishment wants you to sell so they can take control of the markets, buy in cheaper, and prepare for the next run.

investing,Hi I made a very free and very large guide on investing using YouTube video and book recommendations with beginner / intermediate / advanced skill level tiers that I believe will set anyone up for investing success in the long term. Check it out and please lmk what you think!,"**Investing guide**

**Preface: Why I made this** 

Let’s start this guide off with an honest truth: I spend an unhealthy amount of time on Youtube. Whether it’s watching Japanese sumo championships, video games I don’t even play, or Mike Tyson absolutely annihilating anyone unlucky enough to box him: I love it all. Thankfully, some of my time has been put to good use. Over the past several years I have learned nearly everything I know about investing, almost exclusively through the platform, and that has changed my life. I have been investing in ETFs for the past 5 years, picking individual stocks for 2, and as of today (June 10, 2020) my portfolio is up over 60% overall. Investing, to me, is the path to financial freedom. The key to spending my life the way I desire and never needing to worry about money or slaving away at a job I don’t enjoy. 

I’ve been interested in investing since high school but I only just started recently because I had no clue where to begin, and entering the investing world intimidated the hell out of me. The education system provided me next to nothing in terms of personal finance, and anyone actually talking about it seemed like some sleaze bag that wanted to sell me something.

I made this guide for anyone feeling that exact same way: I decided to slog through all the books and the hundreds of investment videos I have watched over the years to make a structured list of videos and personal notes that will give anyone, completely for free, the tools they need to begin investing and to succeed in creating wealth over the long term. 

**Disclaimer:** 

Getting through this guide will not be easy. At times it will suck, it will be boring, and it will be wildly time consuming. I have included many hours of videos and I expect you to watch each one. I want to be clear: If you cannot sit through a 45 minute video on how to learn to invest, then I would seriously reconsider investing at all. Patience is just as key in the markets as it is in learning new skills. 

I encourage you to use this guide as an education tool, but not as the definitive answer for how to invest. It is undoubtedly prone to my personal bias and my style of investing, which may or may not not fit your own. Nothing in the investment world is gospel and it is imperative to develop your own strategies, to stay humble, and to continue educating yourself.

However, I do believe this guide should provide you with everything you need to begin investing and to be successful in the long term. Most, but not all, of the links provided reflect my own personal investment style, but occasionally I will present several different ideas and allow you to decide what is best for your own portfolio. Almost all of the linked videos are by amazing Youtubers that have tons of additional content, each of them with their own strategies, opinions, and expertise. Check them out. 

If you decide you are ready to begin investing I have included my three brokerage recommendations at the bottom of the guide. Good luck!

[How to Tell If a Stock/Company Can Weather a Downturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUW1g4wLoRU) \- 

This video details how to get an in-depth look at a company's debts and obligations to determine their ability to weather an economic downturn. Covid has taught us that it is IMPERATIVE for a company to have cash on hand that can cover its short term debt obligations for a bare minimum of 1 quarter with no income. Some concepts in this video are pretty advanced, what I recommend is to —at least— know how much cash the company currently has on hand in comparison to their current debt. This can be done on yahoo finance by looking at the company's balance sheet.

If the company has significantly more debt than cash on hand then you need to figure out how much of that debt is short term (due within the next 12 months). If their cash on hand cannot cover that debt, then this company is an extremely risky investment. If this company is forced to shut down for any reason and cannot gain profitable revenue then in-order to avoid bankruptcy they will be required to take out more debt (which will be lent at extremely unfavorable rates) or to issue more shares to avoid bankruptcy. This issuance will dilute the share count and hurt current investors, also the issued shares will be sold at current market price which is likely to be a very low price for the company. 

Bankruptcy totally wipes out the investor and your stock position will go to 0 as the company sells off its assets to pay off bond investors. If the company's assets value are above what they owe to bond holders then the remaining value will be distributed to shareholders.

**How / Where to invest** 

I only invest with three platforms, so these are all that I can speak on 

**Robinhood -** 

Platform I personally prefer. The layout is simple and easy to understand. Perfect for beginners and long term trading / options trading and fractional shares also available. —— IF —— you decide to invest, please use my invitation link.[ ](http://join.robinhood.com/alexs2134)We will BOTH receive a random free stock and I would really appreciate it.

\- redacted for post rules -

**T. D. Ameritrade -** 

A more professional broker than Robinhood with high level tools, graphs, apps, analysis, etc to use. However the layout is much more complicated and difficult to understand. It is pretty essential to use a professional platform like this if you are short-term trading as their price action is much more accurate than Robinhood. 

**Wealthfront -**  

This is a robo-advisor that builds a custom portfolio depending on your long term financial outlook and overall risk tolerance. The portfolio it builds is extremely diversified and managed by high level algorithms to insure your portfolio is properly balanced and not vulnerable to excess tax loss on realized gains. First 5000 managed for no fees. I love Wealthfront and the instant, diverse portfolio that they provide which requires 0 work or attention from you personally - my portfolio with them is around 4 years old and currently up 40%. 

Using my link will give us both an additional 5000 dollars managed for no fees, and again, I would really appreciate it.

personalfinance,Where to put money for the next 5 years while saving for a house?,"Hello all, 

Question in the title. HYSA are very low right now (Ally at 1.25%/APY). I have a credit union currently with a unique savings plan (You make monthly deposits through payroll deduction, it's a ""high"" variable APY currently at 3.5%) that matures yearly (11-12 month cycles). I'm currently putting $750 monthly (9K yearly). After the account matures, are there any suggestions on where I should park my money? 

&amp;#x200B;

Goal is to have enough for a down payment for a house in southern california in roughly 4-5 years. Would it be a good idea to put it in an index fund/etf like VTI/VOO after maturity every year, or would that be too volatile?  Since the timeframe is so long, would that be acceptable, or is it better/safer to just keep it in a HYSA even with the low interest rate? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts are: 

1. Once account matures, put into VTI/VOO/other ""safe"" etf, every year until 4-5 years and withdraw

2. Do like above, but only for the first two years, rest into HYSA

3. Once account matures, put into HYSA or CD ladder for safety

gaming,The diskless models of the ps5 and the new xbox should have regional pricing,"I know this is an unpopular  opinion for the westerners but i will spit it out anyway.

60$ for an American  just isn't  the same as 60$ in second and third world countries. 

For an example , i will take the american minimum wage  and the romanian minimum wage :
-7.25 $/h is the federal minimum wage  , so in a month you will make 1160 before tax
-in romania the minimum wage without tax (brut) is 2230 ron , as of jan 2020 ,  witch is 525$ white the national convention rate , a smaller amount compared with what you will be charged at the bank

So , a brand new game for an American  is 5.17% , while for a Romanian is 11.43% , over twice as much

And it gets even worse when you look at the median income , the median in america beeing 3x what the minimum is , while in romania it is less then 2x , the gap beeing even bigger the higher of the country's wealth ladder you go

And this is a mild example , think about the countries in sub saharan Africa,  where you have a lot less money compared even where i live

Whit diskless consoles , the price should be adapted to the region , so that the game is more affordable for more people , driving up the sales 

And for people who think this will be abused , you allready need internet connection to download the game , so it isn't that hard to tell which country you are from based solely on IP Adress

And to people who will screan VPN's , the speed of download and the lag would be so bad that it wouldn't make sense 

Riot did lower prices for lower income countries , the RP beeing about 60 ron cheaper for the middle option , and about 100-150 cheaper for the most expensive option

I have tried doing the math but I don't think I am doing it right and wanted to check this out for advice.

I have 6 federal student loans with a total of \~$8750 left with varying range of interests from 3.61-6.55%. The minimum monthly payments are $141 and I am currently over paying on them by $109/month as well as putting in my full payments during this forbearance period.

My question is: If I sell some stocks I can get a total of about \~$5600 to put into one of the two loans. Which one would be more beneficial to pay down first?

Thanks for the advice!

personalfinance,I created a hybrid of snowball and avalanche that seems to have the perks of both,"I know that avalanche is mathematically optimal and that snowball is psychologically optimal, but I've been curious if there's a way to quantifiably rank debt to create a hybrid approach that both reduces total interest paid and helps you get those quick wins and increases in cashflow/reductions of monthly minimums.

Introducing Rate to Balance ratio. Feel free to come up with a more clever snow-related name for it.

Interest rate / balance \* 100,000 = Score. (The 100k is arbitrary, but makes the actual score number larger so it's easier to read/sort.

What it essentially does is give weight to both the size of the debt AND the size of the rate. If the rate is high, the number is higher. If the balance is low the number is higher. So you end up prioritizing things that are both expensive AND easier to pay off.

Here are some example data to show you the math. Things like high-interest cards with lower balances get paid first, whereas things like low-interest mortgages with high balances get paid next to last, and accounts with promotional balances of 0% get paid last. Here's some random example data, sorted by RTB. Avalanche would have you trying to pay off high balance high interest accounts first which could take a really long time to ""get a win"" and snowball would have you pay off small balance debts with 0% interest which is a waste of cashflow.

gaming,Microsoft and Sony’s Approach’s for the Next Gen,"Microsoft doesn’t really need the Xbox, if tomorrow they shut down the Xbox and cancelled all production for it they’d be fine. Sony needs the PlayStation, is their main money maker. Xbox is being really lenient with this next gen, you can play with people on the Series X if you have a One, you can play Series X games on the One. They know that people in the last couple years started buying Xbox One’s like crazy because of games like Fortnite and the One’s affordable price tag, they don’t want consumers to feel like they’re buying an outdated product. If the Series X’s sales are low they’ll be just fine, where as if the PS5 sales are low Sony might have some problems. There’s a reason why the Series X doesn’t have as much unique tech crammed into it like how the PS5 does. Sony needs you to make sure that consumers don’t think “Oh I already have a PS4, I don’t really need a PS5” this is why they’re cramming so much stuff into the next console. They’re trying to make sure consumers don’t take the PS5 as just a beefed up PS4, but rather they see it as a new product. “Hey can your PS4 simulate walking on a dirt road? Didn’t think so.” That’s what they’re relying on. And they don’t actually make that much from console sales, the real money is from the games. That’s why they’re really trying to show how many cool exclusives they have, whereas Xbox only really has Halo Infinite, which they’ve said barely anything about.

TL;DR Sony needs the PS, it’s their main way of making money. Microsoft doesn’t need the Xbox, they’re fine without it financially. Sony is cramming as much unique tech as possible into the PS5 so you’ll buy it and not think “I already have a PS4, I don’t need a PS5” where as Microsoft is being much more lenient because they don’t need you to buy the Series X, and they know recently the One has jumped up in popularity and they don’t want consumers to think they’re buying an outdated product.

I’m attending a four year (US) college in the fall. 
My cost of attendance will be completely paid off by scholarships, the pell grant, and about $4000 a year in federally subsidized loans. I can take out a little bit more than is necessary for the cost of attendance, about $200 a year.

Right now, I have about $1200 saved in the bank, and I expect to have $2500 saved by the time I head to college. Subtracting estimated expenses for my first year, (backpack, laptop, etc) that leaves me with about $1500.

Since my interest payments will be paid off by taxpayers until I graduate, ~~I see no reason not to take out the maximum subsidized loan possible and invest whatever money is left over after.~~ Edit: I’ve been informed this is terribly illegal, and now I see the reason not to do this. 

The way I see it, I’d either invest my money so I can use it after four years, or invest it long-term. 

Should I put money into a high-yield savings account? Stocks? A 401k or Roth IRA (for retirement)? Should I keep money on hand in a checking account, despite the fact that my entire cost of attendance will be paid off via these loans?

personalfinance,I was in a car accident where the other driver was at fault. I need advice on what to do with my settlement money.,"I was in a car accident about a year ago and I have finally received a settlement amount from my lawyer. I need to decide the best use for the money and would like some advice. 

It’s not an insane amount of money, but it could make a difference in my life in the following ways. 

- pay off my car with a few thousand to spare. This would eliminate a approx. $300 per month bill that I can put towards saving or other bills. 

- pay off about 1/2 of my student loans (which I honestly never imagined being able to pay off due to the fact that I am a teacher and don’t really make much). No monthly bill woild be eliminated this way, but I would be a lot closer to having that debt off my shoulders which would be incredible. 

- use as a house down payment. I have been wanting to purchase my own home for a long time but saving up has been slow due to astronomical rents in my area. This money could easily give me a house down payment for something small and reasonable which would save me a lot of rent money in the long run. In this case, I probably wouldn’t purchase anything right away due to the uncertainty of my job in the fall (education is a little uncertain right now, especially in my field). 

These options all seem good? But it’s hard to know which one will benefit me the most in the long run. I’m leaning towards pausing off my car but with the way cars depreciate, I don’t know if that is really the best use for the money. 

Any perspective would be helpful. Thanks!

Edit: I don’t want to give exact numbers but here are some approximations:

Settlement is not massive, but definitely enough to make a huge impact on a teacher’s salary. Approx. $20,000

Say if I am paying an extra $200 to the principal a month on a 4.5% 30 year mortgage, would it produce the same outcome as if I were to refinance at say a 3.1% 30 year? That extra per month to the principal is producing a lower of amount of interest paid out during the lifetime of the loan, so is it worth paying the bank another X grand to lower the interest rate?",finance

vet,Cat with possible scratch to the eye,"Picture: https://imgur.com/a/BpTy77y

Hello, 

So this morning my parents woke up to find my cat with an injured eye. Unfortunately my parents don’t allow our cat inside the house because of the hair(he sheds A LOT). So our guess is that overnight some cat  from my area may have hurt my cat, Simba. He’s a very tame and sweet cat and not violent at all so he is not able to defend himself so this is more than likely what happened. My family doesn’t have enough money to go a vet so my mom rinsed the area around the eye with arnica tea and put Neosporin on it as well. After that he hid but soon came out and didn’t seem to be in pain. He was eating and drinking water normally but is still weary of his surroundings. Just now I fed him again and he seemed fine when all of a sudden he shut his eyes again and flinched backwards as if he were feeling pain. He hid under a car and is resting. 

Did my mom do the right thing when treating him? Is there anything more we can do to help him?

Thank you",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"HYSA interest currently low, transfer a portion into bond index funds?","HYSA interest rates have dropped pretty low as of mid-year 2020.  My Ally savings account (which I love!) has dropped to 1.09%.

Given that, would it make sense to move some of those HYSA funds into bond index fund?  I've got about $5k in a HYSA, much more in i-bonds for my emergency fund which is pretty much done.

Recently unemployed with all of this Coronavirus mess. I got laid off pretty much right right at the beginning of it (in March). This is the luckiest part because, living in Florida, I am one of the few people to get unemployment benefits paid because the system wasn't quite overwhelmed yet.   


I have been using a Healthcare Silver Plan with the help of advance tax credit as my Full Time job paid not great... and paying ZERO dollars per month. I was expecting to keep at that situation, but I messed up.   


I moved to save more money.   


Now, in order to just update the insurance of my address, I have to REAPPLY for health insurance. Since the coverage is through [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov), I can't just call Oscar and tell them my new address. So now, in the reapplication process, they ask me my income. Which right now is only unemployment. Unemployment works out to around 9500 including the federal 600 so that's what I put in.   


So now I don't quality for tax credits because I don't make enough money... And the cheapest rate is around 350 per month, for catastrophic coverage.   


I feel like I have three options, but wanted some help knowing the system a little more.   


I'm 27 and healthy. Havn't been to the Doctor in years. 

I can just wait and see if I can maintain the zero monthly payment if I don't tell anyone about it. This is unsafe and I don't like leaving things in the air like this. Plus I've already put in new info into healthcare site.   


I can pay the ridiculous 350/month BARELY.

CryptoCurrency,The Truth about Bitcoin?,"**Part 1/4 - NSA Connection:**

First off, the SHA-256 algorithm, which stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256, is a member of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA and first published in 2001.

SHA-256, like other hash functions, takes any input and produces an output (often called a hash) of fixed length. The output of a hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 will always be the same length - regardless of the input size. Specifically, the output is, as the name suggests, 256 bits. 

Moreover, all outputs appear completely random and offer no information about the input that created it. 

The Bitcoin Network utilises the SHA-256 algorithm for mining and the creation of new addresses.

Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? What does Satoshi Nakamoto mean?

Out of respect for their anonymity, it would be rude to speculate in a video about who Satoshi Nakamoto is likely to be. The reality is, it's not important. Let me explain: *Any* human being can be attacked. Jesus could come back from the dead, and there would be haters. Therefore, the Satoshi Nakamoto approach neutralises the natural human herd behaviour, exacerbated by the media, to attack and discredit. This is a very important part of Bitcoin's success thus far. Also, from a security perspective, those who wish to dox Satoshi Nakamoto in a video are essentially putting his, or her, or their, life at risk...for the sake of views. 

***As a genius who has produced an innovation not just from a technical perspective but also a monetary perspective, they should be treated with more respect than that.*** 

As for the name Satoshi Nakamoto, I *would speculate* that it is a homage to Tatsuaki Okamoto and Satoshi Obana - two cryptographers from Japan. There is another reason for the name, but that...is confidential.

In 1996, the NSA's Cryptology Division of their Office of Information Security Research and Technology published a paper titled: [""How to make a mint: The cryptography of anonymous electronic cash""](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm), first publishing it in an MIT mailing list and later, in 1997, in the American University Law Review. One of the researchers they referenced was Tatsuaki Okamoto. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2/4 - 'Crypto Market':**

Most of the crypto market is a scam.

By the way, this was predicted very early on in the Bitcoin Talk forums - [check out this interaction from November 8th, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1647.msg20646#msg20646):

***""if bitcoin really takes off I can see lots of get-rich-quick imitators coming on the scene: gitcoin, nitcoin, witcoin, titcoin, shitcoin...***

***Of course the cheap imitators will disappear as quickly as those 1990s ""internet currencies"", but lots of people will get burned along the way.""***

***To which Bitcoin OG Gavin Andresen replies:***

***""I agree - we're in the Wild West days of open-source currency. I expect people will get burned by scams, imitators, ponzi schemes and price bubbles.""***

***""I don't think there's a whole lot that can be done about scammers, imitators and ponzi schemes besides warning people to be careful with their money (whether dollars, euros or bitcoins).""***

Now, on the one hand, lack of regulation is more meritocratic (as you don't have to be an accredited investor just to get access). 

On the other hand, it means that crypto is, as Gavin said, a Wild West environment, with many cowboys in the Desert. Be careful. 

This is the same with most online courses - particularly 'How to get rich quick' courses - however with crypto you have an exponential increase in the supply of victims during the bull cycles so it is particularly prevalent during those times. 

In addition to this, leverage trading exchanges, which are no different to casinos, prey on naive retail traders who:

A) Think they can outsmart professional traders with actual risk management skills; and 

B) Think they can outsmart the *exchanges themselves* who have an informational advantage as well as an incentive to chase stop losses and liquidate positions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3/4 - CBDCs:**

The Fed and Central Banks around the world have printed themselves into a corner. 

Quantitative easing was the band-aid for the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, and more recent events have propelled the rate of money printing to absurd levels.

This means that all currencies are in a race to zero - and it becomes a game of who can print more fiat faster.

The powers that be know that this fiat frenzy is unsustainable, and that more and more people are becoming aware that it is a debt based system, based on nothing. 

The monetary system devised by bankers, for bankers, in 1913 on Jekyll Island and supercharged in 1971 is fairly archaic and also does not allow for meritocratic value transfer - [fiat printing itself increases inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs).

They, obviously, know this (as it is by design).

The issue (for them) is that more and more people are starting to become aware of this. 

***Moving to a modernised monetary system will allow those who have rigged the rules of the game for the last Century to get away scot-free.***

It will also pave the way for a new wealthy, and more tech literate, elite to emerge - [again predicted in the Bitcoin Talk forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12156).

Now...back to the powers that be.

Bitcoin provides a natural transition to [Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY) and what I would describe as Finance 2.0, but what are the benefits of CBDCs for the state? 

More control, easier tax collection, more flexibility in monetary policy (i.e. negative interest rates) and generally a more efficient monetary system.

This leads us to the kicker: which is the war on cash. The cashless society was a fantasy just a few years ago, however [now it doesn't seem so far fetched](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/16/cash-could-be-the-latest-victim-of-coronavirus-and-may-never-recover). No comment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4/4 - Bitcoin:**

What about Bitcoin?

Well, Bitcoin has incredibly strong network effects; it is the [most powerful computer network in the World](https://qz.com/84056/the-bitcoin-network-is-now-more-powerful-than-the-top-500-supercomputers-combined/).

But what about Bitcoin's reputation? 

Bankers hate it. 

Warren Buffett hates it.

Precisely, and the public hates bankers. 

Sure, the investing public respects Buffett, but the general public perception of anyone worth $73 billion is not exactly at all time highs right now amid record wealth inequality.

In the grand scheme of things, the market cap of Bitcoin is currently around $179 billion.

For example, the market cap of Gold is around $9 trillion, which is 50x the Market Cap of Bitcoin.

Money has certain characteristics.

In my opinion, what makes Bitcoin unique is the fact that it has a finite *total* supply (21 million) and a predictable supply *schedule* via the halving events every 4 years, which cut in half the rate at which new Bitcoin is released into circulation. 

Clearly, with these properties, it seems likely that Bitcoin could act as a [meaningful hedge against inflation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s).

One of the key strengths of Bitcoin is the fact that the Network is decentralised...

Many people don't know that [PayPal originally wanted to create a global currency similar to crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOeOzhOxeMU). 

Overall, a speculative thesis would be the following: 

Satoshi Nakamoto is one of the most important entities of the 21st Century, and will accelerate the next transition of the human race.

Trusted third parties are security holes.

Bitcoin is the catalyst for Finance 2.0, whereby value transfer is conducted in a more meritocratic and decentralised fashion.

In 1964, Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev designed the Kardashev Scale.

At the time, he was looking for signs of extraterrestrial life within cosmic signals.

The Scale has three categories, which are based on the amount of usable energy a civilisation has at its disposal, and the degree of space colonisation. 

Generally, a Type 1 Civilisation has achieved mastery of its home planet (10\^16W);

A Type 2 Civilisation has mastery over its solar system (10\^26W);

and a Type 3 Civilisation has mastery over its Galaxy (10\^36W).

We humans are a Type 0 Civilisation on this Scale.

Nonetheless, our exponential technological growth in the few decades indicates that we are somewhere between Type 0 and Type 1.

In fact, according to Carl Sagan's interpolated Kardashev Scale and recent global energy consumption, we are about 0.73.

Physicist Freeman Dyson estimated that within 200 years or so, we should attain Type 1 status.

***As a technology that, through its decentralisation, links entities globally and makes value transfer between humans more efficient, Bitcoin could prove a key piece of our progression as a civilisation.***

I have heard before that the higher interest rate loan should be paid off first, but the vast difference between amounts and the timeline means that it is possible that the mortgage will accrue more interest over time, no?

I currently pay more than double of each minimum payment, so they will both be paid off early, if that helps.

personalfinance,Should I always refinance as the interest rates go down?,"I just got an email from our lender saying that interest rates are down below 3.5%

We currently have a loan for $616k at 4%. (Southern California). This is from a refinance about six months ago, down from 5%.

And we did that bout 6 months after buying the house. 

For the refinance, The appraisal came in at $730k, which also lowered our PMI drastically, and all in all we saved about $400 a month. So it was great!

But now it's going down again...

And it seems smart to refinance again. Even a savings of $200 a month would be fantastic. 

The value of the house will probably stay the same or go up since we've done even more remodeling. So we might be able to eliminate the PMI all together. 

However, with the remodels this means we probably don't have the cash to pay the closing costs and will have to roll them into the loan (I don't want to dip into our emergency funding)

I'm giving a lot of details here to basically ask, is it smart to refinance again, even though I have to add a little to loan? Is .5% worth it? I mean, $200 a month over 30 years is like $60k...seems smart? I could just put that $200 towards the principle too...

There's 29 years left on the loan too.",finance
personalfinance,So I'm stuck figuring out if refinancing my house is a good idea...,"Okay, so I'm 3 years(on the dot) into my current mortgage. We started out at 97% LTV with a 3.75% interest rate.

I currently work for a bank that provides access to better interest rates and closing cost discounts. I've begun the refinance process with my company and gotten a rate of 2.875% locked in just to be safe and be sure rates didn't increase on me. With this new rate, I'm forecasted to save a minimum of ~$300/month on my mortgage bill. My new LTV would also be at 85% (so part of my savings come from the reduced PMI). 

The caveats here are the following:

- My loan amount would increase from ~311k to ~320k because we'd be rolling all fees and closing costs into the loan because we didn't save cash for this purpose. 

- My current LTV if I don't do refinance is already at about 88%, so it's not far off from the new 85% I'd be at by refinancing 

- My loan servicer offers a revaluation of my home to potentially drop the PMI all together if the appraisal comes back and puts me at 80% LTV - this would cost somewhere between $250-495 (depending on the process I use which is either a realtor brokerage estimate or an actual appraisal, respectively)... But, I have less to lose overall than by refinancing and increasing my loan amount.

- The above mentioned revaluation by my servicer could potentially save me $170 on its own.

***

Other important information to consider:

- My wife and I are currently aggressively paying down debt, at a rate of a minimum of $1200 extra a month

- We've been able to pay down about $15k worth of debt in a years time and the $300+ a month was attractive because it would allow us to allocate even more for debt reduction. This would of course be short lived and would end up being additional play money once we're credit debt free.

- We don't PLAN on moving out of this house for another 5 years or so

I'd love some input to see if this move is worth it in the end!",finance
personalfinance,Upside Down on Vehicle,"We have a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee that we have had for about two years now and I have been trying to figure out how to either get rid of it or somehow make it more financially fitting for us. Currently we are upside down a little over $10,000 on the Jeep and I am wanting to get out from underneath of it. Our monthly payments are too high and the interest is also way too high. The current credit union I have the loan through will NOT refinance due to the fact I owe more than the car is worth and I do not have $10,000 sitting around to put down to refinance. On the brighter side if I can find someone to refinance our credit score is way higher now than when we originally purchased the vehicle so I know that we would get a better interest rate, but I didn’t know if a smarter move would be to trade down into a vehicle or if that was even possible. I talked to one dealership a few months back and wanted to trade down into an 2010 Honda Accord and she flat out told me that it was not even an option. I didn’t know if you guys have had something similar happen to you or know of anybody that’s been in this situation before and what moves it takes to get into a better situation financially with this vehicle.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice in boosting my credit score by 10 points in a month,"Hello all.

My wife and I are about to purchase our forever home and we've managed to secure a pretty decent rate that is contingent on us both having a credit score of 740. My wife meets that limit and I'm averaging around ~730 according to the official score of the 3 bureaus.

Now, I know paying down credit utilization gives you a pretty big jump, but I've already paid it down to sub 1%. I do have an existing mortgage that's divided into two loans: one is ~300k and the other is ~38k at a slightly higher interest rate.

I do have around 10-15k cash that I could use to pay down some of the home loans. My question is would this affect my credit score as much? It seems like these loans have a lesser effect than revolving credit and if it's hopeless, it may be better to keep the 10k as part of my down payment.

Does anyone have any other possible strategies?

software,Software to combine video and audio tracks,"I have a music collection that is still growing, but there is an issue: lately when I have been getting new music, my video downloader has been having problems, so I have to view the hit location, where I am presented with a video link and an audio link.

Lately, I have been wanting to combine them with simple software, nothing too high end unless that is required. The problem is, it is in weird formats.

# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.
*****
&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. 
*****
&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500′s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. 
*****
&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed’s bond buying and other policy moves.
*****
&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday’s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.
*****
&gt; “We’ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies’ stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it’s a contrarian warning.
*****
&gt; “Historically that’s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,” he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.
*****
&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy’s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.
*****
&gt; “Once the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,” said Stovall.  
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. “There were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.
*****
&gt; “Trump’s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,” said Stovall. “It’s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.”

&gt; # Consumer barometer
&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.
*****
&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday’s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.
*****
&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April’s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.
*****
&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.
*****
&gt; “Clothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,” notes Zandi. “Online retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead 
&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.
*****
&gt; “I think the cat’s out of the bag. I don’t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he’s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can’t do it on his own,” said Zandi. “He has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He’s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed’s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; “I think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,”  said Zandi. “He’s strongly suggesting there’s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He’s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.
*****
&gt; “I think he’s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they’re doing going forward. He’ll try to preserve some optionality, but he’ll try to make it known, they’re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,” Zandi said.
*****
&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. “I’d be surprised if there’s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,” Briggs said.

# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?

&gt; “Stocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.” — Old investment axiom

&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We’ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.

&gt; “In many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we’ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we’ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn’t always a bad thing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn’t always a bad thing for the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.

# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment

&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today’s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.

&gt; This is still the “Worst Six Months” and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the “Best Six Months” (November-April) as they were in 2020, the “Worst Six Months” (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.

&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year’s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.

&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.

&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell’s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday’s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.

&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the “Pulse of the Market” hit 0.43 last week – its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor’s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.

&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**

&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:

&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.

# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond

&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.

&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.

investing,Potential Long Hold,"So generally, there is an understandable stigma against Devil's Lettuce stocks. The majority of the companies (ACB, CGC, etc) do not turn profits, and are hardly setup for tough times in the industry. I have been looking into a company called Aphria. Overall their balance sheet looks solid, with a decent amount of cash set to the side ($500 mil). They are also one of the few companies in the industry that I have seen that have been able to consistently turn a profit. Out of the past four quarters, three of them were profitable, which helps provide a solid growth backing for the company. I am wondering what your guys' thoughts on the company is? I see it as a good long term buy, especially when they start selling product in America. They are primarily in the European and Canadian market and are supposedly waiting for federal legalization to expand to the US. This could be a strong long play, especially in that market corner.",finance
personalfinance,"New job, no federal tax being taken out of my checks?","I hadn't even noticed til another new person asked one of the more experienced workers why. What do I need to do? I literally cannot afford to owe taxes next year, I barely scrape by as is. Is this a covid thing, a company screw up, did I do paperwork wrong? Any thoughts?",finance
Bitcoin,Winner? 🤔,"USD:

* What backs the US dollar? **Nothing, only the faith that it has value**
* How many dollars in circulation? **Nobody knows**
* Can more dollars be printed? **Yes, the FED can print unlimited dollars when needed** 
* Who controls the dollars? **The FED**
* Does the dollar lose buying power? **Yes, USD inflates 1.38% every year. It inflates more when the FED prints more dollars. #BRRRRRR**

BTC:

* What backs BTC? **Code and Math**
* How many BTC in circulation? **As of now, 18,403,762 but there will only be 21 million created**
* Can more BTC be created? **After 21 million have been mined, no more BTC can be created**
* Who controls BTC? **No entity owns BTC**
* Does BTC lose buying power? **No, BTC is a deflationary asset, so it will deflate causing it to be worth more in value**

developer,Associates of Science (AS) + Boot camp or Bachelors of Science (BS) in CS,"Hi everyone, I've reached sort of an impasse in my life and Id like your opinions on what I should do next if possible.  


So it would only take me one semester to get my AS in computer science. I feel like that wouldn't do much in terms of securing a job for myself so I'd also would look into doing a boot camp in hopes of making my odds better.   


My other option is going to another school to pursue a BS in CS. I have already applied to a school and have a solid chance of getting in but I'm not sure if its the best option for me right now. As it stands currently Ive reached my cap on federal school loans and I would need to get private loans for the rest of the time I would be in school, which is at minimum 3 semesters and a winter/summer course or 2. Total that would be around 30-35k while I already have another 34k already borrowed.  


so my question is, in your opinion, what should I do? Should I get the hell out of dodge, take my AS, pay for a boot camp and try to get a job or do I spend another year and a half and add another 30k to my debt trying to get my BS?",technology
investing,Defensive Bull Case and Stock Picks,"Shorting involves timing, because the market only goes up in the long run. The winning strategy is to be a defensive bull. Trust me when I say, I know all the bear thesis and have some of my own (CLO collapse, deflation, etc). What's the point though if I can't time for shit and the Fed probably only brought down the market to pressure Mitch and Trump to pass another stimulus?

Therefore, here's what I bought and why:

BRK.B

Berkshire is trading at book value, which is based on stock prices as of 3/30. This makes no sense when the biggest holdings are Apple, Amazon, and cash. Plus most of their operating companies are monopoly like, which gives them earning power even in a depression.

BB

Blackberry is now a software only company, but it's valued like a manufacturer. It's automotive software business will shrink this year, but it also is one of the largest names in cybersecurity.  It acquired Cylance two years ago and that part of the business is exploding right now. Cylance, if valued like it's competitor CRWD, would be worth 3x what Blackberry as a whole is worth.

CCH/WS

This is a warrant for the SPAC for UTZ (the salty snack brand). It's good for four years with a strike of $11.50 on CCH. The stock is valuing the company at about $1.4B, which is below enterprise value.. for what's basically another Frito Lay with higher revenue growth and less debt. Also the investor presentation seems really conservative. The CEO says sales increased substantially more than expected last quarter due to lockdowns. 

BHC

Yes this is actually Valeant and they have a lot of debt. However, they rolled their debt and have zero payments until 2029. They are cash flow positive and will remain so for this year (one of the few companies to issue guidance). Their largest segment is OTC products from Bausch and Lomb.

LAKE

Best for last. This company makes PPE. They doubled their revenue last quarter and income exploded, analyst expectations were crushed. Yet the stock is only up about 22% due to this crash. Options are not cheap, but the stock is trading at 50% off its 52 week high from before earnings.

This is not investment advice.",finance
personalfinance,Auto Lease Buyout: Finance or Purchase Outright?,"I've decided I want to purchase my car at the end of the lease term in August. I can afford to purchase it outright without denting my 6 month emergency fund, but want to make the best decision for my overall financial situation and would really love your advice!

&amp;#x200B;

About my situation: mid-20s, work in healthcare currently making 55-60k/year, excellent credit score but very few lines of credit. Car in question well-cared-for single-owner (me) 2016 Mazda 3 w/ 10k miles; will be keeping for myself short-term, likely giving to family in mid- to long-term. Purchase balance at end of lease \~10,900 (not sure how negotiable this is, if at all). Would likely be looking at an interest rate of 3.69% - 3.89% for a 48 mo. lease buyout loan in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really looking to be talked out of the purchase (I know this sub probably frowns on the choice lol); rather, I'm looking for the smartest way to go about buying it. The 11k I would use to pay off the car is presently sitting, earning me a very sad 0.01%. I was considering parking this money in a HYSA, money market, bond ETF, etc. (open to suggestions here), taking the loan in August, and making the payments from this pot of money. My thinking is that the loan will help to build my credit history for the long run, and any return I get on the parked money will partially hedge against the interest I'll be paying to do it. Is this worth the hassle/risk, or should I just purchase the vehicle outright and look elsewhere for ways to build credit history? Thanks for your input!",finance
personalfinance,Should I finance a new car if I can get 0% or low APR and don't own a car?,"Okay, I know everyone says don't finance a car. However, my fiance (getting married in 2 weeks) and I only share his old car (10 years old, the trunk has a leak and often smells like mildew, and he used to smoke in it, and it has quite a few dents in it from people hitting him near a college campus... He hasn't been maintaining it well because of the condition it's in either). I used to usually take public transit, but we're moving to a car-dependant area. We want an SUV for the space and camping. 


We closing on our first house, and because of the hot market, we needed to guarantee we'd finance below a certain amount if it doesn't appraise. Because of that, downpayment, and closing costs, plus our elopement/mini-moon, we're cleaned out aside from our emergency fund. Our housing payments, with taxes, will be around 13% of our combined income (~170k). My student loan payments are around $100/month. Other than that, we don't have any other debt. He was maxing out his retirement before this, and I've been contributing 15%, plus saving around 1k a month at least each. (We didn't have much in savings because he got a 30k raise in the fall, and it was my first year in my career after graduating). 


In our case, because interest rates are generally low, and my credit score is around 790, do you think it would be reasonable for us to buy an SUV worth around 25-30k new? We're thinking of waiting until the end of the year, so we can save for a few months and put down 5k. We'll plan to keep it for 10 years. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,What should i do with my savings account?,"I Currently have $30k in my savings. I'm looking for some insight on how to best utilize the money. I work in the oil field which is always volatile. However the rest of the year seems to be ok with my current company. I should have work until at least the end of the year making on average 10k a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a truck that i owe 30k and a car that I owe 15k. with Interest rates of 4% and 3.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My main question is should I use this money to pay off one of these loans or could i do something else with it to better stabilize my future. Thanks for any help.",finance
solar,Lobbying group petitions FERC to change economics of net metering,"A lobbying group with a history of siding with utilities and other fossil groups, NERA, has petitioned FERC, the Federal Energy Regultory Committee, to make a ruling to change the economics of net metering across the country. This will effectively lower net metering payments by 1/2 and make solar less viable for many. 

Arguments for this change are that solar owners don’t pay for their part of upkeep to the grid, but I thought this wasn’t the case and solar owners did pay for these shared expenses. Maybe it’s different around the country? Another argument is that only wealthy folks can afford solar and that everyone else has to supplement their costs. Not sure I have a counter argument there, though there are many lower-income solar programs across the country that provide installation support and funding for lower once households, non profits, community serving groups, etc.

https://www.natlawreview.com/article/nera-petition-ferc-s-dilemma-and-economic-future-rooftop-solar


This desert sun article details how a California district moved away from net metering in 2016 and now uses net billing, and has seen significant reduction in solar installations since then. So I can imagine that it’s adoption everywhere would hamstring the solar industry and slow installations everywhere. Do you think the US would be better or worse off with less rooftop solar?

personalfinance,My mortgage broker is making me nauseous,"I'm in the Phoenix AZ area. I have a 601 credit mortgage score (according to them) and want to use a 1st time VA refinance with cash out. I have almost 350k of equity. I've been approved with conditions (eg  had to give them more docs, which I did), they are moving towards the close now. The current commercial loan I currently have is at 3.85 percent. That said... 


I've grown to distrust my broker. 

1) He has told me that if I don't close soon it may be a problem because the buyers may not be there in 1-2 weeks (I called another broker and he said the lenders are actually loosening up). 

2)Even though I originally told them I only wanted 50k, he made the loan out to be were I would get back 120. I've asked about it, he has pushed back hard.

3) He's pushing very hard for me to buy points. When I told him that I didn't want to buy points, he said that the originally disclosed interest rate (4.75 percent,which is high but my credit sucks) wasn't even showing on his 'sheet`, which I assume means it isn't available anymore? He keeps trying to get me to buy enough discount points to get me to 3.75.

4) I asked a direct question about if a discount point equalled 1/4 of  a percentage point and if I bought four would that bring down the interest rate 1 full percent (4.75 to 3.75) and he said, ""No. There is no rule as points are tied to GNMA bond pricing for VA and the costs vary daily and sometimes during the same day. "" - What does that even mean? Does that mean the cost of the point is no longer 1% of the loan or is it that a point could equal more or less then 1/4 of a percentage. EDIT: I should add that my plan is to refi again when my credit rating is higher, about a year. 

5) Finally, when we started my credit was at 580. They helped me get it to 601, which is great. The problem is that I want to know what I have to do (I have 9 collections and all 9 collections will do a pay for delete) to get to at least 620. Basically, should I wait a couple of months or a year, etc. They even use Creditxpert and used it by testing a simulation I had to ask them about to get to the 601 (they didn't just do it on there own and were hesitant to do it to begin with). I've worked with a broker in the past (in another state) and they were able to give me that info. 

It's like I am asking for things and I just keep getting ignored. I shouldn't feel like this, right? Or am I just being overly sensitive? 

I'm a pretty black and white person when it comes to financial decisions, make decisions based on facts and then push the button. The hair stands up on the back of my neck with this and I don't know why. 

.... This refi is a big deal, I'm worried that something is fundamentally wrong here and I don't want to spend anymore then I have to. I'm not in a hurry and this the only real investment savings we have.....

personalfinance,Need advice regarding my car purchase,"Hello everyone, I recently saw a thread that reminded me about my current situation and would like some advice. I just purchased a 12k with 100k miles, I put 2k down and had to get a loan and the interest on that is 21%. I know it sounds terrible, but I really needed a car and didn’t have previous credit history so I just went with it. My current plan is to switch to a car with less miles and a better interest rate in about a year, since by then I will have more credit history. 

If you guys have any advice I could use, I would greatly appreciate it!

EDIT: Btw the APR is higher since the only way I was financed the car was in 36 months instead of 60. 

I’m able to pay the car just fine, but will like to see what options I have from here.",finance

This post was removed from “another subreddit” without explanation. Can’t get an answer on why, but I DID NOT delete that post and I WILL NOT delete this one. I’ve cleaned up the language and humorous insults so it’s geared toward a broader audience and will treat you all like adults. 

I'm here to crack open the matrix and give you a framework to draw conclusions and ideas from. Much of this is known information, but I’m putting it into a context that connects the dots. 

Also, now that you're in here I'm going to convince you that it's going to be a long burn down from here. Circuit breakers? Very likely. New lows? Absolutely. Do I have your attention? Proceed.

**I know what you're thinking....**

*""Nobody could have seen this coming!*

*""Buy the dip!""*

*""institutions are selling!""*

*""Rug pull""*

*""JPow will save us!""*

Retail is all caught with their pants down and are going to be holding Wall Street’s and the corporation’s bags. We’re the only ones left with any faith in the market going up. This is a game of musical chairs and the smart money just took the chairs and left the room.

I've never posted here. I comment, I learn, I steal ideas, and I've been building my thesis while Robinhooders buy Hertz. Maybe we can discuss that later, there's no time to waste.

**Few things...Keep this all in mind while we go along and if you don't know what I'm talking about just google. It's all out there.**

1. We're in a bubble. We have been for a long time. Valuations are stupid, PE ratios off the charts, Nikola is big enough to enter the S&amp;P - IF IT HAD ANY EARNINGS!
2. Debt and leverage globally absolutely DWARF the 2008 problems surrounding CDO's. You think there was a little corruption and clever lending in America's banking system? Imagine what goes on in the rest of the world
3. Pretend Covid-19 doesn't exist. The ""crash"" in Feb/March was coming no matter what. Governments, corporations, banks all knew it was inevitable and that there is chaos in the financial system. Let's just operate under that assumption.
4. Think of right now as being the 2008 housing crisis, but instead of houses in America it's COMPANIES IN THE WORLD (hint: its a lot bigger problem)
5. First Crash was a liquidity crisis. Nobody had enough cash on their balance sheet to hand over to the people they owed. Think of it like when you don't pay rent. Your landlord might be financially able to take the hit, but he really doesn't want to sell his Tesla stock to pay HIS landlord and so on and so on until the entire financial system seizes up. (psst that's why it's called ""liquidity"")
6. The fed and central banks came to the rescue the only ways they are legally allowed to. Now that's taken care of and everyone is rife with liquidity to keep the system turning. Today, we are entering a SOLVENCY CRISIS.

**Part 1 - What the Fed is REALLY doing**

Now... let me enlighten you for a second... THE FED DOESN'T ‘BUY STOCKS’. Well, at least not directly. If you remember one thing about the fed, remember - they are bound by RULES. They MUST keep a balance sheet like any other bank. And the money they ""print"" cannot enter the market the same way your paycheck buys condoms for your wife's boyfriend. It's there to sit on the other side of the balance sheet of BANKS or the TREASURY who can then lend ""real"" money into the economy. There's no money that gets ""out"" - It's all ""loaned"" unless it comes from ""stimulus"" which still goes through Congress and the Treasury. More on that later.

**THE POINT IS THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE MIDDLE MAN. THIS IS MASSIVELY IMPORTANT LATER!!!**

Here is the breakdown of the steps the fed MUST take when conducting those ""Open Market Operations"" we've all heard about.

**1. When the Fed buys government securities through securities dealers in the bond market, it deposits the payment into the bank accounts of the banks, businesses, and individuals who sold the securities.**

**2. Those deposits become part of the funds commercial banks hold at the Federal Reserve and thus part of the funds commercial banks have available to lend.**

**3. Because banks want to lend money, to attract borrowers they decrease interest rates, including the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans (the federal funds rate).**

See? The fed only provides ""money"" to institutions they are legally allowed to give money to (Treasury and banks). For simplicity's sake just think of JPow going into his computer and typing in a few zeroes on JP Morgan’s Computer. Doesn't matter. The fed's hands are tied and they can only control rates and print money. Oh by the way... The Fed lowered banks' fractional reserve requirement to ZERO in March. **That means banks don't have to have ANY money in the vault.** Make of this what you will.

**Part 2 - Why Stimulus is Different than printed liquidity**

So now we hopefully understand where the new printing is going and how it gets there. It's going to anyone who needs a little bump to their cash pile in order to fulfill their existing debt obligations **ONLY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM WORKING.** No more, no less. Fed prints $ and banks give loans. Fed prints $ and Treasury writes checks. **NOBODY** ***WANTS*** **TO DO THIS**

Read this whole article if you want, but I'll pull out what matters.

[The Great Leverage Unwind](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/perspectives/global-cio-outlook/the-great-leverage-unwind) \- **March 22 Before the Stimulus!!**

*""In order to get a foundation under the markets, we’re going to need something very large, something in the $2 trillion range in the form of a pool of liquidity that can be made quickly available to businesses and corporations that need it, along with the financing facilities of $2 trillion–$4 trillion from the Fed.""*

**""Liquidity that can be made quickly available"" = YOUR STIMULUS BABY**

**When it comes to getting fed money to individual companies WE are that middle man I mentioned earlier. It takes the responsibility off of the Fed, so they can claim “free market”.**

**Part 3 - Creating a generation of bagholders**

Now here we are at the March lows. You're locked down, sitting on a Zoom conference call and life sucks. But you're alright. You’ve still got a job and aren't really spending money. And hey, you’re are about to have a stack deposited in your Chase account.

""LOOK HOW CHEAP GAMESTOP STOCK IS!!! AND THE GUY FROM THE BIG SHORT BOUGHT IT!!! I'M A GENIUS!!!""

-Also see the latest from Hertz on their insiders and buybacks. They’re raising capital from you guys. Maybe they can get out of bankruptcy, but probably you just gave them a free lunch.


TLDR; Global economy is in a corporate debt bubble that works like housing in 2008. Only way this can be fixed is by the measures we see being taken during Covid. Retail has been MANIPULATED AND REQUIRED to perform the functions the Fed cannot(buying individual stocks). This has led to billionaires and institutions leaving retail holding the bag. It’s going to follow a bursting bubble pattern. Nobody is left to prop up the markets nor do they want to because the leverage has to unwind. Dollar might surge like last time and collapse (milkshake theory).

Addition: Futures being green headed into an open just means we open higher for everyone to get a chance to dump. If you were a fund manager would you want the market to open green and THEN sell? Or sit and wait around all day for a sell price you might not get? Remember it’s all about manipulating retail. The “bounce” you figure is coming already happened overnight. Or there was selling overnight and the bounce is coming at the open. Look at the /ES charts and the market hour charts. That price action that happens in between matters to the patterns. A regular S&amp;P chart is basically cut in half.",finance
personalfinance,Recent graduate in need of advice on how to handle my student loan debt.,"Recent grad in need of debt assistance &amp; advice.

Desperate need of debt assistance.

Hello All,

I come here seeking advice and strategies to tackle my school loan debt. I feel so stagnant and lost.

I come from a very poor family where I am a first-generation college student. I don’t have family to live with- everyone has moved or passed away. (No parents/grandparents/siblings)

I was not really taught about loans but just knowing I needed them to go to school then get a good job to pay them back. In hindsight, I wish I would have worked a lot more to offset the cost of taking out so much. But que sera, sera. I am trying my best to tackle them now.

Fast forward, I graduated with my doctorate degree in physical therapy of December 2019. I am no longer a student but I do not have steady work either.

I have not been able to secure a job yet due to the pandemic and test centers closing. Figuring out whether to keep Ubering to have money to live on or...to stay home and study for a licensure test I can’t even afford to sit for because I don’t want my credit cards to not be paid has been a constant struggle. (Credit score poor to fair)

-1bedroom apartment with utilities (800all in/month)-no internet or cable.
-Own my car- no car payments. 
-A few credit cards to pay off ($8k total) debt to income ratio=close to 90% (had to use for school expenses)
-Phone/gas/car insurance/food/phone bill~$400/month

I budget and skimp as much as I can(rice and beans)- I don’t go out to eat. Make everything at home.

Attached are what I have accumulated in loans from undergraduate and graduate school:

Basically- there is a mix of federal loans and private

Private loans: $49,863 @ 8.375% and $29,882 @ 8.375
Fed loans: varying rates and amounts:
https://imgur.com/a/aFLgEac

A) The best type of strategy to take and a timeline of what to expect? I have heard different aspects of loan forgiveness. 

B) I know I have to work on my credit score to get better refinancing rates going forward. My only income at the moment is ubering/donating plasma. Any way to boost that score more quickly?

C) any other strategies to help my financial situation while having the degree knowledge that I do?

D) What do you think is the best thing to set myself up to not only have a respectable credit score but manageable school loan debt? 

I need to have a long term solution that I can stick to since I’m fairly new out of school. I need to start correctly and not have to double back.

I believe I am able to help people but feel like I can’t if I’m so stressed into what I have going on. 

I got into this field with a passion to be genuinely grateful for the opportunity of helping people but I feel defeated every time I login into that loan screen for trying to do the right and responsible thing.

I apologize for the long post and any help would be appreciated. Thank you all for always helping the people who come here in need because it goes a long way.",finance

personalfinance,Money priorities.,My friend is starting her first job and has some questions about what to prioritise.

Her question is if she should prioritise paying off her loans quicker or try to get the full 401k matching since it's so good.

personalfinance,"Does It Make Sense for a Young, Healthy Person to Contribute to an HSA?","EDIT: Apparently I'm an idiot and my plan isn't HSA-qualified anyway. 

I'm a 28 year old man who is reasonably healthy. I could lose a few pounds, but other than that I have no significant health issues. That being said, I am aware enough to understand that, despite what we'd all like to think, good health does not always last. I'm not making much money now and thus, I am only in the 12% marginal federal income tax bracket. I am also covered by a HDHP through my state's insurance marketplace. I get a modest monthly subsidy.

So... I am eligible to contribute to an HSA. But I'm healthy right now, and don't really need the reduction in AGI. On the other hand, any money contributed would be there waiting to be used. It would be tax free if I did need it for medical expenses. And I'd get the above-the-line adjustment too. I wouldn't be using it for the tax reduction, but, hey, every little bit helps.

I guess what prompted this was watching a medical documentary on Netflix and realizing that... We all think and hope we'll stay healthy. We all think and hope we'll never get cancer or diabetes. We all think we'll never have a heart attack. But the fact is that shit happens.

Does it make sense for someone in my position to contribute to an HSA? Does it make sense to maintain an HDHP to remain eligible?

Situation:

 I currently have a home I purchased using a VA loan in MS(3.75%apr). This home was purchased at 260k and I currently owe 230k on the home. The value of the home is roughly the same as the purchase price. This home currently is being rented and the income is more than the monthly mortgage by a nominal amount. Renters have just resigned lease agreement for another year.

I am hoping to purchase a home in SC at 305k. The maximum amount usable by the VA is 510k, leaving me roughly 60k short of using my va loan. Additionally our credit is a bit on the rough side at  670.

From what I understand we have a few options here, there may be more but this is what I'm currently aware of.

1) drop the down payment on the SC home to bring the amount inside the VA cap (do not have the liquid cash for this, option out)

2) refi the Ms home as a non VA loan and then get a VA loan for the SC home, although I'm not certain with it being a rental property that I would keep my apr close to the same rate 

3) refi the Ms home as a HELOC VA loan and use the cash out to pay the SC down payment (not sure this would cover the amount, would largely be based on house appraisal value)

4) take a loan through Navy Federal that offers 0 down loan with no pmi non VA, but comes at the cost of a 4.5% apr

5) perhaps other options I'm not familiar with.

stocks,Defensive Bull Case and Stock Picks,"Shorting involves timing, because the market only goes up in the long run. The winning strategy is to be a defensive bull. Trust me when I say, I know all the bear thesis and have some of my own (CLO collapse, deflation, etc). What's the point though if I can't time for shit and the Fed probably only brought down the market to pressure Mitch and Trump to pass another stimulus?

Therefore, here's what I bought and why:

BRK.B

Berkshire is trading at book value, which is based on stock prices as of 3/30. This makes no sense when the biggest holdings are Apple, Amazon, and cash. Plus most of their operating companies are monopoly like, which gives them earning power even in a depression.

BB

Blackberry is now a software only company, but it's valued like a manufacturer. It's automotive software business will shrink this year, but it also is one of the largest names in cybersecurity.  It acquired Cylance two years ago and that part of the business is exploding right now. Cylance, if valued like it's competitor CRWD, would be worth 3x what Blackberry as a whole is worth.

CCH/WS

This is a warrant for the SPAC for UTZ (the salty snack brand). It's good for four years with a strike of $11.50 on CCH. The stock is valuing the company at about $1.4B, which is below enterprise value.. for what's basically another Frito Lay with higher revenue growth and less debt. Also the investor presentation seems really conservative. The CEO says sales increased substantially more than expected last quarter due to lockdowns. 

BHC

Yes this is actually Valeant and they have a lot of debt. However, they rolled their debt and have zero payments until 2029. They are cash flow positive and will remain so for this year (one of the few companies to issue guidance). Their largest segment is OTC products from Bausch and Lomb.

LAKE

Best for last. This company makes PPE. They doubled their revenue last quarter and income exploded, analyst expectations were crushed. Yet the stock is only up about 22% due to this crash. Options are not cheap, but the stock is trading at 50% off its 52 week high from before earnings.

in 2019, paypal sent out a 1099k, as I exceeded their $2k + 250 transaction threshold 

1. Is it possible/advisable/legal to claim this as business income after the fact? 

2. If NO, then do I file deductions the same way? For example, can I file my $1500 camera as a tax deductible expense? Or what about shipping materials i use to package my shipments?

3. How do I rectify this at a state vs federal level?

personalfinance,Potential Mortgage Fraud,"I am recent college graduate who has little to no credit history other than my student loans and today I received an email from CreditKarma monitoring stating that I have somehow opened a mortgage with Cenlar Federal Savings Bank and it is now on my Equifax credit report.

A combination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's pessimistic view of the economy and worry around a second COVID wave / lockdown put significant pressure on the markets. Are these concerns valid? Here are the details:

1. **On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell laid out a prolonged picture of economic recovery after COVID.** While Powell stated interest rates will remain near zero and promised continued financial support, he projected a lengthy economic recovery. Powell expects average unemployment of \~10% during the last three months of the year vs. unemployment of 13.3% today. Furthermore, he expects GDP to contract by 5 - 10% this year. These estimates mean the expected monthly decreases in unemployment rates will be less than the 1.3% decrease we saw in May and unemployment to decrease at a slower rate while reopening ramps up.
2. **As states reopen, 21 states saw an increase in average daily new cases.**[ ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-economy-worst-of-coronavirus-shutdowns-may-be-over-11590408000)21 states saw an increase in COVID cases as they have begun reopening. Furthermore, hospitalizations have begun to rise in at least 9 states. However, COVID death are still declining steadily. We'll need to keep a close eye on whether the nation is able to continue this steady decline in COVID deaths following this recent increase in case counts. Continued decrease in COVID deaths will mean we are handling the new cases earlier and better.
3. **Economic recovery continues steadily with unemployment claims reports decreasing and consumer price index (CPI) improving.** This week, we saw signs of economic recovery as unemployment claims reports decreased by 335K, from 1.8M to 1.5M. Furthermore, CPI decreased by only 0.1% in May compared to 0.8% in April; if we look over the past 12 months, the CPI actually increased by 0.1%. Both indicators suggest the slowing of the economic contraction due to COVID. Furthermore, the CPI improvement indicates the Fed's current policy is working; generally, CPI decreases dramatically during recessions as consumers curtail their spending.

**WX Capital is maintaining its position in the market.** Powell's pessimistic economic sentiment and the rise in COVID cases are unfortunate, but not alarming. Looking ahead, we will be keeping a close eye on unemployment rates and COVID death rates, and gauging the market's reaction. As of now, May's increase in employment and the general trend in decreasing COVID deaths are promising signs of economic recovery. As usual, don't hesitate to reach out with questions!",finance

personalfinance,Best way to save until son is 18?,"When my son was born I started putting $5 (not much I know but I'm trying to do something) a week from my paychecks into a savings account for him. He's now 2 and between that and money he's received as gifts or anything else he's up to around $1000. The plan is that when he's 18 he'll hopefully have a decent junk of cash to do something with. Car, school books, etc. Hopefully I'll be able to contribute more towards this account in the future but for now it's $5 a week. What can I do with this money to help it grow a bit faster?

Stocks- higher risk than I'm comfortable with although 16 years is a long time if the money is put into an index fund or ETF. The problem with this though is the small deposits. Is there a way to buy fractions of an ETF? I know some stocks you can do this with but I haven't looked at ETFs.

Bonds- Low risk but also low return right now.

HYSA- This seems like probably the best option except that rates are garbage right now.

CDs- Kind of the same as above although maybe doing several 3 year CDs could get slightly better interest rates. by shopping around each time.

investing,Rant from a Financial Advisor (no love for this in personal finance),"This  is a rant from an individual who considers himself an advisor and  advocate for his clients.  The first myth I would like to dispel is the  idea that just because someone works for an RIA or is a fee only advisor  they are not a salesman.

Instead  of looking for a FA, that is this or that, please just evaluate them on  one criteria.  Are they a salesman or are they there to advise you on  your financial life.  I know that this goes against the grain of  everything you have heard but just keep reading.

Just  because you are working with an RIA or a fee only advisor you are not  guaranteed impartiality.  Sorry to burst your bubble but that is how  life works.  For example they will only sell you certain funds that pay a  commission to the firm and the advisor.  Oh.... you want to buy a  vanguard index fund, nope not happening we have this A share fund and  that is it.  SEE LOOK!!!! we can only sell you certain funds and since  they charge the same commission we are fulfilling our fiduciary  relationship.  THIS IS WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS GOING PEOPLE!!!!

Ok.   now you will say BUT if you just buy an S&amp;P 500 index fund you  will do better than most advisors and managers, follow Warren Buffet's  advice.  NO SHIT!! This is true and should be used by everyone.  BUT  guess what??? Most people are not smart enough or disciplined enough to  do this.  People hire advisors like me to keep them on track.  To keep  them grounded when the market turns bad.  Mostly to keep them invested.   Yes you heard me ""to keep them invested.""  Your grandma or aunt that  you want to take over the account and invest in VOO because you read on  the inter-webs that it is the best thing since sliced bread.  Guess what  happens when the market drops 25%.  She fucking sells out and does not  buy back in for years.  This is the reality of the situation.  This is  why most advisors will buy a growth moderate income fund or balanced  fund, because guess what?  Most people are OK with mediocre returns if  they don't lose money in sharp declines.  This is the real secret to the  business.  we work to keep people invested NOT make them the most money  possible.

* How do you select an advisor you ask. here is how.  Ask FUCKING questions.
* Education: sociology major or English major, yeah fuck that guy
* Time in the industry: your cousin who cold called you, fuck him.
* AUM: this should be at least a few million if he is with an RIA, much more if a broker!!!
* Captive or independent: go independent all the way or get the shit ""A share"" funds.
* Ask them technical question.  If they can not explain a PE ratio run or how a stock price is affected by a dividend then run.
* Ask  for stock picks!!! No joke but don't buy them ( you will likely lose  money).  Because if they cant give you any analysis on a single stock  why the fuck should you talk to this guy.  They are a salesman nothing  more.
* Don't buy shit from your CSR at the bank!!!!
* Will they work with your insert CPA, Lawyer, business partner?
* Speaking of that don't use your CPA or Lawyer as your FA.  Conflict of interest.
* Beware  of the old fuck who has 2 years experience but looks like he has 25  years in the industry.  Usually overweight balding and wearing a J. Bank  Suit from the buy one get three free line.
* Oh  yeah the guy that seems to give zero fucks about you and your money.   That is the one you want.  Why??? because he does not need to sell you  shit to pay his bills.  He will give you advice based on your best  interest not his.  His car and mortgage are golden and do not depend on  your $10,000 IRA to keep his BMW from the repo man.

A few more things

Whole  Life insurance: FUCK WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE.  This is the worst  investment known to man.  Buy term.  Whole is a savings account with  life insurance attached.

Annuities:   These get a bad rap but are great if you understand what you are  buying.  Most people do not.  CD at 1% for 5 years or a fixed annuity at  2.4% for 3 years buy the fucking annuity.  $200,000 in your MMA for the  last 10 years thinking interest rates will go up. Buy an Index annuity  for 7 years at a cap of 5%.  Fuck you were not doing anything with the  money anyway.  See my point!!!

Mutual  funds:  Just buy an index funds.  There I said it.  But really it is  your best bet to make real money.  If you can not deal with the ups and  downs look to a no load fund from a reputable company with a fixed  income component.

Individual stock:  The only way to beat the market.  Also the quickest way to lose money. buyer beware.

This  rant is not geared to people who can invest for themselves.  It is  geared toward those that want to evaluate and Advisor without the sugar  coating from someone in the industry.

EDIT:  Thank you to the persons who gave this post gold and silver.  I thought when I made it that the post would be deleted before morning!!!  I want to address a few things that people have asked the most and I will try to answer everyone's questions

* Education:  This pissed a lot of people off!  I was not trying to say that if you are not an econ major you can't be an advisor.  I was trying to give people a way of cutting out the BS of the industry.  You need to understand how people are recruited.  Many firms will take on about anyone who can breath and pass the series 7, then they put them in a room to do cold calls or go knock on doors asking for business.  A great deal of the folks get jobs with the firm only to be exploited and to wash out of the industry.  People with a business or econ background are more likely to work at reputable and legit firms that don't exploit you for your circle of friends or family.
* Fiduciary Standard:  Everyone likes to make mention of this.  Well.... what does this mean???  In the financial services industry it means that the advisor will not sell you one product over the other based on personal gain to the advisor.  This is different from a suitability standard where you can sell whatever you want no matter the commission as long as it is suitable for the customer.   How each firm deals with this is different across the board.  RIA's for example will only invest your account under a Wrap fee usually 1-2% of the AUM.  Commission based sales will remove low commission products so they can say that  they did the best for you on their platform.  What it does NOT mean is the advisor must do the very best for you and send you down the street if there is a better deal.  IT ONLY MEANS THEY MUST DO THE BEST FOR YOU WITH WHAT THEY CAN SELL.

personalfinance,Financially illiterate with successful career,"Hi PF,

I'm hoping to get some advice from y'all. I was raised firmly middle-class and never really got any sort of financial education from my parents or elsewhere.

I've sort of stumbled into a pretty lucrative career that really started taking off 3-4 years ago. I've never thought about what to do with excess money (never really considered having ""excess"" money before!) so I'm hoping some of y'all can help me strategize how to better allocate my income. 

Here's my situation:

age: 31, married with 1 kid (4yo)

* Annual base salary 180k
* Annual bonus of \~30k
* Annual stock grants (RSU) \~150k after taxes

Here's my expenses:

* Mortgage, $1500/mo, 270k left on 300k note, just refinanced a year ago at 3.5%
* Cars, both late-model American, relatively low interest rate (4% ish) 22k &amp; 18k loans, \~350/mo each
* Less than 2k credit card debt

I've only just started contributing to my 401k 3-4 years ago, it's up to about $120k, I also have been contributing to my child's 529, which is currently sitting at 11k.

I didn't really know what to do after that, but having grown up without much and really struggling in my early 20s I'm terrified of being laid off or otherwise losing my income, so I have a ton of cash savings (exactly 100k) sitting in a BOA savings account earning basically nothing in terms of interest. I'd like to put this money to better use, but honestly the peace of mind having 6 figures in savings gives me is worth it.

I also have $30k in a betterment account, this is where I plan to send any excess money moving forward (I only recently hit the 100k threshold in my savings, that was a personal goal of mine).

I've considered investing in real estate or otherwise diversifying, but I just have no idea what I'm doing here. I went from a \~400 credit score (now 800) defaulting on my school loans to making what I do now over the course of about 8 years. Not trying to flex, but I just want to explain why I don't really know what I'm doing.

So... what should I be doing, PF? Am I on the right track? Should I look into RE? Is betterment a good place to park my extra funds? I don't plan on retiring anytime soon (love my work) and my wife is currently in school (when she graduates and starts pulling her own salary, we'll really be in the black).

Thanks in advance!",finance

My dilemma is that I’m contemplating whether to 

1)max out my Roth before the deadline of July 15th especially with this turbulent times in the stock market (long term investor)

2) use most of my savings to pay off my student loans (I will be able to pay off the balance of the loans with the interest rates listed above. Remainder overall outstanding balance would be around 10k with a hovering fixed interest rate of 3%)

3) some sort of combination of both 

I guess ultimately it comes down to whether I value the guaranteed rate of return on paying off the relatively higher student loans or if I think the stock market will outperform it in the short term",finance

stocks,Silver ETFs A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity,"As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy the PSLV ETF or call options on the SLV ETF** **for 36 USD on 1/21**.

Silver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver’s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.

Silver’s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.

Historically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been “consumed” and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.

Stepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.

While the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn’t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.

This last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.

So today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.

Now why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven’t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.

The way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.

You see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.

China, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.

So do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.

If you look at both instances of silver’s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November. If you are interested in learning more about the large silver price manipulation on the COMEX futures market take a look at the documentation online by Ted Butler, Ed Steer, and Bert Chilton.

personalfinance,Balancing Student Loans and a Savings - advice?,"Hi everyone, 

I just graduated in May 2019 from grad school and have about $160k (149k principal + 11k accrued interest) in federal student loans. They're currently not collecting interest due to COVID-19. I have stafford and graduate plus loans. They're currently also still in forbearance until October 2020 because I've been studying for licensing in my field and just working a shit job that kept me afloat while I studied. but I finally was able to get licensed and get my first job which I start next week and it pays $85k. 

So I want to begin aggressively paying back my loans but I also currently only have about $5k in a traditional savings account that I add to here or there when I can. With my new salary, I will be taking home about $5k a month after taxes. My monthly expenses are about $2k, leaving about $3k to go into loans and savings.

I just wanted to know what a good balance would be and how much I should put into my loans versus savings on a monthly basis. I wanted to open a HYSA and put my existing $5k in savings in there and build from there. My job also offers a 401k plan which I'm having a hard time understanding tbh but if that comes into play should I be directing my money in three directions? loans/savings/401k?

Another factor I considered is that since my loans will not be collecting interest again until October 2020, should I be building my savings between now and then? Or begin paying loans as soon as I can?

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice or anything I may not have considered yet. I'm honestly not great with my money and only recently started budgeting which was a poor decision on my part but I'm trying to stay consistent!

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Paid off 2 newer student loans...score dropped 50 points. What??,"Note: This is based off my proprietary TransUnion and Equifax scores, which have always had a strong correlation with my FICO 8 score. I am waiting on the next FICO refresh.

I thought I was a credit master. I brought my score up from the 500s to 820 over the past 8 years. I read all the literature, understood the score factors were things like payment history, utilization, total credit availability, # of inquiries, average account age, etc.

I had 2 private student loans that were both recently established in the past 2 years. They were loans, not revolving credit, and were bringing down my average credit history to 7 years. I recently got an influx of money so I did the math and paid these off, freeing me up about $1000/mo in payments. As a result, my average credit history went up to 9 years as expected.

What was unexpected was my credit score dropped by over 50 points.

I'm racking my brain and re-reading literature trying to figure out what went wrong. I have 100% on-time payment history, less than 1% usage on my revolving accounts (credit cards), 0 deregatories, 0 hard inquiries, 9 year avg credit history (and 19 years is my oldest). My credit mix still includes 2 other installment accounts (federal student loans auto-deferred due to covid) along with my 7 revolving. The ONLY thing I could see affecting my score...is that I went from 11 total open accounts, down to 9 total open accounts. According to CreditKarma, 0-10 total accounts is a red zone, and 11+ accounts is in the green zone.

Is it possible that I dropped nearly 60 points because I have too FEW accounts open? Really?

Normally I wouldn't care too much, but I am BUYING A HOUSE this summer and trying to nail the smallest rate possible - every partial percentage point equates to a ton of money over 30 years. I feel like I screwed myself big time, here.",finance

stocks,Shopify gains after deal with Walmart expands network's reach,"**Shopify gains after deal with Walmart expands network's reach** 

 [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-web-marketplace-business-1.1450557](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-web-marketplace-business-1.1450557) 

Walmart Inc. has partnered with e-commerce giant Shopify Inc. to expand its third-party marketplace site and grab more of the pandemic-fueled surge in online shopping. Shares of the Canadian technology company rose in early trading.

The world’s largest retailer aims to add 1,200 Shopify sellers this year, Walmart executive Jeff Clementz said in an interview. The company’s marketplace site, which already offers more than 75 million products, grew at a faster pace than Walmart’s overall web business in the first quarter, and third-party sales are typically more profitable as the sellers pay a fee to list items and often shoulder the delivery costs.

The collaboration is Walmart’s latest attempt to expand the scale and profitability of its $21.5 billion U.S. e-commerce business, which is gaining ground on market leader Amazon.com Inc. but continues to lose money. In recent years, Walmart has rolled out a fulfillment service for third-party sellers, allowed customers to return marketplace items in its physical stores and jettisoned millions of third-party items that didn’t meet quality standards.

“There are many Shopify sellers who were already on Walmart.com, but we have not penetrated their base to the extent possible,” said Clementz, who is vice president of Walmart Marketplace. “There’s a tremendous opportunity.”

For Shopify, the deal -- expected to be announced as early as Monday -- provides its network of millions of merchants access to Walmart’s customers, and follows a May linkup with Facebook Inc. that allowed retailers to import Shopify product catalogs to the social-media giant’s new Shops service.

“Few companies in the world match the sheer size and scale of Walmart,” said Satish Kanwar, Shopify’s vice president of product. The deal opens the door for small and medium-sized businesses “to access the 120 million customers who visit Walmart.com every month.”

The deal is “a win-win for both companies,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce researcher. Still, the partnership diverges from Shopify’s typical strategy of acting as a platform for brands competing with large retailers, he said.

Shopify’s U.S. shares rose as much as five per cent before regular trading Monday in New York, even as the Canadian and U.S. markets were poised to decline. Walmart was little changed.

Founded in 2006, Shopify has become the platform of choice for businesses large and small that are looking to get online cheaply and quickly. Monthly fees start at just US$29, which buys a virtual shop and everything that’s needed to run it, including tools to manage payments, inventory and shipping.

The Ottawa-based company claimed the second-largest share of online retail sales in the U.S. last year, and its meteoric growth has made a billionaire out of German-born founder and Chief Executive Officer Tobi Lutke.

 

**Slow Start**

Walmart introduced its marketplace site in August 2009, but progress was glacial at first as the retailer was focused more on its massive brick-and-mortar business and slow to recognize Amazon’s growing clout. That started to change when Doug McMillon became CEO in 2014, and accelerated when he put Marc Lore in charge of the retailer’s U.S. e-commerce division after acquiring his online startup, Jet.com, in 2016.

Lore quickly added millions of new third-party items from small vendors who were happy to have an alternative to Amazon’s dominant site. Later, he took a page out of Amazon’s playbook by offering shipping services for third-party vendors through Walmart’s massive logistics network.

“We need to start playing offense,” Lore said at a February investor conference.

McMillon wants to get even more out of the business, especially after shuttering Jet last month. “We don’t think that we’ve done everything we must do, and should do, to support marketplace sellers in terms of the tools and services that we have available,” he said at the conference, just weeks before virus-related stockpiling sent traffic to Walmart’s website soaring. First-quarter U.S online sales rose 74 per cent, more than twice the growth rate that Walmart had previously forecast for the entire year. Walmart has since withdrawn its financial guidance due to the pandemic.

To bring more direction to the marketplace business, Walmart named Jeff Shotts to run it last summer as part of a broader restructuring that sought to better integrate the online business with its physical stores, which often act as e-commerce distribution hubs.

**On and Off**

Clementz said the two companies had been in talks on and off for years, but discussions heated up over the past six months. A recent pilot test with several Shopify sellers went well, and he foresees eventually having thousands of sellers on Walmart’s marketplace.

There are risks to opening the doors to more and more sellers. Walmart’s marketplace, along with Amazon’s, has faced criticism over the years for carrying offensive items like Confederate flags. In recent years, Walmart has pulled about 20 million items off the site that didn’t meet its quality standards. Though Amazon’s marketplace is open to virtually anyone who goes through an online registration process, Walmart’s is invite-only so it can vet sellers. It also uses machine learning and keyword recognition technology to spot suspect sellers.",finance
personalfinance,"Received lump sum payment for internship, but got about 3000 dollars taken off of the total amount, is this correct?","Hi, I'm working currently at a paid internship, the contract states that I'm to receive a lump sum of 8000 dollars at the beginning of the internship, and obviously it'd be deducted/have to be returned if I didn't complete the full 3 months. 

I received the payment this morning and noticed that I'd received around 4900 dollars, I knew there'd be tax deductions, but not this much! I requested a pay stub and I saw some regular deductions I'd already anticipated (social security, Medicare, etc) but the federal tax deduction was around 1600! 

Is this completely normal and I should just settle with the deduction, or did I file my withholdings incorrectly? I'm just not sure whether this was an error on the accounting team's part, or I'm just overreacting over a completely normal deduction. I have no other jobs / income, I'm a college student atm.

personalfinance,Should I become an authorized user on parent’s 13 month old credit card?,"I have terrible credit due to a mental health crisis after I graduated college in May 2018. I didn’t work and basically laid in bed at my childhood home for over a year. Then, I moved to a city with a friend as a roommate and started working in June 2019. I started paying my student loans off, but I missed a year’s worth of payments. I saved aggressively and paid off all the interest I accrued and now I’m caught up with my loan payments (although with the CARES Act, I do not have to pay until later this summer, as my loans are all federal). 

I also paid off two debt collections on my account in April. 

I have perfect on time payments for my apartment rent for over a year now. 

I do not have a credit card (I tried to apply in October 2019, but didn’t get approved) 

CreditKarma tells me that my credit score is under 600. Before COVID, it estimated I had a fair/good chance of getting a secured credit card through Capital One, but since COVID, it estimates that I would not even get a secured card. I’m not willing to take another hard inquiry credit hit unless I know I’ll get approved. 

My parent has taken some financial hits due to a troublesome sibling of mine. Their credit score is around 650, so they tell me. 

Should I get added as an AU to their Capital One credit card? It’s only 13 months old and they told me they have made 9 months of payments on time. The card is not fully paid off, but they intend to do so this month (so they tell me).

politics,Megathread: Supreme Court Rules Rules Civil Rights Law Protects LGBT Workers,"The Supreme Court on Monday ruled federal anti-discrimination protections apply when companies fire people because they are gay or transgender.

At issue in the dispute is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, among other things, bars discrimination ""because of sex."" The Supreme Court has applied that prohibition in several other contexts, but Monday marks the first time it has weighed in on whether the protections extend to gay and transgender people.

The 6-3 ruling comes in a trio of cases the court considered across two hours of oral argument in October.

I filed my taxes in March. I owed money on my federal and my state taxes. I have paid the federal, but still owe the state. 

Since filing, I have re-allocated some funds and maxed my 2019 Traditional IRA contribution. When I initially filed, I had only contributed about $600 to that fund. 

My questions: 

1. Should I file an amended tax return for this contribution? My assumption is yes, as I will will get a refund on some of my taxes.
2. If I should amend, should I pay off my state taxes **before** I file the amended return? This is the big question I haven't been able to find much about. 

Thanks everyone!",finance
personalfinance,Changes at work mean time to evaluate finaces: any advice,"Work changes mean it's a good time to reevaluate finances, just looking for some advice on what we should focus on:

&amp;#x200B;

Financial details:

\-Wife makes $132,000 per year

\- I typically make around $40,000. I was laid off due to covid, but picked up extra work and should land at around $35,000 this year. I also care for our 2-year old (I work remotely, so I work when he's asleep). 

\- The mortgage is about $2000 a month (including taxes, cdd/hoa, etc.) $270,000 remaining

\- Wife student loans around $1000 a month, but will go up next year (probably close to $3,000) - about $300,000 left. 

\- My student loans are $250 a month, about $18,000 remaining. 

\- No other credit card debt or car payments. We will need to replace one if not both of our cars in the next 2-4 years. 

\- Interest rates on our loans and house are similar. 

\- We have about $300,000 in investments (mostly mutual funds, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Her practice just announced that they are going to a new insurance plan. This is going to raise our premiums from $250 a month (family plan to $800 a month for the same coverage. There is not a cheaper option). 

They also announced that they didn't fire any physicians due to Covid, but are changing their pay structure. Some people will see a raise while others might see a decrease. We don't know what will happen to her pay, but since she's in her first 2 years there....we're not optimistic that it will go up. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're looking at other pediatrician jobs, but there aren't many openings right now (numbers are down for general practices). We've only been in the house for 1.5 years. We expect that we'll see and move, but are scared of losing too much. It's a newer neighborhood and we're seeing people who sell lose a ton of money since there are brand-new models being built at similar pricing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for additional work. This area isn't great for work, but I'll do whatever. The biggest challenge is that there are no daycares open in the area if we wanted to put the kiddo somewhere so I can work a more traditional job. Even then, before we moved here...the most I made was $50,000. Daycare is, on average, $1500 a month in this area. So, I'd have to make like $55,000 to cover the cost of daycare and not lose money overall (based on what I make now). Not impossible, but it makes me want to just find a way to work more when mom is home or he is asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final Thoughts:

We're not necessarily in huge trouble, but we're feeling the pressure. We want to focus on one of the major debts but aren't sure if the house or loans should be the priority. 

Not sure if we're missing something in how we should approach finances. We've read a few books with different perspectives, but just have moments of panic that we're doing something wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a kind of financial advisor who we could hire to help advise us without trying to sell us a program or physically manage our finances? 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Interest rates vs mortgage refi,"This may be a dumb question, but with the fed stating that interest rates will likely stay low for years to come, does that mean that mortgage rates will also likely stay low for years to come? Husband and I are looking at refinancing and taking out a small HELOC to do some home improvement, but aren't necessarily ready to take that loan out right now. Are we ok to wait a year or two? Are we thinking that interest rates will remain as low as they are?  Or should hubs and I bite the bullet and just go for it now?",finance
personalfinance,"Buying a car from a dealership - they have a minimum amount they will finance, and it's basically the entire car value.","So I found a car I like at a dealer out-of-state (but not too far). I'm working with a sales associate over email, and I have the OTD price quoted at $12,500 (includes tax, title, fees, all that).

I have good credit, and the interest rate she quoted me beats any of the pre-approvals I've gotten from other sources (including my own credit union). So I was planning to finance through the dealer.

Here's the kicker.

I mentioned that I am planning to come pay them a visit for a test drive, but I need a couple days to get my down payment squared up. Which I think is a reasonable thing to say. She replies and says that in order to finance with them, the minimum loan amount is $12,000. Which is basically the whole cost of the vehicle, meaning I can only put $500 down. 

I was planning to drop a few grand upfront to bring my monthly payment down. She says that I can just make a large first monthly payment, but that wouldn't do anything to improve the higher-monthly payment I would still be stuck with.

Is this likely to be negotiable? Honestly if I need to finance the entire cost, then I'm probably going to walk. 

How would you handle this?

investing,Bear vs Bull Thesis,"We have seen a spirited debate between the Bulls and the Bears this past 6 weeks.

The Bulls rely on the Fed stimulus, the Treasury stimulus, the market being forward looking and other very compelling arguments that have significant merit.

The Bears rely on the record unemployment, the horrible economy, the soon to be revealed bankruptcies in Zombie companys, the inability of the consumer to spend us to a better economy and the expected glacial pace of a real economic recovery.

Today on an interview on CNBC Leon Cooperman who has quite a few decades of very successful investing under his belt made a statement that got me thinking about both sides of the debate.   Cooperman's statement was ""I would not be surprised to see the market in a trading range over the next few years.""  That is thought provoking.   Both the Bulls and the Bears have very solid evidence for their outlook that the opposing outlook has to acknowledge as fact.   And the result could be that these factors oppose each other over the next few years.  I don't know what that range may be but I suspect in the 2750 to 3250 range based on just the last couple of weeks of data.   I don't think the Bulls can negate the Bear's facts enough to see a breakout above 3250 and those facts will be with us for a long time.  At least 2-3 years.   And the Bull's facts are strong and correct enough that it will be hard for the market to fall very far and I suspect 2750 may be the lower end of that trading range.   

Frankly I have heard enough from both sides to understand the arguments both correct and specious.  I wonder what your thoughts are on the long term tension between both camps that might not allow a breakout either way.",finance

personalfinance,Overwhelmed with options for paying down debt while saving for retirement,"Hello PF,

TL;DR - Prime Directive follower trying to find leeway to meet goals. How can we best prioritize paying down loans, saving for a house, and saving for retirement all at once?

Let me start by saying I've been using the [Prime Directive](https://imgur.com/lSoUQr2) as my guide ever since I started managing my own money. My wife and I [27F/M] are currently between steps 3 &amp; 4, paying down debts and saving for retirement. We both have different philosophies on what our next steps should be - so we're looking for help to us understand if we're thinking about this correctly.

Current Situation:

* Income: ~ 150k combined
* Debts:
 * High-Interest Student Loan &gt;7%: ~40k (deferred with CARES ACT)
 * Student Loan &lt; 7% : ~100k (60k deferred with CARES ACT)
 * Cars: Paid Off
 * CC: Paid Off monthly
* Savings: 
 * EFund: 19k (around three months with current lifestyle, if we both lose jobs)
 * House Fund: 5k 
 * Student Loan deferred payments for Cash-on-hand: 3.5k
* Company 401k's: ~73k total (Both contributing 2%-4% above employer's match)

Goals:

* Immediate: Payoff Debt, Buy House
* Short-Mid: Kid(potentially)
* Long: Not worry about retirement.

We feel very fortunate to be in the spot we are in at our age. We're currently putting aside our student loan payments to have cash on hand and plan to dump it all at the high-interest loans when Federal payments resume. We're tracking and planning our budget and lifestyle with YNAB - we don't feel like we're living above our means, but we're not living frugally either.

We would love to be able to buy a house in under five years and understand our high student loan debt is a potential barrier to getting a mortgage. At the same time, we'd like to diversify our retirement savings to more than just our company's 401ks and capitalize on compounding interest. We've started looking into IRA's, and leaning towards ROTH's. If we expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement, is that the correct choice?

Finance is a very nuanced topic that varies with each situation. Instead of just throwing 'to-be-budgeted' cash into the buckets willy-nilly, what are tips or strategies we can use to best prioritize paying down loans, saving for a house, and saving for retirement all at once?

We appreciate any advice, thanks!",finance
investing,How much margin use is acceptable?,"I was wanting to get an idea of how much margin I should take advantage of, if at all, at this stage in the market. I'd be using it to buy stocks and hold for at least a year, maybe 2. I'd be looking at an interest rate of 9%, which on 50k would come out to $4500/yr or $12.50/day. That's the high figure, as I wouldn't use 100% of the available margin and risk dropping down the the maintenance requirement on a red day or 2. However, with the market so low right now, the gains on stocks over the next year or 2 seem to greatly outweigh the cost of margin interest. Personally, I was thinking somewhere between 50-75% margin should be safe. I wanted to ask around first though to make sure it's a safe move. I know the are much smarter people here that could help out.",finance
personalfinance,Market FOMO and Excess Cash,"TL;DR Not sure what to do with all of the excess cash sitting on sidelines, fearing we're in a stock market bubble, but tired of cash on sidelines not making me anything, what are other very risk averse people doing?

* I have about \~$100k in cash avail but don't want to dump much of it into market just yet. I am nibbling in funds little by little, ACD on certain long positions.
* Maxing out 401k each year
* 70% of home loan paid off @ 4.15% interest rate ( I have made a one time large principal payment and the schedule was re-amortized), am considering paying another sizeable chunk (25k) of that to continue to pay down...however I could see myself renting out the property and buying something new in the next year or so...Also considering cheap vacation property somewhere

personalfinance,MA State Tax increase in paychecks?,"I've been working for the same company since January 1 and am salaried and all of my net paychecks have been the same since the beginning of the year. My last two paychecks however were lower and it's due to more being taken out for Massachusetts State Taxes even though my withholdings did not change. When I asked our payroll team about it, they reached out to ADP and the ADP rep said, ""MA gives us all a break by not taxing the full extent of our wages to start the year, and therefore the taxes on the wages are a little lower.  Once you contribute a certain amount toward those taxes ($2,000), we then start to get taxed at our full gross pay.  That is why we saw the slight increases."" I haven't contributed 2k to MA state taxes but have to Federal (as of two paychecks ago). I've been a salaried employee in MA for over 10+ years and have never seen this happen.

investing,Inequality in 10 charts,"We all know inequality is rising in the US. I felt like taking some time on an off day to quantify it clearly.

The simplest is the gini coefficient, which has risen from 0.4 in the 60s to 0.48 today:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE22

Next, I did mean to median personal income ratio, a similar concept, up from 1.38 in the early 80s to 1.50 today:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE0C

Neither of these is extremely disturbing, minor trends over many decades that do show a degradation in wage equality but not a major one. A further development down this line is GDP/work force (per capita always struck me as a bit off) as a percent of median income:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE2e

This mostly agrees with the other graphs. As an aside:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE2l

The average worker is producing nearly $130,000 per year right now. Consider if you are an ""average"" worker and how close to that number your total compensation lies... I am convinced the GDP per capita number is a way to obscure the poor pay of many Americans - much easier to make workers believe they're paid fairly when you quote a figure that's [typically half](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE4I) what the relevant figure should be.

Moving on from income-based approaches, we move into wealth-based ones. Starting with the top 1% share of assets:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qTPV

Up roughly 50% since the 90s, where the series starts, though I am guessing that 1990 starting point itself is up considerably from the 60s/70s, though that's pure speculation.

Next, net worth of the entire top 10% as a share of the total. Currently it is resting around 70%.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE0x

Let's consider the bottom 50%, where, by odds, many people reading this reside:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qQCE

That's not a multiple, that's the total percentage of the whole. Currently around 1.5%. Curious that in a democratic system that has defined ""free speech"" as equivalent with wealth, the majority of the population has less than 2% of the total free speech. Explains much...

Lastly, a statistic I'm not sure how to interpret, is wealth over GDP:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE34

Very flat until the mid-90s, after which there's been a significant decoupling from the prior decades (note this occurred alongside a rapid expansion in private/public debt levels, and since 2000 amidst [heavy monetary expansion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE5o)). The stock bubble of the late 90s and the housing bubble of the 00s are both clearly visible. The fact we are currently somewhere between those two peaks is a *touch* unsettling - are we in a wealth bubble or is this a sustainable new normal, and how much of that is due to the expansion of the money supply? Worth noting is that wealth levels *should* increase over time as we accumulate capital. Of course, when that capital accumulation is completely missing the majority of the population, political consequences will result.

Lastly, on the rent being too damn high, we have median house price vs median income:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE3H

Currently, 50% higher than it was in the period between 1960-1975, almost certainly higher still than in the 50s. Again, a clear bubble in the 00s, and then today we see almost the exact same levels. The only difference is the [mortgage debt service payment share of income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=n0Q0), explained purely by historically low interest rates. So long as those rates remain at current levels, it's not *technically* a bubble I suppose, but should rates have to rise steadily back to more historic levels, house prices may collapse as they did in 2008. The middle class, of course, will take the brunt of that potential collapse, given their high affinity to place wealth into their single home. On a final positive note, *actual* rent is historically low:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=rE4k

So keep up the #apartmentlife, given houses are quite dear and possibly severely overpriced long-term.

#Discussion

This all brings up relevant investing concerns, particularly the last few charts - how appropriately valued are assets given this decoupling and monetary expansion, and what is their long-term safety exactly? *Especially* when much of this value is predicated on historically very low interest rates, what happens should they return to the mean?

Also when so much of this wealth (and asset value) is tied up in extreme levels of wealth inequality, what will happen should political forces cause a sudden reversal, and wealth is redistributed to facets of the population more inclined to spend it on demand stimulus rather than on asset purchases like stocks and additional housing? If you remove say 10% of the wealth at the top and give it to the bottom of the pyramid who will remove it from asset markets and use it for personal spending, what happens as the process progresses to stock and housing prices?",finance

stocks,I'm happy to admit that I'm a total idiot,"I'm not trying to pass as a genius or savvy investor at all but most of my positions have been up. I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed and lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.

I was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. 

So I changed the way I invest.

I stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if the apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.

I buy and DCA (Dollar cost average) everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF

This is my current portfolio

AMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.

If you think ""ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit""

Yes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.

Sometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. 

The main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. 

So I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it

My portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months

All due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. 

When I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.

I don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.

But before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?

I wouldn't waste money in any of that. Every penny I'm not putting into stock is a penny I lose from profit.

personalfinance,"Bought my first car from a first time buyer's program with my father negotiating for me and now having regrets/trouble with the payments, do I have any options?","I'll start off by saying it for you because I know it's coming: ""You're an idiot for not reading up on this enough and letting somebody else make all the decisions for you and you deserve whatever shit situation you ended up in, suffer.""


With that out of the way some background:
I was hired on in a job in my field back at the end of March &amp; said job is several states away, plus I was hired just before the covid pandemic shut everything down and given just two weeks to acquire a car and pack to move there.
My father offered to help me buy one and I did some searching. I showed him my list of cars around the 10k mark and he promptly said ""No, that's too cheap"" and found a local Toyota dealership that was offering a recent college grad first time buyer's deal which seemed good from my *very* limited knowledge of car sales.
    
He picked out a certified pre-owned 2017 Camry XLE that was practically new with barely any miles on it and was pristine condition-wise and after test driving it with me and looking at the dealer's paperwork on it's history etc. he said he would pay for my down payment and I would be responsible for the car payments. This was fine with me but when it hit the negotiating part he caved hard to all the dealer's smoothtalking and being the obedient child I am I ate up every word of it. When I questioned the dealer's offers(I already had my budget in mind and it would be an uncomfortable tight fit but not impossible *yet*) and was told ""This is the best deal you will get as a first time buyer fresh out of college with zero credit, you don't have time to shop around"", my dad agreed with the dealer and that was it. So I accepted it and signed everything and trusted my dad knew what he was talking about and that my best interests were being kept in mind.
    
A few weeks into my employment my company switched healthcare providers and my insurance went up *massively* and now my car payments are not fitting in my already tight budget and I can't cut any more of my expenses without cutting into my food money.
I don't mean to sound like a spoiled brat or anything because I greatly appreciate him being willing to pay the down payment on it but I feel a bit like my input was left out and I've been shackled to something I didn't choose nor want because I can't afford it no matter what I sacrifice. Attempts to talk with the dealer have resulted in either ""call your bank"" or being outright brushed and going there in person isn't an option when I live multiple states away now. Talking with my bank about refinancing has yielded similar responses as well. On top of that both sources told me not to trade it in for something cheaper because I'm upside down on the loan and they claim I'll be screwing myself over even more if I do manage to find somebody who's even willing to trade me.

**Now:**

For exact numbers(I didn't see whether this was allowed in the FAQ or not so apologies if it isn't but maybe it will help with context and a solution):
The KBB and Edmunds values for the car with its current trim features/condition/mileage is roughly $16,000ish. (Certified Pre-Owned Toyota Camry 2017 XLE @ 30,000 miles)
My payout/what I still owe on it after two months of payment is $25,000, the down payment was $1,000.  The dealership finance person refuses to refund the GAP/Tire replacement/other fluff that amounts to roughly $5,000 of that balance and also refuses to refinance with me for a lower interest rate although though my bank loan officer assured me my credit score warrants a lower interest rate.
Said bank loan officer also refuses to contact me back after telling me to call her once I've made a decision to go ahead with her loan and refinance.
I don't have the option of paying more money towards the principle to help lower how upside-down I am because I can barely make my payments as is without sacrificing my food; my other expenses are as low as I can get them and are bare bones; I don't spend money outside of what I absolutely have to ffs
While I can (uncomfortably) make my payments now because of student loans being in forbearance, when that ends I won't be able to.



**Tldr:** *What can I do about this car before it swallows me up? I don't have bad credit and I don't want to end up choosing between missing a payment someday and eating. Is trading it for something cheaper really that awful of an option if it's even possible?*",finance

My spouse and I (early 30's) are wondering what to do as our next step financially. Should we save, invest, spend or adventure? Appreciate all advice! Including creative suggestions.

We file our taxes married filing joint, rent, have one kiddo (maybe add 1-2 more in next 5 years), and live in VHCOL (Bay Area). We have not started a 529, and yes we’ll do a backdoor ROTH for 2020 – subtracted from “additional savings” below. Financial details below.

**Current debt:**

* ($35k) capital gains tax on sale of rental property due Q1’21
* ($55k) student debt deferred/0% interest through October 2020 (All federal loans)

**Current assets (not including retirement; maxing out 401k, no HSA available):**

* $225k cash
* $15k additional savings by EOY 2020
* $60k bonus and RSUs Q1’21

**Annual expenses:** ($80k)

We could do the next step thing and buy a house, or live off savings for a couple of years. Or buy a boat. Or my spouse could get a second degree while paying for childcare.

The safe thing to do would be maintain the 3-6 months savings ($20-25k with lean living). Gives us $200k immediate to play with. The safer thing would be to pay off our student debt and save for the tax payment which would leave us $110k now, in Q1’21 it’ll be $185k. Or, not pay off the student loan and have $235k (minus 5 months of payments) in Q1’21.

We’ve been talking about buying a home with 20% down, price range is $800 needing immediate, significant work - $1.2 move-in ready. Annual rate of return is \~2% in our area, and a mortgage of $800k has PITI of $4500 high estimate. Where we hit painpoints is the down payment and post-closing liquidity; if we pay off the loans, we may not have the down payment, and the less liquid we are after the sale can impact the size of the mortgage.

EDIT: corrected mortgage info. It's not LTV, it's post-closing liquidity that we would have to protect.

We're debating what a smart person in our financial position would do regarding a house we just bought. The situation:

* A seller accepted our offer on a house costing roughly $400k, property tax is about $7000/year
* We could pay anywhere from 20-45% down, and still have a good cash cushion (1 year unemployed each); we also have $800-900k in various investments (401k, IRA, Roth IRA, stocks)
* The interest rate would be 2.5% for 15 year, or 3% for 30 year
* I plan to stay at this house longterm (but who knows what the future brings)
* I also want to do some renovations (solar, skylights, 1 bathroom). \[as an aside, the solar, I understand has a more generous tax credit this year vs next. The solar index is 90, so lots of sun availability and would allegedly pay for itself in 7-8 years.\]

Given the situation, what would be smart? We keep going back and forth on whether the 15 or 30 puts us in a better position to build wealth, and whether it's smarter to make a larger down payment or the bare minimum.

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin the Solution to America's Problems?#OptOut,"I have taken excerpts from the following link which are relevant to why bitcoin might be the solution to many of America's problems. 

TLDR: We, the 99%, do not fairly share in the fruits of our labor, yet we are consistently forced to bear the burden of corporate and institutional shortsightedness, greed, gambling and failure.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenLetters/comments/h9ofta/dear\_99/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenLetters/comments/h9ofta/dear_99/) 

A light has been shined on the American police problem, but it is just the tip of the iceberg in what are numerous deeply rooted issues concealing entrenched, multifaceted systems of oppression meant to indiscriminately maintain the status quo over the 99% regardless of skin pigment. 

\-End the Fed: The Federal Reserve (The Fed) is America’s central bank with questionable oversight whose name is derived to invoke and imply authority of the federal government and therefore (at least nominally) accountability to, the American people. On paper, the Fed answers to congress, which in a perfect world would be a representative body, of the people and for the people, this is not the case. Educate yourselves on the Federal Reserve and its role in previous greed driven economic catastrophes. End the Fed, stop feeding the oligarchs and the connected cronies they implant into the systems, corporations, and banks which directly benefit from the money these crooks print out of thin air at our expense. Financial institutions need more oversight, and we should be searching for solutions or alternatives. Perhaps we should gradually #OptOut. 

\-Banks and Lending Practices: The US banking system operates on a fractional reserve system. This requires banks to keep only a tiny fraction of the money they lend on reserve, the rest of which they may loan out and charge interest on. Banks literally make money using our money, and still assess overdraft fees and monthly maintenance fees from those who barely have enough to get by as it is (and who cannot afford maintaining minimum balances as they do not possess regular income, or are busy living paycheck to paycheck). These fees might as well be called “poor taxes” as it appears being poor is expensive. We should all vote with our money by removing it from these banks and only doing business with less greedy fee free credit unions. Historically, the banking/financing sector has been racist and biased in their distribution of opportunity to the public favoring the rich living in better neighborhoods. This is a problem, how can historically disadvantaged people for example, raise capital to start businesses, obtain reliable transportation, buy houses in better neighborhood so that their children might benefit from better education all when they are caught in the cycle of poverty (or worse yet, also affected by blatant or backdoor racism)? Socioeconomically induced inequitable access to opportunity is a massive problem in the United States and this affects the 99%, including the middle class. The richer the family you are born into, the higher the quality of education you are likely to receive, the more connected you are, the more access to resources and support for stepping into the world “on the right foot”, obtaining stable income, building/maintaining a higher credit scores which translates to lower interest rates, and in general, better opportunities. From a purely business standpoint, it is then quite understandable that banks would want to obtain the business of these less risky, rich desirables while treating others as low priority clientele (likely with algorithms to “justify” doing so). The terms of credit lines and loans extended to those from disadvantaged communities should be examined (e.g. payday loan offices that plague these communities – or credit cards with outrageous APRs awarded to those from these communities lacking the education to use them wisely leading to the destruction of their credit scores and therefore justification from banks to deny opportunity to these individuals later in life thereby inhibiting class mobility). Lenders and banks have gamed and weaponized their monetary instruments (e.g. predatory credit cards and loans) against disadvantaged communities by enabling the less financially literate to dig themselves into financial holes from which they may never recover; this is a herding mechanism which relegates and confines the disadvantaged to certain neighborhoods (further perpetuating the cycle of poverty). 

Oligarchs, their cronies, financial institutions and the corporations they control have perverted the once great concept of the “invisible hand”. They intervene in our democratic processes to further self-interests at the expense of the public benefit. We are living in a system that gives us the illusion – or semblance, if we are lucky – of justice, opportunity, class mobility, and the “American Dream”. While some of these are achievable through mountainous effort, the struggle in achieving these are unbalanced depending on factors that should be inconsequential such as skin pigment, zip code of birth, and social connectedness. These coercive instruments of oppression propagated throughout our engineered society have kept us busy keeping each other compliant, fighting amongst ourselves over scraps – and promotions, grinding for our next paycheck and inhibiting our drive for vindicated civil disobedience – lest we go hungry or homeless, and have placated us with bread and games to shroud the connected few who rob us through the camouflaged systems they proliferate. We are attempting to climb an ever-growing cliff where the rich have reached the top, raised the ladders, and continue pouring grease along the slopes. Main street is not wall street. Greed has severed the relationship between market performance, our country’s production, and the average American’s plight. The rich get richer by, among other things, their ease of access to newly printed money (debt) before the wider population increasing their purchasing power before inflation takes hold, allowing them to purchase and accumulate stocks and assets at a discount (Cantillon Effect) – further increasing their political influence which they use to further self-serving interests. This has resulted in a financial and social bubble that is bound to burst violently without intervention. 

We, the 99%, do not fairly share in the fruits of our labor, yet we are consistently forced to bear the burden of corporate and institutional shortsightedness, greed, gambling and failure. 

The 1% have their perverted hands wrapped around our necks. We can’t breathe.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,USPS Lost My State and Federal Amended Tax Return,"TLDR:

I shipped out both of my federal and California amended tax return packages with checks to Fresno and Sacramento on May 11th, 2020. The status of both the tracking stopped updating in late May, making me suspect that USPS either lost the items or failed to scan. I have checked the latest IRS and State amended tax return status and they still have yet to process. What can I do next? ;

Detail:

After filing my 2019 tax returns in March 2020, I realized that I forgot to include my high-yield saving account's dividend form. So I updated my information in TurboTax and followed the instruction to mail out my federal and state amended return PLUS my Form 8606 for backdoor IRA.  I shipped out both of my federal (\~$100) and California ($30) amended tax return packages with checks to Fresno and Sacramento on May 11th, 2020 through USPS Priority Mail. These returns include 1040x and 540NR on my missing dividend document and Form 8606. 

Both packages not only did not arrive  within 3-5days of shipment, but have their latest status update more than one week later showing that they departed regional facility (Sacramento and Fresno) but continue to stay stuck ""In Transit to Next Facility"". I have submitted a case through USPS for each package which is shown online that a representative will get back to me within 2-3 days. After a week, I called USPS customer care support on June 9th, 2020 and the gentleman told me that he has marked these two shipments as critical and said they will likely arrive before someone get back to me. Today, June 15th, 2020, I called again and the lady told me that the regional facility closed my cases without getting back to me for the second time...so she will help open the cases up again. Following her instruction, I also just filed an insurance claim and ""finding missing item"" claim on USPS website for both of my items.

I saw from my bank account that $30 was checked out saying ""Deposit Only CA ST Treas. FTB, Absence of Prior Endorse. Guar."" So I am assuming that my state return is received but USPS failed to scan. However, for my $100, IRS still shows that the amended tax returns have yet to be processed although they should be supposedly after 3 weeks from shipment date. My concern is that my sensitive and personal information and a $100 check is out there somewhere.

Question:

Should I wait longer like \~16 weeks for IRS to confirm amended federal tax return before mailing another package with a check again or is there a way to ask my bank to deny any farther check cashout of the $100 in case someone else got the package and mail another copy of 1040x+check to IRS again?",finance

personalfinance,Can I pay off an undergraduate student loan with a graduate student loan?,"I'm currently in graduate school. I don't need any student loans to fund my current schooling or living expenses and haven't taken any so far. I've been making monthly payments on my undergraduate student loans (&gt;$50k), even though they are in deferment as I am a full time student. I expect to be in graduate school for at least another two years.

I saw that the new federal student loans for graduate students have interest rates as low as 4.5%. Many of my undergraduate loans are at 6.8%. Is there anything stopping me from getting a graduate school student loan with a low interest rate and using it to immediately pay off my undergraduate loans? They way I see it, this would be effectively refinancing for a lower interest rate while keeping everything with the federal government so that I'm still eligible for PSLF in the future.

IRAs: None of us contribute to this yet  
Income: Married, our MAGI is $220k  
Location: Currently living and looking to buy in Seattle, WA. Home will be around $530k, probably taking out a Conventional loan from Navy Federal of $510k (just below their jumbo tier) and putting 5% down (No PMI necessary with them), total monthly payment should be about $2.5k.  
Rent: Currently pay $3.2k in rent split between the 2 of us (I know, believe me.) **Please don't recommend renting a cheaper place in the mean time as an option. Consider this a fixed variable, if you will.**

Budget: With our current budget, we have \~$5k left to play with every month.

While the PF wiki clearly states contributing to our IRAs should be our priority, i figured our situation might warrant a different answer giving how much we're currently spending on rent.   
1. On one hand, we could invest that monthly $5k into a three-fund portfolio with Vanguard and have enough for a down payment+closing+lender fees in a years time. This would allow us to lower our rent by \~$700 a month and start building equity on a property. THEN move on to our IRAs.   
2. On the other hand, we could be maxing out or Roth IRAs using the backdoor method then contributing whatever remains into our individual investment fund towards our home, building the capital for the down payment + fees at a much slower rate.

Bitcoin,Welcome to Freetown,"It started with a sign. It stood at the entrance of the small community simple but clear:

**Welcome to Freetown.**

**Enter only if you respect the Life, Liberty and Property of all here.**

**Murderers, thieves and tyrants will be shot.**

The message was a practical one, not inspired by history or ideology but by clarity of purpose. It enumerated the things that would be defended with deadly force and warned away those that would harm them. As time went by and neighbours from time to time suggested alterations or additions to the sign it was always argued that brevity had power. It was unnecessary to explain in detail all the different types of property owned in the community and how it could be destroyed or stolen. It was understood by all what harm to life meant, what need was there to specify differences in degree between murder and assault. Liberty being a more philosophical concept was always harder to define, but all agreed that a good rule of thumb was that if someone came around telling anybody what to do with their property or their life shouldn’t be welcomed and, if telling escalated to threats or orders should promptly be shown the door. 

In any case even given the small number of neighbours at the time there was never unanimity to change it. If it’s difficult to get a handful of people to agree to anything, it could only get harder as their number grew. Certainly many would have liked to add more rules. Most in the community were Christian and wouldn’t have looked askance at the ten commandments… but freedom of religion seemed to most an important part of Liberty. Remembering the Sabbath, honouring your parents and not coveting could surely be left to individual consciences, whereas stealing and killing were pretty clearly community problems.  So after many arguments **Life**, **Liberty** and **Property** remained as the common denominators.

In time it grew to be a social contract of sorts, first in an unspoken, implicit way, but later it was written in the rules of the homeowners association which all new buyers and builders had to sign. So in many ways it was far more real a social contract and far more binding an agreement than any constitution ever approved by “*representatives*” but never actually accepted by the people, never mind *all* the people. 

The sign also had a selective effect on new residents. Some did not like the idea of violence, even defensive violence and would rather not buy a house or live in a place that so overtly threatened. The idea of many of your neighbours being armed simply did not appeal to many. Others did not believe in private property, but those that would have unlawfully occupied empty houses thought twice when they saw the sign and headed for easier pickings. Of course there are plenty of rich communists and their lack of respect for private property never stopped them from personally owning it... but this was no luxury community, at least when it started, so politicians and bureaucrats were rare.

The first big change came in the police strike and riots. As cops were increasingly paid less, later and in depreciating currency they started to protest more, work less and turn back to some old ways of extortion. Mostly they just did not answer calls, but sometimes when they did they were expensive and less than helpful. So the community was quick to become self-reliant for protection, hiring a private guard for the main entrance and quickly coordinating a group of armed neighbours as backup should it be needed. When the first riots came more than a dozen neighbours stood behind the guard with enough weaponry in plain sight to deter anything short of an army. So the looting passed them by. Car burnings, break-ins, assaults and all types of chaos and vandalism happened in nearby neighbourhoods. The police were busy protesting for back pay. People took note. Similar signs started going up in many communities that had seen the difference between trusting authority and trusting your neighbours. One neighbourhood that actually shared the main road and access, simply asked to merge. Over the years the community would grow to ten times its size. However that was dwarfed by how far its example reached as thousands of neighbourhoods followed it. Actually the neighbours simply could not tell if they were being emulated… or if other people had just followed their own logic and reached similar common sense solutions to simple problems.

The second big change came with the banking crisis. As savings were wiped out first by deflation then by inflation the community, just as the rest of the country, had to start saving again from almost nothing. This time they would not make the same mistake again, they would not work tirelessly for years while trusting the government and banks to secure the currency and their savings. They began to use Bitcoin and physical gold for their savings so that they could be personally responsible for the security of their wealth. They discovered another advantage of personal responsibility: privacy. Eventually most trade was done in hard assets and again the example spread far. Government money, fiat money was only used to pay government services… and as the first depreciated the second kept losing quality. “*Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s*” well fiat money most definitely belonged to the government and they were welcome to have it. 

Some attempts were made by tax collectors to exact payments in hard assets and in some places they were allowed to do so. Others resisted with more or less force. Soon they learned which places to avoid for fear of tarring and feathering, or worse. Anyone who wanted to keep their property from the hands of the ever more rapacious and bankrupt government also learnt the lesson: keep your real assets in a Free Zone or lose them. It’s not that the government couldn’t muster, if pressed, the force to enter the a Free Zone and loot… but it was rare for a reason: Agents were unwilling to take risks for the meager pay they were receiving so the only way to make it worth their while was to let them share in the spoils. Any illusions that they were law enforcers went out the window after the first few times that happened. Honest cops quit. The ones still willing to loot were viewed by most citizens as what they were, a violent gang. They were too few and too cowardly to face any resistance.

Police reform would come too late. Private security backed by citizen militias would prove cheaper both in peaceful and violent times, as well as far more respectful of the **Life**, **Liberty** and **Property** of its customers. 

Tax income withered. The death spiral was too fast and paralysing for the government to stop. The government would continue to pretend to offer services and a few people would pretend to pay for them. It would become obvious that there was nothing magical about a monopolistic administration that allowed it to build roads or schools more efficiently than local institutions, companies or communities. In fact it was hard to imagine how anybody had thought that the monopoly could ever do so with better quality than what consumers could expect from competing providers.

Some people rejected this way of doing things and formed their own socialistic communes, syndicates and associations. Many saw a kibbutz revival in the making. Did people in the Free zones object? No. Live and let live. If they want communal property they were welcome to share theirs… as long as they did not try to take ours. Unsurprisingly most people preferred not to live in a commune.

Localism, self-reliance and secure property rights eventually brought unprecedented prosperity, well-being and progress. But that was later, after we survived the invasion...",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Does an investment property make sense for me,"Hello /r/personalfinance . Throwaway account because the personal info may likely give away my main account. I'm in an interesting predicament and was thinking of ways to use it to my advantage. I am currently a pilot living in Georgia but commuting to work in Las Vegas. This means I spend roughly half of my time there. At this rate it involves spending $500-1000 /mo in hotel rooms since my company does not do overnight trips: we always come back to Vegas at the end of the day. I could get a crash pad for about $300 /mo sleeping with 2 other guys in a room, but since I'm not a college student anymore and with this whole virus thing, I would like to avoid that solution. I can also rent a single room for about $500 /mo. This got me thinking: there are plenty of condos around in the $100-150k range for a 2BD. I could buy one, live there while I'm in town, and when this commuting situation is over in a couple of years (hopefully) I would have a rental property. I can most likely put between 20 and 50% down to keep payments in the range of what I'm already spending and have the ability to pay it off quickly. The low interest rates also make this enticing. My only concern is that I just closed on my primary residence in GA and that is my first experience with home ownership. Would I be spreading myself too thin or taking on too much risk? For numbers:  
  
  
Income: $90-110k/yr depending how much I fly. The lower number is a minimum guarantee. My fiancee that lives with me earns about $60k. I also do between $20-30k extra per year from flying on the side.   
  
Debt: only my current mortgage. $450k property on which I owe about $350K remaining at 3%. Split 50/50 with my fiancee.

Savings: i put 8% in a 401k with a 5% company match. SO puts 5% in a roth IRA. I started a roth IRA as well last year, put in $6k last year, and plan to max it out this year too. We also have a $20k emergency fund because aviation is cyclical and I'm paranoid, but fingers crossed I might just survive this downturn as things are starting to pick up and my company's outlook is positive. The potential downpayment would not come from this emergency fund.

stocks,I've lost everything (and then some) - How should I proceed?,"Hello!,

I'm new to variable income, I've started 3 months ago and was doing well, managed to get from 6k to 9k in that time. I'm not american, so this isn't on NYSE.

Recently, I've been exclusively doing day trade with options contracts, wich leads to my doom and hence the title.

Yesterday, I've put everything I have (and some more) on PUT options (on the same company). Yes, I know this is INCREDIBLY dumb, It's been a really though time in my life, I'm very distracted, having ansiety crisis and doing bad calls in general. I know of my extremely stupid mistake, please don't kick a man when he's down, I've learned my lesson.

For a more practical explanation, I've bought 19.000 PUT options at 0.72. Then, the Fed made that unexpected (for me at least) announcement reverting the free fall situation my local stock exchange was in, and shafting me. I've ignored the basics, like a true genius, and did not put stops. Now, it's worth 0.34. The put expires on the 20 of July.

I've borrowed money from my parents, basically in tears, like a professional trader. Now I'm completely lost to what to do.

After this long winded exposition, I'll would like to ask for help about how to proceed, what people with common sense and experience think about this, because I'm in no mental situation to do anything right.

Should I sell everything now while it's still worth something, or just wait and pray for the market to fall in this 1 month I have? At this moment, the paper would need to fall from $21,64 to \~$19,80 for me to break even.

I know how things work, you guys can't see the future and take decisions for me, but I would like to hear what you have to say, please. Also, I know I've made a huge mistake and this is all my fault, so keep civil, please.

Thanks for any input, it's really apreciated.

\---- Edit:

Thank you guys for all the advices and support, your comments made me think clearly again and put my head back in place.

This is a dumb novice mistake, I literally lost everything I've saved up, but this isn't the end of the world, it's not a lot of money and I'm just starting, plenty of time to make it up. People had it way worse and aren't making a big deal out of it.

I'm new to this, a string of good calls made me complacent and I took bigger risks, I thought I was prepared to take a loss, it's clear I wasn't. This is a lesson learned, I wont make the same mistake again.

The market actually reverted a little bit, the ticker for my put went from +5.5% to +2.8% and it's still falling, from $0.32, my options are now trading for $0.40. I'll keep watching and when the trend reverses, I'll sell a majority of my options. I'm thinking of keeping a token ammount (some 20%) since the options only expire in one month.

My sincere thanks to everyone, your comments and advices really helped me.

algorand,"Algorand [ALGO] vs Cardano [ADA] - Difference, Partnerships &amp; Ecosystem - Which is Better?","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pdt01cdmj9551.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e6d140a68eb2f3a3380175c2869c415b5014da

 

## Introduction

The ‘Trilemma’ of Blockchain space  - Scalability, Security, and Decentralization - are the three things every blockchain is trying to solve simultaneously. But it’s easier said than done, as proven by the scalability issue faced by Ethereum. Higher scalability transcends to higher market adoption.

This is where Cardano and Algorand have come into the picture. They have their similarities and differences that seem to work for them for now. Rather than telling you which one has more potential, it’s better to present the entire case and let you decide how they fare against each other.

## Star Player of the Team

Anyone would agree that having a renowned and accomplished team player always gives a boost to the project. 

### Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson

If the name seems familiar, that’s because he is also the co-founder of Ethereum. A tech entrepreneur and mathematician with an interest in analytic number theory, Charles Hoskinson moved into blockchain space in 2013. He co-developed the Ethereum blockchain with Vitalik Buterin before leaving the project in June 2014. 

Hoskinson joined crypto and blockchain research firm IOHK to develop Cardano and since then has sponsored various blockchain research labs at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Edinburgh. He also founded Invictus Innovations.

Hoskinson was the founding chairman of the education committee of the Bitcoin Foundation and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. His current focus lies in educating people on the use of crypto and decentralization. 

### Algorand’s Silvio Micali

Unlike the innovators of other blockchain projects, Silvio Micali is already a famous name in cryptography long before he started developing Algorand. Deemed as one of the top cryptographers, he is a recipient of the prestigious Turing Award in 2012 and RSA prize for cryptography, Gödel Prize (theoretical computer science) in 1993, and ACM fellowship in 2017.

Micali’s work spans around public-key cryptosystems, pseudorandom functions, digital signatures, oblivious transfer, and secure multi-party computation among others. In 1989, he co-invented Zero-Knowledge Proofs with Shafi Goldwasser and Charles Rackoff. He also developed Peppercoin, a cryptographic system for processing micropayments.

A professor at MIT’s electrical engineering and computer science department since 1983, Silvio Micali is also working as a computer scientist at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. His doctoral students include Shai Halevi, Mihir Bellare, Rafail Ostrovsky, Bonnie Berger, Rafael Pass, Chris Peikert, and Phillip Rogaway - each renowned in their respective fields.

## Project Partners and Collaborators

For any business, partnerships and collaborations are the most important aspect since they drive growth and innovation.

### Cardano Partnerships

Cardano has formed 17 partnerships so far that either enhance its capabilities or grow its business. 

* **Metaps Plus:** To integrate the ADA coins into the MeTaps Plus, South Korea’s one of the largest mobile payment platforms. 
* **IBM Research:** For a software distribution project commissioned by the European Union.
* **PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC):** To develop a new commercial strategy, probably to bring enterprise users to Cardano.
* **New Balance:** All customers can authenticate the footwear purchases on the Cardano blockchain.
* **SIRIN LABS:** To integrate the Cardano blockchain in their blockchain smartphone FINNEY and its SIRIN OS.
* **Konfidio:** To drive the adoption of the blockchain business model platform among corporations and governments.
* **Algoz:**  To offer liquidity solutions and trading solutions for its native ADA token.
* **Priviledge:** To study and publish decentralized software updates  Priviledge is a consortium of renowned companies and scientific universities with the European Union. 
* **South Korea Government-Approved Trade Associations:**Signed two MoUs with Korea Mobile Game Association (KMGA) and Korea Blockchain Contents Association (KBCCA) to implement Cardano for Korean mobile gaming and digital content.
* **Ethiopian Government:** To develop a new digital payment system and combine it with identity cards using its Atala blockchain framework.
* **Georgian Government:** Signed MoU to implement Cardano blockchain-enabled projects across education, business,  and government services.

Cardano’s other major partnership includes Z/Yen Group’s Distributed Futures practice, COTI Network, and Ellipal Hardware.

### Algorand Partnerships

Algorand’s innovativeness and potential to be the blockchain leader has helped it bag a plethora of valuable partnerships across the world. Here are a few partnerships out of the 17 - 

* **International Blockchain Monetary Reserve (IBMR):** To launch the Southeast Asia Microfinance Platform and create a stablecoin called Asia Reserve Currency Coin (ARCC) to encourage financial inclusion in Southeast Asia.
* **SFB Technologies:** To build the infrastructure to create a CBDC (central bank digital currency) dubbed ‘SOV’ for the Marshall Islands. 
* **Meld:** To tokenize gold and track it over the supply chain using stablecoin for the Australian gold industry.
* **Caratan:** To build financial tools and products to promote Fintech adoption at an institutional level.
* **Italian Society of Authors and Publishers (SIAE):** To develop copyright management tools and services.
* **DUST Identity:** To authenticate physical objects and validate transactions over the blockchain.
* **AssetBlock:** A real estate startup launched its tokenized property investment platform on Algorand
* **PlanetWatch:** Focused on environmental monitoring, the first ""CERN Spin-off "" labeled organization is building the world's first immutable air quality ledger on the Algorand blockchain using IoT technologies.

Other major partnerships include World Chess - the commercial arm of the World Chess Federation, Big Data company Syncsort, and Tether.

## Consensus Algorithm

Both Cardano and Algorand use PoS or Proof of Stake consensus mechanism at their heart, but that’s where the similarity ends. Each of them has its own spin to it. 

In the PoS mechanism, a person can validate a block depending on how many stakes or coins he holds. The stake quantity determines the amount of mining power one has. So how does each of them differ?

### Cardano

Cardano’s version is called Ouroboros PoS. 

* Cardano allows stakeholders to pool their resources together in a single ‘stake pool’, thus delegating their stakes to the pool. This is because every elected stakeholder may not have the expertise to create blocks.
* The physical timeline is divided into small blocks called ‘epochs’ that are made up of fixed slots. These epochs are cyclic.
* Each such epoch consists of a set of pooled stakeholders. 
* While the endorsers are elected depending on the weight of the number of stakes held by them, a slot leader (for every epoch) is randomly chosen by a digital coin toss among stakeholders. When the endorsers approve the blocks produced by slot leaders, it gets added to the blockchain. 
* The slot leader also selects the slot leader for the next epoch through the ‘coin toss’. 
* Note that having a higher stake increases the probability of getting elected.
* Currently, the list of validators is fixed and the succession is known beforehand.

With the launch of the Shelley mainnet, Cardano plans to remove the above issue. But this will be a hard fork. Here, the community will decide on block validators through staking.

### Algorand

The version Algorand uses is called PPoS (Pure Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism. 

* PPoS randomly selects a token holder as a block producer. 
* The proposed block gets approved by a committee of 1000 randomly selected token owners and then added to the blockchain.
* The algorithm runs a cryptographically verifiable lucky draw over all the accounts to randomly select committee members as well as the block proposer. 
* This means the identities of the participants are unknown until the blocks are added to the chain. 
* This selection does not depend on the stake size of the nodes at all. 
* PPoS runs this lottery process in complete isolation with other nodes in the network. 

The completely randomized election and secret identities of the committee members drastically reduce the chances of any foul playing within the network. As the number of users grows, the network gets stronger and more secure.

Algorand’s PPoS has embraced a more egalitarian ecosystem to negate the wealth gap present in traditional PoS. 

## Handling Scalability

### Cardano

Currently, Cardano offers 50-250 TPS. But with incorporating sharding technology in its Ouroboros Hydra version, the scalability can increase to one million TPS theoretically. The processing speed will increase as more users or nodes join the network.

### Algorand

In Algorand, every lottery takes just a microsecond to run. Since such lotteries run independently of each other, multiple lotteries can run simultaneously. This inherently makes PPoS highly scalable. The mainnet itself has the capability to handle 1000 TPS.

## Conclusion

Both Cardano and Algorand have sound tech and teams that believe in extensive research and meticulously designed products. Having an early start, there’s no denying that Cardano has established itself in a superior position thanks to the technological achievement, consistency, and transparency it has showcased. 

But with Algorand’s ecosystem growing fast, the competition has intensified. Algorand’s aim to bring full transparency, technological innovation, and successful partnerships just within a year have made it a prime challenger to Cardano. 

While referring to Algorand, Cardano chief Hoskinson voiced similar opinion - “... they are another one of the science coins and we all kind of support each other. Even though we get academically competitive, we're able to reference each other's work and learn from each other and grow from each other.”",cryptocurrency

Am I an idiot?,"We've been looking into the numbers about moving in to a 2nd home and renting our current home out before my wife leaves her job to pursue a PhD. Our current house is sub $100k and that is the range we are looking in to moving to as well. Our insurance would drop $100 per year and we can refinance to reduce the interest rate and further reduce costs.

My pay and her school stipend will cover our bills and with our savings and her payout from accumulating comp time from the pandemic response we will have about a year's worth of mortgage payments for our current home. We are also looking to get rid of her car after the mortgage to reduce costs.

We are trying to decide if we want to use a management company which would charge 10% of collected rent. They have given us an estimate that is higher than we expected which our goal was just to break even for now. 

Is it a terrible idea to get a second mortgage right before the main earner leaves their full time job?

personalfinance,Question Regarding Loan Terms,"I am looking over loan terms (for a loan that was just approved by LightStream).  The total loan is for $8k over 2 years (at 5.99% APR).  In the terms sheet, it says that there is no penalty for prepayment of the loan (which is good because I expect to make some early payments and have this loan payed off before 2 yrs).  However, there is another section in the terms sheet which has given me pause, I was hoping some of you could shed some light on this clause...

.......

"" The annual percentage rate may increase by 0.50% during the term of this transaction if your payments are not made through the Automated Payment Option, but it will not increase by more than 0.50%. The increase will take the form of a higher monthly payment amount. For example, if your loan were for $10,000 at 2.29% for 36 months and the rate increased to 2.79%, your regular payments would increase by $2.20 

AUTOMATED PAYMENT OPTION: You have selected the Automated Payment Option. Your selection of this option entitles you to a reduced interest rate for so long as you maintain automated payments. Under this option, we will initiate an automatic transfer of your monthly loan payment each month from your designated checking or savings account. You agree that your failure to initiate the Automated Payment Option prior to your scheduled first Payment Date or your subsequent failure to maintain this Automated Payment Option, for any reason (including, without limitation, if we experience 3 failed attempts to collect any automated payment from your designated checking or savings account), will immediately result in the loss of your reduced interest rate and the non-discounted rate as explained below will apply going forward to this loan.

If you fail to pay or maintain payments via the Automated Payment Option, you agree that the failure will immediately result in a permanent 0.50 percentage point increase in the annual interest rate in effect on your loan. You acknowledge that this non-discounted annual interest rate will result in a higher monthly payment of the remaining unpaid principal fully amortized over the remaining term, applying the non-discounted annual interest rate and using the actuarial method. You further agree that if you cease to maintain Automated Payments, resulting in the non-discounted annual interest rate, you will remit your increased monthly payments to the address that we subsequently designate or our assignee or successor in interest (as applicable) subsequently designates.""

......

Am I correct in my understanding that as long as I meet the monthly payments (including the possibility of prepaying the loan/paying more than monthly minimums), I will not see an increase in the interest percentage?

Hypothetically, I could make the minimum monthly payment on time for say 5 months, and then pay the entirety of the remaining balance off and have no penalty?",finance

personalfinance,How to invest in myself to prepare for dialysis (28 yr old with chronic dx - Lupus Nephritis)?,"I am a 28 year old male and was diagnosed 1.5 years ago with lupus nephritis. Been following the standard treatment with minimal positive results in my labs and amount of protein in my urine. After being in disability and depressed for a year I have been back working for a 1/2 year trying to get control of my life. I am curious how I should prepare financially for my future after reading some studies on lupus nephritis.

**From my research because my GFR is low and my urine protein is high since my biopsy and onward I should expect:**

* \~5-10 years of functioning kidneys until I require dialysis (33-38)
* \~5 years for average wait to receive a kidney transplant (38-43)
* \~1 week to 10 years for the transplant kidney to last (43-53)

It seems my life expectancy is quite wide from any time to \~50-75 years old. With \~3%-25% chances of death at various stages in my life.

**What should I do to prepare myself for the years ahead? Is their any advice you would send to yourself in the past to make your future on dialysis better? Thanks for all your time and any of your feedback!**

**So far I have read about these ideas and would appreciate any further perspective on them.**

* Purchase long term disability insurance
* Plan for FI/RE - Financial independence retire early by saving/investing \~50% of my income so I can afford to retire if I am unable to work due to dialysis
* Reduce the amount of money going into my 401k
* Gain as much health strength and stamina as possible before it becomes significantly more difficult
* Look to shift my career into a field that allows sedentary work even more ideal if it can be done while on dialysis

stocks,The End of Capitalism,"I've posted this topic months ago before, but didn't seem to get any traction. But the signs are showing once again that I'm right. Below is my thesis for the economy collapse that I wrote a year ago,

\-----------------

In my opinion, markets are not cyclical. Markets do not care that it has been 10 years since the last financial crisis. This is a misconception of investors not knowing the difference between correlation and causation. However, people are cyclical. History, no matter how much we study it will always repeat itself. The current status of the financial markets is a perfect example of history repeating itself. Greed will forever dominate the human psyche and drive all actions.

The current markets are plagued by the following factors. CLO’s (Collateralized Loan Obligations), Corporate buybacks, HFT’s, and Chinese foreign investment.

CLO’s are essentially a rebranding of the infamous CDO’s of the ‘08 crash. Except these are not mortgage bonds, but rather corporate bonds. Corporations are selling bonds at attractive interest rates to quickly gain capital to buy back stock. These buybacks are causing a drastic increase in demand in equities. The institutions buying up these bonds are then packaging them just like CDO’s and selling them off again, effectively ridding themselves of the risk. The institutions buying this repackaged corporate debt are largely foreign investors, mainly the Chinese. With the US’ economic prosperity in China, they are continuously chasing yield with their liquid cash. They’ll invest it in corporate bonds and American real estate to prevent their money from falling victim to the devaluing yuan. Similar to pension funds, insurance companies and other yield chasing funds. These entities invest in corporate bonds to reap the reward of the booming US economy without exposing themselves to *measured* risk.

This process will all fall apart once US corporations stop buying back stock to drive equities. When this inevitably happens, they’ll lose the cash flow to pay off the loan payments and default on the loans. This will cause the whole chain to fall apart, causing an equities crash. The Chinese will get scared and sell all of their US real estate holdings, along with dumping every equity with a trace of exposure to the US markets. US investors will panic and sell as soon as this process starts. The high frequency algos will see this sale volume and dump everything, causing possibly the largest flash crash ever seen. Trading will stop and once it resumes it will continue to fall. With many Americans invested in ETF’s tracking the US economy, there will be little to no demand at any price as these equities tumble. The diversity of ETF choices has poised a new problem, there will be no buyers to stop the crash.

My prediction for the catalyst to start this whole process is interest rates. The Fed was never an institution to determine market trajectory. The Fed has become more of a political sentiment indicator that ultimately determines the fate of our economy. The president of the United States has total control over the Fed through fear. Because of this, the proper monetary policy will never be advised. As a result, once the Fed has a change in political alignment, they will raise rates faster than the market can process. Ultimately, leading to the events described above.

There is no promise of when this will happen, nor if it ever will. However, if the catalyst described above does occur, the above events are my prediction for what will follow. As for the purpose of this prediction, there is a perfect opportunity to hedge against this in a more recently created market.

So i'll get right to it. I filed my tax return this year by mail in April 2020. In the big envelope for my federal tax return I put all necessary documentation. My 1040 clearly stated that I am owed $980. I ended up realizing that along with my 1040 I also put a tax worksheet in the big envelope as the last page. This tax worksheet had $95 at the bottom of it. It is clear to me that whoever filed my return must have just went to the last page and wrote down whatever the last number was. Ok, so currently I think I know why the error occurred, but I have no idea how to remedy it. I have been calling the IRS to no avail, since its all automated and when I could possibly get to a real person there is an ""extremely high call volume for the topic I have selected"" and I must ""try again later"".

CryptoMarkets,Moons and Bricks. All you should know about Reddit tokens,"You will know what reward program started on Reddit, what tokens are used there, and how safe and reliable this idea looks.

## What is it and how it works?

On May 14, 2020, the famous Reddit forum started testing the Community Points user reward system for actively commenting and creating publications.

So far, not all sections of the forum (they are called subreddits) are participating in this program, but only two r/CryptoCurrency and r/FortNiteBR.

r/CryptoCurrency tokens are called MOONS, and r/FortNiteBR tokens are called BRICKS (as the name of these subreddits implies, these are the cryptocurrency and game sections of the forum, respectively). Coin management, balance viewing (which will be publicly displayed on the forum) will be performed on the Vault platform and in Reddit's mobile app. You can read more and immediately start your Vault on the official page.

## Is it reliable?

Both tokens are based on the Ethereum platform, the ERC-20 standard (in essence, these are smart contracts). Vault is an Ethereum wallet designed specifically for Reddit users. According to Reddit, the system was tested for cybersecurity by Trail of Bits. The creators also draw attention to the fact that tokens cannot be transferred without a local private key of the user and are at his full disposal.

Until the end of testing, all tokens operate in the Rinkeby test network, and after this, they will be transferred to the Ethereum main network. Testing will last until the end of summer, and the transfer of tokens from the test network to the main one will take place tentatively at the end of 2020.

## How to get and how to spend these coins?

For now, Reddit members can use tokens to vote, encourage content creators, and transfer funds. Tokens are built on ERC-20, so in the future users will be able to transfer funds to other ERC-20 compatible wallets. Since many users do not own cryptocurrencies, the transaction fees (“gas”) will be completely ""on the house"" (i.e. Reddit).

First, it is planned to distribute the first 50 million points based on the Reddit karma system. Then, in the first year, another 50 million points. Gradually, the amount of distributed points will decrease with every distribution round. The distribution will be over when the total sum of points reaches 250 million Community Points.

Also, percentages are provided for Community Points, which will be monthly received by participants for certain merits: moderators get 10%, 20% goes to Reddit itself, 20% is reserved for the community. The rules are written in more detail on the official page of the rewards program.

## How does it go?

Reddit’s co-founder Alexis Ohanian is optimistic about cryptocurrencies and believes that “crypto spring” has come.

According to DappRadar, which shows informative statistics, in the first two weeks since the launch of the rewards program, more than 15 thousand participants conducted more than 18 thousand translations. In total, 15 million tokens circulate in the network. At the same time, the Fortnite gaming community holds 4.5 times more tokens than the cryptocurrency community: 13 thousand vs. almost 2 thousand. 15.3 thousand transfers were made in r/FortNiteBR, and only 3.3 thousand in r/CryptoCurrency.

We think this is due to the fact that gamification (to which this reward program belongs) works better among gamers than among those interested in cryptocurrencies, which are already fed up with an overabundance of different types of tokens.

Analysts note that the crypto community on Reddit has management problems. Even the example of upvotes for posts shows that the most successful content in r/FortNiteBR can gain 20 times more reactions than in inert r/CryptoCurrency (with approximately the same number of users).

## So why should we care about this news?

If it were another forum, information about the launch of tokens would hardly be interesting to anyone. But according to Bloomberg, Reddit has more than 430 million active users per month. And the mentioned subreddits have a total of 2.3 million participants. Therefore, if the project is successfully tested and launched, such a large number of users will provide it with sufficient popularity. Therefore, it is possible to expand and change the scope of new tokens.",cryptocurrency

solarenergy,Learn Solar: Solar Energy Explained,"***This article will give you a basic understanding of solar energy, its history and applications.*** 

# What is Solar Energy?

Solar energy is the energy emitted from the sun (a natural nuclear reactor). Our planet captures more than billions of photons (tiny packets of energy) from the sun every day. These photons determine the climate and support life on earth. 

Two interesting facts about Solar energy,

**1.** *“Our sun emits more energy in one second than the combined consumption of every person who either has lived or is living on earth!”*

***2.*** *“Did you know that less than two hours of sunlight striking our planet can fulfill our electricity needs for an entire year.”*

# History of Solar Energy

From the very beginning, people have been harnessing solar energy by using it to cook food, stay warm or find the way in the darkness. People used simple magnifying glasses to concentrate sunlight into beams so hot they would cause wood to catch fire. In France, over a century ago, a scientist used heat from a solar collector to make steam to drive a steam engine.

Almost 100 years ago, people scientists and engineers began researching ways to use solar energy in earnest. In 1936, Charles Greely Abbot, an American astrophysicist invented a solar boiler. 

In the mid-1950s, Bell Telephone discovered that an element found in the sand called silicon (Si) creates an electric charge when exposed to sunlight. This led to the discovery of solar cells that capture the sun’s energy and convert into electricity.

Among other renewable energies, solar energy has been adopted more quickly. In the U.S alone, there are several state and federal incentives and policies contributing to driving down the cost of solar panels far enough to become more widely consumed. According to the market insights for the year 2019 provided by [**Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)**](https://www.seia.org/us-solar-market-insight), The installed solar photovoltaics capacity in the U.S  can power 13.1 million American homes and this number is expected to double over the next five years. 

# Solar Energy Applications

Applications of solar energy can be classified into three main categories.

* Residential (Homes, Farms, etc.)
* Commercial (Buildings, Industries, etc.)
* Utility (Power Plants etc.)

As you’re aware, solar energy is spread out over a large area and is not constant at any specific area or place at one time. How much solar energy an area receives depends on several conditions which include the time of day, the season of the year, the latitude of the area, and the clearness or cloudiness of the sky. 

A solar collector is like a parked car on a sunny day. As sunlight passes through the car’s glass windows, it is absorbed by the dashboard, seat covers, walls, and floor of the car. The light that is absorbed changes into heat. The car’s closed glass windows let the light in, but don’t let all the heat out. If the car windows are open the heat will more quickly dissipate, but that’s another matter.

From the example above, a solar collector is an object which does three things:

* it allows sunlight inside the glass (or plastic);
* it absorbs the sunlight and changes it into heat;
* it traps most of the heat inside.

Note that all solar technologies used today work on the principle of sunlight collection.

We have classified the applications of solar energy into 2 categories.

1. Solar Space Heating (Thermal Applications)
2. Solar Electricity (Power Applications)

## Solar Space Heating

Space heating means heating the space inside any structure with roof and walls. It could be a house, a shop or a factory, etc. 

There are three types of solar space heating systems. 

1. Passive
2. Active
3. Hybrid (A combination of both passive and active)

### PASSIVE SOLAR SPACE HEATING

In a passive solar building, the whole structure operates as a solar collector (heat absorber) and does not use mechanical or electrical devices. The main design requirements of a passive solar space heating structure are:

* Latitude, sun path, and insolation (sunshine)
* Seasonal variations 

To help you understand better, let us take an example of a passive solar house. It would not have any special mechanical equipment such as pipes, ducts, fans, or pumps to transfer the heat Instead, the house is designed in such as way that it relies on properly positioned windows. Since the sun shines from the south in North America, passive solar structures are built so that most of the windows face south. 

A passive solar house would convert solar energy into heat just as a parked car would. Sunlight passes through a building’s windows and is absorbed in the walls and floors.

To control the amount of heat in a passive solar house, the doors and windows are either closed to let the heated air in or opened to let the air out. 

Usually, at night, passive solar homeowners use heavy curtains or shades by pulling them over their windows to keep the day’s heat inside. 

While in summers, awnings or roof coverings are used to help keep the house cool by shading the windows from the blazing sun.

Most passive homes are located in a quiet and peaceful place. A home heated naturally by warming the walls or floors is more economically beneficial than using mechanical and electrical devices to heat the air inside a house. 

It’s always convenient to use solar energy equipment to make electricity for your house. That way you are both warm and lit up!!!!

After the installation of solar energy equipment, your passive home solar system would now be labeled as a hybrid solar system.  

### ACTIVE SOLAR SPACE HEATING

An active solar building operates on both mechanical equipment and the solar collection (heat absorption) principle. Active solar structures are commonly used at places where solar energy is not sufficient.  

For active systems, special solar collectors that look like boxes covered with glass are used. Dark-colored metal plates inside the boxes absorb the sunlight and change it into heat. You may ask have one observation, why use only dark colors? Well, dark colors especially black absorbs more sunlight than any other light color. 

Depending on the usage, air or a liquid flows through collectors and is warmed by this heat. The warm or heated air or liquid is then distributed to the rest of the house just as it would be with an ordinary furnace system.

Solar collectors are usually placed high on roofs where they can collect the most sunlight. They are also put on the south side of the roof where no tall trees or tall buildings will shade them.

# Storing Solar Heat

Why do you store anything? The answer would be to use it later. The same logic applies here. You need to use an efficient heat storage system to keep yourself warm during nights or on rainy days. Otherwise whats the point of investing money on the solar energy system.

Storing heat is a challenge confronting any solar heating system; whether passive, active, or hybrid. 

In passive solar homes, heat is stored by using dense interior materials (masonry, adobe, concrete, stone, or water) that retain heat well. These materials are good absorbers and retain surplus heat and radiate it back into the house when its dark and cool. Some passive homes may have walls up to one foot thick.

In an active solar home, heat can be stored in two ways

* A large tank to store hot liquid, or
* Rock bins beneath a house to store hot air.

Houses with active or passive solar heating systems may also have a backup system that can be a furnace, wood-burning stove, or another heat source to provide heat in case there is a long period of cold or cloudy weather. 

# Solar Hot Water Heating

Conventional water heating is expensive and is the second leading home energy expense, costing an average family between $350-$800, a year. 

We can always use solar energy to heat our water. Based on your location, family size and water usage habits, a well-maintained and efficient solar water heater (geyser) lasts 15-20 years longer than a conventional water heater and can pay for itself in five or less. 

Note that most solar water heater manufacturers provide excellent warranties and financing plans. 

A solar water heater works on the same principle as solar space heating. A solar collector is mounted on the roof, or in an open area with direct sunlight. It collects sunlight and converts it to heat. When the collector becomes hot enough, a thermostat starts a pump. The pump circulates a fluid, called a heat transfer fluid, through the collector for heating. The heated fluid then goes to a storage tank where it heats water. The hot water may then be piped to a faucet or showerhead. Most solar water heaters that operate in winter use a heat transfer fluid, similar to antifreeze, that will not freeze when the weather turns cold.

Taking advantage of the latest advancements in solar technology, residential and commercial property owners based on their location can either install solar water heating systems (geysers) or design their buildings with solar heating.

Today over 1.5 million homes in the U.S. use solar heaters to heat water for their homes or swimming pools.

# Solar Electricity

Solar energy can be utilized and produced in several ways, the most common of which is with [**photovoltaic panels**](https://energizedpak.com/solar-panel-energy-system/) (also known as solar or Photovoltaic or PV panels) that convert sunlight into electricity. 

There are two main solar electricity systems:

* Photovoltaic Electricity
* Solar Thermal Electricity

## Photovoltaic Electricity

In the mid-1950s, Bell Telephone discovered that an element found in the sand called silicon (Si) creates an electric charge when exposed to sunlight. This led to the discovery of solar cells that capture the sun’s energy and convert into electricity.

Simply put, a solar cell is a semiconductor device made up of wafers of pure silicon (Si) doped with special impurities, which convert sunlight either visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation or infrared (IR) radiation into direct current (DC) by using photovoltaic action of the cell without the use of any moving parts.

Solar cells or PV cells operate according to the photovoltaic effect. Here, *“Photo”* means light and *“Voltaic”* means electricity. They are constructed with a positive and negative layer which together creates an electric field.

Solar panels directly convert sunlight (photons) to electricity (voltage). When sunlight (photons) hits a solar cell, electrons are knocked out of their respective atoms and if conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides of a cell, it forms an electrical circuit. When these electrons flow through an electrical circuit they generate electricity.

Solar or PV solar panels generate direct current (DC) electricity. With DC electricity, electrons are unidirectional and flow in one direction around a circuit. 

## Solar Thermal Electricity

Solar thermal systems use the sun’s heat to make electricity. We’ve discussed a lot about solar thermal heating above, the principle is the same. Solar thermal electricity systems use solar collectors with mirrored surfaces to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver to super-heat a liquid. 

This super-heated liquid makes steam that drives a steam turbine to produce electricity like most conventional power plants.

Solar thermal systems are of three main types: 

**Central Receiver System**

A central receiver system uses large mirrors on top of a high tower to reflect sunlight onto a receiver. This system is also known as a Solar Power Tower.

**Dish-Shaped System**

This system uses a dish-shaped solar collector to collect the sun’s energy. This system resembles a TV satellite dish.

**Trough System**

This system is most promising and uses mirrored troughs to collect sun’s energy.

My 2000 Toyota with 215k miles is finally dead. I have 14k in the bank and I'm receiving $450 from the state of CA and $600 from the federal government from unemployment due to Covid-19. My credit score is \~715. I will return to work in around 2 weeks depending on the status of the mall I work at. I make around 45k per year working in luxury clothing sales.  I initially went to my credit union to apply for a loan but they rejected me because I am currently furloughed. Also, the hard inquiry dinged my credit. Lastly, I need a car for my 45 minute total commute to work. 

Initially, I was considering putting around $8,000 down and financing around $5,000 - $6,000. Without the option to do that through my credit union, here is what else I'm considering:

1. Paying all cash for a used VW 2018 Jetta with \~30,000 miles for around $13,000. This would leave me with very little savings. I do live with my parents though so I'm lucky to not be homeless if I lose my job or get struck by lightning.
2. Trying to get a parent to co-sign with me and seeing if I can get the loan that way.
3. Buy new through dealer financing. I didn't really want to do this as I don't need a new car and I don't want to end up paying $20k when all is said and done for a 2020 VW Jetta.
4. Put the 5-6k on a credit card but I know this is probably very stupid and I just paid off all my cards (yay).

Billionaire Leon Cooperman on Monday said that the emergence of individual investors eagerly scooping up stocks that have been rocked amid the coronavirus-induced downturn will ultimately not end well for those individual investors.

The ‘Robinhood markets are going to end in tears,” said Cooperman during CNBC’s show “Halftime Report” on Monday, referring to the popular online trading platform.

Cooperman referred to a Barron’s article that noted that free trading app Robinhood has added more than three million accounts this year, and now has over 13 million, with a median age of 31.

A number of recent reports attribute the market’s rally since its March 23 low, and its subsequent choppy trading, to an era of zero-commission discount brokerage trades, ushered in by Charles Schwab SCHW, 1.41%, and platforms like Robinhood that cater to younger investors.

Critics like Cooperman say that a dearth of diversions due to COVID-19 lockdowns and unemployment have created a perfect environment for newly minted day traders to wreak havoc on Wall Street.

On Monday, Cooperman pointed to purchases of bankrupt car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, -2.13%, which has drawn feverish buying interest from bargain-hunting investors, even though the company’s bankruptcy means that there is little if any equity value in the enterprise. 

Thus far, mom-and-pop investors have outperformed pros like Cooperman and mutual funds, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs. It’s unclear, however, how long that outperformance will last and to the degree by which individual investors are piling into risky investments with reckless abandonment.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 2.20%, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 2.04% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 1.75% were resuming a rally on Monday after opening sharply lower on the day.

“The gambling casinos are closed and the [Federal Reserve] is promising you free money for the next two years, so let them speculate,” Cooperman said, referring to the central bank’s balance sheet which has ballooned to $7.2 trillion from about $4 trillion at the beginning of March, as it rolls out stimulus measures to limit the damage from the pandemic. The Fed also has held interest rates at a range between 0% and 0.25% and is expected to keep rates around those superlow levels until at least 2022.

“Let them buy and trade. From my experience, this kind of stuff will end in tears,” Cooperman told CNBC.",finance

We both work from home so we want a productive environment to escape to. In addition, we will be using this as a guest house when family come to visit. We might even rent it out on air bnb if we need the extra side cash). TIA!",finance

i recently got him to max out the 401k (he wasnt even doing the matching contribution) and temporarily got him to put his 100k ""emergency"" fund in High yield savings account rather than the .01% it was earning. now he sees that 100k is too much, and wants about 70k to be put to some better use.

some options - can put it towards home equity, but he has a low interest rate \~2.75%. no major debts to pay off. obviously bonds come to mind, but im young and have never really researched that because i do 100% equities. maybe theres a good bond ETF or something else that would yield reliable 4-5%?

personalfinance,With my situation is it reasonable to purchase a NEW car over a USED?,"Hello Everyone!

I need someone to tell me if am being financially reasonable or dumb for leaning towards and justifying in purchasing a NEW car. I am in need of a car for work since my old car with 250K miles finally gave up. This will be my first car purchase (old car was a hand me down/gift from family) and I hope to use it for the next 5-10 years until electric cars become more mainstream. 

**Some Background Information:**

Recent grad, 26yrs old, current annual salary at 60k, and sitting at 300k student debt with 6.7% interest (most of the debt are from student loans for my doctorate degree). I know the loan amount is very high, but I am not too worried since I am expected to earn six-figures after this year of training , and I am okay with living a conservative lifestyle for the years to come. 

**My Reasoning for choosing NEW over USED.**

I am not a big car enthusiast but I do want something reliable for the next 5-10 years, a car with somewhat up to date technology, and I do appreciate cars that has a nice drive feel. 

My current savings is 20k and initially I had a mindset of buying a used car for 12-15k and paying in full (I really do not want to finance a car with interest). 

However, Mazda is currently offering 0% APR for 60months and a deferment in payments for 90days for their new 2020 models. After talking to some dealers I think I can get a new model with a downpayment of $5000, and monthly payments of around $280-290 for 60months.... A total of around 22.5k (including all the fees, titles, etc).. 

By choosing to finance a car with 0%, and potentially opt in for the 90day deferment, I can have more cash now to pay off more of my student loans, and thus pay less compound interest in the long run. Right now the interest rate on my students loans are at %0 due to the COVID pandemic. 

With some basic math calculations, I think in 5yrs (when i finish paying off the new car) the difference in price between buying new over used will only be around 2k-3k---the 13-15k that would be used to buy a used vehicle would not to go my student loans that has interest, and ultimately cost me 3-5k in incurring interest in 5years. I am willing to spend the extra 2-3k for a new car. 

Am I making sense? Are my basic math calculations telling me the truth?? Is the earth flat?????  I test drove the new mazda3 and I loved it... so I admit I am kind of blinded by love. Oh ya I also can afford the monthly payments. Thank you for your time !!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Should I purchase a new vehicle with 60mo payments at 0% APR and an option of a 90day payment deferment (total 22.5k), so I can put more money now on my 300k student loans with 6.7% interest rate? Or should I buy a used 13-15k vehicle that is more within my budget?",finance

investing,The Zero Growth Hypothesis - Is there a legitimate bull case?,"The predominant argument on this thread and a few other financial threads on Reddit has been the classic bull vs bear argument, but what if there is a more likely third outcome.  Zero growth. 

The Fed, unless something dramatically changes, is going to continue to prop up the financial markets through the pandemic.  This should keep most US markets from declining dramatically as we saw in March, and keep the markets afloat through what will continue to be a historically difficult economic time.

The issue, however, is will the markets go up?  And while I doubt there will be a dramatic drop of 40% like we saw in March, I suspect the base case for the stock market over the next 1-2 years is 0% due to uncertainty about the economy and the virus.  Unemployment will remain high for the foreseeable future at levels, quite frankly, none of us have seen in our lifetimes. Due to the downturn, those who are still employed are most likely going to continue to stash cash and decrease spending until the economic and health uncertainty is resolved (Household savings increased to 30% of income in April).  While some travel stocks have neared all-time highs, travel itself has come to a near standstill, which will have ripple effects on growth.  And to cap all of this good news off, stocks are historically overvalued with an S&amp;P Forward PE ratio &gt;20.   

Obviously the other issue is the virus, but what happens there is anyone's guess.  Sure, there will most likely be a vaccine, but most scientists seem to think it will not be widely available until next spring at the earliest. Even assuming the vaccine works, we may still have double-digit employment, making a quick economic bounce back seem unlikely.  Some scientists have pessimistically argued that the vaccine might not even work and that it could take another 2 years before we have a working vaccine.  It is not a done deal that we will get a working vaccine this fall, winter, or next spring, despite how much we want that to be the case and there is still a lot of uncertainty about when the pandemic will finally be over.

Poor economic conditions, uncertainty about the virus, and the Fed's dramatic intervention are leading me towards a hypothesis of zero growth in the stock market over the next 1-2 years.  I guess what I'm wondering is if you're a bull, other than the Fed and feeling a lot of FOMO about missing the dip, what is your case for 7-10% YoY growth?  Why is this more likely than the market flat-lining for the foreseeable future?",finance

economy,Videogame Economy,"***BEFORE YOU READ THIS!*** Please have in mind that this is a working concept and as such, it has flaws, holes and needs tweaking. Be open minded, **bring solutions** not only problems to the table, think ahead.

There is an idea that has been wondering my mind for a while now, and its how *videogame economy* works. Is it possible to take some of its ideas to real life economy? Will it make a good contribution to humanity or will it be its demise? Lets look at its core points:

* There is no inflation, no supply and demand rule.
* Money is created from thin air by the actions of its character (much like banks create cash through loans; remember the ""action from character"" phrase because it will be represented later on this post)
* Everyone should have equal chances to earn money/coins through effort and work, regardless of social status.
* It's basically digital, as characters don´t really carry cash paper around, with almost limitless amounts on their pockets.
* Revolves around a descentralized system.

Does some of this sound familiar? Maybe they do. There are many issues with applying this kind of system in the real world, so lets make an example to make it easier to understand it. We have this imaginary country called ""***Weland***"", in which they have opted to place a new economy system that required many changes on their *government, bank system and public/private businesses*. Some of them are the following, which will be later explained their reason to be:

* Abolition of paper cash, as money will be handled digitally through a new ID for its citizens.
* The new ID which will contain a QR code, bar code, serial number, nfc, and will provide instant access through a slip and optional security measures (such as fingerprint, passcode or password which will be done through a hardware present). This new ID will give access to the persons ""cash"", bank accounts and function as a credit/debid card by a single touch decided by the person at the moment of payout, it will unify ID with license ID as with itself it can prove on the ""online system"" that its license is active and for the respective vehicle, personal information like type of blood, personal address, nationality and last residence given. It may also include more options later.
* Digital personal page hosted by the government where the citizen can enter and view its ""activated"" features on the ID, for example the status of his license and when does it expire, the connected bank accounts and brief data (they can use the banks personal app to view their information and pay bills, exactly the ones we have now as this will only mean to have it all in one seemingless ecosystem), its personal information of phone #s, addresses, etc.
* Essential jobs will have a payout equivalent to the fair minimum wage and an increase over time by experience and education. All medical personal (doctors, nurses, all hospitals, medical centers, medical related facilities), mental health (psychologists, psychiatrists), educators (teachers and everyone involved in education by kinders, schools, high schools, univeristies and colleges), will be free for the population and will remain as a basic right for them to have at no expense at all. Their salary will be given by the government in the amount that is fair and equivalent of their profession, time worked and specialization. It is safe to say that they will earn a good salary based on their careers and education. This basically means **free education and free health system**.
* Digital elections for the government officials to ensure 0 corruption and fake votes, through a series of validation by ID, passcode or password, optional fingerprint, etc. This will allow to have real time **LIVE** counts for the votes in every location.

This are the **basic changes** that must occur, but there are a lot more as we will dive right now. The new economy will be as follows:

**First degree** \- ""All public office jobs, public companies and state owned businesses, organizations and enterprises will have its workers salary, capital for proyects, investments, constructions and expansions money be created from nothing, through a digital system. This system will be precise, as its digital and everything will be paid through the ID and Bank System, every flow in or out of cash will be registered. Which means that salary will be just, the investment money needed will be accurate and no single bill will be stolen in corruption or theft from its work force. Every penny that is used will be of public knowledge with complete **TRANSPARENCY**, with every payroll for every worker respecting their personal information as will be coded, but their job position name and salary, duties and responsabilities will be public on our webiste. There is no single bill that is used which will be left unnoticed, as its digital its an automatic calculation that will be uploaded live to the website.""

**Second degree** \- ""The private sector will be legally required to function through a similar online accounting system that will detail only the job position name, duties and responsabilities to protect the persons private information. Even so, every job position that has a payroll must be placed, every cost and investment made so that way there is **COMPLETE** transparency and wages **REFLECT** what is fair and just to every employee. If the private company may it be small or big can't afford to pay the full salary to an employee for a justifiable reason, the government through the economy department will intervine to help the private company pay said salary by giving them the remaining amount that they can´t cover for a limited amount of time until they can recover and paid it in full themselves. Have in mind that this is not a loan, it will not need to be given back or paid back with any kind of interest, and it will only apply if its justifiable and the company can prove its need for it. Adding to this, there will be a minimum wage that will be digitally calculated by the city, state and country balance of quality of life and basic expenses to ensure all basic needs. This minimum wage will **NOT ONLY** be for workers, but for **ALL** higher ranking positions all the way to chairman, president, owner and investors of any private or public company may it be big or small. A higher ranking position like manager or president can´t have its ""**minimum wage**"" higher than a basic operation agent if the latter has not reached its minimum wage. This means that everyone will need to cover its minimum wage first, before paying a much higher salary to another position. We pretend to avoid and immense void in salary from managers and chairmans that sometimes earn monthly wages of over tenths and hundreds of thousands when an operator works under a minimum wage, as this is unfair. Hence, the need to digitally account for every penny spent, avoiding ""overestimated proyects and products bought to slash some of this cash for a few"", working on the fairness.""

**Third degree** \- ""Banks will need to adopt their accounts with a secure connection to the government website to reflect the amount of cash the citizen has, as no paper cash will exist, only transactions with the ID will be possible. Banks can keep their loan systems, interest rates and promotions but take into account that the rates, requirements and general economy will drastically change with the implementation of the economic system. This will mean a change in policies and interest rates, loan specifications and more. **NO MORE** credit or debit cards will be created, as they will fall into a verification system througth the ID.""

**Fourth degree** \- ""Every small, medium or big business will have payments and transactions through their online methods or with the ID on site for customers. As the ID´s will be full of functions to work with bar codes, QR codes, NFC and serial numbers, there will be plenty and vast options to take in payments for each and every type or size of business. With a single app, businesses can use their phones, tablets, computers or else, as a method of receiving a payment from customers. The idea behind this is to fight climate change and pollution by the removal of paper cash, the difficulties and disadvantages of having paper cash that can be lost, needs to be manually counted, can be easily stolen and my be damaged making it unusable. Digital cash avoids all this and represents a huge leap into transparency and digital accounting, making it everything easier. The current state of technology, internet availability and mobile devices expansion makes this a plausible reality.""

**Fifth degree** \- ""The Weland international economy of its virtual coin on pair with the dollar, euro, pound, etc, will be the biggest limitation of itself, but the biggest opportunity too. Its value needs to be consistent, as no country has the measures to produce and use each and every piece of techonology, food or wearable needed to sustain an economy and a population. There will always be the need to import goods and services, thus the value of the virtual coin of Weland has to be valuable and not be completely worthless to buy imports. The proposed measure is that the direct value of its coin is a direct product of its export. Meaning that the goods and services Weland exports will be valued on the international market price. Example: If Weland produces **100k of mangoes** that will be sold internationally as export for **10 million** dollars, then the capital of the country to import will directly be 10 million dollars as well. This 10 million dollar capital will be distributed for import from the most basic resources needed, for example 6 million dollars invested in buying prime materials and essentials, the other 4 million dollars will be distributed evenly for the citizens to buy internationally at the fair value that represents the price in dollars. The clear disadvantage is that the amount of income by export may it be of public or private industry will have to be greater thatn the import and the online internet purchases made by regular citizens."" Lets consider now the following **benefits**:

* The immediate need to **invest** in factories for goods essential and non essential for citizens and to export, food industry and farming to feed the citizens and to export, and so on. This will mean an explosion of investments and creation of jobs, more advanced, efficient, green substainable and larger scale farming, factories for cloth, shoes, gadgets, electronics, construction and more. Weland must become a highly productive and export based country that can fit its own needs. This will be supported by the new economy where money is created from thin air to invest in what really matters.
* A very **generous law** that will be incentive for growth, farming, industry and jobs related to the essential consumption of goods for the citizens and for export. This will be handled on a fair interest and range from banks and the government itself, approved by the citizens in consensus.

There are many flaws and disadvantages of this economy system, so lets review some ideas to make it more plausible.

* ***Radical government changes***. All government office jobs must undergo a strict, objective and efficient procedure to be hired, even the president. Every office job will required that the person who is applying fits the curriculum. Example: The minister of health must be a recognized and experienced doctor, the minister of economy must be an experienced economist, and so forth. All positions must undergo series of tests going from psicometric tests, general knowledge test of the country and if specified the city they will be congressman, ability and skill tests depending on the context and interviews that will be broadcasted live. After they pass all the general tests required, they will be chosen by votes by the population. Have in mind that there will not be any political parties, there will only be professionals with the experience and capacity to fit the role, as this is not a popularity contest like current government elections but a systematic, objective and efficient approach to choose the most qualified person for the job. Every candidate must present a monthly, quarterly, annualy and a full 4 year plan to execute on their job post and they need to fully present it on interview and on public record.
* ***Monthly, quaterly and annual reports*** by every government job that must work for the community, the city, the state or the country. To have a good perspective of this, there will be a mobile app and a website where congressmen, ministers, vice president and the president must legally report their progress and results of the work they have beeing doing, a work report. Depending on the post, the citizens will have a certain period of time to vote in favor or against the ideas and projects posted by the government officials, and will rate and vote if said worker must still be in their office post if they deem effective and productive. If they don´t, depending on the job post they can vote in two to three stages to remove said official and hire a new one. This is not a coup nor an impeachment, this is just a logic decision if a worker is not meeting the goals and fitting the role, like any other enterprise and the bosses are the citizens which choose the official, pay the taxes that pay their salaries and are entitled to decide if keeping them or not. This will be a rotation job every 4 years. The purpose of this is to have the most efficient, effective and government that will bring up the country of Weland and develop it to its fullest.
* An ***immediate need to invest in renewable resources*** for energy, as the country of Weland will target to be self sustainable in goods, services and food, energy must to be one as well. Heavy development projects for clean energy must be key.
* The ***amount of tax needed to be paid per citizen could be significantly dropped***, as the electronic accounting will precisely tell how much must it be given to cover every government and public salary, project investment and mantainance. PUBLIC SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH AND EDUCATION WILL NOT BE PART OF THE TAX AS THEY WILL BE PAID WITH THE NEW ECONOMY SYSTEM AVOIDING THE INCREASE OF THE TAX.
* In other words, ***life will not have a price tag*** on the new health system, nor will education for the formation of the population. Tax exemptions for pharmacies and other health related businesses. Weland will invest heavily on the creation of their own drugs for the pharmacies, with the goal not to depend on other countries.
* ***Promote with great incentives the electric automotive industry***, that will take benefit on the clean energy project and a less dependency on buying coal and natural gas from other countries.
* ***Heavy investment in education*** for every citizen as this will be provided for free and will be promoted to everyone so Weland may have specialization workers and superb work force.
* Laws and policies both from the government and private companies must reflect a ***positive attitude towards the growth and development*** of both their citizens/workers and the community/country.
* ***Prisons*** need to turned not only into a captivity based approach, but a ***reformatory to educate, treat and help people***.

This is it, a different approach. Videogame Economy is **NOT** communism, it is **NOT** capitalism, it is **NOT** socialism, its taking the good things of all of them and implement a mix of approaches that benefit the country and their citizens. It needs improvement, tweaking, because its *crazy and daring*, but *you can´t have success and gains if you don´t risk.* Have in mind that the other systems have great flaws and disadvantages as well, we need to calculate which one is actually better.",finance
personalfinance,Home purchase + Personal Finance + Career advice,"Slightly long post - I am in the final stages of a row-home purchase in a steadily appreciating neighborhood in Washington D.C after selling my condo that I’ve lived in in the same neighborhood for the past couple of years. I will be using the profit from the condo sale + some savings to put down at least a 20% down-payment. The new row-home purchase price is $620,000, the appraised value came in at $665,000. By sticking with the same lender from my condo, I was able to lock in a 30-year fixed interest rate of 2.875% with no points or loan origination fees. My agent recommended **only putting down 20% down payment** and investing the rest of my savings in higher yield assets. Intuitively I know this makes sense, however I am relatively inexperienced in investing (though I am voraciously learning) so I’m still drawn to the comfort of having a lower monthly mortgage payment. I currently make a decent salary right now at a stable position, but life happens and there are no guarantees that I’ll always make the same salary in the future, (or if I get sick, have a family etc.) so I’m not certain if I should put more towards the down-payment in order to have the certainty of a lower monthly payment. My agent also mentioned that I could do a cash out re-finance soon after the sale and take out the instant equity to invest, though conversely I’m not sure I’d be able to get the same low mortgage rate as I currently have without points or fees so my monthly payment would go up slightly. I’d like to get some PF advice on this home purchase situation.

Secondly, I have the possibility within the next few months of transferring my job overseas outside the U.S for up to 5 years. The caveat is that my overseas gross pre-tax salary would be about 23% less (it would be at just under 6-figures), but I would have all my housing expenses + utilities reimbursed as a tax-free benefit for the entire duration. If I did go this route, I would rent my Washington D.C row-home out and have some net positive monthly cash flow (which I would plan to all invest) + passively building up home equity in the process. I figure that despite the lower overseas gross salary, I’d be able to save more to invest since all my housing expenses would be covered by my job. I'd like to get some PF opinions on this job situation.

My goal is to get as close as possible to having the financial ability/option to retire in 10 years if I choose to within a high cost of living area. I am in my early 30’s, no debt, no other obligations other than myself, have a 401K, Roth IRA, and HSA.

Would appreciate **any** PF advice on my situation on how to manage my time &amp; manage risk in order to get closer to my goal of being able to retire in 10 years.",finance

My loan officer said that since my loan is 564k, and over 514k, my interest rate is 3.25% today, if I were to take it under 514k, my interest rate can be 2.875%.

Here is my calculation. House price 705k, and I plan to live in this house for 10 years. (Emergency fund is out of the question, either way I will have sufficient cash for all I will need (remodeling, wedding, kids, car payment, emergency incident), and either monthly payment is well within my affordability (mortgage income ratio at 35%-38%)

1. Loan amount: 514k

Down: 191k (27%)

Interest rate: 2.875%

Monthly payment: $2117

Total payment over 10 years: 254k

Total interest paid: 129k

Interest rate: 3.25%

Monthly payment: $2454

Total payment over 10 years: 295k

Total interest paid: 164k

&amp;#x200B;

However, since I ""saved"" 50k from down payment, I am able to put them in investment and yield  average 5% (very conservative) per year over the next 10 years, and this will get me extra 81k (initial 50k plus 31k compound gain over 10 years.)

So at the end, I will only pay 164k - 31k = 133k on the interest for 2), just 4k more than 1) over the course of 10 years, but it gives me a lot liquid by having extra 50-81k cash laying around. (if we change 5% to higher, or we decide to stay longer than 10 years, I may even save money)

Conclusion, I am effectively taking a 30 year $50k loan @ 3.25% rate from the bank and invest it for more than 3.25% gain. And the longer I live in her the more I can benefit from this $50k loan.

Am I missing anything here?

Edit: What I missed is that the monthly payment difference of $337. I should have calculated to invest them as well, which brings me 52k, and this is added on top of the the number above. So yeah, if I were to go for 2), it will cost me 52k + 4k = 56k after 10 years. Bad idea.

personalfinance,Paying down student loan vs. keeping the loans to help credit,"Currently my student loans are doing a lot to help my credit. My score is as high as it’s ever been due to the SL’s increasing my average age of credit and keeping # of accounts in a major impact range. 

The thing is...I have about $20k in savings that I don’t want just sitting in my low interest savings account. My thoughts lately have drifted towards paying several of the highest interest rate loans off. I’m thinking dropping $15k, which would leave me a nice emergency fund. 

I suppose my concern is my credit score dropping and losing a large safety net/future down payment power. 

For additional info: 
- My personal student loans are around $23k, all around 4.25%
-I don’t plan to buy a house until 4 or 5 years. 
-I’m 24M and make approximately $64k/year in southeast US. Very secure job.",finance

personalfinance,Escrow Shorted 3 Years In Row Now,"Like the title says, 3rd year in a row. My mortgage is handled by US Bank. Not my doing it was sold about 6 months after I purchased the house. Owned for 6 years. First three years no issues got a little back every year from escrow overpay. Then comes year 4. My property value starts going up a large amount but my mortgage stays the same. I called US Bank and tell them ""hey, my property value is going up and the county appraiser is showing my taxes going up"" they say ""no biggy we will account for it and it shouldn't go up too much"". I being me start putting extra money away on top of my usual mortgage payments because it is obvious I am going to short my escrow that year. Low and behold my yearly escrow review comes around and I'm 1.8k short. Luckily I was saving on the side and was able to pay it up front. Once again the following year my appraisal from the county go up yet US Bank doesn't adjust my mortgage even a cent from the previous year even though I call and tell them it needs to be raised to keep up with increasing property value to keep from shorting my escrow at the end of the year. Well here I am 3rd year in a row and this year they shorted it 2600 fucking dollars. 

So here is the question. Is there anything I can do to these ass hats to get them to give me a fair escrow. In my eyes they are not upholding their duty as the mortgage lender. It is a VA loan so I'm almost positive I have to use an escrow account since they are federally backed. What's the fucking point of having a half assed escrow account that I have to also keep my own personal escrow to cover since the bank refuses to do it. Short of refinancing with another lender I don't know what else to do. Even then it could just end up sold back to them or worse end up with an even crappier lender.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car or keep growing?,"So a year and a half ago I bought a car that I sort of regret. It’s a nice Subaru with insanely low miles for a ten year old car. My reasoning for the car was AWD was necessary as I live in the northern mountains and commute 30 minutes to work through the mountains, so snow is always a big problem come winter. My old vehicle died the day prior and I was sort of pressed on time and there was very little options in my immediate area. However, it was slightly below what I was willing to finance so I went with it. Because of its age, however, the interest rate ended up at 8.99% for a loan of 9000 dollars and my monthly payments are 201 dollars.

I’ve been adamantly saving and investing my money ever since whenever I could. I so far have reached about 12,000 dollars between my brokerage accounts and my savings (9000 in savings, 4000 in brokerage). My loan balance as of right now is just around 7000 dollars. 

The only thing that scares me is the current state of the world. I am also a homeowner, and am absolutely terrified of a recession, as I was just entering the workforce during the last recession in a state harshly hit. People in my current age group then, people in their 30s, seemed to have been the most affected viscerally from that recession so now I reserve a certain level of fear over what’s underway. 

I am currently on a logistics team doing short haul trucking and yard management for a major distribution center making around 20/hr full time. My car payment, mortgage, average utilities, car insurance, cell phone, and other bills equate to around 1000 dollars a month. 

I really want to get rid of this car payment so I can save an additional 200 dollars a month, and since the interest rate is so high, would save me money in the long run, as the last bill cycle is sometime in 2024. But, I also am terrified of life in general and fear going from 12k in cash/investments to 5k in cash/investments would make me more vulnerable to the woes of life.

Would more financially literate people contribute more towards the monthly payment now, then once life goes back to normal, pay it off, or would you just rip that bandage off?

personalfinance,Quitting job without having another lined up - how illogical would this be?,"Hey all,

My situation is coming to a head and curious to think what you all think.

I'm completely in agreeance that finding a job before resigning is the optimal path to take, but I'm not sure that this is feasible with my current position.

I'll spare the gory details but the all of the variables o my role are severely stressful (tech support supervisor) and it's not rare that I work a 12 hour day to stay with my team to get them home after we close our phone lines for the night since we are understaffed/have a green team.

It has gotten to the point where I literally cannot sleep the night before I go back to work and during the work week. I work 4 10 hour shifts but that often ends up being 11 or 12 hour shifts so by the time my shift ends, I'm so mentally drained that even thinking about applying for jobs/studying for technical certifications spikes my anxiety.

As the week ends, I tend to sleep 12-14 hours just to catch up on sleep and my weekends end as soon as they start because of the residual effects of my position. I'm so mentally drained that I only just start to recover mentally over halfway into my weekend.

 It's also not uncommon to get texts during the weekend to help someone on a call. 

In my estimation, I have three paths with varying pros/cons and I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts as I don't really have too many people to discuss this with which increases my anxiety ten fold. For reference, I have two full years of liquid, safe expenses in a savings account. 


Path 1: Suck it up, bite down and find any job that makes as much that is not as mentally abusive during off hours. I'm concerned with this option due to my stress/depression levels being at an all time high and not being able to effectively apply/interview with my stress levels/depression related to current job. 

Path 2: Quit position, start studying full time for industry certifications in IT and find a job that makes as much/more than current without changing expenses while recovering mentally and focusing more on healthy physical/metal habits. 

Path 3: Quit position, start studying full time for industry certs for a couple months and move in with parents over the summer to reduce expenses. I could use this to 
mentally recharge and be closer to family during all the chaos and focus on my body/mind. 


I really have two priorities, to further my career with doing certificates and to get out of dodge with my current position. My quality of life would likely improve significantly if I woke up doing something else with the same pay.",finance

personalfinance,Is refinancing a BAD idea?,"I'm refinancing my house.  We bought it 3 years ago or so with a 30 year mortgage at 3.625%.  Even at 15 years it would be very affordable. 

Given that rates have been dropping, we're  wondering about refinancing. I've got a lock at 2.5% with zero points for 15 years.

But I've been wondering about all the buying of assets by the federal reserve recently including secondary market bonds. With their ballooning balance sheet, I anticipate inflation will be a problem in the next 5-10 years and may last many years thereafter.  If that's the case, would refinancing to a 15 year mortgage be a suboptimal (if not bad) financial decision?  If inflation averages even 5% over the next 30 years and my loan is only 3.625 percent, then wouldn't it make sense to keep the current mortgage and stretch the loan out as far as possible? 

I think no debt also is a sound financial decision, too, I'm just trying to think it out.

investing,Star investor: Markets may crash so badly the Fed has to start buying stocks,"The Federal Reserve is buying junk bonds and corporate debt ETFs as part of its campaign to revive the American economy. Next on its shopping list: US stocks, as Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, told CNN Business.

The S&amp;P 500 has skyrocketed 40% since March 23, when the Fed announced its unprecedented experiment with junk bonds. That surge, coming in the face of the collapse of the real economy, drove up market valuations to dotcom-bubble levels.

But Minerd thinks a reckoning is coming, and soon. He expects the S&amp;P 500 will retest its March 23 low of 2,237.40 over the next month, potentially crumbling to as low as 1,600. That would mark a 49% collapse from where the index traded Tuesday during a strong rally.

""There's a point where the Federal Reserve is going to have to pull out a bazooka,"" Minerd said in an interview. ""And I think the option of buying stocks on the part of the Fed is on the table.""

It's honestly a darn shame that in order to survive in this country, one is required to invest themselves in the stock market, which originally was intended to help prosper new businesses. Now it's being used as a monetary water hole. 

Greed has gotten the better of capitalism, gents. And the government is just there trying to do what's right, without truly understand the consequences. In the end, it only will increase the class gap: the haves (who understand the system), and the have nots (who are honest working Americans, just trying to get by on their minimum wage job, but do not understand the system).

Congratulations everybody! You've all killed the American dream. Because anybody who stands by and allows it happen, is apart of it. And no, I'm not saying you have to go march on Wall Street, but simply admitting to it is good enough in my eyes. Because it gets the word around. And we all know it. Just don't turn your heads, because that's what the German's did in the 1940s.  

Granted, yes... I'll be putting money into the stock market tomorrow. Not by choice. But by force. Because over the past 5 years I've lost at least 3-7% of my wealth because I let my money sit in the bank. I take responsibility for that, and inflation is a natural thing in a healthy economy. But this is unprecedented.

personalfinance,Review of recent PenFed Credit Union used auto loan experience,"First off, I currently have a used auto loan with PenFed. I have had the loan since 2017 for a truck I bought, and everything has been simple - until now. I applied for a loan on a classic car 3 days ago - a 1971 Chevrolet Nova. The loan amount was about $16,000 after I paid for some in cash, and I was pre-approved right there on the spot at 3.74% APR.

The car is a completely rebuilt classic with only 2,400 miles on the new engine and transmission. The car is in pristine condition. First I was told they needed pictures of everything outside and within the car. Okay, easy enough. I got pictures of the inside, outside, engine, trunk, etc., and the title. Everything was good there, too. Next they wanted an appraisal. Alright...a pain, but I went through and got the appraisal completed by a local Chevrolet dealer. In big words on the top of the page are ""USED CAR APPRAISAL FORM"" which apparently wasn't ""what PenFed was looking for"" and wanted a full appraisal of what made this car worth $16,000.

The car was rebuilt by the previous owner out of his own pocket. He didn't take it somewhere to have it done, he worked on it for over 4 years to get it where it's at today. The previous owner and I sat down with the appraiser and listed out all of the things that were done with the car, and the appraiser still signed off on the appraised amount of the car. That is the job of this person, he appraises cars. Apparently a Chevrolet dealer isn't a ""certified"" appraiser, and PenFed wanted someone different to look at it. I refused, as this is absolute nonsense. I should not have to be running around left and right for all of this to get a car loan. ESPECIALLY when NADA auto sales appraises the car at $14,219. It is absolutely ridiculous.

I know some are going to say, ""Well the bank needs to cover their own in case you don't make payment and they need to repossess the vehicle, they want to ensure they can get their money back."" I mentioned my auto loan I currently have. I have paid over $10,000 on this loan and NEVER missed a single payment. I have a 753 credit score. I would consider myself to be extremely LOW RISK to lend money to. My credit history is perfect in terms of payments made on time and everything else. Plus, $16,000 is not a very large amount of money. I was planning on taking a 36 month loan because I know I can afford to make the higher monthly payments to pay the car off even quicker than average. 

With all of this nonsense running around for this vehicle, I will be refinancing my current loan so I don't pay a single penny more to PenFed. They have lost all trust and faith in an active duty service member.

personalfinance,Should I quit my job?,"Hi all, 

I’ve gotten into a disagreement with my manager and am considering quitting my job, but wanted to get the unbiased opinion of others in case I may be in the wrong here. 

For background:
I’m a restaurant server who was laid off during the pandemic and was collecting unemployment (which ironically is paying me more than I earned full time as a server). My restaurant then re-opened in early May and asked me to come back. 

I was hesitant to return due to the virus, sacrificing my benefits, and other personal reasons, but agreed to so long as I was only scheduled 2-3 shifts a week. Also, I can keep my benefits if I work under 25 hours a week, and I can earn up to $300 a week (any money over that deducts from my benefits).

All had been going well until this week - I’ve been scheduled 6 days (Sun, Tue-Sat), despite my previous request to work no more than 3. I have two issues with this 

1. That’s double the shifts I requested to work 
2. I can only earn $300 a week, which I already made after my Tuesday shift. Therefore my next 4 shifts I’ll be sacrificing 30-35 hours of my time with no personal benefit.

Last night, I re-explained to my manager that I don’t feel great about working more than three shifts in a week, but would be willing to make an exception if I could somehow be compensated for my time (ideally just paid in cash for these shifts).

His summarized response was:
- I can’t pay you in cash because we’ll be audited
- I had to over schedule you because we’re understaffed (due to other workers quitting or calling out)
- You should show up to work anyways because you’re getting free money from the government 
- You shouldn’t complain because “I thought you were better than that”
- If I don’t want to show up, I should just call him and tell him, but I’ll likely be disciplined for it

This rubbed me the wrong way because of the tone; it felt unsympathetic, like he implied I was ungrateful and childish. This bothered me as the main reason I returned was of loyalty to him (I don’t need this job or the money it provides, I just returned because I had liked my managers), and it doesn’t strike me as selfish to object about being overscheduled to cover the slack of others... also I’m afraid if I concede and work this week, then he’ll keep over scheduling me (which he’s done to my girlfriend many times in the past, because she hates to say no).

If I were to defend my manager, he IS understaffed and HAS had a rough week with other employees screwing him over, but I don’t think it’s fair that I should be expected to cover them and care for the business with zero personal gain, and I really dislike being shamed for objecting to doing so. His response felt demeaning and is making me want to quit.

I also know, however, that my judgment is imperfect, so I was looking for advice from a 3rd party - am I being unreasonable here? Is there something big That I’m ignoring? Should I show up to work these extra shifts anyways? Am I wrong to want to quit after this disagreement? 

As for the personal side, I don’t need this job or the money it provides, and am not worried about finding employment elsewhere; my only concern Is potentially burning a bridge, only to find out I was in the wrong.

I appreciate anyone’s time who reads this, thanks!

EDIT - if it matters, I’m actually on Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, not regular unemployment, and I’m allowed to quit my job due to covid 19 without sacrificing my benefits

EDIT 2 - when filing your PUA you’re allowed to state an option saying “I had to quit my job as a direct result of covid 19” and some of my coworkers quit because they didn’t want to work too much, and they still receive benefits. I don’t want to be in a restaurant surrounded by people 5-6 days out of the week right now, and from the personal accounts of others, can quit because of this and still be eligible.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on what to pay off first?,"Hi Reddit,

I'm 26 and have about $20K in student debt and $7k in car loans. I have $26K in savings diversified in different areas.

Avg student debt interest rate = 4.1%  
Car loan interest rate = 5.9%

My total monthly budget/cost for living and everything else (when I pay the minimums on my student debt and car loans) amounts to $2,603 and I make $4,034 from my job each month after taxes. Of course, here and there, I'll always do a trip and vacation with my friends/family but COVID has prevented that and I've been saving a lot over the past few months. I've been saving extra hard just in case I get laid off from my job but that doesn't look like it's happening since they didn't lay off a single person and things are starting to normalize (well the best it can in a situation like this). So I'm pretty confident in job stability right now.

With all of this background info, I'm wondering how you guys would tackle the debt? I was thinking of just paying my car loans in full because the interest rate is so high. Or would you still not do that because the COVID situation has been so unpredictable? How would you tackle the student loans right now when they're at a 0% interest rate?

Thank you all in advance!

Edit:  I'm off to work now, so I won't be able to reply to anyone immediately but I'll definitely read every comment during my lunch and after hours.",finance

personalfinance,"I have a very rare chance to save enough money for a downpayment on a house for my wife and 2 kids, but don't know the best way to go about it. Please help a financially illiterate dad.","First, some Backstory. 

Since the beginning of COVID, my wife and I have both been working from her family's place in the country, rather than staying at our apartment Downtown. We were both given expectations by our companies that we would return to working in the office at the beginning of July, but that is no longer the case. My company is keeping the office closed through the end of the year, and her office is going to be doing shifts of 2 consecutive days in the office per week. 

We both make $40k, and I make an additional \~$6500 every quarter through commissions and bonuses, so basically I have three more of those bonuses coming to me by mid-January. We have two kids, and an apartment downtown ($1800/mo)  where the lease is up in July. With our offices not requiring us to be back in the office full-time until the start of next year, we have decided we will be staying at her grandparents' place in the country, as both grandparents have passed away, and her parents could use some help with upkeep on the place. Between the $1800 saved from not having rent, and \~$1000/mo in childcare that we will be saving by having her retired mother watch the kids, we have the chance to really accelerate our goal of saving up a downpayment for the house. But, there are a couple of kinks. 

1. We currently have about $30k in credit card debt. I won't bore you with the details of how we got here, but suffice it to say that we were young parents of twins with little knowledge of finances. Minimum monthly payments are about $700, and the interest rate is 24%. 
2. We have about $600/mo in medical bills, with a grand total of \~$3050 left. 

We own both of our cars outright, and combined insurance for the cars is less than $150. Our credit scores are both in the 680-700 range, with the credit cards being our biggest detractor. 

Assuming that we are able to stay rent-free and childcare-free through the end of the year, I am hoping to figure out the best way to get to a place where we have a downpayment saved up for an FHA loan, and get our debt low enough to get approved on said loan.

I have the option to forward it to my current 401k or receive it all directly now, subject to a 20% federal tax withholding, plus however much will be taken out by California state taxes. I have the option to elect to not have state taxes withheld (but I’m assuming come tax day next year I will have to pay). The payout is not substantial, but it would help me pay off my credit cards by the end of the year even after the taxes are taken out, so I am leaning toward receiving the payout directly. 

Is this a good or bad idea? Are there any other hidden fees I need to worry about? The payout is between $200 and $5000 and I am under 59 1/2 years old.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. Given the overwhelming feedback I’m going to go ahead and roll over to my 401k. A few extra months of interest now on my credit cards is nothing compared to what I’ll be paying now for this money or in the long run from lost interest for my future.",finance
personalfinance,Which mortgage refinance would you go with?,"I posted yesterday about a refinance offer I had on the table and quite frankly, this seems to be pretty stressful and confusing. 

Current term: 30 years with 28 left.

Current loan amount: 372,000

Original interest rate: 4.375%

Payment: 3052/month (taxes, principal, pmi)


Loan offer #1(from current lender whom I have mortgage with now): 3.5% no points (30 year)

Closing costs: 7000

New finances amount:379,000 (escrow account being paid cash)

New payment will be around 390 less a month. 

Loan offer #2 (Quicken loans): 2.99% (30 years)

Closing costs: 7,252 (including paying for 1 point)

New financed amount: 390,000

New payment saves: 480 a month. 

I feel like the 2.99% is obviously better but comes at a higher cost because the escrow (I think) is rolled into the loan. 

I’m almost to the point where I will just tell both lenders who are heckling me to do a deal today that I will be walking away and keeping my rate.

Only thing in question is that we have a 5 year plan and not sure if we will be here after 5 years, it’s 50/50 right now. 

Plan is to take the monthly savings and continue to pay down higher interest debt (student loans).

I'm not wanting to buy down the interest rate so, assuming the bidders didn't sneak anything into the fees, the rates should be what they have to offer at par.  What I currently have left on the principal of the loan is a little under $154,000



&amp;nbsp;

Original loan Info

  Loan Amount = $157,600

  Loan Issue Date - 3/11/2019

  Loan Type - 30 year, fixed rate

  Interest Rate = 4.375%



&amp;nbsp;

Bid 1 (from bank)

  This bid from my bank used estimated numbers instead of the true loan amounts.  The escrow is not rolled into this loan

  Loan Amount = $150,000

  Type - 30 year, fixed rate

  Interest Rate = 3.375%

  Closing Costs = 4638.61

  Closing Cost Breakdown (Estimated Values)

     Bank Origination Fees

        $550 processing

        $550 underwriting

    Texas Partners Title

        $1224 Estimated Fees

    Third Party Fees

        $500 Appraisal /Estimate

        $400 Survey (I have my original and this is being waved)

    Prepaids to set up your new Escrow Account (not required/optional)

        $1500 Taxes

        $600 Home Owners Insurance

        plus 2 month cushion


&amp;nbsp;


Bid 2 (from mortgage company)

  The escrow is rolled into the loan amount for this bid.

  Loan Amount = $162,871

  Type - 30 year, fixed rate

  Interest Rate = 2.99%

  Closing Costs = 9,144

  These guys sent me a nice closing cost sheet breakdown that I'll link to instead of re-typing like I had to for the 1st bid

  Page 1 - https://i.imgur.com/MrTomRH.png

  Page 2 - https://i.imgur.com/hL16EXM.png


&amp;nbsp;

What I think I'm looking at is that Bid 1 has a higher interest rate but lower closing costs, by almost half the amount, of bid 2.  This is true even when factoring in the return of my current escrow. 
 While it looks like Bid 1 is making their numbers look better by using an ""estimated loan amount"" that's lower than what I actually owe, I think the higher closing costs on Bid 2 still end up making Bid 1 better in the long-run.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, rolling the closing costs into the loan amount means I don't have to pay those fees all at once at close, correct?  So for Bid 1 I would have to pay the $4638.61 all at once at close.  Bid 2 I wouldn't have to pay anything at close since that is rolled into the loan and I'd be paying that amount off monthly with my Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance.  Is that correct?

&amp;nbsp;

I live in US. Both me and my wife are fortunate enough to keep our jobs (essential workers in different industries) during this economy and pandemic.  
I have enough saved for about 10% on a house (plus emergency funds which I'm not touching). We haven't decided to buy or even looked at houses, but know that we would like to be in around 300-350k range when we do buy one. Just by following 28% rule.  
If you are following the market at all, you know the interest rates are at a historical low. 
The Golden rule as I read it is to have 20% down. This gives you access to lower fixed mortgage rate and you also don't have to pay PMI. My question is in the long run, would jumping in housing market now be better than say waiting another year to save for 20%? Does keeping the money I have now in my checking account really make sense? Would I not be risking prices going up and rates going up also with inflation usually around 2% losing the value of the money?

personalfinance,Financing options to get my interest down,"In January of this year, I financed car for 12,500, at a 9.5% interest rate - 5 year term. Currently, my monthly payment is  $263.36, of which 108.27 is interest. (The math doesn't add up because I round up to 300 on payments.)

Since that time, my credit score has raised significantly (from \~620 to \~750), and I would like to know my options for getting the remainder of the principal on a new line of credit at a lower interest rate. just a few points interest difference would save me thousands over the life of the loan.

My main issue here is that I haven't been any to find any lenders that will refinance a car over 7 years old. (I purchased a 2012, go figure). Could I get around this with a personal loan? my thinking is not, because the lender will want to know what I'm using the loan money for. What are some other clever options here?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Medical Issues and Uncertainty about the Future; Need a Plan and Advice from Financially Savvy People.,"Ok, so I am just going to start. 

I an currently in the process of getting diagnosed. I have numbness, pain, fatigue, vision issues, balance issues, ect. My work has put me on PRN while I have an appointment for my intermittent FMLA paperwork and I have not been cleared by PT to go back to work. I have worked at my current job for 4 months.  All of my specialist appointments are next month where I will have nerve testing and a neurology consult which will most likely lead to an MRI. The longest I have ever held a job is 2 years. Yes, I know this is stupid. I just get so bored that I cannot take it anymore and quit. 

I have Medicaid which is paying for my bills. I was the only one supporting us before and I made $12 an hour which I know sucks but has literally been the most money I have ever made. My boyfriend was unemployed for the past three months and was not able to get unemployment. In one part because in the beginning we weren't sure if he would qualify and the second part when he did start looking into it the website kept crashing so he gave up. Yes, I do know that was not the right thing to do. I am aware the he should have been refreshing every second but he didn't do that and here we are.  We didn't know that I would be unable to work. He had an interview today so I hope we get it so we at least have some income.

I have been unable to work so we are living off my savings and credit cards. I owe $6,600 in debt spread over three credit cards and a car loan which will be paid off next month. My credit score is 714. I am waiting to (hopefully) be accepted into the Respiratory Therapy program, then I will be applying for every grant and scholarship known to man. I am very concerned if I will be able to do the clinic work but I absolutely need to do my best because I worked hard to be accepted and I don't want to let the opportunity pass me by. Classes start in August and they are sending out acceptance letters in July. I am hoping I will be cleared by the doctors to work by then or they will have me on medicine, ect. I already have a Bachelors in Social Work but I am unsuited to the job. It was something I got because I was passionate about it in school but I never really used at all. Like at all. It was a tremendous waste of a degree and all it does is make me pay for my next degree without any federal grants. I can still borrow about $5000 on my credit cards. 

I have $1200 in a mutual fund which has penalties for early withdraw, or that is what I understand. Our rent is $470 per month. We have a lease renewal coming up in, we also have a cat which I am thinking about getting the paperwork for a emotional support animal from my Psychiatrist. I have $800 (which may be put down for a deposit if we have to leave)  in savings and $900 for the rest of this month. We have a lease renewal in August and we will want to negotiate with the landlord to see if he will reverse his no pets policy especially since she is very well behaved, we haven't been late on rent, and would be willing to pay a deposit or extra rent.

Of course he could just as easily say no. I am in contact with my boss and she is planning on printing out my check stubs so we can at least start to get the paperwork going for other apartments if need be. My job wants me back and I desperately want to go back. I cannot stand all the doctor's appointments and the laying in bed all day so I don't have symptoms. 

My boyfriend:

My boyfriend is also returning to college for a System's Administration Associates degree. He's really good at it. He has a deal with his Dad that he pays for the classes and if he passes his Dad reimburses him. He said he may not go to his classes this semester since we are having problems and I have offered to pay on my card. He says no but I do want him to finish the degree since it would be his ticket to a better life. He has no health insurance. 

He has $1200 in debt on a former credit card which is sent to collections. He says that they require a negotiation or a pay in full but he doesn't have the bulk cash to pay it. His credit score is 550. Only the bank offers subsidized credit cards which would be amazing to get after he pays off collection  to increase his credit score but we don't really have the ability to do that now.

He is unemployed but I am having a good feeling about the interview. 

The other worry is that despite how much I am doing, the PT, the appointments, keeping up with my previous job ect, what if it is something degenerative? I know they say you shouldn't ""what if"" but I need to know and the doctors are in the beginning stages of figuring it out. What happens if it turns out that I can't work? If I can work, which I cannot wait to happen do I need to get short term and long term disability? 

How did we get here? Easy, got a degree in career I thought I would love but ended up hating. I had a very poverty mindset of ""It could be gone tomorrow and this is your only chance"" with credit cards mixed in with taking care of others. I also leapt on the boredom train because I could not comprehend staying in the same job after I knew what I was doing, it was too boring. I also think I got used to low income. 

My boyfriend has the opposite problem where he always has a soft landing with a good financially stable family so he didn't really develop the motivation since he had his physical needs met, in my opinion, He is a steady worker but takes a lot to motivate him to move forward. I think he figured that he would be fine no matter what. 

I know we need to change. I know we both need to get out of debt. I am just not sure how, especially when it comes to my medical issues. I don't know what is coming down the tube which is scary and makes it hard to predict. I don't even know if I will be physically cleared to the the Respiratory Therapy program and will have to delay it. I know this is long but if anyone can help out with a plan or advice it would be appreciated. Me slowly sinking deeper in debt to support us isn't an option. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,When does it make sense to refinance?,"Currently we owe about 182k on our 250k house with about 25 years left on the mortgage. We currently have a 3.5% VA loan. According to the local VA lender I can buy a point for 1% ($1800) and refinance to a 2.75%

According to my calculations I would be saving nearly 20k over the life of the loan. Even if I finance the $1800, I would still be saving right? Full disclosure I over pay by about $400 every month. I'll keep doing that assuming I can afford it. 

The biggest two unknowns is that VA interest rates may drop further and what hidden fees are associated with the loan. I did ask the guy. He kinda dodge the question by talking a bout the 1% and no need to do an appraisal.

Skip ahead two years after everything was charged off and we are doing much better.

What’s the best way to take advantage of all the options for first time homebuyers? Is it even worth trying in our situation? I’ve been told FHA is the best option as we will only be able to save $10-13k by the time we’d like to start the process later this year.

I’ve run the calculators on websites like Trulia and our DTI is around 26% on a $230k home (median in our area is $270k so we’d be buying a fixer upper, which is fine because I have done lots of remodeling with friends in the past). 

What do you think Reddit? Do I need to wait another few years? Wait to see if there’s a real estate downturn? (So far its still a sellers market in our area)

They called me about the refinance. Months go by and I get a letter in the mail saying I owe Santander a balance, this was April.

Long story short... the credit union did not send the correct payoff which left a balance. And for some reason the payment was reversed by Santander and they never let my credit union know. I don’t know where they got the pay off amount but it was not from me. When I got this letter I called them to let them know. They sent another payoff check which ended up being for the incorrect amount again and left a balance again. When I called my credit union about it they said the solution was to add it into my loan (write up a whole new loan) or to pay it off with my credit card through them. I thought this was ridiculous as this was their mistake. I got marked up on my credit for being 30 days late because they sent the wrong pay off amount TWICE.

personalfinance,Optimal Strategy for credit score planning,"Hi so I currently have no credit history but I have just been approved for a student credit card. I have been looking about information for building credit and the basic stuff appears obvious (pay on time, Credit utilization below 10%,) with this said I plan on getting a mortgage roughly 3-4 years from now so I want excellent credit by then because that would constitute significant savings and I want some clarification on things.

1. How quickly should I apply for credit cards multiple hard inquiries are slightly bad but assuming my immediate credit score is not useful to me (i have no need for an auto loan or a mortgage for now)and it gets dropped off of fico after one year and entirely off my history after 2 years as long as I get approved it seems I should apply for as many cards as possible without a annual fee correct?

2. I am going to apply for federal student loans when the rates are dropped in july to my understanding direct unsubsidized loans will not have a hard inquiry if this is true I should apply for that before applying for any other cards because it will not affect my acceptance chances correct?

3. My parents could add me on one of their cards as an authorized user I don't know their exact credit history but they are high income responsible and have many cards I assume the best one would be near perfect when should I do this and does the order matter? I would assume I should do it immediately if the federal loans have no hard inquiry. If they do to my understanding they are guaranteed approval so I should do that then add AU then apply for my cards unless someone could explain a better way than this(eg apply for 1 or 2 then AU then more cards).",finance

My situation: military academy undergrad so I never experienced paying tuition. I received a minor wound in Afghanistan and as a result have a Purple Heart. Due to that, I qualify for 100% of the GI Bill. 




I am heading to an expensive private business school (think Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, etc.). Tuition over 2 years is $215k



GI Bill will pay approx $50k and the Yellow Ribbon will pay approx $80k. That leaves about another $85k that I will have to go out of pocket. 



Now this is a type of working MBA so I’ll maintain my full time job. Without bonus, my income is $170k. My wife was furloughed due to covid but has a potential offer coming. If she gets the job, that’s an additional $85k-ish. My yearly expenses after my home refinance goes through will be about $25k mortgage and another maybe $20k for everything else. So I can afford tuition without a loan. 




With that said, if I could secure a student loan for below 3% then it would make sense rather than just pay the tuition balance. Given my income, assets, credit history that should be a reasonable rate. But apparently federal rates for grad school are 6%??? That is completely ridiculous. How should I go about loan shopping? Any lenders more reputable than the others? I can’t just go to any big bank like chase or Wells Fargo, correct? I live in California if that makes a difference.

3. Bitcoin is revolutionary technology that's changing the world as you read this. Consider a small Bitcoin investment as “your fee to learn about the future.”
4. “Bitcoin is an unstoppable force” -- US Congressman, Patrick McHenry. The Congressman is right.
5. The world is waking up to Bitcoin. ""Smart Money"" investors already own Bitcoin.

7. Buy Bitcoin to support free speech. Free speech underpins a free and open society. Bitcoin is money, and money is speech. Don’t like watching governments and central banks bailing out their buddies while mainstreet suffers?
8. Scarcity matters. We’ve never had a truly scarce monetary good. To put it in perspective, there are twice as many millionaires (46m) as there are bitcoins (21m). Might be smart to get some before everyone catches on.
9. The Roman Empire fell  Just like the roman empire, the US Dollar Hegemony won’t last forever.   The “monetary base” changes periodically. Bitcoin has a real chance of being the next monetary base.  Pound Sterling --&gt; US Dollar --&gt; ??

\- $3,550 on CareCredit Card, just had LASIK done. This is with 24 months of interest free financing. I pay \~$150 per mo. This was within the last 2 weeks which contributed to my credit score dropping.

\- $2,500 on Best Buy Credit Card. This was for a laptop purchase that I needed for school, my old one broke down right before the summer semester. This is on 18 mo. of interest free financing. I pay about  \~150 per mo. This was within the last 2 weeks which contributed to my credit score dropping.

\- $4,600 through BMO Harris for my car loan. This one still has 60 mo. left. It's earning interest at 4%. This is a flat payment of $200 per month.

Lastly.... student loans. - $14,000 through Great Lakes Loans. Please don't come at me, but... I don't currently pay any on this as I still have three years of school left. I couldn't find the current interest rate, but about $300 of the $14,000  is interest.

Secondly, if/when some of the companies ends up going bust, how is this accounted for?  Who gets the red ink on their account and are there any wider consequences?

Thirdly - and I don't mean this sarcastically,  why is this monetization of debt working for the US and Western countries in general but ends up as a disastrous economic collapse  for third world countries who have gone down the same path?  

TLDR - who's getting the coupon when the Fed buys corporate bonds?   What happens when companies go bust?",finance

politics,Megathread: Supreme Court Rules Against Trump Administration Attempt to End DACA,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Trump administration cannot carry out its plan to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has allowed nearly 800,000 young people, known as ""Dreamers,"" to avoid deportation and remain in the U.S.

The decision is a big legal defeat for President Donald Trump on the issue of immigration, which has been a major focus of his domestic agenda. The ruling said the government failed to give an adequate justification for ending the federal program, calling the move ""arbitrary and capricious under the APA.""

personalfinance,Car Loan or Credit Card,"TLDR: Should i use a 3k bonus to contribute towards my CC with high interest or pay off my car completely?

I am getting an unexpected bonus with my paycheck on Friday. I have two large outstanding debts - a car loan, about 2.5k at around 6-8% interest. I forget the exact numbers. I have a credit card with 5.2k at around 24% interest. The bonus is 3k.

The car is a 2010 Chevy Malibu with 160k miles on it, and I've sunk a few grand in repairs since I bought it in late 2014. It runs ok. Some minor issues not worth the cost to fix. The advantage to paying it off is that if another huge repair comes up thats more than the value of the car, I can trade it in for another one. But I only pay $130 a month on it, so its not a burden on my budget right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate on the credit card is pretty steep, and I know putting 3k towards the principal will reduce the interest I'm paying significantly. The monthly payment is around 300, but I chuck about 800-1k at it at the end of every month. So I already plan to have it paid off by the end of the year.

I am not sure what the most optimal move is. I'm leaning towards the CC because of the interest rate, but paying off a debt completely feels really, really good.",finance
personalfinance,"I made a post yesterday about being trapped inside of a 23.39 car loan. Well, i got it figured out. But i have a new question now.","Turns out, i have something called a TSP and i had quite a bit of money in there. Enough in fact to pull out a 12000 loan with 0.75 interest rate. Much better then 23.39.

The payments will come right out of my paycheck and i wont even miss it.

Now that this huge weight is being lifted from my shoulders, i have another question:

How do i make absolutely sure that this one, giant lump sum of money goes DIRECTLY to the principle and final cost of paying off the car loan, and not some kind of shady last minute switcharoo similar to how my initial car loan waa made?

I swear, never again in my life will i finance a vehicle, or anything for that matter besides a home. I want this to be the final nail in the coffin.",finance
personalfinance,Work claimed more dependents than I claimed,"LONG story short, I recently started working for a company in August last year.

Did my taxes this year and I owed the feds money, figured I got confused and claimed ""1"" instead of ""0""

So in April I went to my boss and redid my W-4 just to be safe.

I noticed my pay checks have only been -.60( we recently moved locations so its the city tax difference)

I get to looking at my Paystub even more and they have me claiming 2!!

I am 28 and file as a single with 0 dependents, as I have done my whole life. (there is a chance I originally claimed ""1"" hence why I redid my W4)

I'm waiting for a co worker to get back with me because she said she also owed money on her taxes (for the first time in her life) so I am asking her to look if she has to many dependents claimed as well.

Do employers get any sort of tax break if their employees claim a certain number of dependents?

I just feel like something shady is going on, especially since I know the kinda nonsense that goes on here day to day..",finance

solar,Critique solar quote options,"I received quotes for two different solar PV systems, one sized to match my current demand, and another slightly larger system to account for increased usage due to an EV (2-5 year plan). I am located in northern Wisconsin, so the payoff period is a bit longer than typical installations in sunny Southern states. My utility offers net-metering with a pretty low $22 interconnect fee, and we do not have time-of-use rates. I would be purchasing the system outright, no financing or leasing required. While from a purely economic perspective I'd probably be better off investing in the stock market, solar is something I want to do and I'm willing to spend on my convictions.

personalfinance,Is this a good or bad deal for a mortgage refinance?,"My current interest is 4.175% and my monthly payment is about $1300.  I owe 137,000 on the house and it was just appraised at 194,000.

I got with the bank that was already servicing the loan to see if they would reduce rates and they offered me a new loan at 3.375% with monthly payments that come out to about $1100 a month.

The only issue is that I didn't realize there would be something like $10,000 worth of closing costs and I don't have this kind of cash at hand so I would need to roll it back into the cost of the loan.

Would it be worth increasing the loan amount by $10000 to get the lower monthly payment and the lower interest rate?

# Are we in a stock market bubble?

The best indicator of whether or not the stock market is in a bubble can be seen in this chart. **Charts don't lie.**

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)

This chart shows you the **market cap to gdp ratio**.  It's basically a chart that shows how overpriced stocks are compared to  the actual economy. When stocks reach above 1 then it's in bubble  territory. US stocks are currently at **1.478**. At the peak of the dotcom bubble that number reached **1.4**. At the peak of the housing market bubble it peaked at **1.061**.

# Market sentiment during peak of bubble

At  the peak of a bubble you start noticing a lot of people that have  gotten rich from the stock market. People are buying stocks on margin  thinking that the Fed will always save the day. It is very easy to just  buy and walk away and you see your portfolio double and triple. You see a  lot of hysteria in the market as you see now. This happened during the  peak of the dotcom bubble and the housing bubble. People were buying  tech stocks with $0 in revenue thinking they would be the next Google.  They didn't care the company wasn't making any money and thought the  stocks would just keep going up. FOMO (fear of missing out) is common  during these times. A lot of new traders hop in when they see all their  friends getting rich. During the housing crisis people with low income  jobs could easily get three mortgages to buy big houses thinking they  would go up forever. As we all know now, they don't go up forever.  Today, we see companies like Nikola with $0 in revenue skyrocket because  a lot of speculators are jumping in. But who knows, maybe they will  become the next Tesla. I personally would avoid it. This article  explains market sentiment during a bubble well. I think we are in the  ""return to normal"" stage where a lot of people were buying the dip.

# How to invest during a bubble

Bargains  are not easy to find during a bubble but if you do enough research you  can find them. Even during the past recessions, if you were able to find  companies that were a bargain, you still would've made money. I thought  airlines were a bargain when they hit rock bottom but apparently  Buffett had second thoughts. **Buffett never sells his stocks**.  When you see him selling stocks in a company, that means there are  serious problems with the company. He knows a lot more about companies  than most of us do. The table below is from Bridgewater Associates. They  did a study on a macroeconomic level on the impact of COVID-19 on the  economy.

According  to this table if the unemployment rate is at 10% you can expect an 85%  drop in earnings for the airline industry. Currently the unemployment  rate is 13.3%. Currently AAL stock is at $16. If you do the math and  calculate the potential earnings drop, the price of AAL isn't considered  a bargain unless it is less than $5. Buffett sold AAL at $11 and he is  right.

One industry that took a  huge hit but Buffett still held onto were oil stocks. Oil stocks hit  rock bottom during the recent crash due to oil prices dropping. I think  oil companies could potentially be a bargain right now.

Also, with all the money printing being done by the fed, gold is looking more and more attractive.

# How to invest like Warren Buffett

Buffetts strategy is actually very simple. **Buy when cheap**.  Even if you have to wait 20 years for it to become cheap. You need the  patience like him in order to become a legendary investor. He follows  the market cap to gdp chart closely. When the market goes through a  recession and the number drops down to below 0.8, watch him go on a  buying spree while everyone else is crying. He does this during every  recession. He rarely buys when valuations are high like now.

# Are recessions bad?

Recessions  tend to happen every 10-20 years in a healthy economy. Most people  think recessions are bad but actually they are healthy for an economy.  Economies like the US go through debt cycles. Debt goes down during  these recessions and the economy emerges more efficient and it is better  for the consumer since prices drop. We are currently at the very end of  this current debt cycle and you are noticing the signs of it. Wealth  gap increases and social unrest increases. Interest rates are at 0%. A  new power (China) emerges and contests the current power (USA). Fed is  constantly printing money to keep the stock market from falling. Rich  get richer and poor get poorer. A deleveraging process (recession or  depression) usually fixes a lot of this. Dalio says we should be excited about the future after the deleveraging. (source: Big Debt Crisis by Ray  Dalio)

# Are bubbles bad?

Most people think of bubbles negatively since the majority of people lose money during these times. But from macroeconomic point of view bubbles aren't so bad. These periods of high debt are when entrepreneurs emerge and start companies. They can easily get low interest loans like we see today. Few of those companies are good enough to become the next Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Uber, etc. The best companies will survive the low debt periods (recessions). The economies with the wildest debt swings are the ones that are the friendliest for entrepreneurs.

# Where is the stock market going in the short term?

Nobody  knows the answer to this. I see a small upside potential but a large  downside potential. Which direction it will go in the short term is  anybody's guess. One thing I've noticed is Trump is trying very very  hard to inflate the stock market bubble. He knows he is not getting  re-elected if the stock market crashes now. He is pressuring the Fed to  constantly print money and he's spending helicopter money like a madman  trying to prop up the stock market. This may be good for stocks in the  short term but has serious consequences for the long term, since the  already huge bubble becomes even bigger. Also, during a deleveraging  process a lot of high debt companies declare bankruptcy. This is when  the Fed needs to step in and save the essential businesses. You can't  let large essential companies fail, since that might take down the  entire US economy. When the auto industry failed in 2008, it took down  entire cities along with them. All this spending that the Fed is doing  now worries me. They might run out of ammunition when they really need  it. This next recession might be very very bad. Recently, Dalio issued a warning to his investors about a “lost decade.” If he is right, that means we won’t see stocks go back to 2019 levels for the next ten years.

This doesn’t mean dump all your stocks today. I’m just giving you the advice from Dalio and Buffett. They may be wrong too. You should always do your own research and make your own decisions on how to invest. I personally think they are right. They are smarter than most of us here.

personalfinance,Calculators/comparison tools for mortgage refinancing?,"Are there any calculators or tools that people have used to help evaluate the numbers for different options for refinancing a home mortgage?  I'm trying to figure out if refinancing makes sense and how much we could save over the next X number of years (assuming we sell and move at some point down the road before paying off the loan).

I am 5 years into a 30 year now (4% interest rate) and have looked into options for 15, 20, and 30 years with refinancing (APR fixed year rates would either be 3.14; 3.3; or 3.39%).  The 15 yr would increase our monthly payment by about $200 (which isn't really doable at this point for us given uncertainty of spouse's job); the 20 year monthly payment is roughly the same as what we pay now; and the 30 year payment would be about $200 less than what we currently pay monthly.  Closing costs would be 5000; 4550; or 4850, respectively for 15, 20, 30.  Realistically we plan to stay in our home for at least 5-7 years, but maybe longer.

I'm wondering if going to the 20 year would be worth it as it would be the same payment we have now and would shorten the loan by 5 years. Or if going with the 30 year refinancing would make sense and give us flexibility to take the $200 in savings a month and either put it towards the principle or invest elsewhere.

If there are any tools out there that can help compare the different options and allow us to view how things calculate with different variables, it would be much appreciated, thanks!",finance

I have about 200k in a trust from my grandparents, and the cost of attendance (tuition+living expenses, max allowable federal loans) is 90k/yr. (I believe I can do 85k/yr frugally, but lets stick with 90k). I was offered two types of loans, a federal unsubsidized (45k/yr, 6% interest, 1% fee) and a GRAD+ loan (45k/yr, 7% interest, 4% fee). I additionally have 20k in a savings account.

I've heard three routes I could take. One is that I pay everything off with my trust ASAP, essentially cover the first two years and then switch to loans, avoiding early interest accrual. The second is using none of my trust, accruing heavy loans, but always having this safety net cash. The third route, which I'm leaning towards, is using 45k/yr of my trust to avoid the GRAD+ loan, and cover the rest of the cost of attendance with federal unsubsidized loans.

Any opinions? I've talked to a couple of doctors and they said they would opt to go with 100% loans, but I can't help but think of the inefficiencies of the GRAD+ loan.

This may belong more in the r/cards subreddit but I am putting this here because I need more personal finance advice. Anyways. 

I am 22 and building my credit back up into the mid 700s and need help. My credit was 757 before I bought my car and had some medical issues (and fed into debt because I wasn't making enough pre covid.) My current cs is 673 which is slated to be 710 according to simulations on Credit Karma and if I pay off another $1,100 it will be 740! 

My current utilization as of now is dead 50% which will go down soon as I'm paying more then the minimum and getting a small bonus from work. 

My cards are as follows. 

Discover Cash Back. $2,300 Limit $4,500
GTE Financial Credit Card. $2,400 Limit $3,900. 
Merrick Ban. $750 Limit $2,100. My dad owes this balance and is considered paid off in 7 months or less. **
Capital One been with 3 years on one account. $340 Limit $600
Capital One Quicksilver Opened 4 months ago $0 Balance Limit $500. 

Car Loan 9 or 10 months in out of 75 at 4.3% for $23k which I used Discover for DP and scenario kinda made it happen. 

Income is around $24k with spending around max every month going towards insurance and payments. 

No college or student loans. Nothing outstanding debt wise aside from credit cards and car loan. 

Average age is 1 Year 3 Months. 

****My problem is I am hopefully within the next year or under I am paid off and I would like to consolidate my credit cards. The question is what can I consolidate. Should I try to increase my Discover and GTE Credit Limit and get rid of Merrick and both Capital One accounts once I'm down to near a 0 Balance on all 5?? The only downside is that Capital One #1 is my oldest account at 3 years 3 months and Merrick is #2 at 1 year 7 months.****

Important new note (seems to be like a common thing these days: The Federal Reserve adding items to it's balance sheet):

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, ""Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and
Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks,"" has been modified to include information on the Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and a new table 4 that provides supplemental information on all credit

Table 4, ""Information on Principal Accounts of Credit Facilities LLCs,"" was added to provide information
about outstanding principal amount of loans extended to LLCs by Reserve Banks. The table also provides
information on the net portfolio holdings of credit facilities LLCs including outstanding amounts of facility asset
purchases, Treasury contributions, and other assets.

gaming,Peoples thoughts on Nerfing on games.,"Probably a very unpopular opinion but we're all gamers and thats what is important! :) but anyway for my post:

For the past decade or so I feel like alot of developers have gone crazy with nerfing things such as weapons or equipment on their games which has literally made the game feel more of a grind than fun. 

I understand somethings did definitely need nerfing on certain games for example the Brute on Fortnite...

But for other things that are not game brakingly overpowered or impossible to beat such as certain weapons on COD for example I think they go nerf crazy and playing games I once had fun on just feels like no fun at all since they have too many nerfs.

Yes I get told that I'm a bad player a lot just because I disagree with the constant nerfing It's nothing to do with me being a bad player because I still manage to keep a positive K/D most of the time and play towards the objective at the same time and that includes BO4 and MW.
But the main fact is it honestly just doesnt feel fun anymore when things get constantly nerfed I mean fair enough people want to play competitively but that shouldn't have to affect those who want to play for fun. 

I know it would be impossible but I truly wish game developers would focus on both sides of gamers those who want to play competitively and those who just want to play for fun.

But anyway sorry for babbling on what is everyone elses thoughs on Nerfing on Games? :)",technology

personalfinance,Need Advice: Do I Lock In My Home Equity Loan Rate?,"*As you read this, bear in mind that I know squat-all about personal finance. Feel free to explain things to me in the most simplistic terms possible, like I am a 5 year old.*  

I took out an adjustable rate, home equity line of credit with Bank of America in Dec of 2018. According to my statements from that time, the opening interest rate during my first month was **3.990%.** 

At the time I opened the loan, the Bank of America rep told me that I could lock in the rate anytime I wanted to. Again, I know nothing about finance, but I have a notification I created on my phone that pops up every couple of weeks reminding me to look into this.  

So I noticed that my auto-payments on the loan dropped substantially the last couple of months, which of course I attributed to the pandemic. My rate, which was initially **3.990%**, climbed to as high as **4.624%** in January of this year, but then dropped all the way to ***3.125%*** in May. My current payment is nearly $100 full dollars below what it was in January.  

I called B of A to ask if now was a good time to lock that rate (not that I expect them to give me unbiased advice or anything). And the rep said that now is NOT a good time to lock, because if I did, I would not lock at my current adjustable rate of 3.125%. Rather, my lock rate would shoot all the way up to **6.25%** (because... reasons? Something about ""prime"" and ""blah blah blah"" and I'm not really sure what else). She recommended just sticking with the current adjustable rate, and explained that the only reason I would want to lock and let my rate jump up to 6.125% is if I thought that the adjustable rate would climb higher than that, which she says it almost certainly will not be doing *anytime* soon, what with the economy being where it is right now 

So anyway, is the rep right? Am I better off just sticking with the adjustable rates and enjoying the current low payments? Any thoughts, advice, or opinions is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Which loan should I focus on paying down?,"My husband and I recently bought a large piece of land that carries a relatively high interest rate of 5.875%. We put 20% down when we purchased and currently owe $175,000 on the loan. Our plan is to build a home on the property in 1-2 years. At which point we will need to take out a construction loan and eventually we would roll the land and construction loan into a mortgage once construction is complete (hopefully at a much lower interest rate).

We also have a 3.0% mortgage on our current home and owe approximately $87,000 on it (home value is probably around $150,000). We have no other debt. 

Before purchasing the land, we were making additional principal payments on our mortgage and were on track to have our house paid off in the next 3 years. Our goal was to pay off the house, move and keep the house as a potential rental property. We had to stop making additional principal payments on the house when we bought the land.

My husband recently got a new job and we will be able to make additional principal payments again. Should we make additional payments on our current mortgage or the land?

Logically, it seems to makes sense to pay off the higher interest loan first (the land) but if the loan will be converted into a lower interest rate loan in a few years (hopefully), does it still make sense to do so?

I paid taxes out of each paycheck, and I'm a single adult with no dependents, I don't make very much, and my returns are historically very simple. I have never owed taxes at the end of the year, I've always gotten returns. I tried searching the IRS's website for how to file past-year returns and just got a large index of downloadable forms and got kinda flustered. I also searched turbotax and they want me to pay ~$70 for past year's software to print and mail in tax forms.

I grew up in a single parent household, with 4 siblings, and absolutely zero discussion about money. My family was poor, as a single parent with rotating jobs would be, and myself and my siblings were taught nothing about the value of money and saving. My parent is approaching 60 with no financial assets to their name, and I do not want to end up in a similar situation by any means. I would love to be able to help my parent when I get older. 

 I recently turned 34, and don't want to be financially illiterate anymore. My financial situation is as follows

1. $75k LIRA account (transfered from a government pension upon leaving the service). This is sitting in a DISA account with my bank, entirely un-invested right now.
2. $25k personal RRSP account. Sitting in a DISA account with my bank, entirely un-invested. 
3. $2k TFSA. Sitting in my bank account, entirely un-invested. 
4. $40k cash, sitting in my savings / checking account in my bank. Also not invested in any way. 

I have a couple of debts to my name. 

1. I hold a $6,000 Visa card, which I use for all of my purchases. I pay this off every pay day (two times per month), and so never hold a balance. 
2. I have a small vehicle loan (Initially $8k, at 0% financing), which I owe roughly $2,500 on. I haven't really considered paying this off, as it was financed at 0% and don't know what the benefit of this would be. I am under the assumption that having open loans and making payments is good for credit, and so I've just kept it open for the time being.
3. I also have a personal line of credit with my bank in the amount of $40k. This doesn't have a balance. It was initially used to transfer my $6k credit card balance over in order to pay a lower interest rate (I had a near maxed out credit card for some time in my early twenties). I don't know why I was approved for $40k, but the bank just sort of handed it to me.
4. My current credit rating, the last I checked, was 849. 

How I got here I couldn't tell you. I have been considerate of money, growing increasingly more so as I age. But I don't know how to handle larger sums of money, or plan for a day when I do not need to work anymore.

I currently make around $40k net each year, but will be seeing YOY increases as I work through a well paid trades apprenticeship. I will be making closer to $65/yr net in 3-4 years time.

What I really want to do in the short term, is invest my LIRA / RRSP / TFSA accounts in a way that will help set me up to retire in 25-30 years. This is where I am wondering; should I seek a financial advisor at my bank? Should I read some books on Finance? Should I seek a private financial advisor? I really don't know what to do with this sum. 

Also, the $40k I have in cash in my accounts, what do I do with this? I was planning on opening a business this summer, right before COVID really picked up, and was planning on needing roughly $15k to launch. I am fortunate that I didn't pull the trigger earlier, as the business would have failed before launch if that were the case. And as it stands, I would still like to open a business in the near future. Should I maintain cash on hand for this purpose? Or just open a business line of credit when that time comes and finance most of it, saving the cash for if it doesn't work?

I know this might be considered rambling, and I apologize if this is the case. But I really do need help here, and even a finger pointed in the right direction of who I should seek would be greatly appreciated.

Honesty is appreciated here. 

Thank you all for you time. 

Stay safe out there.

personalfinance,huge tax problem... seeking ideas (USA),"*Throwaway account obviously, this is a somewhat delicate matter so I will try to explain the situation anonymously but in enough detail for relevant tax advice.*

Early in 2019 I exercised a number of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) in my company, (a company that is/was planning to IPO) with the notion of using long term capital gains on their future sale and with the expectation that I would not trigger AMT in 2019. 

Late in 2019 I received a very large (and unexpected) bonus. Cool right? Oh god no!

Here's the problem now: 

I received a salary of \~$300K USD in 2019. I then received a bonus of \~$300K USD in 2019.

The options I exercised based on cost to me versus Fair Market Value had a difference in value of  \~$600K USD which has been reported to the IRS so that now I had an ""income"" in 2019 of \~$1.2M and I trigger AMT (being an income &gt; $1M.) 

I now owe AMT on \~$1.2M USD of taxable income, despite having only seen and banked $600K of actual cash income. I now owe &gt; $200K to the IRS (that in addition to the \~$190K I'm already paying for normal income on the first $600K.)

Here's the real catch: the company is private: I cannot sell the options, they are not public, there is no secondary market. I cannot liquidate my options to use that cash to pay my &gt;$200K unexpected tax bill (so please don't suggest I do.)

Now here's the good news: I understand that in 2020 I can get that amount of extra AMT credited back  (assuming I don't also trigger AMT for 2020 which with no IPO on the horizon in 2020 either is &gt;95% likely) but meanwhile that means:

1) right now I owe &gt;$200K to the IRS that I don't have on hand (without liquidating stuff at cost to me)

personalfinance,Bank returned rent check before direct deposit on same day,"Hello everyone this is my first post here. I have a checking account at PenFed Credit union. I received a direct deposit to this account on June 16 (night between June 15 and 16) and had a check drawn for June 16 as well for my rent. The rent check was $1020, the direct deposit was $2500 or thereabouts. The balance in the account before was $20. So on 16th I see four things posted-first a $1020 debit for the rent echeck, then a $1020 credit for the returned rent echeck, then a $30 NSF fee and then the $2500 direct deposit, in that order. So the rent was not paid and I got hit with fees both by PenFed and my landlord because of this. I was under the impression direct deposits are available immediately which it was actually and also that deposits are posted before withdrawals. Apparently that’s not true? Couldn’t find transaction posting order in PenFed account policy, but for example Chase says that deposits are always before withdrawal on same day. Anything I can do about this?",finance

investing,Executive Order 6102,"On April 5, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates. 

Quoting wikipedia
&gt; The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve which prevented it from increasing the money supply during the depression; the Federal Reserve Act (1913) required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit (in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes) that could be backed by the gold in its possession (see Great Depression).

The decree was reversed in 1974 by President Gerard Ford.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;III.C. The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**

&amp;#x200B;

Next, turn to page 16: **III.D. Vulnerabilities of Warehouse Funding,** to keep it simple its the equavlant to adding stop loss to every warehouse line of credit (which are used to fund mortgages). Since the margin call is on the loan for the mortgage instead of the mortgage itself, we don't see forclosures yet, but instead the margin call money is funded by the repo. Shawdow banks take the margin call. They pay the call via repo loan and pay that back via bonds, hence why the fed is buying those, junk bonds to be specific

&gt;Ginnie Mae servicers can only obtain unsecured financing, such as **unsecured corporate bonds**, to cover their advances. The rates on this financing are high, especially because many nonbanks have highyield credit ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** most high risk mortgages(over 50% of total mortgages) that a bank wouldn't lend, was lent by shadow banks via a link of credit from the banks. Banks have tight stop losses set on these and have been issuing margin calls on tons of them.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Two Loans, a home, and surplus income.","Hi all. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around what the best option is to get the most out of some surplus income/savings I’ve been accumulating and was hoping to get some advice here.

I currently have two loans - one car loan ($10K @ $285/month), one student loan ($22K @ $260/month) both at around a 4% interest rate. Currently the student loan is in forbearance until November because of COVID, so I’m paying nothing with 0% interest until then on that loan.

I’ve got a Roth IRA for retirement, a good emergency fund, and now, some extra savings. I’m looking to purchase a home at some point this year and was originally going to put somewhere between 0-5% down as a first time buyer promotion through my credit union.

So my question here is: What should I focus on doing - getting rid of the car loan as soon as possible, paying down the student loan while it’s in forbearance with no interest rate, or continue my monthly payments as planned and put it into a bigger down payment for the home? I have about $8-10K to place money where makes the most sense at the current moment, but expect more to trickle in.

Ideally once I get rid of the car loan, I’d like to continue putting that money toward savings for another car, but the student loan would be helpful to get rid of faster as I could transfer that monthly payment into a bigger monthly payment for a home. I’d like to move up a little in my home buying price range (currently looking at around $215k, would like to be closer to $230-240k) so I’m trying to figure out strategically what the best place is to put my money into so I’m able to afford that payment a bit easier. Or even if I’m not thinking of something that could yield better results, I’m all ears! Any insight is much appreciated, thank you!",finance

Hello and welcome back! Now, I'm going to try to make this one a bit longer and finish Poni Island next part or the one after. You know I listen to communist songs while I write these. Like, I've listened to every official Soviet anthem like 20 times(each). I'm listening to it as I write these very words. Of course, there's other stuff like ""March of the United Front"", ""Workers of Vienna"", ""The Warsawian"", ""March of the Volunteers"", all the fun stuff. I don't know, it's just thinking music(it puts me in the totalitarian mood). But anyways, this series is not for those who can't stomach something mildly risque, so if your eyes water at the sight of mild swear words and dark themes I suggest clicking off. Without further ado, let's begin.

XXXX=Player Name Placeholder

When we left the gang off, they had gotten off Melemele and landed at Poni, beating up the Plasma grunts that showed up.

This time on Yugi-oh, we begin with Lillie, Gladion, and yourself getting off the boat. Plumeria hangs around and takes you back to Melemele if need be, though she lands in a hidden cove at the northern end of the island and you can't enter Hau'Oli(also there are random Red Shirt patrols that stop you. The main idea is to discourage you from returning.)

Returning to Poni, Seafolk Village is kind of a middle class sort of area. Not a slum, but not any rich people either. There are still Pokemon themed boats that have things such as restaurants inside of them(and even citizens supportive of your anti-communist crusade that give you items). But Seafolk Village is mostly irrelevant to the plot(and Exeggutor Island with be locked until the post game), so let's move on.

The routes above Seafolk(the Wilds, I think they're called)are quite different. Where the route would there is a massive brick wall separating the area from whatever is beyond. The whole area looks like a homeless shelter, with tents hugging the wall and some lucky individuals owning permanent shelters(hugging the big brick wall, of course). The place is somehow worse than the Melemele slums. There are Red Shirts standing guard on top of the wall and a few dragging people away to the right of the screen(y'know, in broad daylight).

Going through the area, you exit out to where Hapu's house would normally be. This is where the area suddenly gets nicer. No rich people, no poor people, just nature. Oh yeah, also the entrance to whatever is inside the wall. It is quite heavily manned, half Plasma grunts and the other half Red Shirts(six people in total). You walk over to them to see if you can get in.

Plasma Grunt: Sorry, no children are allowed into here.

Gladion pulls out his family photo. The Plasma Grunt takes it, chuckles, and rips it up.

Gladion: Oh, you little-

Lillie: Stop it! What do you think you're going to do!

Gladion takes a deep breath and steps back, though, not before spitting in the direction of the Plasma Grunt. Your group steps to the side.

Gladion: So we have to find a way in.

Lillie: Why?

Gladion: Because the key to destabilizing Poni has to be in there, right? It's gotta be.

Lillie: You know, we could just go back to...you know, nevermind.

There is a short pause.

Gladion: Soooo...there's two ways to go, and three of us. I'll go down to the beach(where you'd normally find the shrine to Tapu Fini at the end)and Lillie and XXXX can go up through the canyon. When you two are done, come back to the boat. We'll make a plan there.

Gladion walks off towards the beach. You and Lillie start up the canyon.

Lillie: Well...um, do you have a plan.

You tell her not yet.

Lillie: As I thought.

You give her a glare.

Lillie: I'm sorry, it's just, I know my mother is tyrant, and who knows what she'd do to us if we returned, but I still strangely miss her. I know it's sort of strange, but...

She trails off. You tell her you understand.

Lillie: Well, your mother isn't a saint either.

You give her a confused look.

Lillie: You haven't thought about that? Just two months ago she ordered the execution of twenty ""traitors"".

You go bug-eyed

Lillie: In fact, after the harbor thing, Plumeria told me your mother had all the grunts killed.

You raise your hand in a ""stop"" gesture.

Lillie: Oh, yeah, I understand.

There is an awkward pause. This continues until what would normally be the entrance to the canyon(past the place you'd normally have Hapu's grand trial)and there is a fork in the road. The whole area just has an uneasy atmosphere. It doesn't seem to bother Lillie, though.

Lillie: You go right, I go left.

Without any time to process what she said, she pushes forward. She's trying to act strong, though her shaky walk doesn't help prove it.

Without any other thing to do you go right. You barely go into the place when you hear this:

Lillie: AAAAAAHHhhhh-(or some sort of scream)

You immediately backtrack to the path Lillie took and see the scene. A man dressed in black(kind of like a criminal suit)and another man in an official looking uniform(similar to the Red Shirts)are around Lillie. It's hard to describe, but imagine Lillie's on the floor, with the man in black pressing really hard on her back and putting his other hand on her mouth and the other man is trying to catch Lillie's flailing arms. The second man also has a pair of handcuffs attached to his belt.

Plasma Elite: Plasma and Government business, go away!

Red Shirt Captain: This girl is a criminal of the highest order!

You step forward instead.

Red Shirt Captain: Your escalation of the situation is yet another federal arrest! Go deal with that kid!

Plasma Elite: On it!

This would be a pseudo-boss battle. The Plasma Elites are pretty much wearing their B2W2 uniforms and are tougher than your usual grunts. And of course, there would be remixed a B2W2 grunt battle theme. No matter how cool his uniform, he is still trying to detain a young girl, and he is defeated.

Plasma: P-p-plasma!

Red Shirt: Why do you morons always say that when you lose? Whatever, you're obviously too incompetent to defeat a child. So have at me!

This would be another pseudo-boss battle, this time with a Red Shirt Captain. Their battle theme is kind of like the classic Soviet anthem that people seem to like, so of course this commie loses.

Red Shirt Captain: Ummmm...we gotta report back to Mrs. Mina, I guess.

Plasma Elite: I guess so.

These two don't run off. They just slowly walk off with hunched backs further up the canyon. Lillie gets up from the floor.

Lillie: *Gasp*, they just attacked me! from nowhere!

There is a pause as Lillie brushes herself off.

Lillie: Can I...walk with you?

You smile and nod your head.

You can choose to go left or right on the path, they both go to the same place. And Lillie will follow behind you(she keeps up with your pace, no annoying escort mission required)and will heal you three times(so be sparing).

Now, the paths are slightly different:

The right path take you down and makes you follow a river. Eventually the big wall from earlier makes it so you have to turn right and go back up the canyon and into where the Dragon Trial would normally take place.

The left path is more like the original games, being dry and being made of rock. It isn't particularly interesting, just thugs to beat up and a few tents on the side. But eventually it leads you to where the Dragon Trial would be.

(Side note-though it's a bit random to say now, I'd like to say that in this game there would be no HM's, Ride Pokemon, or any equivalent. It would rely on the pacing and story to tell you where to go.)

The area would still be a glorified hallway. The alter with the crystal is broken and there aren't any more crystals, so no Dragnium-Z(yet).

Entering the area where the Altar of the Sunne or Moone would normally be...is a mystery for later!

personalfinance,Assessing different providers of mortgage refinancing,"We're now in a place where refinancing our mortgage makes a lot of sense - but the thing I'm trying to figure out now is which how to decide which lender to go with.

I've been assuming it's all about price shopping for the mix of the best interest rate / fees.  But I've been seeing three tiers of options and now I'm not so sure.  

* Option 1: Lowest rate from a local mortgage broker that claims no fees and 2.5% on a 15 Yr
* Option 2: Great options from lenders via Costco, with low $800 fees and 2.75% on a 15 Yr
* Option 3: My current lender (BofA) with $3,600 fees and 3% on a 15 Yr

The best option looks like #1... but seems too good to be true.  

So my question is, what else should I look to in order to make my decision?  We've never refinanced before so not sure on what other criteria to look at or other questions to ask.

personalfinance,Need help understanding my financial situation and tackling debt,"Hey everyone. I recently found myself wanting to make an affordable, but definitely not negligible, impulse buy of a new guitar (~$600), but stopped myself because my financial situation is kind of weird and I don't wanna screw up. 

The tl;dr is that I have a ton of student debt but I am managing it well while building up savings at the same time. But I don't know what next steps I should be taking.

I'll first try to summarize what all I'm working with here:

- I'm a 23 y/o male, 1 year out of college (1 year at this company)
- I make ~4150/mo pre-tax and about 3k after 401k and taxes
- I receive up to a 5% bonus at the end of the year, which is not factored in.
- I currently only contribute 2% to my 401k, and only became eligible for the plan this January
- My employer has a generous match of 100% up to 5%, 2 more years until vested
- Current total balance across all bank accounts is a little over $15.5k
- I recently opened up a few lines of credit and my score is currently in the mid 700s

And my kryptonite, I owe ~108k in student debt.

 - 81k is private loans @ 5.852% for 20 years. This is post-refinance. Monthly amount owed is $594 (paying $650). Previously this was 3 loans across 2 lenders averaging ~11.2% for 15 years. 
-27k is private loans averaging 4.4% for 10 years. Monthly amount owed is $297 (pay $300)

- Expenses are:
    - $700/mo for rent
    - $950/mo student loans
    - $200/mo average on all utilities
    - $150-$175/month on food (Thanks Aldi)
    - $100/month on gas
    - $18/mo renters insurance
    - $12/mo YouTube Premium subscription
    - Going to start my own car insurance paymets 
       in October -&gt; TBD
    - I've been trying to ween myself off of my.      
              family's cell plan and Netflix but have met 
              resistance from my mom (lol)

So like, now what? 

I know it looks like I should be tackling my debt first, but right now I'm able to live comfortably while saving up a fair bit. This is largely thanks to living in a cheap city. And I tend to be afraid to spend money. If you don't count the Martin guitar I bought earlier this year. But that was my first big purchase since starting my job last May, and it was definitely time for an upgrade.

Anyway, I've upped my loan payments from the minimum to where they're at now to knock some years off of this, but I really don't think I should throw
a lump sum at the loans just yet. I think my first plan of action should be to maximize my employer 401k match. But maybe I'm wrong. 

So here are my actual questions:

- I'd like to invest, but not necessarily for retirement. Am I in a situation that lends me to that possibility? I'd been considering putting $5k into a mutual/index fund and growing that over the next 10 years with the help of monthly deposits to kill this debt faster. Are there better options?
- I've been told Roth IRAs are great, and would like to open one at some point. Should I hold off until I'm sitting on more cash before doing that?
- I'm worried I'm blatantly missing out on a financial move I can make now that will seriously benefit me in the future. Is there more than this that I can be doing?
- Would it make sense to refinance a second time for lower rates now that my credit is stronger?
- Is inflation helping me out if I extend my loan deadline and get a lower interest rate?

I'm pretty much open to any suggestions. Thanks for reading my book!",finance

personalfinance,Are these good refinance rates for California currently?,"Currently, I am looking at 2 separate offers at 15 year fixed for a 109K loan:

Wondering how good these offers are in California currently, im in zip code 93013. 

Both banks told me that the rates are slightly higher due to the loan amount being less than 200K.   
Not looking for the absolute best rate, as long as they are good, I'm happy. But if it would be pretty easy to find a bit better rate with lower closing costs, I do have the time to do so.

Also, are there any other numbers I should be focusing on beside the interest rate and total closing costs?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off auto loan early?,"Hi all, I’m looking at getting an auto learn due to the interest rates being so low right now but had a question about early payments.

Does making extra payments reduce the overall principal amount and thus reduces my monthly payment? Or would this instead reduce the months in the loan?

For example if I have a $500 monthly payment, and I make an extra $500 monthly payment that month - is this extra payment reducing the duration of the loan by one month? Or is this reducing the principal/interests and thus reducing my next monthly payment?

personalfinance,Understanding the new W4 and my new status,"I'm writing this with the hope that someone can help me better understand how to fill out the new W4 in light of my new filing status. 

I got married last July. At the time, my wife was back in school and not working, so I opted to keep my W4 as it had been up to that point. For 2019, I filed at the single rate, with two withholdings. I ended up owing the IRS $45.00, which was fine.

As of June 8th, my wife is back at work. Huzzah! So I've now changed my status to ""Married, Filing Jointly."" But I can't figure out the new W4 to save my life. We only have the two jobs, we don't have any dependents, and we don't have any income outside of the jobs. I expect we'll take the standard deduction. (I make $40,000 more than my wife if that matters.) Thus, on my new W-4, I only filled out steps 1 and 5.

This past Tuesday, I got my first paycheck following changing my status. My federal tax withheld went from $389 to $230. That seems...steep. I'd like to avoid a huge bill from the IRS next year, but I'd also like to getting too big of a refund. Breaking even, or coming close to it, as I did in 2019, is my goal.

So...I'm confused. Should I go back and fill out a new W-4 where I enter something into step 4 (c) extra withholding? Leave it be? Something else entirely? Thanks for any of you willing to weigh in.

tldr: I can't figure out the new W4 since changing to ""Married, Filing Jointly.""",finance

personalfinance,EE Savings Bonds Cashed for Education Expenses,"Last year around Christmas time my parents were doing some cleaning and came across an envelope with about $2500 worth of savings bonds purchased for me between 1996 and 1997. My dad mentioned that if I were to put the money towards education expenses, the cashed out bonds would not be subjected to the federal income tax. My wife and I had to take out a student loans to cover the last year of her graduate school, so this is what we wanted to put them towards since it is more than likely our last and only education expense. I’ve read the treasury direct website about eligibility requirements to exempt the bonds from income tax, but I am not exactly sure what to do to make sure I complete this process correctly. Is it as simple as filling out an additional form at tax time text year? Any advice or help would be much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Can you rate our financial situation.,"So, as of the last 2 years I have been very mindful and trying to fix our finances and our financial future. I would like to hear how you guys would rate our situation and what you would do differently, if anything. 

We are 28 years old, married, and have an 8 month old. 

We owe 371k on a ~470k home at 4.325% (might move in ~5 years).

We collectively bring home 9,600 a month after tax and health insurance. 

We are currently not contributing to retirement (as of October 2019) because we are focusing on paying down debt. 

We have around 50k collectively in retirement accounts, my wife is paying into a pension. 

We owe 7,900 on a 2019 car, worth 24-26k now, which will be paid up this month and will free up 467 dollars extra a month. 

I have 84k In student loans.

54k at 4.9% for 20 years paying 360 a month (just refinance again.)

30k federal loans ranging from 2-6%

Our plan is as follows:

Pay off truck this month, free up the 467 a month. Wait until September (my wife’s a teacher and we will be using her end of the year check to pay off truck). 

Come September we will start contributing 10% each (for now) back into our retirement and 250 a month for our sons 529.

During this we will be slowly paying down my student loans with maybe an extra 500-1000 a month and putting the rest of our income into savings. 

We currently have been following Dave Ramsey so we only have 1000 emergency fund. I am a nurse and she is a teacher. We have reduced our debt from 166k to around 85k in 8 months. 

How does this plan sound? Would you do anything differently? Thanks in advance guys, just trying to pick your brains and see if We are on the right track to become financially stable and safe in our future. Cheers!",finance

personalfinance,How fast should I pay off my student loan?,"Im sure this is always asked, but everyone's financial situation is different. 

So I just refinanced my student loans and I am curious as to what is the smarter decision in the long run. Pay off the loans quicker now, or pay the monthly balance. For reference, I just refinanced my loan of $50,000 from a 15 yr loan at 9.6% int, to a 10 yr loan at 4% int. Monthly payment would be around $580 but I've always put about $1200 at it a month. 

My situation. 
I'm 23 and single, still live at home. 
Have well over 10k in savings as a cushion. 
Engineering salary of 75k/yr (bring home is typically about 4k/month after 401k and benefits)
Truck payment $350/mnth
Federal std loan $200/mnth
Few other small bills like phone bill etc, but they dont take a big chunk like my others so we will negate them. 

I get paid twice a month, and typically use my first check for bills/allowance and just save the second one. 

So with my salary, and living at home (for now) would it be smarter for me to just pound out my student loans now. Putting $1200 a month on it I have will get them paid off in about 4 years I think I figured out. Or would it be wiser to pay the monthly payment for 10 yrs, and save more money now. I could do either, but what would be wiser?

Bitcoin,The long-term viability of bitcoin,"Okay, someone please help me understand why this would not be the case:

To me, bitcoin's only problem is that as it increases in popularity, the incentive for the state to destroy or outlaw or regulate bitcoin out of existence will increase in direct proportion to that popularity. The state obsessively protects its monopoly on two things- violence and monetary policy. Bitcoin adoption is a direct threat to state monopoly over monetary policy control. 

At a certain point, when bitcoin becomes popular enough, not only does it begin to choke off massive revenue streams at the retail banking levels (which could easily be remedied by retail bank adoption of btc which will likely happen), it disrupts the state's control over money. The state will not allow that. 

I cannot see bitcoin ever getting to a stage where it allows for monetary freedom on a large scale. So long as the percent adoption is less than \[some number\], it is not seen for the threat it could be. As soon as it crosses a certain threshold, it will be attacked technically and/or through regulation. What am I missing?",cryptocurrency

We have plenty of savings to pay the down payment and monthly payments until the job starts. We’d really like to buy now to take advantage of super low interest rates and avoid potential home price increases.

The question is: can we get a traditional mortgage to buy a house if we don’t plan to use it as our primary residence for another year and rent it out until we are ready to move in? Our realtor is a friend who helped us sell our house in Texas before coming back to school. He said that if the house isn’t our primary residence, the mortgage will be different as it will be like an investment property. Is that correct?",finance

gaming,My two cents on The Last of Us Part 2 hate (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),"If what I say in this post is in correct than please let me know :)

So I’ve been seeing a lot of great things said about this game and I’ve been seeing a lot of hate towards it as well. I’ll be honest I’ve never played this one nor the first one so I could be totally wrong about this but it sounds to me like a lot of the hate is due to a homosexual sex scene? Again maybe I’m wrong but I know for a fact that I have seen atleast 2 or 3 posts, specifically hating on the gay sex scene. And the posts also had a decent amount of commenters agreeing with the OP so I’m just assuming that, that’s the reason for a good amount of the hate. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I, a heterosexual male, really don’t care to see two males getting it on. I don’t find the male body attractive in any way and so I just kind of feel awkward when something like that comes on the screen. However though I don’t play/watch things for the sex scenes either though. And I’m able to judge a form of media on whether it’s good or not, without thinking about the sex scenes. 

However, how can TLOU2 receive so much hate for having homosexual sex scenes in it when not but a few years ago, game of thrones was considered the best thing to have ever been created? GoT had plenty of gay sex scenes! Ones that really weren’t necessary to the story. 

Now I understand that some people just really don’t like to see that stuff, cool than either this game isn’t for you or be prepared to hit that skip button (again I’ve never played it. Not sure if it has one but surely you can look away or something if your that sensitive to it) but you can the math! If over half the world loved GoT despite the gay sex and then over half the world hates TLOU2 due to gay sex, then obviously some of you people don’t know how to make your own opinions... just saying. Maybe I get downvoted like motherfucker for this post but I’m honestly try a little fed up with the way people have been acting towards EVERYTHING lately. I just figured this was a safe place to let my frustration out lol. It’s just a game and me speaking my mind won’t be hurting anyone lol

Again: if I’m wrong about this, please feel free to let me know!",technology
personalfinance,Does it make sense to Refi?,"I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to refi with the low interest rates. I'm not particularly concerned with monthly payments. I want to save money over the life of the loan. Here are some numbers:

Current Mortgage:

Originated in June of 2014. 30 years at 4.5% for 200,000. Current balance is 178,619.70. I've paid about $51,000 in interest so far. Total interest paid at the end of the loan will be $164.809.

Refi option 1:

15 years at 2.365% Closing cost is 9487. Lenders credit would be 692. Cost to close = . I would borrow this mount on top of the current balance of 178,619 coming out to 187,414. Total interest paid over life of loan $35,404

Refi option 2 :

15 years at 2.5% Closing cost is 9487. Lenders credit would be 1869. Cost to close = 7618. Again, I would borrow this amount on top of current balance of 178,619 coming out to $186,237. Total interest paid over life of loan 37,312.

I know 30 year mortgages are a hedge against inflation, but it looks like I can cut the interest paid over the life of the loan by about half. Thanks for any input!",finance

It was strange to me that they were so reluctant to tell me the price or the interest rate on the loan. Long story short......after several back and forths, they asked if i would sign papers if they could provide the following...$50,000 price out the door, a $10,000 down payment, and $600/month x 72 months. I said i would sign for that and we are meeting tomorrow. But when i put those numbers in an online auto loan calculator (@ 6% interest which they said was my rate) I'm getting $663.

personalfinance,Help With the Refi Math!,"Hello!

I need some help with the REFI Maths. Our goal is pay the same each month, and we are considering moving some from the mortgage to investments.

Wifey and I spit our mortgage. Currently 12 years left on a loan, 85K left with a mortage payment of 748(plus taxes and insurance of course) . Interest rate is 3.875. We already have more than 80% equity in the home, depending on valuation it might be close to 50% equity. 

Got quoted a 15 year refit at 2.875-&gt; would free up some cash flow as the mortgage payment goes down to 562, freeing up $166 a month to invest.

Alternatively we could refit to a 30 year at 3% or 3.1%(I can't remember) and bring the payment down to like 365. That would allow an additional $383 a month to invest.

We would 100% invest the extra cash, as we have no need for it.  Likely into a target date fund to keep it super out of our hands. We already have good emergency savings, put into our ira's and 401k like we should.. etc. We are getting quoted a bit under 3k upfront to do the refi.",finance
personalfinance,Is it dumb to take out a personal loan when you have the cash in the bank?,"My wife and I are saving for a house.  I have accumulated about 10g.  She has more than me, but she also makes more money than me.  Between the two of us we're in a position to purchase something this year.

So, here's the basis of my question: I am a very serious mountain biker.  I have been doing it for almost 20 years and I've competed in race series in the past.  The last time I bought a bike was 7 years ago, and it's just time for a new one. The bike I get will end up costing me about $3500 after I sell my old bike.

So, I have 3 options; 

1: Just buy the bike with cash I already have, which would take a good chunk out of my savings.

2: Save up the $3500 in addition to what I already have, which would put house savings on hold for a few months

3: Take out a personal loan which would a) get me the bike I want without dipping in to savings and b) only cost me like $100 a month allowing me to still save heavily for a house


I'm sure you can guess which option I'm leaning towards.  I'm actually a pretty financially savvy person and generally I am against the idea of loans or financing...but in this case, with interest rates being so low, it seems to make sense to me.

Currently, I have $2.5k in credit card debt and $6k in a medical loan with a \~24% and \~13.25% interest rate, respectively speaking. I've been making monthly installments, paying as much as I can from work.

My friend knows and understands my financial situation and understands that having financial stress can hinder my work performance, so he's offered to refinance my debt as he received a business loan at 3.5% interest and is offering it to me at 6%.

1. Should I take the offer considering my APR of my debt, or would that jeopardize our friendship/work relationship?
2. If I were to refinance with him, what precautions should I take besides a loan agreement?

CryptoCurrency,Why it's probably not a good idea to earn interest with the funding fee on Bitmex,"I have been doing video's reviewing the options to earn interest in the crypto space, while researching the interest rate you might get on bitmex I was surprised to find that it was'nt that great.

If you are not sure how to make interest on Bitmex check out my video posted at the bottom.

https://imgur.com/5sshP26

As you can see the only time you would of got a good rate is in 2017, and in that year btc went up 1300% which likely inflated the rate.

If we ignore 2017 you would of actually lost 0.5% over the 3 years.

While this is a bad indictment of earning interest on Bitmex it does mean that you would of been paid to go long on leverage, something any trader dreams of.  Finally minus interest rates for the masses.

Ultimately I think if you believe the crypto market will rise, you are better off buying crypto (maybe on Bitmex, risky).

If you believe the market will fall, it is better to sell your crypto and lend out the funds, on say bitfinex, binance or other sites. Or even short on bitmex if you are feeling wild.

personalfinance,Is buying a condo mid-conversion/renovation worth the risk?,"Recently entered into contract to purchase a condo that I really like. It's still in the early stages of conversion and the building owner is essentially converting+renovating one unit at a time as tenants move out, and they expect to be finished with the whole complex by the end of the year. Here's the issue - I'm one of the first to consider buying a unit on the property, so it doesn't currently meet a certain owner occupancy threshold,  and that makes the condo non-warrantable. This means that I need to provide a larger down-payment than I was expecting as well as pay a higher interest rate on the loan. All this makes the purchase much more difficult for me financially, but still doable. Part of the reason I was interested in this property is because it is located in a part of town I expect to appreciate, and after full renovation and conversion of the building, the value of my unit can be expected to increase. The city as a whole is growing very quickly too.

I'm going to have to sell some assets that I didn't want to let go of in order to pay for the down payment, and considering paying an extra fee for an interest rate reduction from 4.125% to 3.500% as well. That's compared to 3% flat interest rate if I were to find a different property. I'd only have to pay $250 to back out of the contract and find a different place with better financing options for me.

# **The stock market is running out of steam with reopening trades fading and economic data ‘uneven’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/the-stock-market-is-running-out-of-steam-with-reopening-trades-fading-and-economic-data-uneven.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.
*****
&gt; The stock market, so eager to put the entire blow from the pandemic behind it, is now coming to terms that a “V-shaped” recovery might be too rosy a scenario. 
*****
&gt; With recent spikes in coronavirus cases and fluctuations in the economic data, the market seems to be stuck in a range amid elevated volatility. Market analysts said investors should expect more turbulence ahead because the economic recovery is most likely to be bumpy.
*****
&gt; “The market was priced for a continuation of improvement and I think that’s overstating what’s going to happen,” said Brian Levitt, Invesco’s global market strategist. “We are going to have episodes of cases rising. We are going to have a very slow and uneven improvement in the jobs market.”
*****
&gt; After soaring more than 40% from the March lows, the S&amp;P 500 turned sideways in the past two weeks, trading at similar levels to early June. The market, which used to turn a blind eye to disastrous news on the thinking that the economy had already bottomed, has become more vulnerable to negative economic headlines as the data begins to give a read on the shape of the recovery.
*****
&gt; Stocks came under pressure earlier this week after data showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week, and the number stayed above 1 million for the 13th consecutive week. 
*****
&gt; And on the virus front, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona have reported an uptick in new infections and hospitalizations amid the reopening. Apple said Friday that it’s again closing some stores in Florida, North Carolina and Arizona due to the spikes in coronavirus cases, which sparked a sell-off in the market, especially among retail stocks.
*****
&gt; “The economy is going to need more help to bounce back in months to come,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “For now, volatility and choppy markets remain our base case as an uneven economic recovery likely unfolds.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Rolling Ws’
&gt; The rally in those popular reopening trades — airlines, cruise lines and hotels — is seemingly losing steam. Shares of American Airlines and Delta posted their second straight weekly losses. So did Carnival, Norwegian Cruise and MGM Resorts. Those stocks were once the high-beta leaders of the market comeback as investors bet that a successful reopening would take hold. 
*****
&gt; “Although the stock market was suggesting a V-shaped recovery, the more likely scenario is rolling Ws,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.
*****
&gt; A similar market pattern happened during the financial crisis, pointed out by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. After stocks rallied nearly 40% from the 2009 bottom, the market was range-bound for about seven weeks so the fundamentals could catch up, Colas noted.
*****
&gt; From a technical perspective, Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, is watching if the S&amp;P 500 can break above its recent high of 3,232 or drop below the 3,000 threshold or its 200-day moving average of 3,018 as of Friday.
*****
&gt; “Whichever way it breaks...should be an very important development in trying to determine how this critical juncture in the stock market will be resolved,” Maley said in a note.
*****
&gt; # Fed can’t prevent volatility
&gt; While the flattening virus curve played a big role in the market rebound, it’s no denying that the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented stimulus has been a key driver in lifting stocks from the coronavirus slump. The central bank unleashed another weapon in its arsenal this week, saying it will start buying individual corporate bonds.
*****
&gt; As comforting as it is to have the Fed’s support, the central bank can only do so much to ease investor fears.
*****
&gt; “The Fed can’t prevent the volatility we’re seeing in stocks,” Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said in a note. “It will likely take years for the economy to fully recover and there remain other uncertainties on the path ahead. As such, investors may continue to struggle with this mismatch between markets and the economy before seeing the case for new highs.”
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reminded investors again this week in his semiannual testimony before Congress that “significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery.”
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street have also warned that extended policy measures including injection of trillions of cheap money would lead to problems down the road such as hyperinflation.

# 100 Days

&gt; 100 days ago today on March 11th, the WHO made it official and declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Markets were already under a lot of pressure before the WHO declared the pandemic, but the 100 days since will probably go down as some of the craziest 100 days we'll ever experience, not only in the market but in general society as well. More than enough ink and pixels have been spent discussing the societal impact at large, so we'll spare you and just focus on the markets.

&gt; While much of the declines were already in the rearview mirror by the time the WHO made its announcement, equities still had a steep decline in the immediate aftermath. The large-cap Russell 1000, for example, fell another 19% to its March 23rd closing low, but after the rebound, the net change since the pandemic was officially declared &gt; has been a gain of 14.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Russell-1000.png))**

&gt; As impressive as the Russell 1000's gain has been in the face of the global pandemic, many stocks have done a lot better than that. The table below lists the 25 stocks in the index that have seen the biggest gains so far during this pandemic. Topping the list is Wayfair (W) which has rallied more than 350%. If there is one thing Americans must have realized while they were stuck at home under lockdown it was that they needed some new furniture! Behind Wayfair, two other stocks have more than tripled and both were beaten down stocks from the Energy sector that were trading at less than $2 per share on March 11th. A number of familiar names standout including Moderna (MRNA), Twilio (TWLO), DocuSign (DOCU), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Etsy (ETSY), but looking through the list, there's really a diverse group of names ranging from bombed-out stocks from the Energy sector (8 stocks), Consumer names (7 stocks), and the ever-popular software stocks from the Technology sector (6 stocks). It's definitely been a rocky road for the markets over the last 100 days, but for anyone who had these names in their portfolio, they aren't complaining.

Relative to their 50-DMAs, all 24 S&amp;P 500 industry groups still have rising 50-DMAs. When you consider the fact that the 50-day window spans the period going back to early April, a period encompassing most of what was one of the strongest 50-day rallies on record, the fact that every industry group has a rising 50-DMA isn't all that surprising.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Rising-50DMA.png))**

&gt; Even though all their 50-DMAs are rising, not every industry group is currently trading above its 50-DMA. While the reading briefly reached 100% in late May and early June, two industry groups have since pulled back below their 50-DMAs, putting the percentage at a still impressive 91.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Above-50-DMA.png))**

&gt; The table below summarizes industry group performance showing YTD performance, where each one is trading relative to its 50-DMA, as well as where the group is trading relative to its 52-week high.

&gt; As mentioned above, all but two groups (Drugs &amp; Biotech and Food &amp; Staples Retail) remain above their 50-DMAs, and another four are less than 2% above their 50-DMA. If Friday's sell-off deepens into next week, the percentage of industry groups above their 50-DMAs has the potential to quickly sink as low as 75%. Of the 22 industry groups that are above their 50-DMAs, Autos and Tech Hardware are the only two greater than 10% above.

&gt; On a YTD basis, the S&amp;P 500 is down less than 4%, but for the vast majority of industry groups, performance has been worse than that. Of the 24 groups shown, 16 are down more than 4% YTD, including eleven that are down over 10%. The worst performers of these losers include Energy, Banks, and Autos. While Energy gets most of the attention for being so weak, Banks are essentially down just as much! On the upside, just two industry groups are up over 10% (Retailers, which is basically Amazon, and Software &amp; Services). Retailing is also the one industry group that is within 1% of a 52-week high and one of seven that is within 4% of a 52-week high.

# Credit Market Reversals

&gt; We've noted in detail the massive reversals seen in global equities over the last three months, but outside of equities, we've also seen some other massive moves. One example is credit spreads between the yields of corporate and high yield bonds relative to Treasuries.

&gt; The top chart below shows the spread in yields between the B of A Corporate Index relative to Treasuries going back to 1997, and below that, we show the 50-day rate of change in the spread. Heading into the COVID-crash, spreads on corporate bonds were less than 100 basis points (bps), meaning the corporate bond index was yielding only 1 percentage point more than comparable Treasury yields. In the span of less than two months, though, spreads surged by more than 300 bps to over 400 bps. Not since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009 had we seen spreads widen out more than they did in March. Just as notable as the level is the fact that the speed with which spreads widened during the COVID-crash was similar to the pace during the credit crisis.

&gt; While spreads were quick to spike during both crises, they narrowed nearly as fast both times. Going back to 1997, the most corporate spreads have ever narrowed over a 50-day period was in June 2009. Coming in at a close second place, though, the 50-day period ending in early June was nearly as extreme.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-Corporates.png))**

&gt; Similar to spreads on corporate bonds, the movement in spreads on high yield (junk) credit has been nearly as extreme. While spreads on the B of A High Yield Master Index widened out by only half as much during the COVID-crash as they did during the Financial Crisis, the 50-day move ending in late March was easily more extreme than any other period outside of the credit crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-High-Yield.png))**

&gt; A shown in both charts above, the only time both corporate and high yield spreads narrowed by an amount anywhere close to the amount they narrowed from late March through early June was back in early June of 2009. The chart below of the S&amp;P 500 shows that point from the perspective of the S&amp;P 500. That period in June 2009 was right in the early stages of what turned out to be a multi-year bull market. Given the similar tightening in the credit market now versus back then, should we assume a similar move for equities going forward?

&gt; After the last five months, we'll be the first to say that anything is possible. However, while there are plenty of similarities between the moves in credit markets over the last three months versus the first half of 2009, there are also important distinctions. The most important of these has to do with where the S&amp;P 500 is trading right now. The second chart below shows the historical levels the S&amp;P 500 has traded at relative to its all-time high. Even after the initial narrowing of credit spreads from March through early June 2009, the S&amp;P 500 was still more than 40% off its all-time highs, and therefore still had a lot of climbing to do to get out of the hole. Back in June 2009, to get back to its all-time high from October 2007, the S&amp;P 500 still had to rally another 75%. Today, it's a much different picture as the S&amp;P 500 is already within 10% of its February 2020 all-time high. Could we be in the earlier stages of what turns out to be another long-term bull market? Sure. Will the magnitude of the gains be anything like the gains early on in the bull market that began in 2009? It's unlikely.

# The Very Slow Recovery In Economic Activity Is Continuing

&gt; As economies around the country slowly recover from COVID-19 and reopenings proceed, economic activity is slowly recovering. For the hardest-hit sectors, though, the recovery is only inching forward. Security checkpoint volumes at US airports are still down 80% YoY, and the trend of improvement is only set to return travel activity to 50% of 2019 levels in September.

&gt; For restaurants, OpenTable data shows covers down by two-thirds from last year, though some of that is because many restaurants remain closed. Among reopened establishments, the number of seated customers are still down almost 40% YoY. About half of restaurants remain closed per the OpenTable data. We discussed this chart and other retail enthusiasm indicators in last night's Closer report, which is available to Bespoke Institutional members.

# Leading Indicators Turn Positive

&gt; Yesterday, The Conference Board released last month’s reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, which showed a month-over-month increase of 2.8%. As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the return to positive territory follows three straight months of negative monthly growth.

&gt; ”We noted that the pace of the LEI’s deterioration slowed in the April report, potentially suggesting a bottom forming in the US economy,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yesterday’s print was one of several positive economic data surprises we’ve observed recently, bolstering our optimistic view for economic growth in the second half of the year.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.19.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the economy still has a ways to go in order to recover from the damage of the prior three months, the composition of May’s LEI advance encourages us. We noted a disconnect in April’s readout in which the financial market indicators tended to be net positive contributors while the “real economy” indicators detracted. May’s release saw a reversal of that trend whereby the economic subindexes played catch-up. Seven of the 10 components were positive contributors led by an improvement in average weekly initial unemployment claims, average weekly manufacturing hours, and building permits. The three negative contributors were the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) New Orders Index, average consumer expectations for business conditions, and the Leading Credit Index.

&gt; The most recent LEI release reinforces our view that an economic bottom is likely behind us. Workers starting to return to jobs that they were unable to do remotely had material effects on May’s readout, and if that trend continues, a stock market trading at stretched valuations would have a stronger foundation under it.

# 3 Charts That Have Our Attention

&gt; Stocks have shaken off the 5.9% S&amp;P 500 Index drop last Thursday by gaining three days in a row before yesterday’s modest weakness. While researching and reading this week, three charts stood out that tell us quite a good deal about how investors have reacted during this volatile market and what could be next.

&gt; “Incredibly, we saw nearly a third of all investors over 65 years old sell their full equity holdings,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “With stocks now back near highs, this is yet another reason to have a plan in place before trouble comes, as making decisions when under duress can lead to the exact wrong decision.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, according to data from Fidelity Investments, nearly 18% of all investors sold their full equity holdings between February and May, while a much higher percentage that were closer to retirement (or in retirement) sold. Some might have bought back in, but odds are that many are feeling quite upset with the record bounce back in stocks here.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Along these same lines, investors have recently moved to cash at a record pace. In fact, there is now nearly $5 trillion in money market funds, almost twice the levels we saw this time only five years ago. Also, the past three months saw the largest three-month change ever, as investors ran to the safety of cash. If you were looking for a reason stocks could continue to go higher over the longer term, there really is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we noted last week that the extreme overbought nature of stocks here is actually consistent with the start of a new bull run, not a bear market bounce, or the end of a bull market. Adding to this, the spread between the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average was near the highest level ever. Think about it; with the 45% bounce in the S&amp;P 500, many stocks were above their 50-day moving average, but not nearly as many were above their 200-day moving average. So from a longer-term perspective, there could still be gains to be had.

&gt; Sure enough, looking at other times that had wide spreads, they took place near the start of major bull markets. Near-term the potential is there for a well-deserved pullback, but going out 6 to 12 months, stocks have consistently outperformed.

# Election Year July Performance Tepid

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

&gt; Election year Julys rank in the bottom half of all election year months. DJIA: 0.5%, 6th worst; S&amp;P 0.4% 6th worst; NASDAQ (since 1972): -0.7% 3rd worst; Russell 2000 (since 1980): -0.2% 3rd worst.

With that being said I have seen limited  coverage related to the amount of companies that are on the brink of Bankruptcy, amount of people who have defaulted on their credit cards, mortgages, and other loans.  I'm not suggesting that we are going to be going back into the 2008 housing crisis, but when you look at the unemployment numbers, the lack of a second round of stimulus, and also the fact that business can't operate at 25% or less of what they use to be operating at, it all isn't looking good! Should we be expecting a retest of the lows in March, should we be expecting that the FED will support and then post election the economy will fall out from under us?

personalfinance,Car or Credit Card Debt,"First time poster, so I apologize for any mistakes. I am expecting a check of about $4800, and am trying to decide what to do with the money to help my finances: do I purchase a safer vehicle or do I pay off my credit card debt? 

I drive a 2014 model car that I purchased out of necessity when my credit wasn’t so great. The car had 80k miles on it, and I got hit with 17% financing, and pay $409/month. Not only this, but the car has a weird problem where if my oil is not full, and I put TOO MUCH gas in the car, it will just stop while im driving. For example, I just filled up my gas tank, drove on the highway and was going 65 mph when the car completely shut off. Luckily it was at night, so not many people were on the road. It has done this three times, and after taking it to the dealership, the Car company refuses to acknowledge a problem, and several other mechanics have said its not worth putting more money into. I still currently owe $14,500 on the vehicle. Is it worth using the $4500 to pay off the negative equity and trade in the vehicle for something safer and more reliable, since my credit is a lot better, and get something at a much lower interest rate? 

Or, do I use the money toward paying off the $5k I currently have in credit card debt, and just keep driving the vehicle until it dies? Alternatively, should I just put the money into savings since the economy (US) is currently falling apart? TIA",finance

investing,Bank Stocks TOO Cheap?,"Have bank stocks become too cheap? JPM, BAC, WFC, C are all trading as if they have unlimited distressed loans on their books. The reality is they have massive reserves to protect against any downside thanks to 2008/2009. They have suspended and halted share buybacks to further build reserves for any losses. 

The results of the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) showed that JPMorgan’s common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio would hold at a “very strong” 10%, and the firm would have in excess of $500 billion of liquid assets. The Federal Reserve’s stress test, which assumes unemployment peaking at 10% and the stock market falling 50%, results in JPMorgan’s revenue falling 20% and credit costs rising $20 billion over 2019. Even in such a pessimistic scenario, JPMorgan’s CET1 ratio would remain well above the regulatory requirements.

## JPM currently has a near 4% Yield with Potential for More

JPMorgan has paid dividends in each of the past 10 years. Over the past five years, the firm has generated more in free cash flow ($109 billion) than it has paid out in dividends ($98 billion), which equates to an average $2.2 billion surplus each year. Its latest quarterly dividend, when annualized, equals $3.60/share or a 3.9% dividend yield.

personalfinance,Buying first car - is this the right financing approach?,"Hi all

I'm 30 years old and planning to buy my first car. Am curious if this sounds like an appropriate amount to spend and if people have suggestions for a better approach.

I live in a high cost of living metro area. Gross salary is about $90k. Monthly expenses on necessities are rent and utilities ($1,600); food ($300); student loan ($600). No CC debt. Credit rating of 800+. Feel secure in my job, although there is always risk in this economy.

Current accounts: $18k in checking; $30k in HYSA; $11k in non-retirement ETFs and a couple of stocks.

Want a car that is safe, reliable, and that I enjoy driving. Still on warranty and blind-spot monitor are a must for me. Am looking around, and think I can get a 2018 or 2019 crossover that I would enjoy driving for about $20k all in.

Am planning on spending $10k out of my checking account and taking a 3 year $10k loan out with my credit union. Still waiting on approval, but think I will get a sub 2% interest rate.

Is this a fine plan? Should I just pay cash for the entire purchase? Is $20k too much?

Thanks for the advice!",finance

personalfinance,Concerned about the credit hit if I pay off a student loan,"I have one student loan from 2003, which is scheduled to be paid off in June 2024.  After being exceedingly lucky and relatively frugal, I owe about $1500 total on the loan which comes out to a monthly payment of $45.  The interest rate has been increasing as of late and is now 4.66% (no pandemic interest rate relief for me).  I want to get rid of it. It is so hard to actually pay the damn thing too. I have to send a check (they don't DO autopay). If I want to overpay, I have to send two checks, one for the loan and one for the overpayment. I'm constantly worried the check won't get there on time etc etc.  

I have the cash to immediately pay it off. My income is over 100K per year and I live on about half of it. Recently, my husband and I have been saving for a substantial down payment on a new house, so I have $63K liquid making 1.2% while we wait for the pandemic to slow down so we can get back to looking. 

The reason I haven't paid it off is because this loan is one of my oldest accounts. I have a credit card from 2002, this loan from 2003 and a Kohls charge from 2005.  Every other credit card was from 2013 or later, when I got my first ""big girl"" job after grad school.  

I asked at my credit union if I should pay off the loan, and was told that because it was so old, it would hurt my credit to pay it off.  Plus paying off the loan would mean that I don't have any other loans, just credit cards, and therefore my credit profile wouldn't be diverse enough. My current score is about 800  and since we will be getting a sizable mortgage in the near future (\~200K), I want the lowest interest rate possible.

Should I wait it out and pay on the loan for another year? Or should I just bite the bullet, take the credit hit, and pay off the loan?",finance
personalfinance,Saving money vs paying off debt in the current state of the world.,"I saw another thread about a person wanting advice on paying off his car loan vs keeping the money in his (?) saving account. 

 
 
I am in a similar situation, except with credit card debt. We have quite a bit. However, we have enough money to pay it down a lot (more than half), which would save us hundreds of dollars per month, and that doesn't include the extra interest charges every month.  

 I am a nurse. However, I know nurses who have been called off due to low census, and furloughed, etc.  
 
My husbands job has been slow but he has had his normal 40 hours a week, and his bosses have been great at making sure there is work to do. But of course, they wouldn't keep him if it wasn't worth it to them. That's business.  
 
So this brings back to my main point: if he lost his job and I didn't, I make less than him (due to insurance, etc) and it would be very difficult to make all of the credit card payments.  
 
It seems to make since to pay off the debt and be done with it. Then we can save 500+ more dollars a month (or put it to the remaining cards).  

 And then if one of us does lose our jobs, then we would still be able to make our normal payments (house, power, etc) AND the remaining credit card debt. If we both lost our jobs, which I feel is unlikely, but anything is possible, then we would still have his VA, which covers most of our normal bills minus credit cards so with the remaining savings that we would have left we could pay the minimum without defaulting until one of us found a job. Again, I feel this option is the least likely given the occupations that we work but still a thought. 
 
Tldr: pay down debt and be able to save an extra 4-500 a month or save the money and continue paying minimums while barely paying down the principle due to high interest rates.",finance
personalfinance,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi! I just found this subreddit and realized that you all would be a big help in a decision I am paralyzed about. (I’m going to avoid putting numbers on things, just doesn't feel right.) 

I’m shit with money. I’m fortunate enough that my employer’s direct deposit allows for multiple accounts, so I can wall off money from casual access and make sure my bills get paid. 

I would like to buy a house. I have an inaccessible account, where I put everything I can save. That balance is approaching the amount I will need for closing costs (I’m a vet, so no down payment). So great, right? It took me 2 years to get there.

Here’s the thing, if personal finances is a boat, mine has got a lot of leaks. Debt-wise, I have 2 student loans and 2 credit cards. I make more than the minimum payments on all 4, but not a lot more. I am also renting at the 1/3 of my income level. I have no assets. Now, as I'm approaching my goal amount, here is the decision: the “house savings” account would let me pay off the smaller student loan OR pay off the largest credit card balance OR buy the house. I was saving for the house, but I feel a little irresponsible for not addressing my debts first. 

So pros and cons. 

1) The smaller student loan. I should have it paid off in the next 2 years one way or another, pretty much any spare money I have goes to it. The larger one is simply too large to address. It’ll be more than 10 years to pay it off. I consider it a burden that I’ll probably die with. It *is* a federal loan and I’m in a federal job. I’ve checked the boxes, so it might be forgiven at the end of ten years, maybe and that is my only hope to get rid of it in a reasonable time frame.

2) Credit cards. These are pretty much off the table. Any time I make an attempt to pay one off, I run the balance right back up in a few months. I try not to carry them, just to limit my ability to use them. While paying off the credit card would help my credit score in the short term, I feel that by the time I have enough money again to buy a house, the credit card balance will be the same. 

3) House. Right now, the money I pay towards housing simply evaporates into my landlord’s pocket. Houses have upkeep costs, but I plan to buy something where the mortgage/taxes/insurance are below what I’m paying for rent and any money I put into the mortgage is equity, right? The apartment I’m in was something of a sweet deal, but there are maintenance issues that are never addressed and I can hear my neighbors (who are mostly nocturnal) pretty clearly. (She should kick him out, he is never going to make it as a musician and he never helps around the house.)  I would really like out.  

So back to the boat analogy, Right now, I could plug one hole that would have plugged itself, just sooner (the loan), plug one hole temporarily (the credit card), or partially plug one and end up a little higher in the water (the house). So Reddit, what should I do?",finance
Forex,Macro Views: Depression &amp; Deflation,"Here’s an interesting thought experiment for you… 

Imagine that your friend asks you for a small loan. He promises he’ll pay you back in full in six months. You consider this friend to be quite trustworthy, so you agree to loan him $1,000.

Little do you know that you just started up a good old-fashioned game of hot potato…

I’ll show you what I mean in a moment. As you’ll see, this simple concept is the perfect analogy for what’s happening in the world economy right now.

Plus, I’ll show you one of the moves you can make today, to make sure you’re not left holding the hot potato.

First, some context…

## The Two Bogeymen:Depression and Deflation

Over the past few weeks, we’ve talked about the history of money. \[I've removed the URL links because I don't want to link to anything outside this subreddit.\] It’s so important to understand where we came from to know where we’re likely headed next…

As I’ve mentioned before, I believe the incredible run in the global economy since the last financial crisis is coming to an end.

Officially, North America is in a recession. And it won’t be too long before the mainstream media start using the word “depression” more often. But that’s not the only bogeyman for financial writers and stock market observers…

There’s also “deflation.”

Right now, journalists and TV personalities will do everything to avoid saying that word out loud. Instead, they’ll say things like “negative inflation.”

The truth is that depressions and deflation go hand in hand.

Through our *History of Money* series, we built a foundation for understanding the power and the dangers of fiat currency.

In this next series, we’ll look at deflation. You see, I believe this next phase of the economic cycle will be devastating. If you want to preserve – and grow – your wealth, understanding deflation is crucial.

And the first step in that is understanding the role of debt in the world economy. That’s where our game of hot potato comes in…

## Chain of Lunatic Lending

You’ve probably heard of this game before. You gather in a circle and toss a potato around to the other players in the circle while music is playing.

The last player to hold the potato when the music stops is the loser. The real question, however, is who are the winners?

To answer that, let’s go back to that loan between you and your friend that I mentioned at the beginning…

The two of you draw up a contract, shake hands, and the matter is settled.

Now, if someone asked you how much money you have, you wouldn’t subtract the $1,000 loan from your net worth. You’d include the $1,000 you just lent out.

But if someone asked your friend the same question… he’d also include the $1,000 you lent him in *his* calculation of his net worth.

How can this be possible? Two people think they each have a $1,000 claim to the same $1,000. But of course, that $1,000 hasn’t magically doubled.

If your friend uses the money wisely, he’ll be able to pay you the loan back in full. But what happens if he loses the entire loan… and he has no way of paying you back?

You’d be out your $1,000. (And, being smart, you’ll never lend money to that friend again.)

Now let’s take this scenario a step further…

Imagine your friend *does* misuse the money you lent him. Desperate, he goes to a family member for another loan to cover the initial debt he owes you.

We can stretch this out forever… or at least until your friend runs out of people willing to lend him any money.

When times are good and business is booming, your friend can probably keep this juggling act going for quite some time.

But all it takes is for one fault line to crack this fragile foundation. Then, the entire house comes crashing down.

As it becomes obvious that your friend can’t manage his debts, his creditors will come calling. Maybe you’re the first one to ask for your money back. If you are, you’re the lucky one.

Your friend is able to give you back $700. Considering you could have lost your entire $1,000, you feel relief that you’re only taking a 30% haircut on this whole affair.

But one by one, as the creditors come marching in, each one gets back less money than the one before.

Everyone in this chain of lunatic lending gets hurt.

Your friend will be broke by the end of it. And many of the people that lent to him will have lost what they thought might have been a good and safe investment.

So now you see, there are no winners in this game of hot potato. When the music stops, everyone gets burned.

This same logic applies to the global economy as a whole. Let me show you briefly what I mean. Then I’ll tell you about the one move you can make today…

## What to Do Before the Music Stops

Small businesses, corporations, and even sovereign nations are all trying to keep this same juggling act alive. Meaning it’s not just you and your friend playing hot potato. It’s the global economy.

If demand in the economy slows down… corporate revenues decline… or the cost of goods rises, the cracks start to show.

And the cracks are already forming.

If you subscribe to our elite advisory, *Andy Krieger’s Big Trades*, you already know this. But let me give you some examples…

Neel Kashkari, the President of the Minnesota Fed, believes unemployment is already as high as 24%. That’s almost as bad as the Great Depression. Back then, unemployment peaked at 25%.

Meanwhile, major airlines are losing $40-50 million per day. And out of all U.S. mortgages, nearly 8% are in forbearance.

What all this tells us is the music will end soon. How soon? That’ll be the subject of a future issue… so stay tuned.

In the meantime, if you’re wondering what to do, we recommend looking no further than the currency markets – Andy’s specialty.

You see, in times of great fear and economic stress, the market tends to turn to certain currencies. We call these “risk off” currencies.

We anticipated the world would turn to a risk-off sentiment. And we helped investors position themselves accordingly.",finance

I know I want good gas mileage but I also am afraid of paying large maintenance costs, and so am hesitant to buy a used car (negative experiences with my parents buying craigslist cars every year and having them die every year)

I also want to finance this car so that I can get a credit score, but I'm not sure how credit scores work. If I got a $9000 car and paid $6000 up front, what would my interest be with no credit history? How would my credit score look during and after the loan period? I heard that if the loan ends it hurts your score?

And what kind of rate can I expect for insurance? all my googling just returns quote software that requires you to know the car you have, I'm 25 and have put off getting my drivers license until now because I didn't see the point in having a license with no car.

My hope is that I can get a car and either have a low enough monthly payment or pay it off fast enough that I can use the $1000/mo (more like $1400 since I'm currently paying $200 for rent and $200 for student loan repayment) to get an apartment and increase my loan repayment to get it paid off sooner

personalfinance,Loan/debt payoff options,"**Background:**

First college experience: 18, no parental guidance or financial assistance, and subsequently took every single loan I could get to pay for college. That balance is currently sitting at $93K. Obviously looking back this was an incredibly stupid financial decision, but I cannot change it. My parents said I had no choice but to go to college but offered to assistance financially nor guidance about loans. I was 18, naive, and really had no understanding of what I was signing up for. 

Second college experience (current), I am going to nursing school and my husband and I are trying to navigate whether we refinance my private loans or take out a personal loan for a better interest rate. 

**Loan information:**

Navient: federal loans totaling $120k by the time I'm done with nursing school (that total is reflective of first degree and estimated nursing school), interest rates are currently set to 0% 

Wells Fargo - Private Student loans totaling $67K, interest rates are 3.75% and 3.5% (two loans). 

**what I need:**

I know that I am in a large amount of student loan debt. I really do understand that. I am trying to figure out how to best navigate this debt and get it paid off in a responsible way. UBS currently is offering 1.95% on a 5-year loan - does this make sense for the private student loans? Do you have a suggestion for another lender? My current WF Interest Rates are pretty low, considering, and I am currently in deferment on all loans (private and federal) for the next year while I'm in school. I have not been making payments while in school. 

This is an incredible sensitive subject for me as I am equally embarrassed and angry about my financial debt situation. My husband knew about the debt prior to our marriage, and has been trying to help me navigate it, but I am also seeking outside advice on how best to tackle this mountain. All advice is appreciated!

I already have an account with Ally but the interest rate keeps going down. Can anyone tell me if it'll make a difference whether I do a no-penalty CD or just open another HYSA with Ally?

personalfinance,First time moving away and need to build credit.,"I am moving away for school, and this stuff is really confusing to me. I need help step by step sadly. :( And some of these questions may sound ridiculously dumb, but I need to learn.

I opened up a checkings account with Trustco which is near my area, the checkings account has some money in it, around \~2k that I deposited, and I also received a debit card from them. A debit card wouldn't help me build credit anyways.

Unfortunately, where I am moving, they don't even have a Trustco bank near them. They only have an Empower Federal Credit Union bank. So I am not sure what to do?

I was thinking of opening a checkings account with Empower Federal Credit Union bank and just transferring over my \~2k from Trustco to there. But I am not sure if that is possible or how to do that.

From the website, it seems they are connected with MasterCard. So, I was thinking of applying for the Platinum Mastercard. But I have absolutely no credit. So I don't know if I would be approved. If I don't get approved, then what do I do next?

If I were approved, I'm sure I'd be put on a credit limit of around 200$-300$. So, if that is my limit, how would I pay for other things? For example, I can spend 200$ on groceries, and then pay this off at the end of the month. But, what about the rent? Would I just have to pay my rent with cash by going to the bank and taking out 500$ and giving it to my landlord?

I'm a student, so I am taking out FAFSA loans. I will receive whatever is left over on a check that I can deposit in a bank. This will be used to pay for my rent and food and living expenses. So I need help. I don't even know how it is possible for me to receive FAFSA loans if I don't have credit, a bank account, etc. But apparently, my advisor said, that all students receive FAFSA loans and it doesn't matter about income or anything. This is all new stuff to me.",finance
worldpolitics,Quotes that keep me up at night,"Trump suggested he wanted to serve more than two terms

More now on President Trump's conversations with Xi Jinping. Mr Bolton says Mr Trump told China's leader that Americans were keen for him to make the constitutional changes needed for him to serve more than two terms.
""One highlight came when Xi said he wanted to work with Trump for six more years, and Trump replied that people were saying that the two-term constitutional limit on presidents should be repealed for him,"" he wrote in an extract published by the Wall Street Journal.
""Xi said the US had too many elections, because he didn't want to switch away from Trump, who nodded approvingly."" Bolton

Mr Trump was willing to intervene in criminal investigations ""to, in effect, give personal favours to dictators he liked,"" Mr Bolton wrote.
According to the book Mr Trump offered help to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2018 in a US investigation into a Turkish company over potential violations of Iranian sanctions.
The US president is said to have agreed to ""take care of things"" and that the prosecutors involved were ""Obama people"".  Bolton


Bully Barr, how do you obstruct justice? Let us count the ways:


1 LIED about the contents of the Mueller Report, claiming that it found “no evidence” of colllusion or obstruction of justice


2 Attempted the redact material in Mueller Report which reveals that Trump DID collude


3 Tried to interfere in sentencing of Roger Stone, who we now know was communicating with Trump about said collusion


4 Is trying to get the case against Flynn dropped, against the interests of justice as a former federal judge serving as amicus has stated


5 Is dropping the case against RUSSIA, which attacked the U.S., by classifying info necessary to prosecute Russian defendants


6 Has testified that he doesn’t believe that foreign assistance to a campaign is even a crime if it is not directly by a “foreign intelligence service”


7 Had his OLC justify blocking a whistleblower complaint required by law to reach Congress from ever reaching Congress (an opinion which was soundly rebuked in a letter from collective Inspectors General)


8 Oversaw his Criminal Division deciding — before even investigating — that secretly extorting a foreign country to investigate a political opponent would not constitute a violation of campaign finance laws


9 Has appointed, without any legal basis that I am aware of, political appointees to (repeatedly) “investigate the investigators” of Russian interference even after the DOJ IG has investigated it




10 Where was I? Oh yes: Got “activated” by POTUS to tear gas peaceful protesters and clergy members in violation of the Constitution of the United States  AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT


11 Has YET to mention that right-wing extremists are the most dangerous domestic terror threat AS TESTIFIED TO BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI 


12 But meanwhile has put the Joint Terrorism Task Force on investigating Auntie Tifa who is his imaginary foe


13 Has been pimping hydroxychloroquone in his free time for no apparent reason even though by the way we know it kills people

(Not sure this is obstruction but it’s super cray cray so including it)


14 Now is trying to fire the U.S. Attorney for SDNY which, among other things, has evidence that: 


a) Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in criminal campaign finance violations in conjunction with the indictment against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen


b) was investigating to co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein who died under mysterious and as yet unexplained circumstances and who by the way used to work for his DAD who wrote a bizarre novel about space sex trafficking (someone else please take over this piece because I can’t)


c) was reportedly investigating Fruity G &amp; Co. playing Scooby Doo in Ukraine digging up sketchy dirt on his political opponents (see #2 and 3, reprise)


d) is obviously investigating other things which will continue “without interference” as per SDNY U. S. Attorney who 


i) never was told he was “resigning” and 


ii) isn’t resigning



APPENDIX A: (To tweets 11 and 12) Took it upon himself to bring in unidentified, armed federal agents to DC to intimidate the population and usurp the authority of the DC mayor*

reserve the right to add appendices and additional evidence that I forgot or which may arise



15 I am SO EFFING DONE with this dude and if Ted Cruz wants I will wrestle Barr and settle this once and for all if Congress isn’t willing to impeach him because this %#*$! has Got. To. Stop.

The New Mueller Report: Part [I](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.205521/gov.uscourts.dcd.205521.122.1.pdf) and [II](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.205521/gov.uscourts.dcd.205521.122.2.pdf).

To start off, here are some my favorite Mueller Report redactions that have just been revealed, coded as spoiler text (going to be updating the comment as I work through them):

 - In a section that looks at Trump’s potential motives for firing FBI Director James B. Comey — ([Vol. II, Pg 17](https://nyti.ms/2MNFVNd))

&gt;Within the Trump Campaign, aides reacted with enthusiasm to reports of the hacks. &gt;!Trump associate Roger Stone had predicted and!&lt; discussed with Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release the hacked material. Some witnesses said that Trump himself discussed the possibility of upcoming releases &gt;!with Stone!&lt;. Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Trump, recalled hearing &gt;!Stone tell Trump during the summer of 2016 that Stone had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that WikiLeaks planned to release information soon.!&lt; Cohen recalled that Trump responded, “oh good, alright,”

 - Then, on this highly redacted page that references WikiLeaks, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and Manafort ([Vol. I, Pg 54](https://nyti.ms/31K53Z9))

&gt;!Michael Cohen, former executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump,199 told the Office that he recalled an incident in which he was in candidate Trump’s office in Trump Tower when Stone called. Cohen believed the call occurred before July 22, 2016, when WikiLeaks released its first tranche of Russian-stolen DNC emails.200 Stone was patched through to the office and placed on speakerphone. Stone then told the candidate that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and in a couple of days WikiLeaks would release information. According to Cohen, Stone claimed that he did not know what the content of the materials was and that Trump responded, “oh good, alright” but did not display any further reaction.!&lt; Cohen further told the Office that, after WikiLeaks’s subsequent release of stolen DNC emails in July 2016, candidate Trump said to Cohen something to the effect of, &gt;!“I guess Roger was right.”202 After WikiLeaks’s July 22, 2016 release of documents, Stone participated in a conference call with Manafort and Gates.!&lt;  According to Gates, Manafort expressed excitement about the release &gt;!and congratulated Stone!&lt;. Manafort, for his part, told the Office that, shortly after WikiLeaks’s July 22 release, Manafort also spoke with candidate Trump &gt;!and mentioned that Stone had predicted the release and claimed to have access to WikiLeaks. Candidate Trump responded that Manafort should stay in touch with Stone.204 Manafort relayed the message to Stone, likely on July 25, 2016.!&lt; Manafort also wanted to be kept apprised of any future developments with WikiLeaks and separately told Gates to keep in touch &gt;!with Stone!&lt; about future WikiLeaks releases.

 - On a Trump phone call with Gates, indicating that he knew more WikiLeaks dumps were coming ([Vol II. Pg 18](https://nyti.ms/2o1yic2)):

&gt;Manafort said that shortly after WikiLeaks’s July 22, 2016 release of hacked documents, he spoke to Trump &gt;!and mentioned that Stone had predicted the
release and claimed to have access to WikiLeaks!&lt;; Manafort recalled that Trump responded that Manafort should &gt;! stay in touch with Stone and!&lt; keep Trump updated. Deputy campaign manager Rick Gates said that Manafort was getting pressure about &gt;!Stone's having!&lt; information and that Manafort instructed Gates &gt;!to call Stone and get!&lt; status updates on upcoming releases. Around the same time, Gates was with Trump on a trip to an airport &gt;! when Trump spoke by phone with Stone at length!&lt;, and shortly after the call ended, Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.

 - In the paragraph titled ""Contacts with the Campaign and WikiLeaks"" ([Vol II, Pg. 18](https://nyti.ms/2BFGPVs))

&gt;On June 12, 2016, Assange claimed in a televised interview to “have emails relating to Hillary Clinton which are pending publication,” but provided no additional context.
&gt;
&gt;In debriefings with the Office, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates said that, &gt;!before Assange’s June 12 announcement, Gates and Stone had a phone conversation in which Stone said something “big” was coming and had to do with a leak of information.195 Stone also said to Gates that he thought Assange had Clinton emails. Gates asked Stone when the information was going to be released. Stone said the release would happen very soon. According to Gates, between June 12, 2016 and July 22, 2016, Stone repeated that information was coming. Manafort and Gates both called to ask Stone when the release would happen, and!&lt; Gates recalled candidate Trump being generally frustrated that the Clinton emails had not been found.
&gt;
&gt;Paul Manafort, who would later become campaign chairman, &gt;!provided similar information about the timing of Stone’s statements about WikiLeaks.197 According to Manafort, sometime in June 2016, Stone told Manafort that he was dealing with someone who was in contact with WikiLeaks and believed that there would be an imminent release of emails by WikiLeaks.!&lt;

None of the sections related to Manafort giving battleground state polling data to the Russians or Trump declining to be interviewed are unredacted in this release.

---

But perhaps the most significant unredaction is that [the Trump campaign knew in June](https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/1274105939520618496) what was coming:

&gt;“Stone claimed to the [Trump] Campaign as early as **June 2016—before any announcement by Assange or Wikileaks**—that he had learned that Wikileaks would release documents damaging to the Clinton Campaign.”

Corroborated by multiple witnesses, redacted by William Barr. 

[Gates had already testified](https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1194278009747972097) that Trump knew via Stone what WikiLeaks had as early as July:

&gt;Here’s how the the question went by Aaron Zelinsky, a former Mueller prosecutor: 
&gt;
&gt;After Mr Trump got off the phone with Mr Stone, what did Trump say? 
&gt;
&gt;Gates: **“He indicated more information would be coming.""**

This pushes it even earlier, long before a word had been breathed publicly to anyone else. Trump had a backchannel to WikiLeaks, knew they had more hacked content, but for whatever reason the time wasn't right to release it. Then months later...

 - October 7th, 2016 4:00 PM: The [Washington Post reveals the existence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html) of the Access Hollywood tape.

 - Less than *one hour* later: WikiLeaks dumps the [hacked Podesta emails](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/), and releases them in dribs and drabs over the following days to maximize saturation and squeeze out the Access Hollywood story as effectively as possible.

[Just as Roger Stone had planned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/29/roger-stone-wanted-wikileaks-email-dump-distract-access-hollywood-tape-associate-claims/):

&gt;The striking simultaneity fulfilled the hope of Trump confidant Roger Stone, according to Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and former Stone associate who was subpoenaed over the summer for questioning by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
&gt;
&gt;“I had one call from Roger, as I recall it — Roger disputes this — **on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, ‘We’ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we’d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,’”** Corsi told MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Monday. Bush was the “Access Hollywood” anchor who appeared with Trump in the clip from 2005, in which the host of “The Apprentice” describes using his stardom to grope and kiss women.

The story isn't just that Trump knew what was coming from the Russia Intelligence cutout, but they *coordinated* the release with them to ensure the maximum possible benefit to Trump's 2016 candidacy. Mueller did not determine that amounted to statutory criminal conspiracy, but it sure as shit amounts to collusion.

Perhaps more importantly: these are the redactions Barr has *chosen* to release only in an attempt [to convince Judge Walton](https://www.lawfareblog.com/judge-orders-review-mueller-report-redactions) not to unredact further.

I remember a time when people cared about each other. For a short period in human history my generation experienced something beautiful. We were equals with everyone, my parents taught me the only way to get respect is to give it. Growing up I'm sure there were people who judged me not on my character, my intentions, or even my actions, but solely on the basis of my skin color.
An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere. 
We exist in a time where we are more connected then ever before, and yet we have never been felt lonelier.
The world had never been safer, but people have never been more afraid.
Leaders leading people towards the slaughter, using screens and buzz words to distract us and make us complaint.
A world where american veterans brag about their service and reep the benefits of it, yet forget that simple oath they made on the constitution.
Protect it both foreign and domestic.
Where is your voice?
Who are you?
Remove the label of:
Republican or democrat
Black or white 
Brown or yellow
Rich or poor
Male or female 
CEO or associate
Extrovert or introvert 
Gay or straight
Cis or trans

Arent you tired of labeling yourself?
Arent you tired of feeling divided and like your voice doesnt matter?
Is this the country that fought for its independence or is this the country who turns over and let's themselves be ruled by greedy people who separate themselves from us ordinary folk. 
The ones who think we are nothing more then to be used and then thrown away when we can no longer service their desires. 
You are so much more then any one thing, a beautiful flower waiting to blossom. 
One flower is beautiful but a field of flowers is life changing.  Shaun Worthy",energy

I was thinking that that might be too much money to just keep inside of my checking account, so I wanted to know if there is anywhere else I should put it.

So far, the savings accounts that I've looked up seems to be best for accounts with more that $20,000.

I know that there will in expenses that I will have on campus, so that's why I'm keeping $700 in checking. Fortunately, I have 0 expected student contribution for my education. Though, I'll have federal subsidized loans (no interest until I graduate) of $2,500 a year.
Should I just keep the $2,000 in my Ally checking account, or is there something else I could do with it?",finance

personalfinance,I feel like I'm over spending by a lot but it also doesn't seem like that - Sanity Check,"This will be kind of an odd post, I'm mainly looking for a sanity check of everything in my budget.

For starters I'm in my mid twenties and my salary is just shy of 102K/year. I'm contributing the federal maximum to my 401K plan, it's not a good plan at all and they suspended the 401K match during COVID. Though when I look at the match I gain \~300/month more by contributing to it pre tax. From there I have a PPO Plan 2 Health Insurance which is crazy expensive at \~160/month for a single payer which is double what I paid last year. I contribute around 2K/year to a FSA pre-tax as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My NW is 230K as of this week, and the only debt I have which is included in that is my car loan at 6.3K left. For what it's worth to I work from home even pre COVID, and I love it as I can get much more done and the freedom it allows me. Previously when I worked in the office I was spending $10-15/day on eating out for lunch.

From there my take home net pay 2325/pay period (Every 2 weeks). I live in a Medium COL area.

Now for my actual budget

* Cell Phone - $70
* Rent - $1440
* Electric $200 (Just moved, need to figure out averages)
* Water $60
* Internet $86
* Groceries - $200
* Transportation - $30

&amp;#x200B;

* True Expenses (Car, Costco, Medical, Auto Maintenance) - $200

&amp;#x200B;

* Auto Insurance - $90
* Life Insurance - $14 (Most likely about to cancel)
* Renters - $34
* Umbrella - $10

&amp;#x200B;

* Auto Loan - $306

&amp;#x200B;

* Brokerage - $300
* Roth IRA - $500 (Yearly Max Limit)
* Savings - $800/month until built to 16K for my emergency fund, will happen in the next 1-2 months

&amp;#x200B;

* Subscriptions - $123 (Amazon, AWS, Crashplan, Domain, YouTube, LastPass, WordPress, YNAB, YouTube TV)

&amp;#x200B;

* Dining Out/Work Lunch - $200

I didn't list out some of my savings goals for a new office chair or Christmas or fun money. Right now the budget is kind of tight to allow a lot of extra shopping/fun money

Part of my goal/plan is once my emergency fund is built back up I'll keep the extra money in my HYSA and pay off my car in 2-3K chunks. This will allow me to maintain the extra in my emergency fund if I need it. If I burn and turn at this goal I can pay of my car in full by March of next year and officially be debt free which I haven't been since I got it. the interest rate is only 2.4% of something very low. But it's more of a thing hanging over my head.

Where my issues come into play are at the end of the money I only have $100-200 extra leftover. I'm very aggressive about savings and from all the research I can find I well within the 50/30/20 rule and about 30% post tax savings (Not including the 401K), and well within rent under 30% pre-tax.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do better, and based upon what I've outlined above am I just over thinking this or am I really spending beyond my means? Part of spending beyond my means makes me think is I'm technically pay check as I don't have next month bills already funded. I hope to remediate that problem next month as it's a 3 pay check month.",finance
gaming,"Dark Souls VS Rocket League: ""git gud"" and actually gitting gud, a long and pedantic essay","Let me preface this essay by saying that I am biased as fuck here. I don’t like Soulsborne games. I tried hard to like them, but i just never could, whereas Rocket League is easily my favorite game and the one I sunk the most hours into. I’m more or less attempting to explain why I don’t like Soulsborne games and why I love Rocket League (and competitive games in general), despite the both of them having a reputation of being hard games that you need to “git gud” at to actually enjoy them. if you love Soulsborne games, more power to you, and i can see why you do. But if you’re presenting as the holy grail of difficult games, then we have a problem, and here I am trying to explain why I feel that this perception is wrong. Without further ado, I hope you’ll enjoy my ramblings, even if you most likely won’t!

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t think a lot of people will disagree with me when I say that Dark Souls is a frustrating game. Where there may be some more disagreement however is if I say that Dark Souls is a difficult game: newbies will agree with me, but veteran players will tend to disagree. Whenever they’re trying to convince someone to play the game, there’s an argument that comes out frequently: “it’s not that difficult, eventually you learn how to beat the enemies”. And that’s precisely what makes me say that the frustration felt playing a Dark Souls game is a bad kind of frustration.

Let me explain myself. At first glance, it seems like the bosses, and in fact many of the basic enemies when they gang up on you, are overpowered. They can kill you in two hits, whereas you need to hit them over and over and over before they finally fall. Your attacks have a pitiful range compared to the breath attack of an undead dragon. You move slowly and clumsily while they can take to the air. It feels like the odds are stacked against you, at first.

But eventually, you learn the patterns. You learn to lie in wait, dodging the boss’ attacks until they’re vulnerable, and then go in for a hit or two and quickly retreat, rinse and repeat until you beat them. Sure, you have to stick to this pattern rigidly, and a single missed dodge can spell the end of your attempt, but you learn that the monsters can be defeated, with gumption and perseverance, until you finally exult with joy at the sight of that boss who gave you so much trouble pitifully collapsing on their side as life or unlife leaves their rotten bodies. You advance further into the game, discover new areas, acquire new weapons and abilities, until you stumble on another boss. And… You don’t really want to go through all that again. 

It’s frustrating. All that effort, only to beat a single boss, to acquire knowledge that’s only useful against this specific enemy, to overcome this specific hurdle. You’re not learning any new skills, you’re not improving your strategic knowledge of the game, you’re not learning a complicated combination of button presses that allows you to deliver a super combo that you’ll then be able to use against future bosses, no: you’re learning the patterns of this one specific boss. You memorize sheet music only to spit it back out, careful not to miss a beat or that’s half your lifebar gone. You don’t actually git gud, you just learn the patterns. That’s what I mean by bad frustration.

This, in my opinion, comes from the fact that you’re kind of cheating. Let me explain.

In Soulsborne as in many other video games, you can retry after you died. In Soulsborne games specifically, the lore goes to great lengths to justify that bit of gameplay in universe: you’re a zombie-ish warrior cursed never to die, or something to that effect. The fact that you can resurrect is supposed to balance against the overwhelming kill-you-in-two-hits power of the bosses, to give you a fighting chance against those behemoths. No matter how many times they kill you, you’ll always come back to life, having learned their patterns a little better, until you finally know them well enough to kill them. So when you think about it, it gives you much more than a fighting chance: it is in fact an overwhelming advantage, one that the AI can never hope to beat. As long as you’re perseverant enough, you WILL beat the boss. They may kill you a thousand times, but you only need to kill them once. They’re not the ones who are overpowered: you are. They stand literally no chance of ever defeating you for good. So it makes you feel like you’re cheating.

And that’s the crux of the bad frustration that those games make you feel, and why many players find themselves with a bitter taste in their mouth after having beat their third or fourth boss. They’re used to it now, the bosses are no longer scary, you’re not even that frustrated by defeat anymore, you know that you just messed on the execution, next time you’ll get them. What once felt like a difficult task becomes trivially easy: it’s just long and frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare that with the frustration you get playing, say, Rocket League.

(this works with any game that offers a high skill ceiling, really: fighting games, RTSs, strategic shooters a la Counter Strike...)

&amp;#x200B;

The equivalent of beating a boss in those types of game is more or less going up a division: it’s a long and challenging ordeal, and you’ll fail many times before you finally succeed. It’s extremely frustrating to lose a promotion match, just as it is frustrating to die when the boss only had a silver of health left in a Soulsborne. The key difference, however, is that you actually need to get better at the game to advance.

Whereas in Soulsborne games all you have to do is learn the bosses’ patterns and patiently execute your strategy, in Rocket League, you need to improve your mechanical skill and your strategic knowledge of the game. You need to learn how to read your opponents and to anticipate where the ball will be two, three, five seconds from now; you need to evaluate whether or not going for that high ball is a good idea or if going back to defend is a better idea. In a word, you need to actually git gud.

And that makes a world of difference in terms of how you respond to the frustration of losing. In a Soulsborne game, losing means that you missed a beat on the sheet music, that you didn’t execute the partition perfectly. In Rocket League (or in Street Fighter, or Starcraft, or Counter Strike, etc etc), you lost because you weren’t skilled enough. You weren’t quick enough to get back in defense. You picked up boost at the wrong time. You whiffed the shot that could have tied the game. Or your teammate did, but those games make a pretty good job of assigning you partners and opponents of similar skill, so over the course of multiple games statistical anomalies average out, so in the end, it’s all about your skill again.

And this is why wins feel infinitely better too. You didn’t win because you had the power to restart the game until you did: you know you had a real chance of losing, and if you did, you would not have been able to retry the same exact match against the same exact opponents. You didn’t cheat, in short: you won because you played better than your opponent this game. You earned that fair and square against a player who did everything in his power to make you lose. And if you end up matched against each other again, you’ll both have learned from the previous game, and it won’t be the same match.

That last point might be the most important: in those games, skill carries over. When you get promoted up a division, the skills you had to master to do so don’t suddenly stop being useful: on the contrary, you need to hone those skills even further if you want to be promoted again. Every single match builds on the next one; you’re always playing by the same set of rules yet no two games are the same. Failures are not erased, they stay in a permanent record, forcing you to confront them. If you fail a thousand times and win once, you’ve lost, as it should be. That makes for good frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, this is the major difference between those two types of games: the frustration you feel losing to a boss on a Soulsborne will only help you defeat that one specific boss, while the frustration you feel losing a game of Rocket League or of League of Legends will help you get better in every single one of your future matches. I’d wager that the popularity of the Soulsborne games and the whole “git gud” mentality around them comes from the fact that those games feel difficult, but that anyone can beat them with a bit of perseverance. They present themselves as going against the mainstream of games that make you feel like a superpowered badass who can destroy anything in their path, but in the end that’s exactly what they make you feel like, albeit in a roundabout way. They purport to make the fun hard to reach and therefore gratifying, but it’s not really hard to reach that fun, it’s just a long way away. They make you feel like a hardened warrior who beat all these overpowered bosses with fine skill, but in fact you died to them a lot more than they died to you. You’re the real loser, but the game makes you feel like a winner. Whereas if you want to feel like a winner in a competitive game like Rocket League, well, you actually have to win more than you lose.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: you don’t need to git gud to win at Soulsborne, you only need to learn the patterns and be patient since you can never actually lose the game. you need to git gud to win at Rocket League, since you can potentially lose every single game.

&amp;#x200B;

additional observations:

\- yes, you could make the argument that this is essentially ""singleplayer vs multiplayer games"". many of the criticisms I make of Soulsborne applies to most singleplayer games that feature saves and reload, and as I remark the points i make about Rocket League apply to really any multiplayer competitive game. a counterpoint, however: roguelikes are singleplayer games with the characteristics i associate with Rocket League, and MMORPGs are multiplayer games where you can't really lose (most of them). And then there's management games like Rimworld or Football Manager, in which you can reload but shouldn't. The reason i chose Dark Souls VS Rocket League is that i'm familiar with both games and they both have a reputation of being hard to master games.  
\- another way to articulate my points would be to say that while both games have a high skill floor, Soulsbornes' skill ceiling isn't much higher than the skill floor, whereas Rocket League has a virtually infinite skill ceiling.",technology

personalfinance,"$15k saved, no cc debt - Should I pay off student loans or invest in retirement?","For the first time in my life I have about $15,000 in the bank and I am looking for advice on what would be the best way to invest this money into my future. Should I pay off student loans, invest in retirement, keep it in an emergency fund, other options?

Current income: Unemployed (was laid off bc of covid), but hoping to find a new job soon. I am currently receiving about $4k/month from unemployment, which is comparable to my regular salary. Rent + bills = about $2000/month, and I can be pretty frugal about my other expenses, especially since I've been self-isolating at home. How much should I keep in my account as an emergency fund, in case I can't find a job by the time my unemployment runs out? Should I keep saving until I have a bigger chunk to invest?

Student Loans: $13,600, interest rate is 5.375% - any advice as to the best way to tackle this? I've been consistently paying $300/mo via autopay (minimum is $222) after using an online calculator and entering my income. I have been paying this off for 15 years and the number just won't go down. It sure would feel good to just pay it off, but I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket. This is not a private loan - I went to a public state school so it's just your run of the mill Stafford &amp; Perkins loan.

Retirement: I'm 37 years old and have no retirement savings. I realize I'm late in the game, and feel an urgency to invest, but I am wondering if it's a better idea to pay off my loans first. I have been looking into the Fidelity Zero Total Market Index Fund ~~for a Traditional IRA. I decided on a traditional IRA rather than a ROTH because I've read that the short term tax breaks may not be as beneficial in the long run as a traditional IRA.~~ (Edit: ROTH IRA sorry for the mixup!) Should I invest the max amount for the year all at once or make monthly contributions? I admittedly am totally clueless when it comes to this so any advice here is appreciated since it's my first retirement account.

Car loan: I bought a car last year and still owe $17,694.01, interest rate is 3.49 %, 60 months, financed by BMW Financial (it's not a bmw, it's just a standard mini cooper). Monthly payment is $360, $53 of which is interest. I have been paying this consistently with autopay. I ran into an issue previously when I paid off a car early and it ruined my credit score. My Fico report never fully recovered. I'd like to keep my student loans a priority since the interest rate is higher. My plan is to keep this loan as is, unless anyone has any advice for me, please share.

High-interest savings/Money Market/CD - From what I've read so far, this doesn't seem like a worthy investment at the current moment because of low interest rates/return. Correct me if I'm wrong and this is something I should look into.

Credit: I currently do not have any credit cards of my own, and I have a credit score of 670. I am currently registered as an authorized user on a parent's card, and my score dropped 80 pts when they made a big purchase without consulting me. I should be closer to 750, and I'm hoping this will recover over time. I've been told to invest in a prepaid credit card to boost my score, but this would be a last resort for me, if I have any other options for building my credit. The reason is because I would have to invest a large enough sum of money to keep my usage low, and that just seems like a waste of money when it would be invested elsewhere to bring in interest. What are my best options? Invest in a prepaid card, or just wait it out until my score recovers to apply for a credit card? The only reason why I want a credit card is to boost my credit score. I don't believe in credit card debt and don't plan on keeping a balance for any reason.

Cryptocurrency: I have about $1,200 in Bitcoin that I bought for funzies so that I could gift small amounts to family for birthdays and holidays. It's almost doubled in value, but I don't want to bank my future on this so I'm considering this more of a hobby than a financial decision. I don't plan on buying any more, but plan on holding onto what I have for at least a couple of years to see where it goes.

I realize I am way behind for my age, and I feel panicked when I think about my future. I wouldn't say that I've been financially irresponsible (I don't have any credit card debt or luxury items and live very frugally). It's more that I've been living more or less paycheck to paycheck on low income for most of my life (along with a few family &amp; health setbacks), and my career has made a turn where I've finally been able to save in the last 2 years. If anyone can give me some advice on how to turn things around, please let me know! Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,My dad needs a new car...and I have to pay for it.,"Hi all! I am 25F living in Canada with my family.

**Backstory:** my dad currently owns a 2007 Volvo S60 which is starting to become unsafe on the road. The car starts shaking back and forth on the highway and it's quite scary. I've had that car suddenly stop running as I was driving too, so our family decided it was time to replace this car.

**Financial situation:** my parents are around $200k in debt. They have been using line of credit to get by for the past decade or something. To be honest, I am not sure of the details because they do not disclose these sensitive information to me. All I know is that they don't really have money, and neither of them are working. For myself, I am making payments for my schooling and car. Since I am a student, I am only working part time (though not really now because of COVID-19). Basically, my finances are quite...tight.

**Problem:** the car my dad wants to replace is a 2015 Volvo S60 AWD that ran 54,000 km. We found a private seller that is listing the car for $22,000. Obviously, neither of my parents can buy the car. So it's up to me or my sister. My sister will never participate in this, so it is really up to me. I can't pull $22,000 out of my ass and it's a private seller, so it's not like I can finance it. I can use my student line of credit from RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) and they charge 2.45% interest to get the money. They do not expect me to pay them back until I am done my school program in addition with 2 years grace period upon completing my academic program. But during my schooling and the grace period, I only need to pay the interest.  The other option is to buy it from a Volvo dealership, and the car costs around $26,000. It is a 2017 Volvo S60 (but ran 71,000 km). We can finance it of course, and it should cost around $190/bi-weekly. The interest rate is 1.99%. I will be the one responsible for financing it.

Anyway...I suppose I am just ranting...I feel scared, trapped, and hopeless. My parents need a new car, and I somehow got burdened with the responsibility to pay for the car with my measly monthly earnings (I earn around $3100/month if I was working. Right now I get $2000/month from the government due to COVID) in addition to the money I owe with school and paying my own car. I had plans to save around $320/month to pay off either school or car but now it feels like I am set back. I am stressed. Thank you for reading this.

**Edit:** people have been asking if we have tried fixing the car. This year, my dad spent around $2500 (CAD) to get it fixed. yet the car was still shaking back and forth. So, yes we tried to fix the car. Unfortunately, neither of us are car experts, and I only have background laymen knowledge  in cars.

**Edit edit:** Btw, I am from a Hong Kong family and we are extremely family oriented. I appreciate that everyone is telling me to leave my parents, or to say no, or to just focus on myself but it just doesn't really...work. That being said, I also understand I need to set boundaries and to say no because this is truly impeding my finances and cultural values shouldn't justify ruining my life. On a bright side, it's because of everyone's bluntness, harshness here (it was hard to read some of your comments tbh) that allowed me to have a wake up call that I gotta really put my foot down and to look out for myself.. I don't want to antagonize my parents. They are *most definitely* selfish here and I agree. But at the same time, they raised me very well, invested a lot into my education when I was younger, they are loving and affectionate parents. But at the same time, my values tell me to also look out for my parents too. BUT. NOT at the expense of a $22k loan. I should only help them *within my means* and I have a *choice* to help them or not. And it's thanks to you redditors that made me have this wake up call. Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Just something general,"First off, I do apologize if my flair is incorrect.  I did read the rules, but I am still unsure of which to choose (apologize, I might just be dumb).

Ok, so I've started late last year to buy and sell crypto.  I am currently using the luno app as my ""base"" (not sure which is the correct term), but as things goes, I didn't think it all through, I've lost a bit of money.  Luckily not a lot, just tens.

So, I want to start fresh since I did not do a lot of research before hand.  So here are my 2 (thought it would be more) questions:

-what app or ""base"" can I use to buy, trade and sell my crypto.  I don't really like luno because their 'interest' rates are a bit high in my view.  Though I'm not sure about others. 

-what crypto should I start buying and selling? On this point if I can use an example:  last year bitcoin was at a high around 190k and a low around 40k (though sadly I missed that).  Id rather buy at a low and sell at a high.  With bitcoin I see that this could bring in quite the profits.  (though luno is like a vampire).  Besides bitcoin, what would you recommend to invest in or would it be best to stick with bitcoin. 

As far as my knowledge goes, my country doesn't use crypto as currency, nor is it common in purchase.  So I'm mainly using it as a means for a small income so I'm basing it around that.

It took me almost 4 months to realize that I was completely wrong and I had the entire scenario backwards. If you're a beginner then you too might also have this misconception or maybe it was just me. The reality is if the stock market is going up then the USD is going to end up losing strength and if the stock market is going down then the USD will gain strength. Let me briefly explain to you the reason why this is the case. If the stock market is doing well then it's going to give investors the confidence to head into some more riskier assets and currencies which we refer to as a risk on sentiment since investors are willing to take more risk. The USD is considered a safe haven currency and investors will jump to it if there's a lot of doubt or markets aren't looking too good which is referred to as risk off sentiment. If investors are willing to take more risk and jump to riskier assets then it means that they're likely going to sell off their USD in order to get into more riskier pairs. If investors start selling off USD what's going to happen to the strength of the USD? That's right it's going to get weaker. This is the reason why the stock market and the USD have a inverse relationship with each other.

Knowing this we should be able to look at the S&amp;P 500 Index in order to try to get an idea of what the USD pairs might do in the near future. This is where a lot of fundamentals come into play which is why I always recommend that every single trader sit down and read the news for about an hour every single day since it could give you a slight edge in the market.

**Unemployment Rate:** Looking at the U-6 unemployment rates we can see that the current unemployment has really spiked in the recent months due to the pandemic and it still hasn't really shown any signs of coming down yet which is definitely going to play an impact when the government might have to decrease grants and funding to businesses to keep employees employed.

[U-6 Unemployment Rate](https://preview.redd.it/y3ek7dcod9651.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b801604ef48f6b9f5d747d69231e487be859437f)

You also need to keep in mind that the government can only provide companies with so much money to keep people employed before they have to start backing away a bit. That point might be here soon and once that point comes then companies have one of two options: they can either continue to pay employees which is definitely going to hurt their profits or they can cut jobs which again isn't going to look good for the company since it's going to tell investors that the company isn't doing too hot. If investors start backing away from companies then the stock prices drop and that's going to be reflected in the S&amp;P 500.

**Reopening The Country?:** The US definitely wants to reopen and I'm not going to start a debate here about whether that's a good idea or a bad idea but I just want to state the numbers. Since states started to reopen guess what happened? Twenty-one state reported a jump in the number of cases of the Coronavirus. This could be a sign that the country isn't ready to reopen and companies are definitely aware of the fact. Just look at Apple and what they did. After viewing the increase in cases, Apple made the decision to close 11 of their reopened stores.

**The Feds:** The Federal Reserve has been really doing its best in order to keep liquidity up but the question is how long can they maintain it. Just take a look at the Balance Sheets of the Federal Reserve for a while and start comparing the numbers from recent balance sheets. It's becoming quite evident that the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet looks like it's going down which means they won't be able to keep adding liquidity into the stock market in order to keep it going higher. Once the liquidity they add starts to decrease drastically then we could begin to see the stock market drop which will drive the USD up. To top things off our GDP isn't also doing too hot right which is also adding onto the reasons of why there might be a big drop off in the stock market soon.

**Technicals:**

There's definitely a couple technical signs telling me that S&amp;P 500 Index is looking like it's getting ready for a drop off before proceeding to go higher.

&amp;#x200B;

[Elliott Wave 1](https://preview.redd.it/5r77z3k2rb651.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9196d8479e4f70b37cf61308640277ee5e182e)

In terms of Elliott Waves, to each is their own and everybody draws them differently. The S&amp;P 500 looks like it just completed the impulse move of an Elliott Wave. After an impulse move of an Elliott Wave there's always going to be a corrective phase described by the letters A, B, and C. If the B leg is completed then we could see a drop off of the S&amp;P 500 Index to around the 2800 area in order to complete the corrective phase before maybe continuing up if the Feds are able to keep pushing and the fundamentals begin to support them. This is just one Elliott Wave but I see another which is also saying that we might see a much larger drop off.

&amp;#x200B;

[Elliott Wave 2](https://preview.redd.it/ndpdre49n9651.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1409c18e100a8a7416773d9e01179ab6f9fa55d)

This Elliott Wave stretches further back and I'm more leaning towards this Elliott Wave since if you look at volume (green and red lines at bottom of the screen) you can see that it's really beginning to drop off and when you combine that with the Feds money dropping I think a large drop in the S&amp;P 500 is going to happen in the near future.

However there's one sign that's currently making me a bit nervous about this analysis and that's the Bullish Hidden Divergence.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hidden Divergence](https://preview.redd.it/0n0aknqhp9651.png?width=1289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa2da07fa5f9945b13cc4722c9201b39289b388)

Looking at the 4 Hour chart there's some pretty clear hidden divergence since price made a higher low but the RSI made a lower low which could be an indication that there might be a trend continuation and the S&amp;P 500 Index could continue to push higher which might mean I would have to reconsider my Elliott Waves.

Well now let's head back to the USD shall we. With the S&amp;P 500 looking like it's going to drop, I feel it'll create a risk off sentiment for investors where they'll jump back to the safe haven currencies. This should definitely increase the strength of the USD so you probably will want to keep your eye on the S&amp;P 500 Index and some of the USD pairs since they might have some large moves in the near future and I want to make sure that you're on the right side of the moves. This is just my take on what I think will happen according to the information I have. If you completely disagree with me and you think the S&amp;P 500 and stock market will continue their rally up then let me know as I would love to get some perspectives from others. I hope you enjoyed that little lesson on cross analysis and how you can use other resources in order to try to predict what a currency will do in the near future.",finance
gaming,2020 specs for gaming PC?,"Wasn't really expecting to shell out anything more than $600 for now at least. Trying to figure out what to buy, but there are SO many different variations. I used to have a GTX 1060 but that was 2 years ago. Been on xbox since a storm fried my motherboard.

I'm 21 and get paid $300 a week (free room, board and food at uni plus scholarships so all my money is for spending) should i wait a while to buy something over a thousand or what? I don't really want to have the BEST graphic/performance specs but i'd at least like to play the AAA game titles comfortably, maybe some MMO games because..it's PC.

Super realistic graphics don't really interest me, but what about processor/cpu? I'd like to buy a premade because I previously f@#$ed up trying to install my own stuff, never again. Any recommended sites?",technology

personalfinance,Is it better to make saving easier or to get more from your money?,"I have 2 banks, currently, Synchrony and Chase. Synchrony offers better interest rates (I believe they're at about 1.05% currently, I've had it up to 2.5%, Chase gives a flat 0.01%) but Chase makes it really easy to save without thinking about it with their Autosave thingy.

Autosave let's me set up automatic transfers based on criteria I set up. You can set $X to transfer every 15th, or X% of every deposit over $XX, and a couple other. It also automatically doesn't initialize a transfer if your checking balance is below a certain amount of money you set. I don't even have to think about it, I just have to check my balance before making purchases over my safe balance level. There also isn't the stupid 1-3 day waiting period while banks send my money back and forth, it instantly withdraws from my checking and instantly deposits in my savings.

My personal finance teacher always screamed and screamed that you should always go after the better interest rate, but tbh, because of all the annoyances and human interaction involved, I often forget to save at all, until I opened my Chase account. So Reddit, give a stupid 20 year old some advice?",finance
personalfinance,"To buy, or rent. That is the question.","Sorry if this is too long, I'll try to provide enough information without going into our life story. Basically my husband and I recently moved to Texas and are currently staying with family while we decide whether we want to try to qualify for a home loan, or just rent a place. We have about $35,000, both need cars, and I currently have a job which take home pay is about $2,600. He is going back to school which is covered right now through grants and scholarships, and is looking for a part time job to hopefully bring in about $1000 a month. What are our best options for planning for the future? We were thinking maybe now is a good time to get a house since interest rates are so low, and we would be looking mainly for something that the property will have good resale value, not for our dream house or anything. But since we are doing it for investment purposes, we would love some advice as too if this is the best way to spend our money currently.",finance

personalfinance,Question about taking out a loan to consolidate credit card debt.,"So without a ton of backstory, my wife and I are looking to buy a house in the next year or so. We've been working diligently to lower our debts, but due to a variety of factors, we have racked up quite a bit of credit card debt. We had around $12k in CC debt, but recently paid off our highest usage card, and we're now down to just over $7k of debt. Both of our credit scores are mid to high 600s (mine jumped to around 680 or so after paying off the card).

We looked into a balance transfer CC, but our scores are far too low to qualify. We spoke with our local credit union and were told we could take out a loan to cover the CC debt and it would cut our interest rate by more than half of our average interest rate across the cards. This seems like our best bet, but will having a $7k loan out affect our ability to obtain a mortgage? If it matters, we will be first time buyers using the first time homebuyers option in our state.

Should we go through with the loan or are there better options for us?

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Advice on opening a savings account (for the first time),"Hi,

Here's a little info on me:

An international grad student in a two year program starting August. I finished my undergrad in the states and worked last year. Currently, I have $3000 in my bank (from what I had saved) and starting August, I'll be getting semesterly stipend of $5500. I will be living with my boyfriend who is also a grad student and American. So, we are splitting rent and everything else.

Here's my half per month:

Rent starting August will be $490 /m

Groceries /m: $200

Electric + wifi (the apartment comes with other utilities): $70 (approx)

And we're setting aside a misc amt for extra expenditure each month: $100

\*We don't really have any other expenditure, we have full-scholarships and no student debt from undergrad either.

So, I will be putting aside $760 or about $800 a month (just to be safe) and he will be doing the same for our expenses. As for the remainder: I want to put a significant amount into savings to earn interest.

Here's my predicament:

How should I start saving? What banks should I look into? (I currently have a checking account with Chase bank) What interest rates should I be looking at?

I would really love for anyone to share what they think/they would do if they were in my situation?

My bf and my goal is to start investing in the stock market at some point.",finance
personalfinance,"What does it really mean to apply payments ""to interest"" or ""to principal""?","In my mind, there is just an amount $X that you owe. Every payment period you increase $X by a factor of (1 + your interest rate) and decrease it by your payment amount. But people keep saying that if you make early payments, you need to make sure the servicer applies it to principal and not to interest.

If the two are distinct, then how can you observe the difference? Do your statements distinguish between ""outstanding principal"" and ""outstanding (or credited) interest""? Is there a checkbox on the servicer's website that says where to apply extra payments?

And is there ever any advantage to applying payments to interest? How would I know if I have the right to apply payments to principal when examining loan documents?",finance
CryptoCurrency,10 famous cryptocurrency quotes and what we can learn from them - read and don't look like a fool anymore :P,"**“If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you, sorry.” – Satoshi Nakamoto**

This is an early quote from Satoshi Nakamoto to the Bitcoin doubters on the forums. Since those early days, a whole industry has been created around his invention. With hindsight, it is easy to say that perhaps people should have listened, but what was created was something entirely unique and therefore difficult for many to understand. A key aspect of this message is that to understand Bitcoin, you need to put the time and effort in to learn on your own. Mistakes can easily be made by trusting unscrupulous actors.

**“It’s money 2.0, a huge, huge, huge deal.”  – Chamath Palihapitiya, venture capitalist**

Chamath Palihapitiya was an early employee at Facebook before moving on and setting up his own investment fund. By 2015, his fund had over $1.1 billion in assets, and he also became a minority shareholder of the Golden State Warriors NBA team. Despite stating he is a disciple of Warren Buffett, they do disagree on the notion of Bitcoin. Palihapitiya is a strong believer in the cryptocurrency. He believes that within the next 20 years, Bitcoin will rise to $1 million.

**“It’s a fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs” – Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan**

Unsurprisingly, the boss of JP Morgan – Jamie Dimon – isn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin. This quote from Mr Dimon in 2017 was spoken during the most recent Bitcoin bubble. Since then however, JP Morgan has announced its own form of cryptocurrency, suggesting the banking titan isn’t as adverse to crypto as the quote suggests. One of Bitcoin’s main aims is to remove the need for such huge banks as JP Morgan, so it is unlikely that Jamie Dimon will ever change his mind.

**“Stay away from it. It’s a mirage, basically. In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.”  –  Warren Buffett, legendary investor**

Coming back to the traditional finance sector, the fact that Buffet isn’t a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general is to be expected. Buffett’s fortune has been accumulated through traditional assets and a patient approach. The risk and volatility seen in cryptocurrencies would be an instant warning sign to the famous investor. Buffett has been notoriously adverse to upcoming technology stocks, so a punt on Bitcoin isn’t going to be happening any time soon.

**“I do think Bitcoin is the first \[encrypted money\] that has the potential to do something like change the world.” – Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal**

Peter Thiel and his team had a similar idea to Bitcoin when in the process of creating PayPal. However, at the time, they were unable to get their idea off the ground. Peter Thiel is now one of the largest venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and a staunch Randian. These two factors should show why he has an interest in Bitcoin.

**“Bitcoin actually has the balance and incentives center, and that is why it is starting to take off.” – Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks**

Bitcoin and Wikileaks have a long relationship. Indeed, without Bitcoin, there may not be a Wikileaks as we know it. When the major credit card companies attempted to block payments to Wikileaks, the company asked for donations in Bitcoin instead, which allowed it to survive. Nakamoto was adverse to supporting Wikileaks due to the pressure it would put on the young network. Julian Assange himself is one of the earlier cypherpunks, regularly interacting with members on the CypherPunk mailing list from 1995. Ideas such as Bitcoin were common on the mailing list, so when Bitcoin was finally released, the fact that Wikileaks appropriated it is not surprising.

**“The Federal Reserve simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way.” – Janet Yellen, former chair of the US Federal Reserve**

Janet Yellen highlights a key aspect of Bitcoin in her quote. Bitcoin is not a US cryptocurrency. Instead, it is the first truly global currency. It isn’t run by anyone in particular, but anyone who wants to get involved can do so. This makes it extremely difficult for the authorities to formulate regulations around Bitcoin. This also makes Bitcoin extremely difficult to stop. Many bans have been rumoured throughout the years, but this has never stopped Bitcoin from progressing.

**“Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.” – Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum**

Buterin’s quote recognises the removal of third parties that cryptocurrencies allow for. Instead of a company like Uber or say Dropbox taking a cut of the profits, this can all be managed in a peer-to-peer manner through cryptocurrencies. This increases the profits for you and me, reduces costs, and can help remove some of the largest corporations in the world in the hope of creating a fairer economy.

**“I see Bitcoin as ultimately becoming a reserve currency for banks, playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking. Banks could issue digital cash with greater anonymity and lighter weight, more efficient transactions.” – Hal Finney**

This early quote from Hal Finney shows that he understood the possibilities of Bitcoin from a very early stage. This was helped by the many discussions that took place on the CypherPunk mailing list in the 1990s, whereby digital currencies and issues of privacy were constantly discussed and philosophised.

**“Since we’re all rich with Bitcoins … we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use.” – Hal Finney**

personalfinance,(US) does TurboTax remembering my prior years taxes give me any real convenience?,"So this is my 3rd year doing taxes, and I notice Turbo Tax imports my prior year’s tax info since I did it with them last year too. Is this something I need, if I don’t have any big events in my life such as buying a new house?

Some background on why I’m asking this:

So for 2019, I guess my W2 wasn’t correct or something and now I owe (according to Turbo Tax) $1500 in federal taxes (no state, I live in TX). Because I’m also deducting student loans, I will have to upgrade my Turbo Tax to the $80 version for them to include my student loans in my filing. So I’m wondering, if I have to pay $1500, why should I pay Turbo Tax not only the base product, but upgrade to the $80 version so I can claim my student loans? 

The only answer I’ve come up with so far is bc it imports data from the previous year’s taxes, and I don’t even know if this is important. I think I’d like to just use Turbo Tax and my guide on how to fill out my tax form and then submit it myself for free (well minus the $1500 I owe). 

But at the same time, doing this all yourself is a hassle (I’m pretty tax illiterate), then I’d rather just suck it up and pay those $80 and file with Turbo Tax.

personalfinance,"Pay off debts, Invest, or Spend it?","Hello, 

I am 25 years old and starting dental school this fall. I have about 10K sitting in my bank account that I  am not 100% sure what to do while I am in dental school. My current undergraduate debt is around 14k (3\~5% APR). I will be getting federal loan (\~7%) for my dental school tuition and cost of living. I expect to borrow at most 75k per year. 

I have been thinking how I should use my 10k. Pay undergraduate loans? Invest them in ETF funds or stock market? or spend it to borrow less for loans?

personalfinance,Should I pull out of contributing to my investments to pay off my auto loan?,"I've been mulling this over personally for a few months. Since I follow this sub relatively closely, I thought I'd see if someone had some advice.

Situational details:

- 29 years old
- 85k/year + bonuses 
- 37% of my income goes towards investments (Roth IRA max, HSA max, 401k 6% full match, rest goes to brokerage account for house savings)
- Emergency account stocked for 4 months
- 813? credit score 

Auto loan details:

- $35,910 initial amount, 10/2019, %4.04 interest rate, 72 months :( (not smart, I get it)
- I'll pay 4.5k over the life of it 
- $560 a month, I currently pay $600

I'm mulling over pulling some money from the brokerage account or Roth IRA on a monthly basis to pay off the auto loan faster. However, that would set me back on faster retirement and buying a house sooner which imo would be a good investment and at my age that needs to happen soon. 

I get investing in the Roth IRA feels good, but it feels silly putting away 6k a year there when I'm going to lose 4.5k over 6 years? Idk. The yields there seem they'll outweight the auto loan loss, but it would feel good to have 0 debt too.

personalfinance,Advice Needed: What are the next steps after you receive a debt settlement offer in the mail?,"TLDR:  
I have a private student loan that went into collections. A couple of days ago I received an offer in the mail to settle for 30% off. The caveat is that I have to pay the loan off in full.

Taking the offer would mean leaving just $1000 in my emergency savings. What should I do?

Should I try to see if they'll cut a higher percentage (immediately)?

Should I wait to negotiate when I have more savings?

Is there another option you'd suggest?

Longer Version:  
\~$36,000 in federal student loans  
\~$2,000 credit card debt

I work in healthcare administration--my company is profiting more than usual so there are no plans to lay off any personnel. Last week I paid off the only other account I have in collections. Getting this final monkey off my back would allow my credit to rebound.

Though saving aggressively when you have major debt goes against the prime directive my mental health has improved by seeing the number in my bank account rising. I spent the last 5 years underemployed and unable to save, so bending the rules is a suitable trade-off to rebuilding confidence and my dumpster fire of a life.

I originally planned to pay minimums on the debt in good standing, save aggressively until the end of the year, and then seek to settle with this debtor for the lowest amount possible. In 2021 I would begin aggressively paying down the other debt.",finance

Dear lord they are loaded to gills with debt.

Who holds it?

Banks.

GS.  BNS.  BAC.  PNC.  WFC


My theory is they were reaching for yield so they jumped into the energy bandwaggon.

Cant get yield from the fed, so get it from energy.  

This allows banks to attract HNW/Affluent by paying about par rates on savings accounts, and then using those deposits in normal frational reserve functions like auto loans.

The music stopped last quarter bigly.

Both on payment of hi yield debt (chk just filed its not paying interest for 30 days) as well as private loans like auto and mortgage on the retail side.

Plus CRE.

Its so bad, some banks have shifted teams from market makers to market savers with work out plans.

The icing on the cake js fed is now questioning dividend affordability and putting banks thru V, U, W, and L stress tests.

Covid is rising in usa.

And latest survey of household stress has a lot of people planning to sell their house if financials get any tighter.

fintech,Kick-Ass 2: Multiple guarantors-backed lending service ideas to validate,"Hello everyone!

Thank you all for your replies to my recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/h17496/looking_for_a_fintech_expert_to_kickass_my_idea/)!

My initial idea was a P2P but having made additional research I've excluded peer lending from the model as it won't affect the primary goal (return rate) but could lead to overcomplexity at the start.

What I want to do is to allow the borrower to sign **multiple guarantors** among friends. My goal is to repeat the [Grameen Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank) trusted loan scheme with its 99% return rate. I see this as a mobile-first service that uses social networks.

What are the critical legal restrictions that could break my model?

Also, does the community know any micro-to-mid loan service that with a similar approach? 

I've noted Amigo and Suretly. Amigo allows signing a **single guarantor** and wires a loan to that guarantor: too much effort for a guarantor. Suretly is about croudvouching and guarantors **vouch for people they don't know:** the real value of a guarantor is missing here.

**UPDATE**: I've clarified post a bit and would like to add that I've done my homework: I've read annual reports, found some legal issues that current players are facing, but nothing critical that prohibits my approach. I assume that having a high return rate and affordable interest rate there is a place on the market. But having no direct examples and performance metrics except Grameen, I'm wondering is it not implemented yet or someone failed for some heavy reason? Or maybe I google wrong?

stocks,Interest shifting to foreign stocks as US equities hit full recovery prices,"It appears to me that, unlike earlier in the COVID19 season, foreign equities aren't lagging behind US equities anymore, particularly in the past week. After looking around a bit this morning, I do find some confirmation of this, for example: 

* [BlackRock says it’s warming up to Europe, which it says may outgrow the U.S. in second half of the year](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackrock-says-its-warming-up-to-europe-which-it-says-may-outgrow-the-us-in-second-half-of-the-year-2020-06-22)

My thinking on this is two-fold: 

Firstly, US private corps, equities &amp; corporate bonds have received the benefit of an enormous stimulus and practically unlimited backing by the fed and are earlier in their stock market values recovery curve than other countries' markets, so foreign stocks have room to run some more in their recovery.

Secondly, the dollar is persistently the butt of disagreement over inflation/deflation threats as the result of the stimulus and economic contraction due to the pandemic. While one would expect massive inflation from so many dollars being printed, there's also deflation to consider due to possible recession, which is a function of market fundamentals driving prices and is not as divorced from the real economy as a fed-supported market recovery can be. The possibility of inflation and deflation also seems to be affected by how well the US economy does compared to other countries, making the USD a safe haven that foreign buyers will support, and foreign buyers of the USD reduce the risk of inflation. Nevertheless, there does appear to be a significant possibility of some weakening of the USD as other countries' economies begin to climb up their economies' recovery curve.

A way to investors capture gains from the recovery of Europe does appear to be opting to invest in foreign stocks. But investing in foreign companies listed on the US stock exchanges as ADRs doesn't capture the currency inflation/deflation effects of a foreign investment, when the benefits of hedging vs a weakening of the USD in coming months should be one of the benefits of investing in foreign stock in these circumstances. In the past week, while looking at foreign stocks vs US stocks, my impression is that foreign stocks listed in foreign exchanges outperformed foreign stocks listed in US stocks markets, possibly because US-listed foreign stocks are subject to the same market sentiment &amp; currency conditions as US-listed US stocks which saw some seesaw activity last week. 

Personally, I have been tracking different investments in foreign stocks for a few weeks, and it seems to me that some foreign mutual funds and foreign ETFs that are not based on matching indexes, but are actively managed to select the best investments and outperform indexes, are performing better than index-matching mutual funds and ETFs. For example, Kraneshares ETF KWEB, invests in China tech stocks, and Kraneshares ETF KURE, invests in Chinese health company stocks, and they have outperformed China's broader indexes (as well as US markets, including NASDAQ) in the past week. This is also true of mutual funds, like Matthews Asia Innovators funds, MATFX, and MCSMX.

[This chart compares the performance of KWEB, MATFX and MCSMX to the US market indexes SPX and NDAQ in the past month](https://imgur.com/YW1OGWR). Especially notable is how they continue to march up even though the US stock indexes appear to be slowing/consolidating near a local top in the past week. This is interesting because many US-listed Chinese stocks like BABA &amp; JD appear to be following US market trends, which one would expect because they are held in US index ETFs and many US institutional investors also have them in their portfolios. This led to me take a second look at why the foreign ETFs and mutual funds were outperforming the US-listed foreign stocks that they supposedly hold. The answer appears to be that the more well-managed foreign ETFs and mutual funds are investing in these companies in foreign markets as local investors and not trading the US-listed stocks of these foreign companies. 

What that suggests is that we're already seeing the incremental effect of dollar inflation as part of the US market performance. And that investing in foreign stocks in well-managed, actively managed ETFs and mutual funds that are able to invest locally in foreign countries generates returns not only from room left to run in other countries' economic recovery, but that as those countries' economies strengthen, the weakening USD vis a vis those countries' currencies, that effect may make foreign stocks purchased on foreign exchanges in the other countries' currencies more valuable. A final consideration is, there is a chance of a very significant upside to holding foreign-currency-denominated stocks as [some of the more bold predictions of a weakening dollar predict a double-digit inflation move in the next few months](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dollar-is-going-to-fall-very-very-sharply-warns-prominent-yale-economist-2020-06-16) (personally I see a big weakening of the USD in coming months as being possible but not inevitable, and the Fed will certainly try to fight that if it happens).

I've enjoyed the 25% gains I've gotten from KWEB in the past month, and that continue to roll in. I'm now looking at very high quality, actively managed mutual funds that cover European and Emerging market stocks in a way that the funds hold the stocks as local investors, to break this approach out to other countries. As the Blackrock article, and some other suggest, it might be time to start following Europe's stimulus efforts more closely to assess what countries/companies that impacts the most. It takes more research to dig up good actively managed ETFs and mutual funds than it takes to invest in index funds, but it's not as challenging as trying to pick stocks in this fast-moving market environment.

So these are my thoughts, up for discussion. Feedback welcomed.

tldr; investing in very well-managed, actively managed speciality foreign ETFs and mutual funds (and not index ETFs) is not only a way to capture returns from room left to run in other countries' recovery, but it's also a way to hedge/capture gains from some USD inflation occurring due to the massive stimulus, as some of them may offer foreign stocks purchased locally in foreign-denominated currencies so they are investments denominated in other strengthening economies' currencies, which should rise vs the USD in coming months.",finance

investing,Time to sell bonds?,"Gov. bonds are great during falling interest rates and as hedges against deflation.  

With gov. bonds at rock bottom yields, is it time to rotate to cash?  I don't seem much upside to bonds anymore and if inflation starts to tick up, there could be some real downside. 

At a macro level, business are opening and the US economy will likely start to come back to life (modulo a 2nd waive shutdown).  

Edit to add: 
Just to be clear, some people are saying gov. bonds are great in a crash, and they are, but look where *they are at right now*.  Bonds perform well when people are running to them and bidding down interest rates.  Interest rates are right near zero with short and interim term gov. bonds.  If people run to them further, they *might* bid them to negative nominal interest rates but that's a big if.  Also, I'm comparing to cash which has no nominal downside risk. 

In the *current* situation, which has the better risk/reward situation.  Bonds will only really outperform cash at this point if we go into deflation where as cash should be relatively flat nominally regardless of interest rates.  

So, the question is, which would you prefer right now, *cash or gov bonds* if you have to choose between those two based on the current situation and risk/reward outlooks.

personalfinance,Canada Student Loan Fixed or Floating,"I am paying back my federal student loan through NSLSC. They allow two interest options

* a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate; or
* a fixed interest rate of the prime rate + 2%.

It says the prime rate is based on the 5 major financial institutions in Canada. I believe right now it is 2.45%. I have heard that these rates are low comparatively so would now be a good time to switch to the prime + 2% (4.45%) or just stick on floating? Once you go fixed, you can't go back.

personalfinance,Review of Budget in Consideration of Goals,"Hello everyone,

My husband and I are 26F and 28M respectively and could use some assistance looking over our budget, and seeing how it compares to our current goals.

**My main questions are:**

1. Should I be putting in $700/month into my student loans?
2. If no, where should I be allocating that money?
3. Where should my husband allocate the extra $200-$300 left over at the end of the month?
4. My husband wants to get rid of his 2016 Mustang for a more family friendly car (used if possible, to avoid another car payment), what is the best way to go about that? Worst case scenario we can use my car (Toyota Corolla) as the family car when we have a child.
5. What is the best method of saving for retirement for myself?

**Plans/Goals**

* Possibly look into purchasing a house late 2021 or early 2022 (more likely)
* Having a baby hopefully by the end of 2021

**Here are our current outstanding loans:**

* My Student Loan: $15,515 (varying interest rates, highest of 4.66%- will have that group paid off in October 2020)
   * Minimum required student loan payment= $200, 0% interest until Oct.1, 2020
* My Car Loan: $9,897 (about 1% interest rate)
* Husband's Car Loan: $10,850 (his is somewhere between 2-3% interest)

**As well as our current savings:**

* My savings: $3,200
* Husband's savings: $4,400
* $$ saved for house down payment (as of end of June): $7,500

personalfinance,Turning 18 soon- Please give feedback on how I plan on spending $5.5k!,"Hi, I will be turning 18 in a few days and would like some criticism on my financial plan. To preface, I just want to comfort (hopefully) everyone in saying that I have already read all of the side bar information and am a long time lurker on this subreddit so I have a decent understanding of personal finance. I will be attending an in state university this fall and have tuition completely covered for the first year (accumulated ~$24k in grants and scholarships). Unfortunately, I will be taking out $11k in loans for my first year. I also have ~5.5k in cash to play around with. Here is what I plan on doing ASAP upon turning 18. 

1. Open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and deposit $3k in VTSAX
    1. I would like to only deposit $1k but it seems like the minimum for VTSAX is $3k. I may consider only putting $1k in S&amp;P 500 index. Please advice
2. Set aside a $1k emergency fund with Ally Bank’s HYSA
    1. I feel like this $1k is a complete waste as I do not have any other expenses except for transportation, entertainment, and other miscellaneous fees. Certainly can survive without any of the expenses listed above. My parents are also welcoming me to come home every weekend so I don’t think ill ever be in a true emergency. Open to other recommendations.
3. Invest $1k. Whether it is stocks, using it to start an online business, using it as capital for flipping (buying and reselling), this money will be used strictly for business
    1. May look into starting an Etsy shop to sell handmade jewelry and/or opening a dropshipping business
4. Keep the remaining ~$500 or so in my checking account
    1. Mostly “fun” money but I may consider using it to slowly chip away my student loans ($120 per month)
5. Open up a student credit card with Discover It. Yes, I’ll keep my credit utilization rate below 10%

I appreciate all who have made it through this far. I think the biggest criticism will be my $10k student loan that I’ll be taking out. Considering I want to keep this as finance related as possible, let’s just say I have extremely strict, but supportive parents and never got the “high school experience” or any real “social experience” as a matter of fact. Although I believe all of my classes will be fully available remotely, i’d much rather take out $11k in loans at 2.75-4.5% interest rates to pay for housing and for the “college experience”. I feel that us 18 year olds will find a way to make fun memories (and party) during our first year amidst COVID. This will certainly not happen if I stay home and take all of my classes via Zoom.

Please leave any suggestions and/or advice!

Thanks again",finance
personalfinance,Is it normal to feel broke when you’re not?,"Let me preface this with a couple of things before I get started

-I know my situation is a lot better off than most people
-I know I’m not even in a bad position
-I probably just have unrealistic expectations

That being said, I’m about to strike off on my own for the first time and after getting a preliminary budget on paper it just feels like I don’t have as much money as I expected now that I’m going to have my first salary job. I’m making around $3,000 after taxes, both state and federal. 

Take away another $1600 for rent. 

Another $250 for auto insurance. 

Another $100 for groceries (this might be low or high as my job has a lot of travel where my food is paid for most of the week). 

Another $300 if not more for savings

Another $300 for charity

And that leaves me around $450 disposable income

I know it’s not actually broke as I’m still clearly up $450. It just doesn’t feel like as much money as my probably unrealistic expectations put me at and just makes me a little disappointed. Couple that with being a year behind my friends due to getting my masters and then making probably 20 k more than me just makes it feel worse. Is $450 of disposable income a month more than I’m thinking it is?",finance
personalfinance,"Refinancing house, considering AmeriSave","I have a $340k loan at 4.25%, 30 year conventional fixed plan and was shopping around for lower interest rate. My main goal is to lower my interest rate and lower my monthly payments. I talked to my current loan company and was offered 3.5% for the same 30 year plan. I used lendingtree and AmeriSave quoted me at 3% for the same 30 year plan. So far they have my interest on the low interest rate and monthly payments they offered me. The person I talked to over the phone mentioned that they will waive the appraiser fee and getting my house appraised won't help my monthly payment to be any lower. But there is a house estimated value listed on my quote which is higher than the value listed when I purchased the house two years ago. I then called my realtor was directly to a mortgage broker. I filled out an application from the mortgage broker and waiting for their reply.

I'm favoring AmeriSave as of right now but my concern is that, am I moving to fast? Is there anything I should look out for when doing business with AmeriSave or refinancing in general? Should I work with the mortgage broker recommended by my realtor. This whole entire process is a bit overwhelming. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",finance

financialindependence,Re-evaluating the 60-40 portfolio,"I was catching up on podcasts this past weekend and listened to Masters in Business, an interview with Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School and wrote a bunch of books, etc. In the podcast, Siegel argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is dead due to low yields on bonds. He argues that the difference between the 2008 crisis and the current crisis is that in 2008 the banks did not have much excess reserves, and the Fed's balance sheet expansion increased those reserves without much new lending. The current bailouts are cash infusions directly to businesses and consumers, and he cites the rapid increase in M1 and M2 money supply that did not occur anywhere near as much as it is happening now. There is something like a 30% increase in Americans' checking accounts due to the crisis. Just look at the current M2 money supply: 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2

Siegel predicts a sharp increase in spending next year and higher inflation, contrary what many other analysts are saying (long term low or negative yields). Thus, Siegel predicts a bond bear market and that the low interest environment of the current period will end. Ultimately, Siegel argues that the coronavirus bailouts will be paid ultimately by bond holders, as currently issued low yield bonds will face capital losses. He does not advocate dumping bonds altogether, but shifting from 60/40 more towards the 20-25% bonds. 

He also predicts long-term stock returns to also decline from historically 7% to 5.5%. 

I know most people in the sub are probably not 60/40, but there could be an argument to be made to reduce overall bond holdings in the long-run. What do you guys think?",finance

    The state of the world that they outline along with the infamous BTC time traveller post suggests something quite bleak.

    Not to say that this will ever actually come to be. Although,  I can’t help but think with the current state of our world we could be heading right towards this.

My husband and I both need vehicles so we can't sell a car, motorcycle is unsellable right now, nobody is buying bikes right now with Covid hardship. 
- Would it be better to pay off the low interest car loan completely, or put that same amount to pay down the high interest car loan to shave off interest accrual?
- I believe I should go ahead and pay the credit card off completely...
- From what I've read on here I need to put 18k (6 months CoL) aside in a savings account and not touch it....which would leave $12k remaining to allocate to paying off debts...

&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group Inc. is undervalued, especially when considering its investment in a peer that could one day rival Nikola Corp., according to a hedge fund that recently established a position in the shares.

&gt;The stock of the Ohio-based company, which designs and builds electric vehicles and aircraft, trades at “a significant discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value,” Formidable Asset Management LLC said in a research note.

&gt;The stock is undervalued “despite its presence in this attractive niche, valuable intellectual property, and potentially transformative strategic partnerships,” Formidable’s Chief Executive Officer Will Brown and Chief Investment Officer Adam Eagleston wrote.

&gt;The company’s “key stamp of approval” is its client roster, which includes companies like United Parcel Service Inc., DHL Worldwide Express, FedEx Corp. and Ryder System Inc., according to the note.

&gt;Formidable added that Workhorse’s investment in electric pickup-truck maker Lordstown Motors Corp. is the “kicker.” The 10% stake could be worth over $1 billion even if the market views Lordstown as only half as valuable as Nikola, the fund said.

&gt;Nikola, which designs and manufactures battery-electric and hydrogen-electric vehicles, has nearly doubled since debuting on the Nasdaq June 4 via a reverse merger. Workhorse’s shares have gained 50% over the same period.

I attend school out of state and I have run into a bit of a financial aid obstacle. I took a year off to work full time after high school, which helped me til now. However, my family's combined household income in 2018 put me just above the line for one of the federal grants I received. This makes my costs significantly higher. I have been in contact with my school and I submitted my 2019 info (which was noticeably less.) What I am wondering is if it would help me more by moving out of my folks house and into an apartment in the area so I can be independent from them. I understand that at that point I would pay completely for all my own things (insurance, rent, utilities, etc.). But if I was independent, would that not grant me additional aid through the FAFSA? The school I attend is very strict with their off campus housing policy, but complete independence from parents is an exception they allow for one to live off campus, and there are good options for places to live up there. If I did that, it would be significantly cheaper than student housing. I am just curious if it's worth it to move out or just stay with my folks. I have a job here at home this summer and Christmas break, and an on campus job at school. However, I don't make nearly what I did during my year off so I feel like staying with my parents would also be fine. There is zero family drama, just want to find some help here!",finance
personalfinance,Maxed out on 403b,"Hi! I am 25 woman and am maxing out on my 403b this year, and did for the first time last year.  I currently have $28000 and will have around $41k by the end of 2020. I always put the max. 6k in my roth first. Before that, I was hardly contributing more than $1000 or so a year since my salary was so low. I finished school at 22. I am trying to build a nest egg for when I am older. Right now, I make 69k, and I just got promoted. I will be making 80,500 starting next month. I do live in a large city where expenses are high, but am also free of debt, or children so that is a lot easier right now. I also try to keep my expenses down, and I don't own a car. I also walk to work and save on my commute (pre-covid obviously). I own a two bedroom condo--and have a roommate who pays a little bit more than half the mortgage. I pay around $1080 utilities included (they pay around 1200), my mortgage is 2133 with approx. $100 in utilities. When I get a new roommate I will likely up this a little as I did not really account for too many maintenance costs on their end.

My question is after maxing out on my 403b, what would would be a good next step in terms of long-term investing? Should I try to pay off more of my mortgage first or allocate my money elsewhere? My interest rate on my mortgage is 3.625%, and it's in an extremely desirable area of the city. I only put 10 percent down, so I do have $90/monthly in PMI and some additional interest, but I also get a deduction on my monthly taxes (that I would not if I rented out the unit without me living there) so it evens out a little with the market value for the apt.

personalfinance,Mortgage Interest Rate Question,"Hello All,

Me and my wife are going to purchasing a house, one we have already picked out and put an offer in on (which was accepted) It is a new construction, and we plan on being there for a long time.

I will also have some (around $50) worth of PMI on my monthly bill. 

Which option seems to be the more logical? The Extra 6K down is what i was originally planning to do. I'm worried that interest rates will eventually rise back up and refinancing wont do much good. 

 

$230K Purchase, 30K down + escrow + pay down amount

$200,000 loan, 30 yr fixed:

3.375% par rate, no cost

3.25% costs 0.375 points ($750). Payment and Interest = $870

3.125% costs 0.625 points ($1250).  Payment and Interest = 857

3.0% costs 1.0 points ($2000).  Payment and Interest =843

&amp;#x200B;

 

$230K Purchase, 24K Down + Escrow + Pay Down amount

3.0% @ cost .625 ($1,287.50).  Payment and Interest = 868

3.125 @ cost .25 ($515) .  Payment and Interest = 882

3.25 @ cost .0% ($750).  Payment and Interest = 897",finance
personalfinance,"Lost my FICO score due to inactivity, advice/help?","So I'm in an odd situation right now.

**TLDR**: I haven't had loans/credit usage since mid 2018. My only credit card was closed in August 2019 due to inactivity. If I apply for a credit card and make some payments, will my score take 6 months to appear or will it ""renew"" shortly after I first start paying it off?

I got my first credit card right around the end of college in 2014 or 2015. I used this every month til about mid 2018 when it expired and they had sent a new one. The new one never arrived and I was in the middle of a move. I checked a couple times to make sure no one else had activated the card and used it. I figured I would request a new one after my move because I didn't want the card arriving at my old address. Life/depression got me and it was one of those things I just kept putting off until it eventually closed in August 2019.

In the mean time I had some loans from tuition that I paid off back in 2017. I also had a car loan that I paid off monthly until mid 2018 when I paid it off in full.

Here I am in 2020 getting ready to start the process of getting a mortgage and buying a nice house, now that I have enough saved up for a down payment + closing costs and all of that good stuff.

I went to check my credit score today, I figured it probably went down a little bit due to not using it recently and just now found out that it completely goes away after 6 months. I realize that I brought this upon myself due to pure laziness and I'm trying to figure out what the next steps are.

Will I have to apply for a card, use it, and wait 6 months before I will get a score back?",finance
personalfinance,Opening Brokerage Account First Time?,"Hey guys I have two questions regarding opening up a taxable brokerage account through Vanguard.

1. I was looking into making a 10k minimum investment into VTSAX to be able to qualify for 0.04 percent ER. Should I look to go 100% stock as JL Collins pointed out or should I put some percentage into VBTLX? I'm currently 28. I understand time in the market is more important than timing of the market, but should I wait until the next couple months if we have another economic downturn because of the easing of restrictions in the country to COVID. The overall plan is to just buy and hold, do not plan on selling within the next 5 or even 10 years (if I can stay employed of course) which leads me to my next question
2. How do taxes work in a brokerage account? I'm currently single and in the 24% Federal Tax Bracket. I was confused on what I was reading that if I don't sell any funds within 1 year, tax rate on capital gains is only 15%. Can anyone offer some clarity? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,How to withdraw money from Vanguard without 10% tax? Novice question regarding tax,"Hello, 

I was able to contribute the max $6k for 2019 in a Roth IRA brokerage account. Ended up buying about 5k in different ETFs and was left with about $1000 which automatically got transferred into the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund. 

I want to pull the $1000 out for more liquidity but when I try to withdraw it shows a 

* Federal Tax - Do Not without or Percentage amount options
* Tax withholding notice - Don't send, email. or US mail options  

The disclaimer at the bottom also says because I am under age 59 1/2, this transaction is considered an early distribution and may be subject to an additional penalty of 10%.

I was under the impression that I could withdraw my initial investment whenever I'd choose as long as I don't withdraw my gains until I was 59 1/2. Did I read that wrong? How do I pull out the remaining $1000 without paying tax / losing 10%?",finance
personalfinance,First time car buyer,"First off, excuse my formatting. Will be typing this on mobile.

I am a 21 year old male, currently in the military. I’m looking to make a first time car purchase.

I will be putting down 7000$
I make 1410$ a month 
My credit score is 704
Subaru Crosstrek is in the neighborhood of 19-23K

I’ve pretty much narrowed my car choice to the Subaru Crosstrek, specifically the 2018 and up models due to the addition of Apple Car Play. The versatility coupled with the reliability has won me over.

I applied for a auto loan with my bank, (USAA) and was denied. I’m guessing due to my age of credit history being only about a year old.

Whilst applying for pre financing, I’ve been getting around 12-14% APR. Unfortunately have no one to co-sign with. I can make the car payment for a 60 month term but would obviously like to get a better rate. Starting to think my I’ll have to accept the high interest rate and refinance in a years time.

Car insurance is around 230$ a month

Just looking for input, thanks.

Edit: I appreciate everyone taking the time, to offer their rational input. I’m going to be looking at cheaper options, near the 15K price range or perhaps hold off completely. The Apple car play is a weak justifier for purchasing a car with my budget. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Long view of a refinance with cash out? (Virginia),"This is long, and I apologize. Some of this is me just trying to get my thoughts square and I'd like input from the community.

With rates at a pretty low point, I went ahead and got a quote for a refinance.

My question is this:

If over the life of the refinance, it ends up costing just a few thousand dollars (literally one payments worth) more than keeping my current loan, is a cash-out for home improvement / repair worth it?

Current loan: 526000
Current rate: 3.750
Term: 360
Left on term: 25 years 9 months (309 months)


New loan: 486000
New rate: 3.000 (was hoping for something under 2k)
New term: 360 mo
Fees: 6200

Potential cash out: ~15000-20000

Current P+I  ~ $2500.
Refinance quote: $2075 so I'd save $360/mo

Zillow says a $15k cash out would be $2138 so i'd save ~300/mo. 

Credit cards are paid off in full every month. I have a high expectation of continued employment, and expect salary to rise.

Why a cash out? I'm looking at a roof repair soon, plus several major appliance replacements (just replaced stove/oven when it shit the bed last month, did water heater 4 months ago, and I suspect dishwasher, fridge and washer/dryer will go soon, they're all from ~2003). The deck could use major work, and I'd like some work done on the kitchen and misc. other things around the house.

I know I'll pay more over the life of the loan (with those numbers, zillow shows me at -10000 savings over the life of the refinance), but 30 years down the line, with 30 years of inflation, should I even worry about the $10000? 

With the extra monthly money, I'd generally put it into savings / investments, but I'd also consider paying extra on each mortgage payment to see if I can't trim a month or two off the loan and truly come out at net 0. ballpark estimation - $100 extra per month means an extra payment in just under 2 years, so in about 9 or 10 years, I can stop paying off the loan right at the break-even point.

I guess the other side of this is: Do I forgo the cash-out, and cover these expenses with current savings and investments (which would *hurt*, but not leave me penniless), and use the increased monthly income to ""recharge""? I feel like with normal interest rates, that'd be smarter, but right now it seems good to take advantage of the rates, and keep my investments working in the market.

You know, the more I type this, the more I feel like it's a no-brainer, but i swear this isn't a humble-brag. I'm trying to figure out if there's an angle I'm missing.

(also do you think i could ask the loan officer if he can get me down to 2.9 or 2.8% these days? The ""informal"" rate quote that started this process on 7 June was for 2.75% which changes EVERYTHING.)",finance

Let's start with Robinhood.

And no, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYd5Hm7Eb0) the legendary outlaw who robbed the rich to give to the poor.

Robinhood made around $100 million from selling its customer order flow in the first quarter of this year.

This means that Robinhood is selling retail order flow to hedge funds, who can then use high frequency trading algorithms to front run the trades.

Citadel, a hedge fund which manages a cool $32 billion, paid Robinhood almost $50 million in Q1 2020 just for its order flow.

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya [described the practice as ""shady AF""](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1272194994057515011).

***So basically, Citadel takes free money via the New York Fed's overnight Repos, places huge leverage bets (which may or may not blow up - who cares anyway!), but gets to buy order flow from Robinhood to front run retail, then the US Treasury issues checks to retail, who buy stocks via Robinhood, and the circle of 'capitalism' is complete.***

This is why Ken Griffin can buy $238 million condos. Citadel know who is leveraged, they know where all the stops are and they trade against everybody. And of course the SEC is bought and paid for.

**Part 2/3 - Shoeshine Time:**

After making good money owning stocks in the roaring bull market of the 1920s, Joseph Kennedy Sr. found himself needing to get his shoes polished.

While sitting in the chair, Kennedy Sr. was shocked to have the shoeshine boy gift him with several tips on which stocks he should own.

Kennedy Sr. quickly went back to his office and started unloading his stock portfolio.

***In fact, he didn't just get out of the market - he aggressively shorted it - and got filthy rich during the epic crash that followed.***

Fast forward to today, and we have the Buy High Sell Low Kings, CNBC's Fast Money, talking about the Rise of the Day Trader. 

We have a record number of Wall Street professionals saying the S&amp;P is overvalued.

We have Jerome trying his best to keep the market propped up.

We have Hertz pumping nearly 1000% after filing for bankruptcy.

We are clearly at the death throes of the market cycle.

**Part 3/3 - Hedge Funds:**

Let me tell you the [fascinating story of Ke Xu](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-19/the-triple-jeopardy-of-ke-xu-a-chinese-hedge-fund-quant), a Chinese quant.

Xu studied maths at Cambridge, by the way one of the most competitive courses in the world, and graduated third in a class of 250.

He then worked at Goldman Sachs, got bored and in 2012 joined the relatively secretive quant hedge fund G-Research.

He spent his days writing code in G-Research's ""secure zone"", which could be entered only through a special pod with a biometric finger scanner and a weight sensor designed to detect unauthorised equipment entering or leaving the area.

Xu's first bonus at G Research, awarded only a few months after joining, shattered any illusions that he had joined the hedge fund elite.

He wrote in an online message to his girlfriend, who was working as a corporate lawyer in Hong Kong:

""Bonus only 3k, Fuck me, why? Only December, but it is still crap, crap crap, crap. It should be more.""

So Xu stepped his game up - he came up with 20 trading strategies - ""signals"" in quantspeak - and tested each in numerous simulations.

Seven proved profitable enough to adopted by fund and put to work in real markets.

So at the start of 2014, Xu was feeling confident about his second-year bonus.

""If I get 1.1 million this year, next year should be 3.3 million. Next year it will be 16 million, then 100 million.""

Instead, he was awarded a bonus of £400K and, although this was a huge amount for a young man from provincial China, it was far less than he was expecting - so he began planning his exit.

It was around this time that Xu began covertly accessing his colleagues' signals.

After all, he would have a better chance of getting a good job elsewhere if he had ready-to-use signals to offer potential employers.

He landed two offers in Asia, but told his managers at G-Research nothing about his plans. 

One evening, Xu cleared out his desk and placed a resignation letter on his manager's desk, and boarded a flight to Hong Kong. 

The abruptness of Xu's departure raised immediate suspicions.

The next morning security personnel at G-Research reviewed video footage of his activities the night before, leading the company's attorneys to get an emergency court order.

***To cut a long story short, G-Research then got the prestigious law firm Allen &amp; Overy on the case, got a travel ban against Xu, who was reported to police in London, then arrested in Hong Kong in August 2014, extradited to the UK in December 2014, then sentenced in July 2015 to four years in prison.***

But that's not all: G-Research then used an ancient quirk of the British legal system called a private prosecution to find out who's seen the 55 stolen signals.

This allows the purported victim of a crime, if they are rich of course, to prosecute the perpetrator if the state fails to do so.

Although G-Research were paying their bills, the lawyers spoke to the jury per the norms of private prosecutions, as representatives of the Crown - the British Government.

In January 2017, jurors founds Xu guilty of two of the five charged in the private prosecution, and the judge sentenced him to an additional 18 months.

&amp;#x200B;

***So the top hedge funds secure their IP like a military facility, have an informational advantage, have the world's best lawyers at their beck and call, have the Fed on their side if things go wrong, and normies think they can match this and be day traders?!***

Yes, of course people like [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbbsNsdwjLM) regularly beat the hedge funds and make a profit every day! 

The vast majority of online courses are scams. 

Don't buy them. 

***Every dollar you save and invest is a soldier working for you.***

Don't supply these scammers with ammunition to increase their ad spend and fleece more people.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

In conclusion, ***DON'T DAY TRADE!***

These hedge funds have intellectual capital and infrastructure you can only dream of.

Invest, don't gamble.

These dopamine-inducing roulette tables scramble our brains' natural rhythm,

Don't take on more risk than you can handle, and don't amble,

Hit that like button for the algorithm.

the url format is something like: [domainname.com/word/anotherword.php](https://domainname.com/word/anotherword.php)

I asked him to take a look, reloaded the page and stopped it loading halfway through. Up comes THE FULL CLIENT LIST with their name phone number showing. 

No Login. 

Apparently, if the page doesn't load all the way, it just vomits out all the client data.  


What's worse, you can search and sort within the page, all without being asked to log in.   


What's worser is that from that page you can actually access and download individual people's resumes. Some contain the last 4 digits of social, as well as information like security clearance, past job history, references (and their contact information). Some of these people work for DOD, FEMA, ICE, SEC, etc.  


Am I missing something or is this a huge data vulnerability?

I guess it's not easy to discover this URL if you don't work for the firm, but it still seems really iffy security-wise.

personalfinance,"Which debt to pay off first — Student loans, CC, Taxes","The Facts:

I owe about $1800 (guessing 16-18% interest) on my credit card, $5000 (5.8%) on my student loans, and $4000 every year in taxes (I don't owe back taxes, that's just how much my bill comes to when I file. I'm a 1099 contract worker.)

I allocate about $200 each month ($7,200 annually) to each of these expenses and have two big gigs each year which float the remainder of my tax bill.

Question:

I'm not sure splitting payments evenly amongst these three things is really the way to go? There is loan forbearance until September and otherwise, I have a SUPER low minimum payment each month on my student loans. However, this is by far the most annoying bill I have and I would love to pay it off.

I just dropped my tax payment and couldn't help but feel as if that money should have gone to my student loans instead. Then I could have used the money I was paying on my loans to pay up on my taxes from this year...but then what would I do about 2020?

My credit card has the highest interest rate, but I'm not adding any additional balance to it. It's just paying off a dental bill I had earlier this year. That said, I know that they say to prioritize the one with the largest interest, so I feel like, maybe I should pay that off and reallocate those funds?

I would love to hear if someone sees a better/faster way to get these paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for the help and perspective here! I do have $1500 in an emergency fund, and save $100 for that each month. I could pay the credit card off with that, but then I would have no buffer, which feels a little scary. All the same, I'm interested to know thoughts on that as well.

Edit 2: Thanks all! That was a very beneficial conversation for me. I  have decided to follow the overwhelming advice to pay off my credit card by September. Then transitioning that money to my other debts. I ended up making a spreadsheet and setting up some auto-save functionality that my bank provides (like the envelope system.)

Banking,How does the bank normally get added as the lien holder on a car title when buying out a lease through financing?,"I live in NY. Back in 2018 my husband’s lease was up and I needed a car so we decided to finance it through our bank. They gave us the packet to send into their offices. Get a return receipt on that. About 6 months later I throw out the return receipt. 

A little after that I get a notice from the bank that we need to list them as the lien holder on the title. I look up the title online on the Dmv website and it says title pending with the bank listed as the lien holder. I tell that to the bank. 

Fast forward to December and I’m on the phone with the bank about something else and she notices that their still not listed as lien holder and tells me don’t worry I’ll take care of it. She didn’t. 

Now we are looking to trade in that car to lease a new one. The car dealer says there is no title listed with the DMV. The car dealer said the bank was supposed to file the title when we financed with them. With coronavirus I can’t go to the dmv and the bank is only taking generic appointments. The bank is jovia financial but was called Nassau educators federal credit union back when we financed with them.

personalfinance,I've been saving 10% of my income and using leftover money to pay down debts. Should I save 20% and just pay debts based on the payment due?,"I should mention that I'm not referring to credit cards, but car loans, insurance premiums, student loans, and other bills (not quite a debt that accrues interest). 

My wife and I have been saving 10% of our income for about 3 months now and have about $1,700 now. I guess watching that savings account go up pretty quickly, at least in my experience, has felt good and I really want to save more because I feel like maybe I'm undervaluing a 3-6 month emergency fund in order to pay debts off. I have 1 month at the moment and I think we'd be able to double that by September if we doubled our savings. 10% to 20% net income and just forgo 'prepaying' debts and bills with interest.

I understand there are guidelines for what debts to pay down first based on interest rate, so I pay the highest first. (student loans in deferment but I'm still making payments). If I continue paying this wouldn't I save more money long term and I would just have to get by on my slowly growing 10% income-long term savings account? 

Also, any left over money usually goes towards recreational things for ex. we're saving for a trip to Europe/Central America, or we decide we want to go out for dinner/order in.

Any advice would be great. Even if you call me a dunce for only saving 10% or something like that :)

Edit: Debts:

- Car loan $21,263 - 4.89% interest rate - 75 month term (want to try and refi this to lower term)

- Car loan $25,866 - 3.09% interest rate - 60 month term

- Credit Card - no balance - 18% interest rate (not exactly a debt but figured I'd include)

- Student Loans - $18,362 - ~6% interest rate - in deferment, making payments every now and then.

- Mattress - ~$1,200 - 0% interest if I pay by January 2021. Balance is left is $250",finance
cybersecurity,Best practices for allowing spoofed email,"I'm curious about best practices for whitelisting incoming spoofed mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a policy of whitelisting spoofed mail ONLY via IP address. This makes sense to me because spoofing fakes domain names, so I need to verify the source IP of the sender before permitting the spoof. We use Mimecast and it's fairly easy to set up a policy which says ""if email comes from Subnet X then don't block it for spoofing our domain name"".  Is this still the best practice or are modern systems like Mimecast capable of securely whitelisting spoofing via domain? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking because I've run across SP's recently who force spoofing of their customer's domain names for email notifications but do not publish their email server IPs. Also, it would be nice to stop maintaining lists of server IPs.",technology

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to turn 27 and feel like I am at a crossroads as far as where to put my money. I make 60k/yr. Here is a breakdown of my financial situation:

401k: 8% contribution (plus Employer match up to 6%)

Employee Stock Purchase Plan, ESPP: 10% (starting contributing in April, will most likely purchase in July since it is done quarterly. However, I have to keep stock for 1 year before selling and 2 years even more tax advantage (long term capital gains). I get a 15% discount on company stock.)

""Fun"" Fund: 4% - This is for bigger purchases that randomly come about like car tires, travel, or other things that I can use instead of financing. 

House down payment account: \~$24,500 - I don't contribute much to this and it is in a low risk investment portfolio. I plan on buying in about 2 years

Roth IRA: \~$17,400 - Used to contribute to this before having a stable 401k and employer match. Don't contribute much to this anymore either. 

Emergency Fund: \~$3,600 - Would also like to work on this but not sure if debt payback or this comes first...

Auto loan: $13,400 - Monthly payment is $330/mo. Interest rate: 3.79%

Student loans: $8,942 - Monthly payment is $125/mo. however, because of COVID these are interest free and have been doing at least $200/mo. on these.  Normally the interest rate is 3.8%

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess the question is... is this a good path to continue or should I take one thing and move to the next? It's tempting to really attack the student loans since there is no interest now. I am still waiting on my stimulus check and would like to put that in my emergency fund or put toward one of the two loans. I really like the idea of the ESPP since the 15% discount is almost a guaranteed profit, but having to hold the shares for an extended amount of time isn't ideal.  I will more than likely be cutting what I contribute to the ESPP and put toward something else. I have a feeling that's what most would suggest. 

Looking forward to hearing everyone's feedback! Thanks!!!",finance
personalfinance,I think I’m getting played on my auto loan,"To start I’ll go ahead and give some background info to see if it can be applied to my situation, I’m military and this is my first auto loan that was done through a local credit union in Colorado through the dealership.

I bought an 07 tundra with a price tag of $13,738.32 with an interest rate of %21.00 over 60 payments of $374.88 (trust me I know I messed up there). 

But the real bit of confusion I have is on my contract it shows where I had a down payment of $4,000 (I’ll get back to that in a second). My total cost of the truck should be about $22,492.80 minus the $4,000 I put down, but my contract somehow shows that I now owe $26,492.80. 

Now I’m no financial expert, obviously, but it should be a final cost of $18,492.80, right?

Do I have any options to fix this or even come out on top of this? Please help.



Edit: thank you to all who help with this and explained the math to me! I have a few routes lining up right now to help reduce that interest rate to a more manageable number and I’ll get back to y’all when I get a number.

personalfinance,CD Ladder - Is it smart to take penalty to get the higher interest rate,"Hey guys.

So for the past few years, I've been taking some of my savings and investing in a CD ladder.  All of the CDs are basically 5 year high yield and if you withdraw early I think it's like a penalty of like 150 days of interest.  

When I started investing, I was getting interest rates of like 2.5% APY and as high as 3.10% APY.  Now the interest rates are like 1.0% APY.  My question is is it smart to continue to build my CD ladder now and keep buying these low interest 1.0% APY CDs, and the moment we climb back up to 2.0% APY, sell the 1.0% APY, take the interest hit and re-invest at the higher rate.  And then if we ever get back up to 3% APY, sell my 2% APYs and take the interest hit and invest in the new higher rate.  

I'm not sure how to do the math on this but it seems like sacrificing the penalty for the locked in higher APY for 5-year term would be a smart thing to do.  

Let me know if I'm missing something of you have any advice on the matter.

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance options: Investing the Difference in Payments,"I'm looking to refinance my mortgage and my lender has given me a offers for a 15, 20 and 30 year mortgage. The interest rates for all of them are low enough that the refi makes sense, but I am trying to decide what is my best option. I can afford the monthly payment for the 15 year, so I wanted to look at what would happen if I took the 20 or 30 year mortgage and invested the difference. 

My monthly payment with the 15 year would be $1525.74 and the 20 year would be $1281.04. I want to know, if I took the 20 year and added $244.70/month to an investment account, what return rate would I need to cover the increased interest paid to the bank over the life of the loan. I feel like I'm doing the math wrong because I'm getting that an 11% per year loss would cover the increased interest over the life of the loan. For the entire duration of the loan I can net much more money by putting the difference between  the shorter term monthly payments and the longer term monthly payments in a checking account.

I feel like I'm doing something wrong or thinking about this the wrong way. Am I right to compare the difference in interest paid to the bank to the saved monthly payment amount?",finance

\- \~$30 per month for Entertainment (Netflix/Amazon/etc)

\- \~$400-500 p/month for Food/Groceries/etc

Unknown is health insurance - My employer's sponsored healthcare lapses today, and so I'm now COBRA eligible (\~$800 p/month in my state) - ugh. I'll need to find other short term options.

Should I just pay the damn credit card off, or preserve cash and pay minimums (\~$30) until I'm employed again? If the interest rate was higher, I'd just pay it off, but it's low enough that I'd consider preserving cash at this moment. I can't decide, can you? Looking for opinions.",finance

As of two months ago, I got a significant increase in salary by switching jobs, now I make six figures. I'm saving twice as much now, roughly $2K monthly directly into my savings account.

I want to put the 8K on the student loans ASAP,  which means I risk losing some of the emergency rent money if an emergency happens during the next four months. I want to know if this is a bad plan, or if slashing the debt ASAP is worth the risk.

Also, I think maybe I could be saving more. Does 2K strike you as too low for someone that takes 100K home after taxes? Should I be aiming for 3K or even 4K?",finance

personalfinance,Curious about where and how to go about personal fiance at 20 years old as someone who's never really given it much thought.,"I'm a 20 yr old male, currently employed at the largest sports complex in Gerogia as a cook making $8/hr with flexible hours. Typically, I can work 5 days a week, anywhere from 6 hrs-8 hrs on a normal day, with the ability to to work upwards of 12-14 hrs, which isn't that hard because the job is relatively easy and the people I work with are high schoolers/college students (time tends to fly by). 

I've always kind of look at a money as just something you have and you basically just regulate yourself to make sure you don't run out or overspend, but as I've grown older and left that naive mentality behind completely, I feel like there's a lot of things I haven't paid attention to that would be best to understand and begin as soon as possible.

In light of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, my job had to shut down for roughly 3 months since the job entirely relies on hundreds to thousands of people being in close proximity for tournaments and games, and all schools closed terminating most sports teams. Because of the I was granted unemployment and it rapidly accumulated to almost $7000 in my account giving me access to a lot of money I no longer use widely, because my priorities and wants have shifted as I've entered college. I live with my mother still and don't pay any type of rent, but help with things like groceries, personal toiletries, my two dogs, house upkeep, and occasionally some video games to entertain myself especially during quarantine. I have a college fund from my grandparents that my mother primarily manages and basically uses to fund all of my college expenses outside of things like books, writing utensils, paper, calculators, etc.

My job has reopened and my unemployment has stopped flowing in and I realize that I'll actually be making less now that I have to go back to work. I feel I need to get a firmer grasp of my finances and a better understanding of things, like opening a savings account with interest rates and ways of protecting myself from making novice mistakes with my money, possibly increasing the methods I have of making income in the process. Not sure if this is descriptive enough, but if anyone has any answers, suggestions, or advice, maybe we can have a dialogue about some of the things I should be looking at and being aware of.

i have always been very bad with money because i never had desires to become rich. i still don't, but i have a 14-year-old son to think about.

i am 32f, born and raised in los angeles, ca. i had a baby at 18, and because i am my catholic parents' only child, they promised to help me raise him.

i have never had financial support from his dad. i work in the film industry and had some decent jobs, but because of a mental breakdown and burnout in 2015, i have been working in the industry on and off, trying to rebuild my life. i have never had a stable job, and i am building a career in post-production as an editor.

i did not finish college and i do not have plans to go back. i have rarely saved any money, but because we moved back in with my parents, i have finally gotten my expenses down to \~$500/month because i gave up my car and we live a very low-key lifestyle.

i help my parents with life &amp; home stuff and give them whatever i can for bills and food. they are encouraging me to save and pay off my debt because they have pensions, a mortgage that is almost paid off and they have always been the biggest supporters of our lives.

prior to the shutdown, i was working as a movie/tv extra. i'm not sure when things will start up again, so i am doing what i can to better myself and work on personal projects. because of various jobs i held over the 18 months prior to when i filed for unemployment (uber/lyft/instacart/etc), i have been getting $1404 every 2 weeks through unemployment, which includes the additional $600.

i am so grateful to be getting anything because now i am very close to paying off $6k in credit card debt. i am on a debt consolidation program through credit guard of america and they were able to get my interest rate down to 3%, but of course i want to pay it all off asap. i'm so happy i have no student loan debt and the car that i had financed was taken over by my cousin.

i would love advice on starting an investment portfolio, life insurance, a 529 plan for my son, and opening a high yield savings account starting at $2k, and contributing as much as i can every month. there are so many options that i am overwhelmed.

i don't want a cd because i am not sure if something will come up where i need to withdraw money. i'm not familiar with ira accounts and i've never had a 401k, so i just don't know wtf to think about regarding retirement, but honestly i am more interested in investing in stocks and crypto after establishing important accounts.

i would love to become a union editor, eventually, but i am assuming i will be working on independent projects for a long time, if not forever (the studio system is a little bit daunting to me). i expect to make a modest income of $20k/year from various jobs/contracts, and maybe more once i start editing feature films or start a small business.

lastly, i know this all seems quite irresponsible that i have never gotten my shit straight, but we did live on our own for many years and i made it work. i finally took my mental and financial healthy seriously over the last 5 years and moved back in with my parents. it has been a long journey and i have only started to take the right steps forward because of unemployment. disclosure that i am on medi-cal but we do not receive food stamps, i have 3 shares in aapl, and 4 eth tokens.

i'm doing what i can now, and i would appreciate compassionate responses because not enough teens/teen parents/young people know sh\*t about finances and they need to learn way earlier.

* Asia, Europe, and the US are [reopening their economies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-economy-shows-signs-of-pulling-out-of-its-slump-11592909854). 
* European manufacturing is [starting to ramp up](https://www.ft.com/content/ed4fcc95-c80a-4cbf-abf6-2c9dc724a27d) relative to the last few months. 
* There might be [more stimulus to come](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/23/trump-stimulus-checks-second-round/), which might further improve short-term economic prospects. 
* However, the stories above is focused on *markets*. 
* We still have significant unemployment and many people on the [brink of bankruptcy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-22/u-s-home-mortgage-delinquencies-reach-highest-level-since-2011) or [major financial stress](https://www.ft.com/content/a2f10c62-85a5-4f85-bbf2-9ceaa089a92e). 

***Where will this lead us in the coming 15 years?*** 

A common narrative around the COVID-19 economic recovery is that  it will be similar to the post-World War 2 (WW2) economic recovery.  

* After WW2, most Western countries had all-time-high debt-to-GDP ratios; ones higher than today. 
* Following WW2, government spending was cut significantly. 
* Combined with economic growth, Western governments outgrew their debt burdens. 

I *do* believe there's a way out of the debt burden and economic slump, but have my doubts on the narrative above... ***Let's break down the post-World War 2 economy to better understand what happened.*** 

* Following the war, [government spending was reduced to by 75%](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/government-spending/us-postwar-miracle), mainly due to the spend not being required for financing and running the war effort. 
* The [Baby Boom took place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-twentieth_century_baby_boom). The years 1946 to 1964 saw a birth rate that is over 3 times the rate today. 
* Consumer debt was non-existent. While statistics in Canada only go back to 1961, [consumer debt back then was $16B](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/longer-term-perspective-on-canadas-household-debt.pdf) \-- more than 10x lower than today even when accounting for inflation. The case was similar in the US. 
* The Baby Boom and associated spending, labor growth, and  consumption meant the post-war economies grew rapidly and significantly  outgrew their debt burdens. 

***These economic features won't be around after COVID-19.*** First, demographic trends are against us.  

* Today, population growth is non-existent in the West and the likelihood of a post-COVID-19 baby boom is basically zero. 
* Worse still, the number of people available *for* work will decline in the next 5-15 years as Baby Boomers retire. 
* Pension obligations will further strain finances in the West. Many municipalities and states in the US will have [trouble meeting their pension obligations](https://www.ft.com/content/d3dc1acb-527a-45e8-94a7-07fdfbb42e95). 

***As consumers, we can't spend our way out of this economic downturn*** the way we did after WW2.  

* Household debt in the US is [at about $14T](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html); approximately a 75% of GDP. 
* Personal savings rates are [very, very low](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Global%20Capital%20Markets/Will%20US%20consumer%20debt%20reduction%20cripple%20the%20recovery/MGI_Will_US_consumer_debt_reduction_cripple_the_recovery_full_report.ashx) relative to the post-WW2 years. We're down from about 5-8% of annual income to nearly 0%, and many [people in lower income tiers spend more than they earn](https://www.ft.com/content/a2f10c62-85a5-4f85-bbf2-9ceaa089a92e). 
* Economic stimulus checks might help a bit, but The Fed and politicians are becoming [concerned about how much those will cost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/23/trump-stimulus-checks-second-round/) the government, too. 
* Many consumers simply can't afford to spend at the level their  counterparts (your grandparents or parents) were able to spend after the  war. 

The post-COVID-19 economy will be very different from the post-WW2  economy. Fewer people able to spend combined with non-existent  population growth means we'll have to find other means of achieving  economic growth.  

If consumer spend and population growth won't save us, then what will? ***Productivity improvements.*** 

* Economic productivity focuses on being able to generate more output from resources (i.e., capital, labor) over time. 
* If spend can't increase and population growth will be stagnant,  we can still become more productive -- and need to do so at a faster  rate than the cost of our debts and pension obligations. 
* The best way to do this is via technology investments --  improving our ability to produce via automation, efficiently use of raw  materials and energy, and so on. 
* This also means investing in education to ensure companies and employees can innovate in the long run. 

In short, if we have a ""New Deal"" of some sort for the post-COVID-19 era, it should focus on technology and education. ***Government  spending should specifically target productivity improvements driven by  technological development and a better-educated workforce***; one that can *drive* these innovations.  

***Finally, what does this mean for investors?*** If you want long-term gains, focusing on technology, biotech, and other hard sciences will be important -- this is particularly true if governments actually focus on a research agenda like this.

In the coming weeks, I'll be exploring the sorts of stocks one might want to buy based on this. However, I'd also love to hear your thoughts!",finance

personalfinance,My husband and are throwing away all of our personal belongings because we are infested with bedbugs. We are moving and need a car and new furniture. How do we plan for this?,"Edited: Grammar, spelling. 

This is an extremely long post. I am very grateful to whoever reads this. My husband and I are suffering from severe anxiety over our situation. I need to overhaul our spending habits and learn how to manage our finances so that stability can become a permanent state for us. Prior to 2020, we have moved from place to place looking for somewhere to settle down and raise our son. I really, desparately need some outside looking in and for some collective insight that I can use to propell us out of severe poverty. 

This year has been an absolute disaster for several reasons. 

1. I have a severe disability caused by osteoarthritis and I can't work. I have had arthritis since at least my son was born but I wasn't diagnosed until this year. The last step for filing for SSDI is a mental health assessment. I can't do that because of COVID19 and over the phone is not an option. They told me in a nutshell that they'll call me back eventually. Anyways, my income is in limbo. 

2. My husband has been a subcontractor painter for 2 years. Last winter there were often periods where he went a week without work. So we had to sell the car to make ends meet. He's been traveling on foot since. Never takes a bus because we can't afford it. We've only used Uber a couple times. 

3. Because of the pandemic, my husband was without income for 2 months. We begged and pleaded family to help us survive when my food stamps wouldn't cover the last half of the month. 

4. By the time he was able to collect PUA (he waited a month to be denied for regular UI and then another month to see anything from PUA), we had already been in debt to our landlord of about 1800. We paid him some of the stimulus check but we also had to cover things we couldn't wait for PUA to buy. For example, I had no bedframe (extra firm mattress on floor) and my back was really fucked up every day. Secondly, becauss I had not yet been a recipient of SSDI, I didn't get a stimulus check; only my husband and son for a total of $1700. I would've given the landlord my whole check. 

5. My husband got his PUA back pay. And we didn't spend it the way we'd been dreaming of: moving and getting a car. We are moving because this apartment is a horrible place; cockroaches, bed bugs, mice, blood stains from gun fights in the parking lot, 2 inch of ring of mold under my kitchen sink, We struck a deal with our landlord after paying all of our rent off. So our moving expenses will be covered. We have the means to move without taking the bedbugs with us. I have cimexa I'm treating our new place and furniture with. Good for 10 years. However, my son now has no books, no stuffed animals,  and a small basket of megabloks and dinosaurs. I want to throw a birthday party that's just the 3 of us. But I'm having a really hard time with spending smart and spending with my heart. We have splurged on so much digital content between his tablet and ps4. And we don't leave the house for days. My son is glued to the screen and is a mess without it. 

I'm sorry it took so long to explain why we're so financially unstable. But I'm absolutely terrified of running out of money. We have spent so much money on bed bug treatment (our landlord is compensating us). We have to replace several belongings because of bed bugs and I'm budgeting to give my son a fun birthday. I have a list of things for him that is running almost $500 and they're things that will last years, like a bike, a dollhouse, a kitchen. The most important furniture for us to replace is: couch, bed, table and chairs. I also have to pay out of pocket medical costs (my insurance wants me to do everything in an impractical order so they will not cover anything other than pt and NSAIDs.) for rollator, a wheelchair, a TENs unit, and a corticosteroid injection. All 3 of us need to replace alot of clothes. Stains, holes, weird fits, pilings. One of us will be naked in a few months if we don't get new clothes. I am terrified of reigniting the infestation by buying used items. 

My husband is returning to work when PUA runs out. I wanted to invest and save after we move. Now everything is turning into giant looming expenses. I even wanted to afford a laptop so I can go to college. I almost got into a living stipend deal with a college but you had to have already had a bachelors and I wasn't interested in their other programs. But it helped me focus my goals in a direction of a career that will both accommodate my disability and keep me mentally invested. I also want to replace my violin and afford classes. I had to sell my violin last winter so I could my son something for Christmas. Playing violin is a vital source of mental health for me. 

My mental health is deteriorating severely. I am so lost. I don't know how to get out of this black hole. It feels like we keep going through one problem after another and it always seems to come down to the fact that we're trapped in poverty. I have never vomitted after an anxiety attack before. My shower ran cold and it startled me. I am amazed my son finds the ability to give me empathy during those times. I am ebarassed he has to watch his parents fall apart. I am thankful he has never missed a meal and always had a warm bed. 

How do I get out? How do we become stable again? I'm terrified that we'll move to our new home in the hopes of finding a good job and then something happens and we have to move again. I'm terrified of spending money on material things just to be forced to throw them away. I'm terrified of interrupting my son's life again and again and again. We have moved from placed to place to place for years and I'm exhausted. When I gave birth, the rental we had was a good deal but on his 1st birthday, he had lead poisoning. We had planned on staying there until he was old enough for preschool and save up money to buy a house. I was supposed to start college and get a career. I just don't understand. I have missed out on all the hallmarks of adulthood. I want what adults are supposed to have. I want a stable income and I want to be smart with my money.",finance
personalfinance,Truth about Conventional 97 (aka 3% down) Loans?,"Has anyone here secured a ""Conventional 97"" loan? I just got under contract for a new home. I'm a first-time home buyer. It's a highly unique property that I didn't want to let pass by. I'm fortunate to have a good income, but I spent the past two years caring for an older parent and so my savings aren't what they would have been. Ordinarily, I would have waited a few more months to have saved up a little more, but this is a highly unique mid century modern property that usually doesn't exist in my price range -- I just happened to find the MLS listing the day it got posted and got super lucky. Technically, I can afford a full 5% down + closing costs without any issue, but I'd rather keep some additional cash on hand after closing for all those auxiliary expenses associated with buying a house for a first time, not to mention just having a bit of a cash buffer. 


 

I already have a loan offer in place from Movement Mortgage -- conventional at 5% down. Today, I asked my loan officer if we can look into a lower down payment so that I could maintain more cash on hand. She told me she'd be happy to do so, but not to hold my breath because she thought my income disqualified me -- as in, my income was too high to qualify for a down payment under 5%. But, from what I'm reading there isn't an income cap on Conventional 97 loans -- it's more about your status as a first-time home buyer. 

 


So, I'm curious if anyone here has secured a Conventional 97 loan (with 3% down) and, if so, would you mind sharing the pertinent details? Loan company/bank, your income, the loan amount, your interest rate.  I have a couple of weeks to shop around, but I don't want to run a bunch of unnecessary hard pulls on my credit if there's a shortlist of providers that are more likely to be offering Conventional 97 mortgages.",finance

cardano,Debunking FUD regarding the Extended ITN,"Nearly all Extended ITN FUD can be dispelled by understanding the synergy which results from having two horses in the 3rd generation blockchain race.

Haskell code has the benefit of being safer but  is harder/slower to write, while Rust is faster to develop, at the cost of less formal verification.

With only one rigid approach these trade-offs inflict maximum damage, but with two complementary coordinated networks the safe vs fast trade-off is nerfed, allowing maximum value to be capured by the flexible sum of both methods.

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #1: ""The EITN takes focus away from the Shelley mainnet""

Fact: The EITN increases focus on the Shelley mainnet.  Hosk already took pains to make clear there are two seperate (yet coordinated) teams working on each project.

Taking some measure of R&amp;D pressure from Team Haskell and giving it to Team Rust allows more focus on building out Shelley.

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #2:  ""Creating a *Cardano Classic* makes ADA look bad""

FACT: Yes it would, and the only possible way to prevent such a viable, competitive ""Cardano Classic"" fork is for IOG and the community to back a cooperative EITN, rather than allow a hostile implementation to emerge and gain traction.

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #3:  ""Making EITN tADA real coins listed on exchanges dilutes the value of real, mainnet ADA, making a mockery of the 45 billion coin emission cap""

FACT: First, see the point already make about how a united IOG/CF/community front supporting the EITN is our best chance of avoiding an actually dilutive Cardano Classic from becoming a real threat.

Second, the model here is that of Bitcoin and Litecoin.  Litecoin as the silver to Bitcoin's gold provides tremendous value by allowing things like segwit, Lightning Network, and mimblewimble to be tested in an incentivized and sandboxed off-chain way.

tADA can already be traded OTC, so the way to look at the additional asset serendipitously discovered by the unexpectedly successful ITN experiment is as a spin-off company (EG, Expedia being spun off from Microsoft).

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #4: ""Newcomers will be confused by two networks""

FACT: Newcomers will always be confused; confusion is in their nature.  They wouldn't be newcomers if they weren't confused.

Two Cardano networks gives newcomers the additional opportunity to learn why the decision was made in the breach to preserve and build on the resounding success of the original ITN.

Having more things and nuance to learn about is ultimately to the benefit of newcomers, despite making the initial learning curve barrier to entry slighly steeper and taller.

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #5 ""The EITN will create bitterness and division""

FACT: Welcome to crypto!  Bitcoin has been running on drama, ritual combat, and tribal warfare for 10 years and is stronger than ever.  If you are too delicate for intellectual and scholastic battles, please get out of the kitchen before succumbing to heat stroke.

Some arguments are educational while others produce more friction than enlightenment.  Spreading FUD about the EITN is an example of the latter, but all conflict helps built anti-fragility so let's welcome it as an opportunity for teachable moments.

&amp;#x200B;

FUD #6 ""We have to stick to The Plan or else lose credibility""

FACT: The Plan has always been to change The Plan as facts on the ground change and empirical data are derived from actual experience.

Sticking stubbornly to a particular static Plan no matter what, by disregarding the emergent phenomenon of the ITN's greatness, would destroy the flexibility, and thus credibility, of the project.

Normally I call and can negotiate an acceptable deal via threatening to leave. Not this time, they wouldn't budge so I asked to cancel on a certain date as that would be the date I would have Frontier installed. On that date Spectrum cut off my services around 8am. Frontier effed it up so badly I canceled the install, sucked it up and called Spectrum to reinstate my service. The CS rep needed a payment upfront since technically I was a new customer even tho it was the very same day. She wanted $168.00 for the month in advance, I asked is this the total for the month and she confirmed it was so I went ahead with it. A couple weeks later Spectrum sent me a new bill, then emailed a different amount owed, so I call them to straighten everything out. Apparently because of a nit picky technicality the month's bill was actually $234 and not $168! (new/old customer but not new enough to qualify for a discount) I flipped out. Told them I never would've agreed to an increase of that much. Wouldn't budge, they wanted an extra $84. I cancelled right then and am now with Frontier's internet with Hulu. 

I don't agree with this extra $84 since the first CS rep reassured me that it would be $168. 

If I don't pay the extra $84 will this show up on my credit report? I have excellent credit (810) and would like to keep it that way but I really feel I'm in the right about this. 

TLDR: Spectrum says I still owe $84, I don't think I do and don't want to pay it. Will this affect my credit score?

Rent / Car / Groceries / Bills: \~$2000

I'm late on my credit card payments and my P2P loan automatically takes out $377 each month. I've stopped those payments for now because I was going in the red and onto overdraft fees by \~$350 each month.

Principal : $5,500
Interest: $682
Rate: 3.76%

Loan 2: 
Principal: $6,500
Interest: $665
Rate: 4.45%

Loan 3: (paid off interest and some of principal)
Principal: $7,440
Interest: $0
Rate: 5.05%

Loan 4: 
Principal: $7,500
Interest: $100
Rate: 4.53%

So, I have a decent amount of money saved already and was wondering everyone’s thoughts on my approach to paying these loans back. I love investing and feel better when my money is being invested rather than put into a loan (psychological thing for me) even though in the long run I can be saving more by paying off these loans. I already paid the interest on my highest interest loan. I have my grace period until November, so do you guys recommend paying off the interest on the rest of the loans and roll back on my savings?  Would appreciate any guidance or advice that you guys can give.

personalfinance,Best mortgage discount for moving assets over to a bank?,"Hey all. So I'm looking to purchase a home. In the process of looking at mortgages I talked to Chase, who mentioned that if I were to bring $1M in assets over they would be able to give me .625% off of the interest rate they provide.

This seems like an exceedingly good deal, but I don't know if there are others that are in the same ballpark or even more? The assets would all come from retirement accounts, and I'm just going to self-manage them, so I don't want to pay any financial advisor management fees or similar.

personalfinance,Home Buying Struggles (HCOL Area - Northern VA),"Seeking advice/criticism/comments:

Our current rent is $2,200/mo for a single family house (1,100sqft) in a very desirable, close-in neighborhood, which is a steal.  On paper, we currently save approximately $60k a year (prior to day care was closer to $75k).

We have had a terrible experience with house hunting in prior years, with every single offer being beat out in bidding wars above our set budget or by all cash offers.  It was truly discouraging and we gave up after finding this steal of a rental.  But now we're sick and tired of renting and we want to be able to make modifications to the house, properly decorate, make it our own, and we need something bigger.

I've run the numbers, and around $750k with 20% down, our PITI payment would be around $3,300-$3,500 depending on the specific location and property taxes.  Without adjusting our current spending habits, vacations, etc., we would still save around $45k annually, but to me it seems like such a huge risk to purchase something at that price point and take on that much debt.  I know people who have bought more with less in this area, but I come from a family that lived frugally, so larger purchases like this are quite shocking.  

Supply is very limited and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.  I thought prices would cool off but I underestimated the power of the Fed.  Cheaper options (\~$600k) are either in need of significant work, or are located on a main road or with a major highway in the backyard.  We ruled out townhouses for various reasons.

Anyone else in a similar situation that could offer some advice?  Are we being too cautious?  Too frivolous?  It just seems like in order to buy a house, we either need to stretch ourselves financially, or live in a house we hate.",finance

In the process of doing a cash out refinance. He is asking me to sign the electronic disclosures without going over them with me. My concern is that there are rates and numbers on these disclosures that are over the amounts that have been discussed, specifically the interest rate. 

He said that I can sign the docs and not worry about the interest rate shown because the docs also state that it’s a floating interest rate. And until I sign those docs he can not lock the rate.

personalfinance,"Received an updated refinance offer, with more accurate costs on our condo. Wondering if we should pull the trigger","Have tried shopping around at a few online places, quicken, lendingtree, better, etc.

We're in California, and refinancing my parent's condo. Currently have $109K left on the loan.

It seems for loans around $100,000 ( anything under $200K from what several agents have told me) the interest rates go up a bit from the national average rates, and you become ineligible for certain lender credits?

The offer below is so far the best offer I have seen so far, after about 2 weeks of searching.

[https://imgur.com/a/c2x7Qj2](https://imgur.com/a/c2x7Qj2)

Wondering if it's good enough to pull the trigger, or if it's probably worth continuing my search. As it is, our current rate is 5.375, so no matter what, we'll save a good chunk of money. But if there is a good chance I can find something much better, say a 2.5 rate, or no closing costs, I'd be willing to keep searching.

Wondering if anyone has seen something like that for a $110K refinance on a condo.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, does property value matter? Our original property value estimate was 400K, but the agent said the following:

""This condo would be a limited review per the approval, the processor tells me that they remove the condo fee at the end.

* The title fee, settlement fee and recording fees have been updated.
* The funds needed to set up their new impound account at the bottom is offset by the funds in the existing Chase escrow balance, which should be very close.
* If we close at the end of July, they will not make an August payment.
* The $330 HOA dues will not be made a part of their mortgage payment.
* **We did not get the appraisal waiver.  I used a value of $275,000, but I believe it was (mom's) credit score that cause it not to be granted.""**

My dad has a credit score of 800+, moms should be at least over 700, probably closer to 750... They are both on the current mortgage, but for the refinance, can't he just put only my dad? If that is the only reason the appraisal waiver was not approved...",finance

In the past, I held just a few jobs before starting grad school, and most of the money I made there, I spent. But one job allowed for a 401(K) which I thought was great and I contributed to that. That experience made me see the value of saving and so I really cut back on my spending. I was lucky enough to have a scholarship for undergrad and also one for law school, so I will only be in around 60K debt after I graduate.

personalfinance,Getting Married and Buying a House,"So my fiancé and I are getting married this September and our house closes sometime in mid/late August, it is new construction in a decent area. We are going through LGI/LoanDepot. The house is $223,000 with $8,000 (3.59%) as a down payment. It is new construction close to my work and hers. LGI is paying for inspection, closing costs and title fee.

Our income by that time will be $56,000 for me (I’m a teacher in the DFW area) and she a Special Ed paraprofessional making about $20,000 a year. Our combined income is $76,000, minimum but we both work second jobs that brings in a couple hundred each per month.

We are having our interest rate locked in within a couple of weeks. I’m hoping for 3.5% but planning for 5% as a precaution. My credit is 740+ and hers is just shy of 760. 

As for debt, she had $17,800 in student loans pre-Covid but we’ve been paying them off aggressively and have it down to $11,000 with the goal of it being $6,500 by the time we are married (and paid off by next summer fingers crossed). I have no debt except for maybe $100 spread across four cards. No kids yet, except for two dogs. I’ve calculated our combined net income at around $4500 with our second jobs bumping that to about $5,100. I have $10,000 in savings and she has $3,000

Our projected monthly expenses are this: 
-House: $2,300 (includes mortgage at 5% interest plus high utilities as a precaution, as well as an extra $100 payment per month) 
-Car Insurance: $300 
-Phone Bill: $210 
-Gas: $250-$350 (my second job is Amazon Flex so I use my own vehicle) 
-monthly Credit payments: $100
-Wedding/Engagement rings: $200 
-Retirement Fund: $315 through OneAmerica
-Food: $300
-Loans: $300, hopefully $600+ on some months to pay off faster
-Entertainment: $150
-Car Payment (her car): $300
-Savings: $300
-Other: $200 

In total this is $5,325 but as a projected worst case scenario. I can trim some things such as entertainment, food, Other and even cut down how much I move to savings from $300 to a $100. 

And once we have the rings and loans paid off we’ll have an extra $500 per month to save or place elsewhere. We are both good with our money, with eating out being our worst thing but we have started scaling back.

Am I being too financially risky? I’m expecting the first year to be living paycheck to paycheck plus side jobs but after that to be semi smooth sailing until she can get a better job (she is trying to be a teacher too but struggles with the certification content test).",finance

personalfinance,Getting a bank to give you a loan on land with your terms,"Is it possible to get a long term loan(mortgage) using land as collateral? 

In my area property values are are decreasing making the acquisition of lots of land worth looking into.  Eventually my goal would be to build a house or duplex on the land.  The terms that I'd need are 30 years with a 3% interest rate with a downpayment of no more than 20%.

I have the cash to buy the lots of land. I had wanted to invest the cash into REITs and other high dividend stocks like I have been doing. If I get the terms that I want I would be able to pay the mortgage off using the dividends from the stocks and still have some left over to reinvest back into the stock. Even if the dividends were cut or something happened I'd still be able to pay the mortgage from other sources of income. I'm not over leveraging myself.

Ultimately, I'd like to get an Equity Line of Credit Loan based on my investment portfolio and use it combined with a construction loan to develop those properties. I'd need to just wait till the Covid-19 situation stabilizes. Acquiring the land now that prices are depressed will really help in the future development of the property. The appreciation in the land value will make a bank more likely to lend me the money for a construction loan. The debt to value ratio will be favorable and thus more likely to get the loan.

My hope is to make money from the appreciation of the stock and reinvesting the dividends; from the appreciation of the land;  and from the development of land. I'm thinking about how derivatives work and trying to use a similar strategy but with less risk. This way I can use the same money to take advantage of chaos in the financial markets as well as the real estate markets. Since I have family backing and income from other sources and the fact I'd be doing this on a small scale I'm willing to take the risk.

I don't plan on doing anything like PSLF or any other program that would cancel loans. I guess the only thing I can think of is if the government decides to do widespread loan forgiveness I would be more likely to have federal loans cancelled. Thanks!",finance

I'm thinking I should pay off Loan C first because it's the highest interest rate? Or possibly Loan E because it's a larger amount? 

I currently live with my parents rent-free (and will until this loan is paid off) - only outside expenses I pay for are gas (I drive approx 400 miles a week, about one tank of gas per week) and misc stuff. No other bills/credit cards/etc.

I'm a first-generation college student just trying to figure my life out. I understand because of COVID our student loans are now in ""forbearance"" (idk if that's grammatically correct, sorry) through the end of September, but should I start making paying now so I don't pay more overall later on? My main objective is to pay these off as soon as possible and overall pay the least amount aka accrue the least amount of interest. Any advice would be DEEPLY appreciated :-)",finance

Or hearing that there will be extra economic stimulus, or that nobody will let the economy crash before the election.

Or all sorts of other things like this.  I just don't understand why so many things are tied to this.  Why does it matter if these things are done before or after the election?

The only theory that makes sense is that Donald Trump is specifically throwing everything he has at these things in hopes he won't look bad and get re-elected.  But even if that is the case, wouldn't it be blatantly obvious he is just building a house of cards that would fall apart.  Basically cooking the books, or doing that thing companies do where they rob from future success for the sake of making their current quarterly figure look good.  Unless his plan is to just keep things together hoping not to get re-elected so it all falls apart in the next persons hands.

personalfinance,Can we afford this as a first house?,"Me and SO make 115k combined. (My income is guaranteed to go up 8k next April as part of our contract - state employee) We have over 60k in savings. SO has 20k in debt, with a $591 month bill. Our net take home is approximately $5800. Guaranteed Bill's (insurance, gas etc) per month is approximately $550, plus the $591 loan payment - not including food. Credit scores are approx 740 and 780.

We know of the 3x rule, living in a HCOL east coast state we havent found a house we even LIKE after looking for a year(my brother does commercial construction and has offered to rehab a home for us at a low cost - but between us and him we havent found anything)

Long story short our realtor sent us a ""cookie cutter"" in a new development that runs $360k at base. Property taxes for the place would run around 10k/year. We toured a completed and lived in, same model house and have been told expect fuel costs around $600/year. Unsure of electricity but guessing 110/mo. We will skip on a few things (ex finished basement) but add on one or two upgrades so, it's safe to say a all in price of around 360k.

Estimated PMI and home owners insurance at $325/mo. Estimated closing costs of around 20k. We will out %5 down (required as a deposit). Estimated time to complete is 7 to 8 months depending on Corona.

We havent put an offer in yet but were looking for some houghts on affording this place. One benefit I see is we have another 7 to 8 months to save money because we cant close until its built. Flip side to that is not knowing the interest rate in 8 months.

Side note: I have an inheritance (approx. 5k) and back pay (approx 10k plus and counting) coming my way. The former should be arriving in a month or two, and the latter by end of year. Both of us are overtime eligible employees and I make anywhere from 5 to 15k gross in overtime per year (not included in figures above).

thoughts? I'm not sure the max we were approved for because we already knew the 3x rule and said run the numbers for 350k and 375k incase we found a house we loved that cost a little more. We feel comfortable with the purchase and putting the numbers on a spread sheet, not including the 15k additional money coming in.

# The War On Gold Has Begun

The war on gold has already started. And yet nobody, no media, no government, nor the companies are actually talking about it. 

To understand the blueprint of what is going on geopolitically and the coming war on gold, all you have to do is focus on the **US Dollar SWAP lines****.** 

What happens next could be the difference between you making the **biggest gains** you’ve ever seen in your life…

Or watching your **gold investments go to zero** during this unprecedented time in the world.

I urge you **not to buy another gold stock** until you understand what’s really going on behind the scenes… and how you can profit from it. 

Here is a list of countries where U.S. Federal Reserve SWAP Lines exist (think of them as Lifelines by the Fed): 

1. Bank of Canada 
2. Bank of England 
3. European Central Bank 
4. Bank of Japan 
5. Swiss National Bank 
6. Reserve Bank of Australia 
7. Banco Central do Brasil 
8. Danmarks Nationalbank (Denmark) 
9. Bank of Korea 
10. Banco de Mexico 
11. Reserve Bank of New Zealand 
12. Norges Bank (Norway) 
13. Monetary Authority of Singapore 
14. Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden) 
15. Bank Indonesia

I spent the last three years living in a less than ideal 9m2 room in a flat share among other sacrifices but I somehow feel it all amounts to nothing. While €1200 seems like a lot to me considering its about half of my net income and could make a big impact on my quality of life, living in a city where a viable flat under 600.000 looks more and more like a dream every day makes that figure feel insignificant.

The idea of financing it isn't much better as it would end up redirecting over half of the amount of what I save into a thing I don't necessarily need and that will rapidly depreciate.

Even if I did have all the money I need for the downpayment a 30 year mortgage at a 2% interest rate would result in 2000 euros of monthly payments which I couldn't afford even if I completely forgo savings.

&gt;Trump administration officials have talked about inserting the federal government deep into the private sector to stiffen global competition against Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co

&gt;Policy makers have also discussed shoring up Ericsson and Nokia with tax breaks and export-bank financing, or supporting a private-equity group that would take one of the European equipment makers private. Other proposals would support “open” network technology that would make it easier for U.S. startups to develop new technology for 5G equipment.


&gt;That has channeled almost all U.S. wireless business to Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung. Still, many wireless executives are concerned about the long-term health of Nokia and Ericsson, which have spent years trying to restructure their operations. Nokia halted its dividend last year and in March said its CEO is stepping down. Ericsson has returned to profitability after years of restructuring

Credit Union B is offering a 4.1% fixed rate home equity loan, no cash out, and they want statements from all our debts we want to pay off and they pay off the debts directly.  No appraisal fee.  They do a walk-through of the property (someone from the CU is what I gather) but no formal appraisal.  There would be no extra to draw on for wedding expenses.  They also said if we want to do a cash out 1st mortgage instead, the rate would be 2.75%, but it's a different department of the CU and we'd have to start the application process over again.

I feel like I am comparing apples to oranges and not sure which to choose.  Are interest rates going to skyrocket in the wake of COVID-19?  Is a home equity loan a safer option than a HELOC?

I've spent my entire young adult life (25) digging myself into an impossibly deep hole of debt. This has had serious effects on my mental health as I suppress it more and more. I had to withdraw from university after a car accident forced me to miss my exams and several weeks of class - after which all of my student loans defaulted, and are presumably now accruing interest. Combine this with the hospital bills from my surgery/stay, I estimate my debt to be around the realm of $100,000. I don't have an issue with irresponsible spending or credit card bills, I just owe an insane amount of money to these student loan companies and the hospital.

I literally have not once checked up on my debt. Like I said, I just supressed and stuffed it down as far as I could. Thinking about it is enough to make me nauseous.

To wrap up here, I'm now focusing much more on my mental and physical health, and I figured now is as a good a time as any to stem the bleeding.

I'm here to ask if there might be any specific tools useful for people in my situation. I've perused the wiki, but I'm a little intimidated by all the information there, and was looking for a few specific things I wasn't seeing.

What I could use help with:

1.) Some kind of income vs. debt tracking spreadsheet to calculate a running net-worth. I work full-time as a bartender at 3 different places, so my income varies pretty dramatically from week to week. I'm looking for something that would allow me to plug in what I make on a daily/weekly/bi-weekly basis to keep a running total. I'd also really like a place to plug in my debt. The goal here is to have some kind of line graph that will show my slow but eventual upward climb - the negative y-axis being my starting point. I would prefer this to go day If anyone has a good template for something along these lines, I'd love to see it. I'm not the biggest excel whiz, so I don't know if I could make this myself. I know this will just be savagely depressing to look it for a very long time, but seeing some kind of visual progress over the years might motivate me to think that this situation isn't entirely inescapable.

2.) A solid, easy to use budgeting app for a not-so financially literate young adult. There are soooo many to choose from. What do you use personally and why?

3.) Optional, but if anyone has any resources or knows of any loan forgiveness programs or any other ways to minimize the damage done here - I'm a Louisiana resident and most of my debt is to the Stafford Loan, and the Direct Parent+ Loans. There are several other smaller loans I took out, some through the university, some through other sources. Which leads me to my last question:

4.) How in the hell would I even get started compiling my debt and assessing the damage? For school - every semester when I was tackling my fee bill, I would just pick the first good sounding loans I saw. If I ever got some web portal login or anything in the mail, I have no idea where that went or how to access it. For my medical debt - I just got a series of bills in the mail from the hospital over several weeks. Opened one or two and saw how expensive everything was going to be and just gave up on opening anymore. I've since moved and no longer have physical copies of these bills.

Other than that, I got a letter in the mail from my bank about a month ago. They did a random credit check for me, and it was sitting in the 200's. I know this is something I need to tackle soon, but I'd rather get all my ducks in a row with the big debts before I start working on repairing my credit.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. Any help, advice, or a gentle reminder that my life isn't over at 25 are greatly appreciated.",finance

solarenergy,Feedback on Solar System for my home,"Hello,

Apologies in advance if this is too long, etc. Since I'm asking for help I wanted to do my best to take the time to provide all the details I have along with my understanding and thought process. As this is my first venture into a solar install I thought I’d reach out for feedback around those who know more than me on this topic. I’m including any information in advance, along with notes surrounding my thought process. Thanks so much in advance for feedback.

I received 3 quotes from different vendors listed below – vendors are Sun Badger, GenRenue, and Sunrun (Costco Affiliate).

**Basics**

· I have a single family home near wicker park in Chicago, IL

· My usage over last 12 months 10,620 kWh (see graph) and cost $1482 ($1283 energy costs, 198.84 customer charges)

· Electric cost is 10.688 kWh after taxes, I am on a fixed rate plan (see bill)

· All quotes are for a purchase, not a lease

· System output is 6.555KW creating an estimated 85% offset

· Net metering is available in Chicago via utility ComEd - I believe I'm only on the hook for customer charges that appear to $15.81 (198.84 annually) aside from usage.

**Economics**

Below is a rough spreadsheet of what I spent annually on electric, estimated customer charges that will remain, cost of electricity, cost of financing with Sun Badger, etc. From what I can tell, assuming no change in cost to electricity, there is an insignificant monthly savings in cashflow with Solar for electricity. The primary motivation for solar is the financial aspect after the system is paid off, as it's warranted for 25 years.

The first 18 months I will pay about $65 extra on the loan until the credits come in, at 18 months the loan re-amortizes but interest rate remains the same at 2.99. Financing offers from the other vendors re-amortized after 18 months.

**Vendor Quotes**

The vendor I'm most strongly considering is Sun Badger / Sunbadger - Credit. The system does have a higher cost, but the low APR and the higher tax credit make it worthwhile.

https://preview.redd.it/rnb7wxdwj4751.jpg?width=936&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1a805de79cf1e86e35336f17379637fbd7cf413

**Vendor Notes**

· Sun Badger and Sunrun are using the same equipment and invertors - LG3450N1C-V5 panels and Enphase Energy IQ7PLUS-72-2-US invertors.

· Sun Badger refuses to do solar panels on the north side of the house. Other vendors had it in their original plan pushing the system north of 20 panels. Sun Badger stated lack ROI for the customer to do panels on the north side of the roof. To normalize bids I got quotes for 19 panels…except Sunrun who never got back to me.

· Sunrun takes the SRECs and offers a discounted price outright

· I was not impressed with Sunrun – the sales agent did not return emails with questions, etc. and lacked familiarity with the local market. To a lesser extent, Genrenew did not follow up with formalized documentation like I would expect, leaving Sun Badger

· Sun Badger estimates 9,079 kWh annually (about an 85% offset) using panels only on the south side of my roof (see graphic below from google showing solar intensity)

· To their credit, Sun Badger does seem to have their ducks in a row. The sales engineer is timely on getting back to me, not pushy, and appears knowledgeable. They also checkout on solar reviews and the bbb for what that’s worth

· System is warranted for 25 years through LG. Sun Badger warrants roof work for 10 years.

**Open Questions**

· Should there be other values I should be considering?

· Are SRECs paid based purely on system size (regardless of output) – trying to understand the risks of underperformance aside from the obvious increase of need to pull power off the grid. Could I end up owning money for SRECs if the system underperforms?

· Is the initial SREC credit value simply calculated 1.2 x system output \*15 years as I’ve been reading? There seems to be some variance in the amount of credit I will get for SRECs, yet the calculation seems very vanilla – 1.2 x 6.555 (system size) \* 70.05 (srec value) x 15 years = 8265. Broker fee of 10% nets 7438.

· Are there better online tools aside form google and my utility (comed) to better estimate electrical output/efficiency given average/typical weather trends?

· Sun Badger suggested SRECs in Illinois could take 8 months to receive – does anyone in Illinois have feedback around how long it will take to receive SREC credits?

· Are LG panels the way to go? I’ve been reading Sunpower is not doing well and may not be around to see the end of my 25 year warranty.

· Will there be any obligations to the buyer of my home should I sell in the future given I am receiving 15 years of SRECs upfront? Note I do not anticipate moving anytime soon.

· Do I need to take out homeowners’ insurance on the system – any idea what that would cost? I’d need to include that in my ROI. I’m with State Farm.

· Does anyone with solar in Illinois w/ComEd have feedback around Comed charges that remain if you are at 100% production vs usage?

stocks,Fed puts restrictions on bank dividends after test finds some banks could be stressed in pandemic,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/fed-puts-restrictions-on-bank-dividends-after-test-finds-some-banks-could-be-stressed-in-pandemic.html

The Federal Reserve put new restrictions on the U.S. banking industry Thursday after its annual stress test found that several banks could get uncomfortably close to minimum capital levels in scenarios tied to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Fed said in a release that big banks will be required to suspend share buybacks and cap dividend payments at their current level for the third quarter of this year.  The regulator also said that it would only allow dividends to be paid based on a formula tied to a bank’s recent earnings.

Furthermore, the industry will be subject to ongoing scrutiny: For the first time in the decade-long history of the stress test, banks will have to resubmit their payout plans again later this year.

Under the harsher scenarios, banks could rack up as much as $700 billion in loan losses as unemployment hits 19.5%, a development that would push some banks close to their regulatory minimums for capital.",finance

I work for a company for college campuses in my area (Mid-Atlantic US). I'm concerned that if these schools are still shut down in August/ September (I have heard rumors), then I won't have a solid income, especially if this crisis is gonna stretch through the winter.

* Unemployment has been paying me since March, but with the end of  the extra federal money per week at the end of July, I'll be just on the state unemployment. I have close to 3 months of rent/ food/ car bills saved, and I might have enough to last til the end of the year with the last month of federal money. 

* I've made the last payments in March for my school loans, paying the minimum (I usually do more) since I wasn't sure if I'd be getting unemployment OR the stimulus. I have gotten both, and have paid them each Loan the minimum once more, even after CARES froze payments for my Fed Loan and I got a Forbearance for my private Loans (lasted 60 days which are almost over).  ** My options seem to be **

* 1) Start paying back the payments for my student loans starting next week, the forbearance being over, digging into my savings and just hoping that I'll be at work again in the fall. If things don't reopen, I'll have to look for another job.  I love my job, but I hate having no control over if we will get to go back again. Or...

* 2) Save money, blow off  all my loans until I get a solid answer about if I'll still be working in September. If I have to live off of what I'm saving from Federal Unemployment until 2021, I would have to keep deferring payments on my Student Loans (not helping my credit) but it beats getting evicted.

These are the terms given to me by my current lender:

Loan amount: $138,000

Interest rate: 2.75% (APR: 3.017%)

Here is the closing cost ($8,252) breakdown:

$1,900: Origination charges ($1,401 from 1 point, $500 from underwriting fees)

$1,101: Credit report, flood certification, survey fee, tax service, VA fee

$375: Land survey

$120: Pest inspection

$98: Title - endorsements

$730: Title - Lender's title insurance

$150: Title - notary fees

$400: Title - settlement fee

$200: Title - title examination

I have a credit score of 800+ and I'd be saving around $220 per month.

I'd heard that one of the benefits of refinancing through your current lender was that they'd waive certain(?) fees.

Do these numbers look valid to you? I was thinking of trying to get them to eliminate the origination charges.

personalfinance,What are the ins and outs of refinancing a mortgage and is it worth it?,"Here's the deal. I just bought my first home last fall. But at the time I needed my mom to cosign with me because my income alone did not qualify me for a house in the price range of a decent home in my city. My mom chipped in for some of the down payment as well. I have been able to make all the mortgage payments so far, even through the pandemic but thats mostly because I do live with my fiancé and we split some of the expenses.

I have not planned on refinancing until I could afford to do so with only my name on the house (or my fiancé too) instead of including my mom. I don't want her to ever be on the hook for anything of mine god forbid something happen to me. 

My mortgage lender just reached out to me asking if I would be interested in refinancing with all the dropped interest rates from Covid. I am sure I could ask her what it would entail and she would tell me but I would like to get a variety of opinions if possible on how this process would go. 

My income has changed a little bit for the worse since closing the house considering I was out of work for a little bit. I have worked 2 jobs for 3 years. And I am just about to go back to my second job finally albeit with far less hours than I am used to having, after a 2 month absence. 

I certainly don't think I am financially in a place to refinance especially cause I am not done paying off my needed appliances (no interest credit cards) and not planning on having that done for another 5 months. 
Is refinancing pretty much the same as the initial mortgage process? Cause while getting a lower interest rate would be amazing I can't ask my mom to help with all that signing again especially when she doesn't live in the same city and has other obligations at the moment. 

Some of this information might be unnecessary but I just wanted to be thorough and ultimately I just need to know what refinancing would entail and if I could do it on my own this time, would it be worth it? 

Thanks for any help!

economy,"I attempt to explain U.S. economics, policy and politics in the simplest possible way","Hi /r/economy, after spending some time studying the way the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar works, I'd like to attempt to explain it in the easiest possible way. This might take awhile to read but it's meant to be easy to understand. Let me know if you like this analysis or how it can be improved. It's meant to be unbiased. Let me know if you have any questions!

&amp;#x200B;

I think the best place to start is understanding the U.S. debt, which is needed when the country is spending more than it is collecting in taxes. The government needs to borrow money, so it works with both U.S. treasury and the Federal Reserve for that with two main sources of funding, selling treasury bonds and selling bonds to the government with interest.

So a person, or a foreign government can fund the U.S. government, since the U.S. dollar is a ""reserve currency"" and has innate value to it (treasury bonds return are inherent wealth), or the Federal reserve can simply print more money in exchange of bonds and give it to the U.S. government and the government promises to pay the Federal reserve back with interest.

When a person buys treasury bonds, the U.S. treasury ""promises"" to give the money back with interest on the maturity date, and the way the u.s. treasury funds the original investment + profit (e.g. you invested $100 in treasury, and treasury paid you $102, so $100 +$2) is through U.S. taxpayers which is named in the budget ""interest on the debt"". This is the main source of revenue of government. The interest on the debt is paid by U.S. tax payers, and this money is then used to pay the treasury bond holders who need to be paid. in case the U.S. does not receive enough taxes to cover the interest of all bond holders, it can always print more currency to pay the treasury bond holders. The fed can be paid later, but treasury bond holders must be paid at the maturity date of the bond.

The U.S. dollar is kept as a ""reserve currency"", although fiat, simply because the U.S. hold many favorable positions that makes it inherently valuable, such as being the only currency that can be used to purchase oil, being an inherent foreign exchange currency (since if country x wants to trade with country y, they use the dollar as a ""buffer"" to exchange each others currencies and be able to trade), being able to invest in the U.S. stock market as these accept dollars to raise equity, and use it in real estate investments, since U.S. government accepts dollars as tax payments.

The U.S. ability of printing money is what makes the U.S. default rate 0 (you are guaranteed to receive a return on investment, and this return is guaranteed to have value and be used to exchange goods and services), which adds to the value of the currency, and what enables it to be the superpower it has been for a long time. The default rate being 0 means this system is not going away at any time and governments throughout the world can comfortably invest in U.S. treasury bonds knowing they will be paid back eventually. The chance of default being 0 with guaranteed returns is yet another point that makes it a reserve currency that can be used for FX, purchasing oil and much more.

Many countries have their debt based in U.S. dollars, and have a big part of their investment portfolio as treasury bonds because of the safety in returns. All in all, this system is not really going away.

Which is why the U.S. has so much leverage over countries. If it ever sanctions a certain country, it not only blocks that country from ever doing business with the U.S., but also the rest of the world, as for example, no one uses South Korea Won in Brazil, and no one uses Brazilian Real in South korea, so they need some kind of exchange and the main currency of choice is going to be the USD which is accepted nearly everywhere. A U.S. sanction could block a country from doing business with nearly every country in the world.

However, although this system gives the government immense borrowing power as the whole owner of the most sought after currency on Earth, it is not unlimited. If the amount of debt increases, the interest on the debt will also increase, thus squeezing the U.S. budget. Everything in the U.S. budget is negotiable and can be cut to pay the interest. The interest rate is negotiable, however the interest itself is not (e.g. we can choose not to fund healthcare, but not funding the interest is not a choice).

Lastly, it's important to know we are no longer paying for the spending of what is happening now. We can actually consider all the borrowing done currently (including, say CARES act), and just like the government sees itself unable to support Millennial's college bills, or the citizen's health care due to rampant military spending in the 90s, future generations will pay for the borrowing and spending being done today. On this note, Millennial's who fight for ""debt forgiveness"", are again, unaware the economy we live is known as an ""IOU"" economy, which means someone needs to owe someone, something, and assets need to be equal to liabilities plus equity. Their loan simply cannot ""go away"" or be ""written off"" and cannot be removed from the ""assets"" part of the balance sheet. This means the U.S. government must foot the bill for them, which means, of course, the children of children's of the citizens must pay for this, which will culminate in the then government cutting expenses in education, and other areas in order to pay the then-very-high interest on the debt. Pay your loans today, and future generations look at the current generation as privileged for having $6000/yr FAFSA grants. Baby boomers had no idea things could be as bad as it is today, and people today have no idea how bad things can be for the future generation. Of course, this is only a problem to those who seek to remain in the U.S., not really a problem for dual nationals/multinationals or people who can relocate, but more on this below.

Based on this I make an analysis of current economic issues with the U.S. economy and what the current administration has tried to do to fix it.

Prior administrations would try to raise corporate taxes to increase revenue and balance the budget so we don't need to borrow as much from the Fed/Treasury. However, because the U.S. has lost a lot of leverage, not many corporations remain physically within the United States, and they can always relocate offshores where they no longer need to pay taxes to the U.S. government, and can still operate here at low costs, as less employees are hired locally and less payroll tax, and other types of taxes are avoided.

Back in the 1960s, the world was divided (business-wise) into either United States (capitalism), or rebuilding from World War 2 (Europe and other countries), Third World Countries with 0 infrastructure to conduct business, and Socialist nations. Which is why back in the 1960s the U.S. could charge high amount of taxes and regulations to companies, and could fund its own government very well. It had leverage over business owners. If they wanted to make money, they had to be here.

This leverage has deteriorated vastly once China opened its markets, and the rest of the world built infrastructure to compete with U.S. capitalistic hegemony. Business owners now had options, and the U.S. government had to decrease taxes in order to remain competitive.

Because of U.S. policies to expand capitalism (mainly, the free access to its markets guaranteeing anyone profits if they want to sell things to U.S. by adopting capitalism, the protection of trade routes, and protection), the U.S. had no choice but to see its leverage wane while other countries rapidly gained creating their own unique selling points to compete with other countries for investment.

The U.S., with the fall of the USSR, did not change its foreign policy of expanding capitalism, focusing its efforts on Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran and some other countries currently in the sanction list. The results of the resulting foreign policy ended up with a huge increase in U.S. debt for campaigns of expanding capitalism further and securing energy only to find itself in a huge money sink that was mostly wasted after it went through the ""Shale revolution"" and became a net oil exporter in 2019.

The ever decrease of businesses being in the U.S. together with decreased government ability to sustain its budget due to its military campaigns gave rise to many dissidents, some clueless (ala occupy wallstreets, and delusional socialist supporters who are simply children too gatekeeped to ever understand what is happening), to what is today known as Trump supporters.

Trump's platform is essentially a nuclear option the U.S. government always had, but never used because it was never intended to be used. The U.S. owns the capitalistic system as explained above, and holds huge leverage against all countries partaking it. However, during the cold war, countries partook it with the promise the system would work on their behalf. If it was blatantly obvious the system was mainly meant to work for the U.S. and not for others not many countries  would have aligned with the U.S. against socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

However, because the USSR was dissolved, the U.S. citizens became more and more concerned with domestic policy, culminating in Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy, that seek to use the leverages built to benefit U.S. citizens. Since U.S. is the greatest consumption power in the world (which essentially rebuilt Europe and is the main force behind China's growth), the U.S. has an enormous amount of leverage in the expansion of a country's economy.

Trump's strategy is then focused on using this leverage to eliminate the advantage of being overseas, and increase leverage of the United States. By taxing foreign products, this eliminates the advantage of being outside of the U.S. and rewards companies for making their products within the U.S. The deficit is sustained by our borrowing power, but would then pay off by having a multitude of companies coming to the U.S. and hiring U.S. citizens.

By renegotiating trade deals, in a way that U.S. would have free access to markets (say, Europe), this would mean a company hiring US citizens has a higher chance of being successful by having greater, duty-free market share while having access to U.S. consumption power at lower rates. As a result, investment power would be rerouted from overseas back to the U.S., where more companies pay taxes without reasons to leave. (A strategy of 100 companies paying 10% tax while holding leverage vs. 10 companies paying 35% with dwindling leverage, and more companies leaving).

The increase in leverage is furthered by reducing immigration. Talking strictly on a supply and demand basis, because more companies would move to the U.S. (due to being cheaper being here), more citizens would be needed to fulfill these positions resulting in a rise in wages, and the so-prized $15hr minimum wage being an easily achievable reality. Taxes, regulation, and immigration are all cut until U.S. government (and as a result, citizen) has leverage back to its hands. Taxes can be raised, regulations can be put in place, and immigration can increase to the extent it benefits the citizens of its nation according to the current leverage it has.

Thus, the current administration's idea of ""Great Again"" is to return America to its 1960s state, where it had economic leverage over the whole world, and all of the world's finances, trade, manufacturing and everything to do with wealth and money would culminate and converge in the United States, making its citizens very rich, and enabling them to enjoy a golden age.

Trump's strategy has a success rate of nearly 100% (which is unsurprising), which explained his pre-coronavirus jobs report and economic record. This, of course, does not hold well for other powers that now has to compete with an ""awakened"" United States. Thus the whole world is against the current administration, in favor of old school politics (currently represented by Joe Biden and the current democratic party) that seeks the further expansion of capitalism, destabilizing countries and never-ending borrowing money from the grand-grand-grand-children of U.S. citizens. In a way, for example, ISIS was an inherent U.S. asset of this ""old school politics"" (willing or unwilling) because it was a tool to further destabilize Syria, aiding in the eventual dethronement of Bashar Al-Assad. Trump's efforts in fully eliminating ISIS, showed that it's existence was a choice of previous administrations as they used and possibly armed them (""unknowingly"") in order to take down Assad. Assad's victory in 2019 was perhaps the greatest slap in the face to all politicians who took place in the strategy regarding Syria's civil war, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Ending U.S. involvement in Syria by destroying ISIS is a Trump America First platform, while destabilizing Syria, through ISIS, ending Assad's regime, implanting a democratic system, together with U.S. friendly central banks that can used to take loans and further increase the value of the USD resulting in Syria having a McDonalds in every corner is a policy of ""oold school politics"" represented by Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and some players in the Republican party, mainly the Bush family, and more notoriously and now-deceased, John McCain.

Overall Trump shows the power U.S. republican supporters, aided by the popularity of the second amendment, has on the U.S. and U.S. foreign policy. He showed the extent of influence a president can have in swinging the country's leverages (e.g. consumption power) to its advantages, and because he keeps using these leverages, however, he threatens many alliances built in the previous century. No ally likes being leveraged against, and Europe is correct in being angry at the United States for getting itself in non-profitable, reckless wars, and now using the system it created to help pay its bills, imposing on European countries. However, the U.S. truly has no choice if it seeks to better support its citizens in a way that is self-sustainable and long-lasting.

The current Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump is a fight against people who have short term interests in the U.S. (e.g. dual nationals, and foreign actors) willing to make the U.S. continue to expand capitalism in currently sanctioned countries, while borrowing money from its own citizens' grand-grand-grand children to support current citizens (which as we've learned, is not sustainable, as cuts have to be made to pay interest on the debt), vs Citizens who have a long term interest in living in the U.S., as these citizens turn out to be overwhelmingly white, its opponents spin the narrative as nativist, nationalist, or racist, when its inherently about survival on a long term. As the U.S. cannot continue borrowing money forever while losing its industries to foreign nations. Which is why said foreign nations has a huge stake in intervening in U.S. elections, and why there's such a huge interest in dethrone Trump. No country wants to lose its investments and see the money return to the United States.

The way to fight Trump's movements, is to, then, convince citizens the movement is racially motivated, and making it about culture, when Trump's platform is inherently economic. As Trump's opponents desperately try to grab power once again to go back to how things used to be. And all countries in the world can be relieved as Joe from Idaho working at AT&amp;T call center will eventually see its job moved to India. Along with his payroll taxes, and other money that will no longer be used to fund the US government and will now fund India's.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, it's interesting to see the current George Floyd's protests as nothing but ""theater"". These protesters are keen to destroy everything but stay far, far away from the U.S.'s main sources of power and stability --- The IRS and the federal reserve. It's all very useless and in the end only hurts average people. People who waste away their lives with socialism (who don't understand what default rate being zero actually means) make a fool of themselves protesting against wall street, making of these players the boogeyman together with Elizabeth Warren, only to show themselves as the gatekeeped fools they really are. ""Hating the player, not the game"" is futile, as these left-wing supporters are seemed completed ""curbed"" and kept under control and completely ineffective in accomplishing their own goals. Which is why corporations pander to them since they are inherently harmless (due to being clueless and gatekeeped) and making George Floyd's protests seem like children playing in the park, hence why the governors and mayors observing said protests never took them seriously. Again, only harming small, common people, yet never truly accomplishing their goals of improving life for anyone. Not even blacks. Where the alternative, which is returning the country to when money would converge within its borders, would grant all blacks (and immigrants who seek to remain in the U.S.) the golden age white caucasians had gone through in the 60s, thus granting blacks the same ""privilege"" whites had. Instead, America fights against its own long-term best interests, and against the interests of all communities that seeks to remain here on a long term, including African-Americans.

This, of course, is antagonistic to the current republican party, who is very effective in achieving its economic goals, making itself a threat of corporations who seek higher profits (they can relocate to the U.S., but the old style politics benefit them more, and higher taxes make no difference since they're now mostly overseas), a threat to countries who seek to destroy Iran, Syria and other remnants of the old world order, a threat to all countries who seek to protect its investment revenue from leaving the country, a threat to countries who seek to protect its own manufacturing against American competition (e.g. Europe and Canada), and a threat to people who seek to immigrate to the U.S. for the higher salaries and first hand access to U.S. dollar in order to better invest in their own home countries.

  
Essentially, the Trump movement puts itself as antagonists against anyone who is not willing to live in America for the rest of their lives, invest here, or seek to leverage internationalism and a global economy to higher profits (of course, only individuals with high amounts of investing power could ever take advantage of this). Highlighting the importance of the second amendment, and the strength of Trump supporters in being able to shift the whole world to their own self-benefit, all while maintaining the trigger on the government that holds leverage against the rest of the world (civil unrest backed by militias = instability = possible u.s. default = world economy gets nuked) which is why it's very difficult to deal with them politically, and also why there's an increase interest in disarming the U.S. population to increase stability of the world economy.",finance

Before even reviewing loan estimate, he asked me for CC to get appraisal done. So if i'm going to go with his estimate, I need to know there isn't a chance for bait and switch.

personalfinance,Credit impact of settling old debt,"The current situation: I have an oooooold student loan with Navient that is in default. I honestly believe they made a mistake and ""duplicated"" a loan but whenever I dispute it they send a promissorry note that has the correct account number and my signature on it. At this point, not worth fighting so I'm not interested in disputing it further.

I also have current loans I pay on with Navient, so whenever I log in I see the two I am paying on, and then this defaulted one for $3k or so that I just ignore and don't pay on. It's annoying and I want to make it go away. These are all private loans, not federal.

This loan first defaulted 10 years ago, so it is no longer reported on my credit reports (I know, I've looked, it fell off right at 7 years like it was supposed to). 

I figure I have three options at this point:

1. Leave it there forever. It doesn't seem to have any impact on my life or my credit score at this point, so this doesn't seem terrible. Though like I said it's a pain to look at it every time I login to pay the other ones.
2. Pay off the current balance. I could do that. I could do it today. But it rubs me the wrong way since I don't think I owe it. Also, will this now refresh on my credit report and show that it was defaulted for another 7 years?
3. Settle. I guess I'd have to wait for some desperate debt collection company to reach out to me on this, but would be the preferable way to actually pay it if I can get away with paying less. However, same concern as above applies about what it would look like on my credit report, given that this account is already so old it isn't showing.

Any thoughts or info on options 2 and 3 would be greatly appreciated (and on option 1 if I missed something that I should consider). Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,How to manage credit score for a huge renovation (USA),"Hey, I was hoping folks on this thread (USA especially) could help me understand what personal finance steps would be best for my scenario.

Over the past my month, my spouse and I just finish performing a large home renovation for a new (first!) home purchase, with about $25,000 of expenses I put on credit cards and $10,000 we handled in cash transactions. My spouse and I ensured we were financially comfortable with these expenses, but were not able to handle it with 100% liquid cash upfront for all the renovations before it made sense to move in to improve a lot of issues in an as-is bank-owned property that we also just closed on (Spouse is the only person on the mortgage, and I am not). We'll have no problem paying this off over the next 6 months based on our cost of living and incomes.

Now that the renovations are complete, I just got a notice from Intuit that my credit score has gone from 812 to 748 in a month. That seems huge -- unless we've been doing things that deem us a higher credit risk?

Here's some context: we now have high balances on the cards that my spouse is a primary holder on and I am authorized on. Most of the transactions for the renovation (\~$20k) are on a single credit card we have with a $32k credit line. Definitely high utilization, but we plan to pay it off immediately with some promotional balance transfers I personally have available. We decided to use the card (Chase Sapphire Reserve) because we feel safer using it for the many large purchases, especially for appliances, we made. It has already been of value to us as it's helped us resolve a large purchase dispute with a merchant quickly. Also good if there's any accidental damage to anything we purchase.

To pay off these balances this week, I applied (and was approved) for a new card for one promotional transfer and getting another balance transfer from another existing credit line. These two things will convert \~$17k of the current balance into \~$17k in 0 APR debt, with only about 3.5% in fees on average on this balance. The remainder will be paid off immediately. 

We thought this was a fine move and adequately balanced our requirements to move sooner with the fees + smoothing out expenses. \~$700 of extra cost to do this made sense to us. However, a huge drop in credit score while not missing any payments seems to suggest...otherwise? Or is this a hugely imperfect calculation system that could bounce back again next month?

Considering the details above -- why has my credit score changed so drastically? I have other open credit lines all with 0 balances and other credit lines that I have zero'd out and closed. Anything that a personal finance guru (or, just an opinion-haver) could suggest to improve what my spouse and I assumed was a normal finance scenario? Was there anything imprudent about this strategy? Is there other options I should have considered? Things like personal loans/home renovation loans (which seems just like a rebranded purchase loan, based on the identical interest rates) have higher interest than just using promotional balance transfers, but is this more 'responsible' behavior in lenders' eyes?",finance

&gt;III.C. The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**

Next, turn to page 16: **III.D. Vulnerabilities of Warehouse Funding,** to keep it simple its the equavlant to adding stop loss to every warehouse line of credit (which are used to fund mortgages). Since the margin call is on the loan for the mortgage instead of the mortgage itself, we don't see forclosures yet, but instead the margin call money is funded by the repo. Shawdow banks take the margin call. They pay the call via repo loan and pay that back via bonds, hence why the fed is buying those, junk bonds to be specific

&gt;Ginnie Mae servicers can only obtain unsecured financing, such as **unsecured corporate bonds**, to cover their advances. The rates on this financing are high, especially because many nonbanks have highyield credit ratings.

**tl;dr** most high risk mortgages(over 50% of total mortgages) that a bank wouldn't lend, was lent by shadow banks via a link of credit from the banks. Banks have tight stop losses set on these and have been issuing margin calls on tons of them.",finance

My wife received a relocation package from her employer and many weeks after we moved she received some kind of report that I'm trying to decipher.

Towards the bottom it lists Fed, SS, and Medicate withholding and then a Gross-Up number equal to the sum of those 3. The (gross) total amount it says we were given is nearly $25k (including the gross-up) and the sum of the 3 withholding amounts is about $5k.

I have been concerned that this income was not taxed as it doesn't show up on my wife's pay statements as any kind of income, and that this might leave us in a situation where we could be penalized for underpayment.

economy,The Truth about the Great Depression?,"The roaring '20s was a period of economic growth, jazz and carefree living for many.

A decade of change, when many Americans owned cars, radios, and telephones for the first time.

Prosperity was on the rise in cities and towns, and social change flavoured the air.

The attitude was, as is currently the case, stocks only go up.

Of course, all good things come to an end...

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened in the Great Depression?**

The Fed is supposed to keep inflation and monetary policy stable.

However, in the 1920s, they created huge quantities of money and cheap credit, which drove rapid expansion and a bubble.

This bubble popped in October 1929, and the Fed then adopted tight monetary policy throughout the early 1930s, creating a crash.

&amp;#x200B;

**What** ***really*** **happened in the Great Depression?**

Some go as far to say that the Great Depression was a Government confiscation of wealth.

Here's why...

In 1900, the Gold Standard Act was passed.

This Act fixed the price of gold at $20.67/oz., where it remained until the Great Depression.

In 1933, a month after taking office, FDR signed Executive Order 6102, dubbed the Great Gold Confiscation.

FDR's Executive Order forced all Americans to turn in all their gold coins, bullion and certificates to the Federal Reserve, redeeming them at $20.67/oz in exchange for paper currency.

Historians have speculated that the real reason for the gold confiscation was a bailout of the Federal Reserve Bank.

[Even FDR commented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNxMD2kaF2A) during one of his early ""Fireside Chats"" that gold obligations far exceeded the gold held by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve.

**“Behind government currency we have, in addition to the promise to pay, a reserve of gold and a small reserve of silver,** ***neither of them anything like the total amount of the currency***.” – FDR, 07 May 1933.

After the public had turned in the majority of the gold, FDR artificially increased the price of gold to $35/oz., which, amazingly, instantly bolstered the Federal Reserve holdings.

Starting in 1934, the Federal Reserve even updated the clause printed on currency bills ""redeemable for gold"" with ""redeemable in lawful money.""

This innocuous act foreshadowed the abandonment of the direct exchange of the dollar to gold.

It's also worth noting that it was the Fed's tight monetary policy which converted a recession into a Great Depression.

Others say that it is just the boom/bust cycle:

A boom to make the sheeple produce, create, establish - then a bust to steal it from them at pennies on the dollar.

Rinse...and repeat.

An intentional failure in order to create a crisis and pass laws to empower the government, which funnels wealth and property into the hands of the elite.

***I personally think this is a ridiculous line of reasoning, to say that the Fed intentionally caused the Great Depression. I mean come on, as if an independent agency set up by a cabal of private bankers on a private island and passed when most of the Congress were away for Christmas in 1913 would collude in this way...***

Of course they aren't *that* power hungry!

It's often worthwhile to look at the official story to at least rule out one possibility as to what *actually* happened.

**“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.” - Bill Casey CIA Director**

Fast forward to the present day and we have, much like the 1920s, a 'play culture' associated with the stock market.

We have the 'Buy High, Sell Low' Kings CNBC hailing the '[Rise of the Daytrader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0t_7R2sv4w)' and people think they can get rich quickly via day trading on the stock market (a [myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo)).

More of a curious observation than anything, I'm wondering if anyone has any insight. 

I know just enough to know that the Fed's actions during the Covid crisis are lowering APY percentages in high yield savings accounts across the board, and it would make sense that CD rates are similarly affected, but I am a little surprised to see that CDs are at or in many cases below HYSAs right now. For Discover bank right now, a 24month CD is 1.01% APY, identical to their savings account. 

From what I understand, CDs are safer for banks since money is tied to them, as opposed to savings accounts which are more liquid and could in theory be moved out, which is why the rates on CDs are generally better. What incentive does one have to open a CD right now? Wouldn't banks want to keep the yields on them higher than their savings accounts?",finance

Bitcoin,"TA Gurus, explain my chart..","This is a chart I made up that roughly correlates Bitcoin market cap to Bitcoin mining costs.  It is ""normalized"" through the halvenings.  It definitely shows a downward trend.  The ""normalization"" for halvenings applies a 100% coefficent post 2020 halvening, a 50% coefficent after the 2016 halvening and a 25% coefficent before the 2016 halvening.

The formula sprung from a discussion I was having on BTC wealth redistribution, and how the BTC holders rely on the miners to secure the chain.  The counter argument was that the holders could just pay for the mining themselves.

Since bitcoin is non-inflationary, this could be thought of as a type of negative interest rate.  If every holder had to offer a 100% subsidy to the miners to maintain the blockchain, what would that look like in the terms of a continual interest rate.  So here's the formula.

    Continual Interest function: 
       A = P*exp(r*t)
       ln(A) = ln(P) + rt
       r = ln(A) / ln(P) / t
       r = ln(A/P) / t         # (where t = 1/365, aka one day)
       r = ln(1 + I/P) / t     # (where A/P = 1+I/P; with 'I' being pct growth
    interest = norm_coef * ln(1 + daily_mining_cost / btc_market_cap) * 365

The datasource is from [bitinfocharts.com](https://bitinfocharts.com) referencing ""Market Capitalization"", ""Hashrate"" and ""Mining Profitability"" fields.  ""Daily Mining Cost"" is derived by ""Profitability \* Hashrate"" once correcting for unit scales.

So why is it after normalizing for the halvenings this interest function is on a negative trend over the last 5 years?

personalfinance,Saving More vs Paying Down Mortgage?,"Sorry in advance for formatting and if I rambled on. I'm typing this on my phone. 

Hello, I’m 22 and going to have my own house soon. I’m very fortunate to have been able to save while living with family and been able to keep my job throughout the global crisis. I managed to get a great deal for a 4bd2ba house with an interest rate of 2.625%. Naturally, I told my friends and family about the house and was asked what I’d be doing with the extra rooms.

 
I told them that I wasn’t entirely sure because when I first started looking for houses I was going to be getting it with my girlfriend, but due to differences we couldn’t compromise on, we broke up; instead, I ended up offering my friends to move in with me for 500/month and all utilities and internet would be included (200 cheaper than any decent apartment in the area).

 
I’m going to end up with 1500 on top of what I’m already making, so I’m not sure what to do with my extra income. 900-1000 should cover mortgage/utilities/internet. I was thinking of putting 50/month into savings for each of my friends to give back to them when they moved out, but other than that I’m not sure if I should try to pay down my mortgage faster or save more. I’m already making double payments on my car loan, so I guess I just need a second opinion, save more, pay more, or how I should split it. I also have my Roth 401k set at 10%

About half of the departments/employees at my organization are being offered a voluntary severance package. In addition to the two months of normal pay, I would be paid for unused paid vacation time (under the normal policy for separation) and an added ""benefit allowance"" of $1400 (this is a flat rate for everyone based on the average amount the organization pays toward benefits in two months for the staff being offered the package).

I'm trying to figure out what, as close as I can figure out, the actual payout would be after withholding. The payment come in a lump sum. Here are the estimated payout amounts from HR:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$2,310.69|$6,460.00|$1,400.00|$10,170.69|

That being said, from looking through this sub there are other things mentioned, like a 22% withholding rate because it's supplemental income or being withheld as if I were being paid $10k every pay period.

So what's the answer? What do you all think the actual amount paid after withholding will be? I'm looking for as much information as possible. Thanks in advance.

investing,Selling bond funds and optimizing bond investing,"I don't have too much money tied up to bonds right now at all. I just started investing in the last few years. I have nearly all of my allocation in stocks right now. This was before I knew about investing in stocks at all. As far as stocks are concerned I think I have gotten a much better grasp about stock investing. I have been reading a lot of books on value investing and have a few metrics for how to find cheaply priced stocks. These range from low formula based metrics, to seeing improvements in earnings and free cash flow, to using the balance sheet and finding intrinsic value (such as the price relative to the cash and cash equivalents per shares outstanding). 

It wasn't until now that I have been learning more about bonds. As we all probably know in the long term stocks outperform bonds. However, at the same time, there are many different reasons why people would want to invest in bonds. 1) to reduce volatility, 2) for fixed income (similar but not the same as dividends), and 3) for speculating purposes (you think that interest rates are quite high and can probably go lower in the near future). 

Some investors such as Peter Lynch are not big fans of bonds in general. Other investors such as Preston Pysch (a more contrarian value investor) believe in buying bonds during stock bull markets (when interest rates are higher) and stocks during stock bear markets. 

As of right now I have a minor position in bond funds through Fidelity. Given that interest rates are very low (even negative) would it not make sense to sell bond funds right now since interest rates can probably only potentially go lower slightly and reput a position in bonds in years from now when we start reaching the heights of the economy again (when interest rates start climbing back up)? 

As of right now, I am 26. I was planning on buying more bonds for my portfolio (30-year treasuries and other similar bonds) around age 30 and keep them for maturity or until interest rates fall again) and probably some shorter-term bonds. 

I figure as I get older it would be good to have a mixture of bonds and dividend-paying stocks.",finance

personalfinance,Is a credit score that is solely based on credit cards and student loans considered “shallow” for auto loans and mortgages?,"I have heard some conflicting information on what “shallow” credit is and how it can affect loan interest rates. Some are of the mind that “shallow” refers to having a short credit history, perhaps your longest credit card account is only 3yrs old. On r/cars they link to a video on the wiki that essentially says if your credit score is made up of only credit cards, even if you have an excellent score, you’ll get a worse interest rate than someone who has a mortgage on a house, with maybe a slightly lower credit score. Does shallow refer to credit age or type?

I have great credit (over 800) with student loans and several credit cards, less than 10% utilization, 8yr avg age of credit: will I not be offered a competitive auto loan rate because I don’t have a mortgage? Or, will I not get a competitive mortgage without an auto loan? I recognize there are numerous unknown factors here like term, down payments, etc but I’m just looking for insight on generalities if any.",finance

I ran over to him and he relaxed but then peed himself. He got back up and walked over to his dinner and finished eating like nothing happened. He is walking around fine now. I thought maybe it is too hot in my house (82F) so I turned my AC on. He is walking around panting a lot but seems normal. He is picking up his toys and playing with them.

personalfinance,Syudent loan refinancing questions,"I'm an almost 25F, graduated December 2016 with my BSc. Unfortunately I had a change in career paths that probably would've helped back in college to steer me in the right direction, but whatever, it's just a few classes difference anyway at this point, so I'm back working my way up. I've never had a high paying job (woo working with animals never pays well!) so paying off my student loans are a bitch. I currently make ~$1700 a month after taxes but pay ~$600 a month in student loans, $625 rent, $80 phone, $60 internet, $300 car note, $120 car insurance, plus groceries and gas. I make enough monthly to survive but just barely. I graduated with just around $60k worth in loans, and my dad took out a Parent Plus Loan as well.

Here's the issue, I have 1 federal loan (on track, great interest rate, great company) with about $22k left on it, and then 1 private loan (horrible interest rate, feel like I'm getting nowhere, small company that's hard to communicate with) that has about $26k left on it. I want to combine these, but I learned I can't consolidate because they're different types of loans, so my only choice is refinancing. I want to cut my monthly payments down and quit paying 2 different companies, it's really a pain to see one paying off so well and the other going nowhere. 

So I've tried some of those refinancing websites that would give you a quote and interest rate, etc. They denied me every time saying I don't make enough and I need a cosigner. I'm an adult that makes enough to pay my loans off now, so I don't want to go crying back to my dad again to co-sign, that just makes no sense to me. How/where can I go to find a reasonable place to take out a refinancing loan to help me? Any advice appreciated, thanks!

personalfinance,Taxable Fringe Benefits for my MBA Eating Away at My Paycheck and IDK what to do,"I work for as a web developer for a local liberal arts college. I took a sizable pay cut for this job 1.5 years ago because my then-job was at risk of being eliminated, and the college job had some non-monetary perks like being closer to home, a better staff, and a totally free master's degree.

After my 90-day probation period ended, I enrolled immediately in the MBA program with a concentration in Project Management, as this degree was the most applicable to my current position, especially with the PM concentration. In December 2019, when I was able half way through the MBA, the college realized that they had been incorrectly taxing employees who were enrolled in masters programs - meaning, they were not taxing employees at all. The ""new"" (to us, at least) federal tax rules would be implemented on January 1, 2020.

Prior to this, there had never been mention of taxing employees for their free master's degree. 

The academic year is split into 5 MODs. MOD 1 is Sept/Oct, MOD 2 is Nov/Dec, MOD 3 is Jan/Feb/Mar, Mod 4 is Mar/Apr/May, and MOD 5 is June/July. When MOD 3 started in January, taking 2 classes, the course load and class cost satisfied the  Education Assistance tax fringe benefit of $5,250. After that, in MOD 4, the fringe benefit started taking out an extra $100 in federal taxes from each of my bi-weekly pay checks.

Now in MOD 5, there is an additional $200 in federal taxes being taken out of each check. 

So now I am losing $300 per check. Starting July 1st, our health insurance resets and I have had to add my husband to my plan, which will deduct $277 from each pay check. I am due to finish the degree at the end of December 2020, and I am concerned that if my tax deduction keeps increasing each MOD, that by the start of MOD 2 in November, I am going to lose a huge portion of my paycheck. This is not sustainable.

For transparency, my pay check after all other deductions is $1500.

&amp;#x200B;

|Starting Check After Deductions|$1500|
|:-|:-|
|MOD 4 Tax Deduction|\- $100|
|MOD 5 Tax Deduction|\- $200|
|Health Insurance Deduction|\- $277|
|MOD 1 Tax Deduction ?????|\- $300|
|MOD 2 Tax Deduction ?????|\- $400|
|**Total Check per Pay Period**|**$223**|

&amp;#x200B;

I am just casting out a wild guess that if my tax deduction for the MOD increased by $100, it will do this for MOD1 and MOD2. This is merely a guess, but I feel like I have to be prepared for some tough numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there anyway around this so I don't lose my entire check?
2. I fully plan to argue that the MBA with PM concentration is applicable to my current position and therefore should be tax free when I file my 2020 taxes. I have read this must be proven on a class-by-class basis. Does anyone have experience on filing tax free fringe benefits or advice on the topic?

I am currently filing as a 2. I worry filing as a 3 would screw me over when filing my 2020 taxes.

I want to mention that I am very aware and thankful that I have the ability to get an MBA without paying tuition. The price of tuition is out of control and education is becoming something that is harder for many to obtain without serious sacrifice. I have worked very hard on my degree while working full time, and I want to finish it. I do not want to quit and I do not want to transfer my credits somewhere else where I will no doubt spend thousands more than what I will lose in my pay checks for the rest of the year. One option I am considering is taking 2 of my last 4 classes in 2021 to get that year's $5,250 education fringe benefit. But I just want to be done and get what I can back on my 2020 taxes if possible.",finance
personalfinance,I am thinking of purchasing solar panels but only plan on keeping the home for about 5 years. Is it worth it? (US TX),"I have been researching getting solar panels for my house and I am trying to decide if it would be a good investment. The only issue is I do not plan on living in this house for more than about 5 more years.

I have a quote saying the solar panels will cost about 28k at a 2.99% interest rate. Combined with the fact that Texas is giving 7k to anyone who purchases solar panels to do with as they please.

I used a website called PV Value and found that the estimated value of the solar panels would be about 18k starting at year 0 of purchase and degrade about $900 every year.

Each of our electricity bills is about 200 dollars which will be almost completely negated but would be replaced with a $130 bill to the solar loan.


From my calculations even with using the 7k toward the solar panels and bringing the cost down to 21k my ROI would not be in the positive about 10-11 years which looks to me like a bad investment. 

In comes my other idea. If I take the 7k incitive and use it toward various credit card debt ~22%APR I could save about $130 each month in credit card interest charges. If I use that $130 + a bit more towards the solar loan I would be paying the loan off in about $300 payments I estimate that the panels would be completely paid off in about 7 years and in only 4 years the value of the solar panels and the remainder of the loan would basically negate itself making it a good investment.

What are your thoughts on purchasing solar panels for a home? Is it a good investment? Is it a good investment in my first scenario? Does my idea for paying off the credit card debt make sense or am I forgetting something?",finance

So we all know the snowball method feels good and has merit in that, but that the avalanche method does save money in the end. But everything that I've read says that the avalanche method means putting any extra money you have towards the debt with the highest interest rate. Wouldn't it make more sense to put it towards whatever debt is *incurring the most interest per month, regardless of the rate?*

Example,

Debt A: $10,000 at 12%

Debt B: $20,000 at 8% 

Debt A adds $100/mo in interest

Debt B adds $133/mo in interest

The avalanche method tells us to put extra money towards Debt A because it's a higher rate, even though Debt B is *actually* costing more money, right?

Wouldn't it make more sense to attack Debt B as much as possible until they are both accruing the same amount of interest per month? And then at that point split any extra money evenly across both debts?

I've worked remotely for years, so I've been saving wear and tear on my car and on gas.  I have $3000.00 in my savings and my checking usually ends up with a 0.00 balance by payday.

My question is this: currently, if I cash out my 401k rather than rolling into a new fund, after taxes are paid on the total I end up with $12,000.

I have 3 loans. All federal. Started at $75K and I'm not just over $10K by a few bucks. All loans are consolidated together into one payment of $253.10 a month, plus whatever I wanna chip away at. I pay all my bills on the 6th or the 7th every month. 

With COVID happening I was an idiot and assumed my federal loans were covered by COVID holds. They were not. I paid up in full and everything is fine. 

This month on the 6th I get an ASTRONOMICALLY LOW amount on my bill: $27.00, and I don't think this sounds right. So, I take a photo and call Navient. 

Even after pressuring them for answers Navient says, ""Nah, you're good."" I don't understand but okay, I guess. 

Yesterday I get text notification saying I owe over $700 total because of deliquient payments. I check my email, and lo and behold on May 31st Navient sent me two notifications under the title, ""Your monthly statement."" 

1. I owe 400+ due on the 27th. 
2. I owe 350+ due on the 28th. 

Both of these emails were sent at the same time, on the same day from Navient. But my dashboard on the 6th said all I owed was $27.00 

I call Navient and ask ""What gives?"" 

- They tell me it was an error and that I only owe the usual amount.
- They then tell me that my account is delinquent. 
- They then retract that statement and say that I'm up to date on all payments. 
- They then say that I'm not paid in full. 
- They retact that, and go back to saying that I'm paid in full
- When asked about fees they say I wont get any
- They retract the statement about fees and say I could get some if I dont pay in full.
- They cannot tell me how much I owe this month
- Then they say I must pay the usual amount of $253.10 every month no matter what, even if the dash board says I'm paid up.

At this moment my Navient dashboard is still saying I owe $0.00 and that I've paid in full for this month. But I'm getting notifications that I still owe and they're threatening late fees on top of that.

A lot of companies never intend to use these but pay the expenses for them in case of a time when they really need the money. In March, a lot of companies drew on these revolving lines of credit to the max so they could get cash while it was still available. Banks have to put money out the door when these are drawn upon and everyone was doing it at the same time. This helps the liquidity of the companies borrowing, but clearly impairs the liquidity for banks as they have to put money out the door to meet the demands. This became a major problem for banks and it attributed to some major dislocations in various high quality fixed income products seen in March.

In April and May, corporate fixed income markets saw a TON of new bond issuance after the Fed announced it was purchasing. Some companies that issued new bonds were ones that drew their revolving credit facilities to the max in March (funded by banks), and some were companies that may have needed to do so in the future. The Fed supporting the corporate bond market took major pressure off bank liquidity and it effective transferred the funding sources to asset managers and other institutional investors that (1) are not as systemically important as the banks are to the economy and (2) in better position to fund at their discretion, as opposed to contractual funding commitments banks provide.

This is not meant to be a post supporting Fed’s actions, but I have previously questioned the need for a central bank to be purchasing corporate bonds and I believe this is the reason why they did it. It’s been successful. The future unintended consequences of the Fed’s actions are a separate topic.",finance

personalfinance,Paying for Grad School,"Hello all.  I just got into the MBA program of my dreams, and am trying to figure out how to optimize my borrowing to save the most money. Relevant info:

* Current Income - 100k a year (I make 55k, wife makes \~45K. I will not be able to work during the program)
* Credit - Mine is low/mid 700's as of a year ago, my wife does not know hers (should be solid)
* Current Budget (monthly)
   * Rent - 1000
   * Cars/Transport - 350 (2 cars, one owned one 2 years into a 3 yr lease)
   * All other spending - $1500 (I can break this down if that is useful, but we are generally frugal)
* Current Savings
   * \~$15k retirement
   * \~$15K cash (checkings/savings)
   * \*edit\* $5K worth of PTO combined when we leave our current jobs
* Current Debt
   * Car Lease - $3000 (250/month, 1 year remaining, counted above in transport)
   * Wife's Student Loans
      * Federal - $9,000 (\~4%) currently on post-grad forbearance
      * Private - $15,000 (9.5%) minimum payment \~300/month, we've been paying \~2k
* Tuition / School expenses
   * $50K/Year for 2 years ($40K if I am able to establish in-state residency)
   * $2k/Year school-related expenses
   * $500/month rent increase (higher COL area)

We are trying to figure out what to borrow, where to budget, and how to move money around to make this happen while minimizing risk/cost. A few main questions:

* **What is the best route to borrow that money?** We anticipate needing about 50K/year in loans to make this happen (mix of federal ($20,500 max/year) + private?)
* **Should we be doing anything with our cash now** (pay down her debt, put it in a retirement account to lower assets for FAFSA, pay it to the program in cash?)
* What pitfalls should we watch out for?
* What resources are available to us to make these major decisions

We are committed to making this work, and the outcomes for the program guarantee a solid ROI on the degree. The question for us isn't if, it is how. A handful of potentially relevant tidbits:

* My wife is a nurse, and if she can secure a job near the school in question we anticipate a minimum annual income increase of $5-10K. Until she does she can easily live with family and stay at her current employer
* We have family nearby. In theory, we could live with them but it is a 30-40min commute and parking on campus is complicated. It would save us significant amounts of money but I worry I'll lose the value of the degree being so far from campus and recruiting.

Any advice is appreciated, I'll do my best to monitor this post and update info as people ask questions and offer up ideas.

personalfinance,Advice on paying off car loan early,"Hi, apologies if this is covered in the wiki -- I checked but didn't see anything that directly answered my question.

I bought a used car last month; I was in a car accident and my car was totaled so I had a check from my insurance and could have paid for the car in cash. However, there was a $500 discount if I used financing from manufacturer, which had a 2% interest rate with no prepayment penalty, so I chose that option. (I think the interest is not precomputed -- I didn't know that was a thing so didn't think to ask at the time -- but I'm going to call someone to confirm.)

My first payment is due in a few days, and my plan was to pay off 80-90% of the principal then. I would then pay the remaining monthly payments for the next few months. This way, I would have very minimal interest costs, but I would still have a few months of this car loan on my credit report to boost my score. Also, the salesperson who sold me the car advised me to pay the loan for a few months to give financing company time to organize all the title documents (though not sure if that's a valid recommendation).

Does that sound like a good plan? Is there anything I'm missing?

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,How To Refinance Personal Loan?,"So about a year ago I eagerly wanted to get one of cars over always wanted , only issue was it wasn’t within the 10 year model year limit my banking institution gives out Car loans to so I had to take out a personal loan for it through them. Yes, I know I should’ve shopped around to other banks and see who could do an actual car loan but the car probably would’ve sold if I waited another day and I didn’t have the cash at that time. So my question is , the loan is through my primary credit union. Have all my accounts through them , is it possible to refinance this loan through another bank And if so how do I go about it and when I do refinance will it effect my credit since the age of that existing open account will close I’m assuming ? It’s a crazy interest rate of about 14% on this and still owe 9k paying around 305 a month and only about a little over half of that goes to the actual principal ,initially I didn’t care due to the excitement of the car but now I realize it was foolish. I’m 21 have about 20k put away and  have a good job. I can pay this off and it wouldn’t really effect me but I like keeping liquid capital to play around and invest with. I don’t mind a monthly payment But I like the peace of mind knowing I’m not getting bent over paying interest on something I can just pay off. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,"Help! I'm $7,000 in debt. Can someone review this budget/give advise?","Hey there. Here's some things you need to know. I'm 21 and I live with my parents rent free. The car I drive is owned by my parents. I bring home $1,100 a month post taxes and dental and vision insurance. So about $550 per paycheck x twice a month. I occasionally have another stream of income from dog sitting, but it's not reliable enough to count on and when I do get it, it's used for debt payment. This debt is almost 50% of my gross income and something needs to be done ASAP. 

I have had budgets before in the past but they didn't work, and once I broke them I couldn't be bothered to have another look at them to try and make it work. But seeing the success some of my high school classmates have made financially was a hard wake up call to try and do something. 

Listed below is a budget I have made today and I'm seeing some feedback on it. I'm very interested in using the Dave Ramsey Snowball method to pay off my debt, but I cannot find the cash to make more than my minimum payments, so I'm turning to you reddit to see if you can help. 

This is no excuse for the massive amount of debt I have myself in and I'm not looking for sympathy, I just want to explain myself. I have been diagnosed my by psychiatrist with type 2 bipolar disorder since I would have extended periods of hypomania where I physically/mentally couldn't control my spending (this led to the purchase of a Macbook pro, Airpods, a new Apple Watch and putting a new iPhone and iPad on installment plans with my wireless carrier, AT&amp;T) only to crash a while later and the reality of my purchases would hit me. This has since gotten under control with the help of medications and therapy. 

Listed below is my budget for a months time:

|Phone Bill: $205|Car Ins: $160 |Loan: $100|\*\*\*Planet Fitness: $23|Apple Card: $75|Misc (oil changes,medication,etc): $70|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\*Chase: $35|\*\*Regions CC: $50|Spotify: $11|Apple Cloud Subscription: $3|Gas: $60|Food: $240|

\* Chase is likely about to be paid off within the next few weeks, but I kept it in the budget anyways just in case. The balance is $570 and I have $250 set aside in my savings along with $350 coming up in dog sitting money, so once I am paid for that gig the money will be used to pay off the card in full. 

\*\* I am unsure of the monthly payment for the regions credit card. I recently opened up a new card with a 0% interest for a 15 month period and made a balance transfer of $900 from my chase card to this one with a 4% transfer fee ($36). The transfer is currently being processed so Regions has yet to post what the minimum payment will be so I took a shot in the dark on the payment amount. 

\*\*\* I currently have the Black card at Planet Fitness, but I will be downgrading in the next few days to the basic membership because I do not use it enough to justify paying that much. So this payment will go down to $10, but I left the old amount because that is what I have been paying for months now. 

Other notes: 

* The reason my phone bill is so high is due to the iPad and iPhone installment payments. My ipad is set to be paid off in February of next year and will drop by bill by $70. I am not sure about my iPhone. I have talked with AT&amp;T and there is no lower data plan that I can switch to w/o having to pay overage charges each month. 
* My Apple CC has been on the COVID-19 payment assistance program since March even though I somewhat have had the funds to make the payment, but I'm not sure if the program will continue much longer so it's best to plan for my payments again. This card has a balance of $2,800 with a 15.99% interest rate and a credit limit of $3,000. Yes, I know, it's almost maxed out. 
* The loan is from previous debt consolidation and has a 9% interest rate and has a balance of about $1,700. The loan was for $2,100. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading! Any thoughts or insights you have are greatly appreciated. TIA!",finance

Bitcoin,Lightning Network is sweet,"First off, i'll come out and say it. I'm not on the hold bitcoin forever train. Im more of a, deposit $ on to bitcoin and try and use it as I would my bank account but hoping to get some solid ROI instead of the terrible interest rate a checking account would. As I spend BTC I can simply buy more. Anyways....

Just wanted to say that for those people who haven't tried using the lightning network, give it a shot. Download a mobile wallet, transfer some sats to it and try sending a few transactions out. I recently started using Bluewallet since IOS lightning wallets aren't as common as android but there are some other ones out there as well. 

My next step is to set up a lightning node to have full custody of my keys like I do with my trezor but the custodial LN wallet has been SUPER simple to use. Just don't put more $ on there than you would be willing to loose since at the end of the day you are trusting someone else. 

I think in the future a simple lightning wallet and buying sats directly off-chain should be the recommended route for people new to bitcoin. That way they can get a feel for it before moving on-chain where fees can be MUCH higher and waiting for confirmations etc can be a turn off for some.

If you haven't tried it you should. P.S. [ln.pizza](https://ln.pizza) is amazing and is definitely the kind of transactions that would make bitcoin get more adoption. Also buying gift cards on the Fold app with lightning makes for a decent discount.",cryptocurrency

BK was dismissed, not discharged. I lost 5k in Attorney fees and of course the BK still went on my record.

Forex,Macro Views: Stock Market’s Clash with Reality Spells Danger for Retail Speculators,"Last week, we were treated to some special insights by Jeremy Grantham.

I’ve known Jeremy since the early 1990s, and I always have time for his views.

He forecasted the piercing of the Japanese stock and real estate bubbles in 1989, the tech bubble in 2000, and the U.S. housing crash in 2008.

So his record at forecasting bubbles is truly prescient. And now, he’s calling the current stock market the fourth great bubble of his career.

He recommends a maximum allocation of 0% to US stocks… with a negative allocation, if possible.

Jeremy is the co-founder and chief investment strategist of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Co. It’s a Boston-based asset management firm that manages around $120 billion.

Considering he’s made a fortune for his clients and himself by picking stocks, this is a remarkable statement.

In fact, he thinks that the current market may be the craziest of his career.

Below, I’ll show you why I stand by Jeremy… and why you shouldn’t fall for the market’s current optimism.

## Markets Clashing with Reality

Jeremy believes the stock market today clashes directly with the harsh realities of the coronavirus pandemic… unemployment numbers… and sharp rise in bankruptcies.

If you’ve been following my writing, you’ll know I feel the same way.

Jeremy attributes this insanity to uncontrolled day traders who are out of work and speculating heavily on unproven or even bankrupt companies.

But why are so many analysts also justifying the sharp stock market rally of the past two and a half months?

One of the things I believe they’re ignoring is the near certainty of much higher taxes over the coming years.

The era of tax cuts is over! Government debt has exploded over recent years, and we need to pay for it.

Taxes will almost definitely go up. Depending on the outcome of the election, they will go up sooner or later.

Either way, we need to factor in the near certainty that Congress will raise taxes on higher earners. This will have an adverse impact on future consumption, which will slow the overall economic growth rates.

Additionally, we may also see taxes on certain industries, with the high-tech companies as likely targets.

Their massive lobbying efforts will mitigate some of the impact. But I am sure that they are starting to calibrate new taxes into their forecasts. This will hurt their future earnings stream and, accordingly, their stock prices.

I am not even going to touch the possibility of future regulation, which would have a further negative effect on the stock prices of the companies affected.

Taxes aside, one of the most fascinating aspects of today’s market is that many, many CFOs of major corporations are refusing to project their earnings for the rest of this year.

This is nearly unprecedented, yet it has happened many times in the past several months.

Finance chiefs are ripping up their prior earnings forecasts, slashing dividends, and often refusing to project their future earnings, scrapping their guidance altogether.

We saw this with Michael Barkin, CFO of Vail Resorts – one of the world’s largest owners of ski resorts. Twitter also pulled its first-quarter guidance in March. As did Anheuser-Busch, which owns some of the most popular beer brands – including Budweiser, Bud Light, and Stella Artois.

If a company can’t forecast its own future earnings, how can stock analysts possibly figure out where a company’s stock should be trading in the future?

I would maintain that they are just guessing.

## Uncertain Times for Investors

Uncertainty is probably the thing that investors dislike the most. Yet there are many, many factors in today’s world which are totally uncertain.

Last month, we had the worst miss in history by Wall Street economists when they absolutely bombed on their unemployment forecasts.

I believe it is reasonable to assume that for some time, future growth rates, trade numbers, and many other things will be equally hard to predict. We are in uncharted waters, so I hardly fault the economists for missing their forecasts.

About the only thing that everyone can feel comfortable forecasting is that the Federal Reserve will continue to keep its printing presses cranking out its funny money at record speed.

Is this enough to justify today’s equity valuations? Hardly. Let me illustrate.

Say company A had a strong credit rating before the pandemic. Now its revenues have collapsed, and its future earnings prospects are highly dubious, at best.

The company had some cash reserves, but not enough to deal with a 90% drop in revenues for multiple months.

It had been making lots of money for many years, but instead of building up a huge cash reserve, it paid out hundreds of millions in massive executive compensation packages.

Moreover, it took advantage of plentiful credit, and borrowed lots and lots of money, which it used for stock buybacks.

Now the ratings agencies see a highly leveraged company that is making almost no money. So they naturally cut the company’s rating to Junk, and the company can no longer borrow money at a decent interest rate, if at all.

In comes everyone’s financial savior, the Fed. It lends lots of money to this company, which would otherwise have to go bankrupt, and permits the company to stay alive – marginally.

Simply loading a balance sheet with more debt can delay an awful ending, but it is a very dangerous way to go. We end up with a company that is dangerously indebted.

It may manage to slowly work off the excessive debt over time, heal its inflated balance sheet, and remain solvent, but the chances are slim.

It is far more likely that the company will be forced to close, or perhaps slide into the realm of zombie companies, looking alive but showing few signs of healthy life.

Pricing this company at a high market valuation is foolhardy.

Although, admittedly, it’s not as dumb as loading up on the stock of a company that has already screamed “uncle” and declared bankruptcy.

Regardless, the moral hazard that the Fed is creating is very dangerous. It’s likely to result in massive losses for the large majority of retail speculators.

More to come…

However, COVID hospitalizations and deaths have not seen a parallel spike and consumer spending jumped a record 8.2% in May. How should we interpret this information? Here are the details:

1. **📉**[ ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shoppers-returned-in-may-likely-spurring-increased-retail-sales-11592299802)**The Federal Reserve capped dividend payments and suspended share-buybacks for banks in order to preserve capital.** On Thursday, the Fed voted to require large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and cap dividend payments in the third quarter. The traditional stress test done in February before the pandemic showed that banks remained well capitalized, but the Fed is taking precaution given current conditions. The market reacted poorly as it seemed like the Fed was preparing for worse to come, but a deeper look indicates the Fed is just taking precautions in a worst-case scenario.
2. **📉** **The U.S. hit a record high daily number of COVID cases this week with more than 45K new cases, resulting in select states to pause reopening plans.** Texas, Florida, and Arizona paused reopening plans this week due to rising COVID cases. This has raised concerns among investors that other states will follow a similar path. If so, this could result in significant damage to the economy and hinder the market recovery we’ve seen in the past month. While this is concerning, it is promising to see these cases are isolated and northern states have seen a continued decline in cases, even in the past two weeks. On Thursday, Governor Cuomo announced that New York saw the lowest levels of COVID-related hospitalizations since the beginning of the COVID crisis. Therefore, it is unlikely that the majority of states would pause reopening plans or roll-back reopening progress.You can see the number of daily COVID cases by state in this Johns Hopkins University link.
3. **📈**[ ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/503427-democrats-unveil-15-trillion-infrastructure-plan)**While COVID cases are spiking, COVID hospitalizations and deaths still on the decline so far.** COVID cases are spiking, and the median age of positive cases have dropped significantly. In the case of Florida, the median age for COVID cases dropped from 50 to 33 in recent days, meaning the infections are occuring in the less vulnerable population. As a result, we have not seen a parallel spike in hospitalizations and deaths. However, this likely means a much greater pool of asymptomatic carriers exists and may spread it to a more vulnerable population, especially with the upcoming 4th of July. It will be critical to keep an eye on the number of hospitalizations and deaths for the coming months.
4. **📈**[ ](https://apnews.com/f7b0b710e4054720e2511aa4fb3108b4)**Finally, consumer spending jumped a record 8.2% in May, a positive indicator of economic recovery as Americans are able to spend as states reopen.** Consumer spending leaped a record 8.2% in May indicating confidence in the economy. The reopening of businesses in May allowed pent up demand to be released. This is promising for our economic recovery as small businesses depend on this uptick in spending for survival. We will need to see if spending continues to return back to normal if government stimulus subsides next month.

**WX Capital believes that the markets will continue their recovery after 1 - 2 months of uncertainty.** Rising COVID cases are certainly concerning, but it's promising that hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID are still on the decline in the U.S. However, with 4th of July coming up and the economy reopening, there is a concern that a large number of asymptomatic carriers will transmit COVID to more vulnerable groups. Hopefully, with increased testing, new treatment options, and proper social precautions, we will see hospitalizations and deaths mitigated. As usual, we have maintained the vast majority of our positions in biotech as a natural hedge against the COVID-impacted markets. Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions!",finance

personalfinance,"Should I use credit cards for a large purchase, then get a debt consolidation loan, or should I just get the loan to start with?","I've been playing the credit card game for about 5 years now, and have acquired over the years 11 credit cards while paying zero interest on them whatsoever. Normally when I make a large purchase I can't afford I'll get a new credit card with a bonus and 0% apr for at least a year. After a purchase 6 months ago for $6000 I've been able to pay it off to $3000 and still have 6-8 months left to finish it paying it. No problem, have that covered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've bought a house, and the house needs work. The best price I could find for what I'm doing was $13,000. I've acquired 3 new cards in order to cover the cost, with the intention of paying off as much of those cards as possible before the 0% interest rate is up, then getting a debt consolidation loan to pay off the rest. My reasoning being that I can pay off a good chunk of the credit cards at 0% interest, which means my loan will be for a smaller amount. I was all set for this plan but then when checking a credit score simulator realized my credit score will go from 740 down to 670, which is a bit lower than I anticipated.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear opinions on whether I should follow through on this plan, or if it's better to just get a loan for my house work from the start and forego using the credit cards. Thank you all in advance, I love reading the different ideas people come up with on this subreddit.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay down my investment financing or keep the cash to buy equities,"Cash: $26 @ Negligible Deposit Rate.

Equities: $20

Financing on Equities: -$3 @ 1.31%

Bonds:  $39 (Average YTM 4%, duration 5 years)

Financing on Bonds:  -$26 @ IBOR + 0% = **0.48%**

*Amounts are normalised for anonymity, but proportions are consistent with what they actually are.*

&amp;#x200B;

I've been selling out of equity markets lately. (Yes yes. I know one shouldn't try and time them market). Initially in the crash I went as far as going deep into margin to buy equities. However, I've gradually sold (Admittedly many positions too soon) and as a result, I currently have a fair amount of cash. I plan to reinvest this cash slowly given the uncertainty ahead.

I also have a significant loan used to finance my bond investments. I have a portfolio of bonds yielding about 3-4%, all Investment grade. My loan-to-value on this bond portfolio is about 66%. The interest on that loan is currently only 0.48%. I am locked in at the interbank rate + 0.

I'm definitely going to move cash to my brokerage account so as to get rid of that margin amount and not pay 1.31%. My concern is with the financing of the bonds.

1. I locked in the spread of IBOR + 0 promotionally, if I pay down the loan, i would unlikely be able to re-obtain that spread. I was quoted that to re-borrow for the same purpose, it would be IBOR + 1%.
2. The return on the cash invested in the levered bonds is great, at about 11% after interest. That being said, it's sensitive to a rise in interest rates which would reduce my bond prices as well as raise my interest expense. The most concerning bit would be margin call if I hit LTV 75 which I'm relatively close to.

Essentially, this amounts to me paying that 0.48% interest on $26 to keep my powder dry to buy into equities. What are your thoughts?

Additionally, I'm 30 so I can hold equities for a while to ride out volatility. Potentially I could pull the trigger now and just park it all in a broad based ETF, but psychologically it's tough to tolerate the volatility that we saw in March, hence the trickle-in approach. It just helps me sleep at night. I would accelerate my investment at lower valuations of S&amp;P, but now I plan to keep it slow and steady just for peace of mind.",finance
personalfinance,New car help loan or PCP?,"Hi Guys

Hope everyone is well and keeping safe.

Just after some advice really as I honestly don’t know what to do. 

We currently have an Audi Q3 that we purchased via a loan (not a great interest rate as we’d just bought a house but nevermind) with about £7k outstanding. The car as a trade in is probably worth £7-9k.

When we had the MOT last, our mechanic who is a family friend advised us that there was approximately £6k of work that need to be done in the next 12-18 months and advised us to get rid of the car. 

Now looking to upgrade to a Tiguan at about £20k for a multitude of reasons, but being a bigger car being on (as we will be starting a family in the future).

So the question is, am I better taking out a new loan. We have seen rates for about 3.5% that reckon we should get approved on over 5 years 

Or do we PCP the car over 4 years? That garage we spoke to would give us the cash to pay off the loan. But the rates would be like 8.9% I think, and the monthlies are easily affordable and similar on the two options. 

I can get a break down of the Bubble payment if needed. 

We don’t plan on changing the car within the 5 years, but 5 years is a long time and a lot can change. 

Thanks in Advance.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay for the car in full and not invest anything into an index fund or make car payments for 2 years while investing specific amount of money on a monthly basis?,"Hey, so basically I’m 20, making $2500 a month in a country where the average salary is $1000. My only expense is $250 for rent and food. I really need a car for business meetings with clients, going to my classes etc.

I have saved up about $25.000, no debt or anything like that, my college tuition is free, so my living expenses are $250 and business expenses are $100, so I can save up about 80-85% of my income without any problem.

The used car situation is a complete anarchy over here, dealers reverting the mileage on cars, hiding errors and car accident history etc. I do not know a single person who has a second hand used car and doesn’t have problems with it.

For that reasons I decided to buy a new car. It costs $24.000 and before you lynch me for not buying an old Toyota or cheaper new car, unfortunately the status symbols in our country are over the top.

I absolutely need to present confidence and expertise to close the deals with clients and I cannot do that in old beater car. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t buy anything luxurious, it’s Skoda, which is known as one of the most reliable, yet elegant and professional looking cars on European market. I plan to use this car for more than 10 years, it’s great looking while being a perfect car for small family, so it will last me a very long time. This is also one of the things that made an impact on my decision. If I want to move on my own or start a family in next few years, I have one liability less because I will have a fully paid transportation vehicle without being afraid that it will break down.

Now what I need help with is deciding on how I will pay for the car. Should I pay it in full immediately and drain my bank account or should I split the payments in 2 years, so about 12k this year and 12k next year, leaving me more than enough amout of money to invest and have a very comfortable emergency fund?

I plan to invest in low interest index funds, no specific stocks, no bullshit day trading, no bonds or gold, just plain old index funds and investing for a long term, at least 20 years.

The interest rate for having a car payments it’s not so high, I would probably pay additional $400 for splitting my car payments into 2 years.

personalfinance,"Physician here, does it make sense not to aggressively pay down my (federal) student loans?","I follow white coat investors in Facebook and I keep seeing these articles posted like ""doctor pays off 600k in loans in 5.5 years with a family of 8!"", and I think hot damn that is impressive.

But yet I am probably ~450k (75k in private) in debt and just starting a 2 year fellowship, with the expectation of making 220-250k/yr starting off after the fellowship. I think in my case, by doing PSLF, which includes 5 more years after completion of fellowship that even paying the minimum for REPAYE, that it seems that is STILL preferred than aggressively paying it down ASAP.

My reasoning is that, after tax I will probably make ~10,000 a month rounded. Sign on bonus I will probably either pay to my private loan or store for mortgage down payment so will not use that. Realistically I could probably afford to pay 6,000/month to loans and live like a resident, which would be 360k in 5 years to federal loans. This isn't even accounting for retirement.

OR, I could spend ~90k in REPAYE during the course of 5 years and have 270k in various cash, maximizing 403(b) retirement, IRA, stocks (huge tech and S&amp;P fan), netting ~5-8% a year on average.

By doing the numbers it actually makes more sense NOT to aggressively pay down a &lt;6% interest rate student loan assuming PSLF works out. So to summarize I could be 270k+ in various savings and investment vehicles or could pay off my debt but have 0 in the retirement, stocks, etc in 5 years?

Is this reasoning faulty? Thank you for any tips!",finance

personalfinance,Cash out refinance to lower interest rate...,"Hi all. With the very low refi interest rates we have right now, I would love to refi. I am currently at 30 year fixed 4+% (15 year mark). Unfortunately, my balance is pretty low (around 150k). No lender would give me a low interest rate. I’m in CA.

An idea I had is what if I do a cash out refi of maybe another 150k (house is worth 600+k) to get a rate of 3% or better 30 year fixed? I would then take that 150k and immediately put it back into the loan to bring the balance back down. Of crs, I would continue paying what I am paying now and not at the reduced monthly payment. I will only reduce payment if I am tight on cash or if I become unemployed.

Upon further research, Vanguard has a fund - VFIIX - where you can buy these bonds for a relatively high ER of .21%. The fund's track record is pretty good for a bond investment...best 3 year return 7.68%, worst 3 year return 1.53%.

My plan would be to keep most of my ""6 months of expenses"" EF in my checking account (of which I earn 3% interest via Lake Michigan Credit Union's max checking...but only on $15k max) so if I truly needed to get cash the same day, I would have access to $15k.

personalfinance,My friend says she always owes $7000 in taxes to her husband each year,"My friend, a married woman who is a non-citizen working in the USA on a visa, says that every year when they files taxes, she owes $6000-7000 to her husband (also a non-citizen on a visa). Her husband does the taxes, with both of them filing jointly as a married couple. She says that she has been paying this amount to him every year for several years now to cover the value of her supposed tax burden. She thought this was normal because she was a non-citizen and so she had to pay more for the taxes. Her husband tells her every year that the $7000 owed is from her and that his taxes are always fine (nothing owed).

Obviously, I thought this sounded insane, so I helped her examine her taxes a bit.

Some stats;

- husband works &amp; lives in NJ, makes about $80,000

- she works in NYC but lives in NJ, makes about $100,000, 1 allowance for Federal and 1 allowance for NY State (0 for NJ state)

I had her pull some recent paystubs, and I checked her employer tax forms. She has all her tax forms set as ""married filing jointly"". 

I helped her run her income and tax numbers through this calculator;

https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator

these are the numbers I use (assuming there have been 12 biweekly pay periods so far this year);

Her:

- $100,000 income
- Federal taxes withheld year to date $4134, $318 per paycheck
- $19,500 planned 401k contribution

Him:

- $80,000
- Federal taxes withheld year to date $3307, $254 per paycheck (estimated numbers)
- $5000 planned 401k contribution (estimated)

- taking standard deduction
- results without tax credit

Results:

- Expected tax withholding $14,704*
- Anticipated tax obligation $20,334**
- Estimated under payment $5,630


So, this tax estimator confirms that something is wrong with the taxes and that when they file, they will owe this much.

However, I am having trouble understanding *who* owes this money. My friend has been under the impression that its entirely her fault. But, I think that this cannot be correct. Because on that page, after you run all these numbers, it says :

&gt; Your Job, Annual Pre-tax Wages: $100,000
&gt; To get your desired refund amount, you will need $548 withheld from each paycheck, $233 more than your current tax withholding.

&gt; Your Spouse's Job, Annual Pre-tax Wages: $80,000
&gt; To get your desired refund amount, you will need $490 withheld from each paycheck, $236 more than your current tax withholding.

So if I re-run the numbers, change her biweekly withholding to $548, and total witholding to $6576 (12*548), the ""taxes owed"" goes away completely. Alternatively, if I enter her original numbers filing singly without her husband, then her ""taxes owed"" goes down to $2800

It seems to me that they *both* owe the $7000 amount in taxes, so really they should each be paying $3500 more each year. Of course, when my friend tells her husband this (who does not understand how taxes work himself), he denies that any of the $7000 could have come from him.

Current Annual Interest Rate : **4.250 %**

Refinance (now) costs: **\~$8,000**

Equity calculation:

House value - What I owe = EquityEquity / House value = % Equity

$354,478 - $328,512 = 25966

$25,966 / $354,478 = 7.325 % percent equity

&amp;#x200B;

**The reason I am considering waiting until 20 percent equity are the following reasons:**

1. I don't know if it is a great idea to refinance now and then refinance again when I reach 20 percent equity
2. Houses get sold like hotcakes out here. Every house I put a bid for was sold within 3 to 5 days. The only way I got this was to bid right away.  I bought the house appraised at $349k in February and it is valued $354k - $369k
3. My location is fairly resistant to price drops, I can anticipate housing values to only go up up up. But of course is a mere speculation.

&amp;#x200B;

**The reasons I am for refinancing now:**

1. Good low rates now. I have the amount already saved up for refinancing. On a separate note, I  have almost a year of mortgage payments saved
2. I can't tell the future. Who knows what will happen, might as well secure a low rate now because my loan rate is high AF.

solar,All the details in my Tesla Solar quote,"I'm at the point in my Tesla Solar quote where I've been given a lot of the details, so I thought I would share them.

I'm located in Maryland, and I placed an order for the 12.24 kW (Large) system without Powerwalls after the new pricing for the 340 watt panels was announced. The proposed layout included 36 panels and information about the equipment. The panels are Q.Peak Duo BLK-G6+ / SC 330-345; they state they come with a 25 year manufacturer's product warranty and 25 year linear performance warranty (85% performance). The inverters are SolarEdge Single Phase with HD-Wave Technology SE3000H-US through SE11400H-US. The product sheet says the inverters have a 12-25 year warranty (I suppose it depends on the model). Tesla provides a 10 year leak warranty.

The interconnect agreement said my system would require 3 inverters, but there were some errors on that form I had to call Tesla to correct so I'm not entirely sure if that is accurate.

Third party financing is provided by either Sunlight Financial or Mosaic. Tesla sets the terms of the financing, so regardless of origin you're given the option of a 240 month $0 down loan at 4.99% APY or a 120 month $0 down loan at 3.99%. Both have terms which let you pay a monthly cost as if you put your 26% Federal tax credit as a down payment, and they expect you to pay 26% within the first 18 months to keep that monthly payment.

In Maryland Tesla is also offering to buy the SREC rights to our system for an upfront discount of $170 per kW ($2080.80 for 12.24 kW). I decided we would sell our SRECs ourselves, and this required a phone call to Tesla to ask them to remove that discount from the order.

The loan term also included an itemized cost for the install:

- 12.24 kW DC Solar Panels $6,580
- Inverter(s) &amp; Balance of System $3,290
- Mounting Hardware $1,175
- Installation, Permitting, and Other Fees $12,455

Hope this is useful.

EDIT: Still no update on the interconnect, but it does appear like they are proposing 3 x SE3800H inverters for a total of 11.4 kW AC. It also says Energy Storage is part of my system, which it is not so maybe they accidentally filled out the system details of my form with a different system that required 3 phase.

EDIT EDIT: it is indeed one 11.4 kW AC inverter. Local county permits took a full 4 weeks but my install is scheduled for the end of this month!",energy

personalfinance,Should I take a student loan?,"I am currently employed full time and I am pursuing a BS.  Because of my job, the tuition is mostly waived and do not have to pay (its a state program).  Because of Covid, I filled out my FAFSA and received the pell grant and the option to take student loans.  I only owe $181 for this semester and can take care of this without loans, however I am being offered a Direct Subsidized Loan.

Here is my question. I owe some money of on a CC that the loan would fully pay off (26.9%) and given the current low interest rates on student loans (and that it is subsidized), could I/should I take the loan, pay off the CC to save interest, and then pay the loan off?

Want to make sure its legal and I'm not overlooking something.

personalfinance,Is my money gone (international wire),"Hi everyone, throw away here with a question about recalling my international bank wire.

Back in April we made a ~3000 dollar wire international wire transfer to make a student loan payment for my wife, to the UK student loan company. We have done this before, and previously this worked. We used the same details/address. However after 2 weeks or so of the payment going through, we reached out where it was discovered that the account number for my wife's loan account was missing one digit, and the funds were still presumably with the intermediate account. The bank sent an updated message with the correct info, but the payment still didnt go through. We were recommend to reach out to the student loan company and the intermediate bank (natwest), which was a complete waste of time as both told us to go through the sending institution (Navy Federal). 

After escalating things at NF they informed us that they could do a recall, which would take 3-5 business days. After 5 business days I once again escalated with NF and talked to someone who sounded like they knew what they were talking about (first time so far). Apparently the 3-5 business day line was a lie, and there is no firm date (if ever) when we will get a response to the recall. When asked whose error this is, as I understand that If I made the error giving the account # I'm fucked, the person gave me a very non-committal oh they probably read it back to you and you must have confirmed, but how do we know that A) they actually did this one the phone, and B) they didn't make a typographical error sending it.

They also informed me that if the intermediate bank doesn't respond to the recall that were basically screwed out of the $$. Is this true? Is there nothing else we can do to get our money back, or does the intermediate bank essentially get a free gift of 3k from us. Overall I feel really frustrated and helpless, any advice would be appreciated.",finance

I requested my broker an indirect rollover of my 401k and ROTH 401k, and I received the two checks.

My understanding is that I have 60 days to deposit the check value into my IRA + 20% which were part of the federal withheld (1099-R) so I don't pay any penalties.

I noticed that my ROTH 401k also had some taxes on the federal income tax withheld -- \~1.5%. Is it mandatory to deposit back the federal tax withheld for my ROTH IRA within 60 days so I don't pay any penalties?

Moreover, I see that there was some state tax withheld too. Am I suppose to deposit this too?

I guess I'm asking so I avoid any headache when I file my taxes next year.

personalfinance,Would you max out 401k for tax year 2019 if you were me?,"Hi all,

I am 26M. I have built up a $20,000 emergency fund sitting in an Ally Savings account that has an interest rate of 1.1% . For the tax year 2019, I maxed out my Roth IRA ($6,000) and contributed approximately $5,000 to my Roth 401k. 

Would it be prudent to do a lump sum contribution of $14,500 from my emergency fund to my 401k to max it out for 2019? A few months ago it was out of the question for me because the deadline was April 15 and my emergency fund was not what it is now. Now that the deadline has been extended to July 15, however, I feel like it's too good an opportunity to pass up. If you were me, would you do it and risk living with a $5,500 safety net while my emergency fund replenishes? I want to take advantage of the current down market. Also, I think Ally's savings rate is fairly low right now, so it doesn't make sense to me to have an excessively large emergency fund. 

Some more information:

My savings rate to my Ally account is $250 a week. This is sustainable and not likely to change anytime soon

My approximate monthly expenses are $2,000-$2,500, so a temporary emergency fund of $5,500 would be 2-3 months of expenses 

I don't anticipate making any large expenses soon (no car repairs, health payments, vacations, etc)

My job and industry are secure. Very low chance of getting laid off anytime soon

This high-market-valuation situation isn't going to change despite all the warning cries of value investors, until and unless the US gov stimulus stops and it begins to unwind/extricate itself from the financial markets &amp; banks. So, my question is, how will that happen and what will The Great Unwinding look like when it does?

• what is the effect on markets when bond/corporate bond-buying by the Fed ceases, and who loses and who benefits (this may involve tracking individual companies to short/buy based on their debt and credit facilities utilization)?  
• what is the effect on markets when windows close on Cares Act related loans and grants, and who loses and who stands to benefit? What do we look for there?  I've read an article that said no one knows what companies will actually be solvent and which will not because that info is currently hidden behind the loans and grants.  
• what is the effect on markets when the window closes on Cares Act related unemployment benefits, and which stocks stand to lose and which stocks stand to benefit (bank/credit stocks lose &amp; defensive Wal-mart style stocks benefit?)?  
• what is the effect on markets if this new stimulus package proceeds, as they suggest it will, in mid to late July?  
• how will The Great Unwinding of the most massive stimulus ever affect inflation and what are the factors that can tip us to inflation or deflation? (This is very relevant to me because investing in some foreign stocks as a hedge against a big inflation move of the USD is a part of my strategy)?   
• what is the true risk of downside so long as the Fed and the US gov has its stimulus hat on? What factors, if they exist, could defeat the US gov's attempts to prop up market values during this time and are they so-called ""tail-risk"", ""black swan"" events like a new SARS-CoV emerging while SARS-CoV2 is still in pandemic mode?

I don't know about anyone else but being on top of these questions seem more relevant to my investment decisions for the rest of the summer &amp; early Fall than the things that value investors typically look at. As far as coronavirus infection factors, I think every investor is looking at those, so I think analyzing the stimulus and how The Great Unwinding might go down is the only thing I feel I haven't gotten a handle on. I think it would be cool if reddit get good at analyzing this aspect of our current market situation.

I just updated our W4 again on June 15 for the 4th time IN 2020 per the IRS instructions.

The only variable that changes each time I run the calculator is the Fed tax withheld per period and ytd, which keeps going up because I am withholding more! 

Has anyone had issues like this? I have double and triple checked our entries to make sure they are the right numbers. I understand that this calculator may not get me to exactly a net $0 tax bill but it’s still significantly off at $8,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I am starting a youtube channel heavily inspired by the great Yannic Kilcher which is focused on machine learning security. My name is Federico and I am an undergraduate researcher in machine learning security at King's College London.

In this video I give an introduction to adversarial samples using the paper by Goodfellow et al titled ""Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Samples"" as a guide.

  
Let me know what you think! :)   


Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=PUNCHe4UhPBHqGSPIk3sgUSCmqZ8MTU5MzYyODg0MUAxNTkzNTQyNDQx&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1412.6572.pdf&amp;v=_0q-zVOn25g&amp;event=video_description)

  
Abstract: 

Several machine learning models,  including neural networks,  consistently mis-classify adversarial examples—inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting.We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks’ vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover,this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. U-ing this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.",technology

We’ve got the cash on hand to pay off one of the stupid high interest rate cards (22%) that we’ve been paying on for almost 6 years now. I guess my direct question is should I pay this card in full or negotiate a lower balance since it’s been open for so long.  I’d love to be rid of it. 

I’m sure they will settle for a lower amount since it’s been open so long with minimum payments only, but will this be counterintuitive and hurt our credit in the long run?",finance

personalfinance,"Son has medical bills, can we open an HSA for 2019 still and deduct from last years Fed and State (NY)?","Some background.

My son is 19 and is an EMT.  He did not go to college, but started working as an EMT about 18 months ago.  A few weeks ago he had a severe chest pain after work, I had to drop him at the ER as I was unable to stay due to COVID.  He had numerous tests, EKG normal, his triponon level was very high and they were suspecting a heart attack.  He was tested twice for COVID (negative), COVID antibodies (Negative), Chest CT, Ultrasound of heart and thighs, no blockages.  Viral panel which came back negative, esophageal ultra sound to check a heart valve, no issue.  Wanted a heart CT, but his heart rate would not drop even with meds.  He had a 102 fever at this point.    He then had an angiogram looking for blockages, nothing was found.  He then tested positive for EBV (same virus causes mono), MRI confirmed myocarditis.  He was able to fight the virus and  was able to come home after 4 days in the hospital.  He cannot do any strenuous activity for 6 months and cannot do his job so he filled out the paperwork for Disability with his employer.

I did not claim him for 2019 taxes as he was not a student  and claimed himself on his tax return.  He is on my wife's health insurance plan as he is allowed til 26.  Although he is on our insurance HDHP, we cannot use our HSA to pay for his medical bills.  (Out of Pocket Max is $5000 for family)  I would like to have him open an HSA and I will give him the money to fund it to pay the bills to save on taxes.  The issue is he is likely not going to make much this year to make it worthwhile to deduct as he only worked 5.5 months and his pay is low.  They extended the deadline to file 2019 taxes until July 15th and this includes IRS/HSA contributions.  Would it be worth it to contribute the individual max $3500 in an HSA and then Amend his returns for 2019 for fed and state (NY)?  I saw online he can do this for Federal, but it said for state to check if it was allowed for each state, but I cannot find that info.

Another question, he is registered to go back to school in the Fall (Paramedic), would he then be considered a student and I could use the funds from my HSA to pay the medical bills as this would have been in 2020?

I am confused.  Thanks to anyone who can provide guidance.

personalfinance,"Will paying off my car loan lower my credit score? And if it does, is that the end of the world?","So, I am a college student and luckily I am interning for the summer. The internship pays pretty well and afterwards, I will have a decent amount of money. I was thinking of using this extra money to pay off my car loan (\~$7.5k).  The loan interest is unfortunately pretty high \~8%. I don't work while going to school and luckily I live with my SO and don't have to pay for housing or living expenses. I have federal student loans (\~21k).

The student loans are low interest rate and aren't going to start accruing interest until after I graduate (all loans under 5%).

I have a couple of credit cards that I use as a cash card essentially; paying off the balance every month. 

Something else to note: I have about 5k in a HYSA that is for emergencies.  

In light of all of this, is it smart to pay off my car? 

I did some cursory googling and read that having a variety of credit is a factor in your credit score. So if I do close out my car loan will it drastically impact my credit score? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is really helpful! Thanks",finance
Bitcoin,"""The Bitcoin Standard"" Question","Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well. 

I've had The Bitcoin standard for a while and I decided to give it a read. I was told it's a MUST READ for beginners who are interested in bitcoin but I've found that some of the concepts and just the overall book is a bit too complex for my understanding. 

Do I need to have a basic understanding of other studies such as.. economics? What about coding or even monetary policy? I feel like I'm missing something that I SHOULD know before I read this book if that makes any sense.",cryptocurrency

**Context -**

The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.5% today, while the NASDAQ gained 1.9%, which had a particularly strong performance by mega-cap and semiconductor stocks. All eleven sectors in the S&amp;P 500 ended in positive territory. TSLA shares rose in anticipation of the companies Q2 delivery results this week. WFC said it expects to reduce its dividend in Q3.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnunchin testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the measures taken to support the economy. There wasn’t much of a reaction in the market.

**News :**

There isn’t any significant news I can find briefing or IB. The VLE industry report for Steel-producers came out at 12AM today. Unfortunately, the link on IB is a dead end. I did find a report from yesterday that Trump was considering enacting tariffs, specifically mentioning aluminum, but steel could also be included. 

**My Impression :**

Between 9:30 AM and 11:00 AM, there was a lot of UOA on MT. There was not one unusually large trade, mostly ranging between 20-30k with two \~70k outliers. The Calls at the % and C/P ratio is pretty bullish. The multiple of ADV also gives hope the call buying may continue. Perhaps someone knows something about new tariffs about to be passed by the Trump Administration. I’ll be watching the change in OI tomorrow morning to decide if I would like to participate in this trade. If it remains high, I will enter.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Interest Rates - help?,"We got pre approved at Credit Union #1 at 2.25% (15 year). My husbands dad told him to shop around. So my husband just applied for pre approval at Credit Union #2 which says 2.5% for 15 year. And now my husband is checking the rates every day at both Credit Unions. Yesterday #2 was higher, today #1 was higher. This is driving me insane because I just want to get approved and move into our new home (we signed a purchase agreement) A couple days ago, both Credit Unions were at 2.25% but Credit Union #1 had a higher APR. 

My husband just keeps checking the rates every day and we need to pick because we are in a contract now. He wants to know why the APR was higher at Credit Union #1 when the interest rate was the same at both places.
