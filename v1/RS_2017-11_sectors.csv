personalfinance,A seemingly too good to be true job offer!!,"A little background information.. Im 29 yo. I work in the wholesale fruit and vegetable industry (importing/procurement/selling). I have 3 young children and a GF of 16 years. I currently earn £34,000 a year working for a big company.  The branch I'm at is run independently and was on the brink of failure right before I started but has since turned the situation around.  The future of my current employers (our particular branch) to me feels uncertain as we operate very differently to our competitors (relaxed management, over staffed and overall lower margins  than other firms) I've IMO opinion only been successful because of how useless my co-workers are which isn't very reassuring to me.  

A competitor (the biggest in our area) with a bad reputation for respecting employees) has been trying to recruit me for some time. He has now stepped up his efforts claiming he needs someone to relieve pressure from him as he is struggling to cope. He is offering 52k a year and 1 day a week less and will also be willing to wait the 3 month cool of required by my current contract, he has also offered to write me up a new contract which stipulates security.  Now this sounds like a no brainer but so many questions remains... I feel like I'm gambling my children's security with this decision....",finance

personalfinance,[CAN] How can I use a line of credit to my advantage?,"I'm 23. Make 45k a year. Have $2,000 in an employer sponsored RRSP. Federal Student loan balance of $1,464 with a rate of prime + 2.5%. Provincial student loan balance of $4,800 at prime. 

The LOC has a $8,000 limit with a balance of nil currently. Rate is prime + 1%. Prime right now is 3.2% I believe.

Should I just let it sit there? Should I transfer enough over to my chequing account so I'm not paying  a monthly fee and then just pay it back over time? Should I use it to contribute to my RRSP? TFSA?

personalfinance,"Student Loan in IBR, but reported as Past Due - Can I fix this?","Hello! 

I have 11 FedLoans totaling about $46,000 (I know I got off kinda cheap didn't I? how sad) I graduated college in December of 2016, and applied for income based repayment in April, was approved in May, and it took effect June 1st, 2017. 

One thing my college didn't do very well was explain loans and do an exit interview, all that jazz. So while yes, I was doing a full time unpaid internship from August 2016 until December 2016, and therefore didn't receive my diploma until December 2016, I dropped below ""full time"" and so my loans came due in March 2017. I had no idea until I logged on to apply for the IBR and noticed they were past due (60 days when I first saw it.) 

When I applied for IBR i inquired about the past due balances, and told them that it was too much. I was unemployed at the time, had no way to pay the past due balances. I was assured it wasn't an issue, approved for IBR with a $0 minimum payment, and my past due balances were put in forbearance as well. 

The accounts show on my credit report as ""Current: paid or paying as agreed"" but with a ""maximum delinquency of 120 days."" 

Obviously with 11 of these accounts total, this has tanked my credit. That is 33 missed payments on my credit report. I want to cry. I can't get approved for a car loan, I can't rent an apartment, I can't do anything. 

Has anyone ever had any luck getting these removed? I attempted to dispute with transunion and all they did was update the account to say ""dispute resolved; reported by grantor"" and then equifax also just updated them to say I was in IBR.

I have almost paid off all of my credit cards and was looking forward to moving out and starting my future and my credit score is crap and it's the biggest source of stress in my life. I can't believe some stupid stupid loans will tank my credit for 7 years. 

Other factors: credit card utilization is at 20% right now so good, 0 derogatory marks, 19 total accounts. Credit age is 4 years, 11 months (nothing much I can do about that) and I have 6 hard inquiries mainly due to student loans. The payment history is by far the worst thing on my report.

personalfinance,I'm 24yo and roughly 80k in debt with no degree. I need a solution before it's too late.,"I need serious advice here. I need to figure out what I'm going to do, but I need some help. So I'll start this post with a summary of my debts. If you need additional details about any of them, just say so (I tried to keep it short). Then I'll summarize my budget, my living situation, and what I think my options are. 

---

This is a summary of my student loans as of ~~July 28, 2017~~ November 2, 2017. I am two months behind on the Perkins account, and I have never made a payment on the Parent PLUS account ~~(roughly $1,700 in interest was capitalized on the PLUS loan on July 31 so I don't know how much I owe or what my payments are)~~. 

Type of Loan| Principal Balance| Interest Rate (* = weighted avg of all loans) | Minimum Monthly Payment
---|---|----|----
Federal Perkins| $4,523.57| 5.000%| $49.93
Direct Stafford | $28,134.64| *4.564%| $0 (REPAYE Plan)
Parent PLUS| $35,129.01 | *7.203%| $421.54
Private Student Loan| $4,252.74| n/a| Still need to set this up

---

I had 3 credit cards back in college and maxed them all out. ~~They were all charged off.~~ The debts were sent to collections, and then finally charged off. I received a notice in the mail last year for one of them, saying something about a litigation department, so I set up 12 monthly payments to pay off the entire balance. I made the final payment in August of this year. So now I only have two cards to pay off:

Credit Card| Balance| Minimum Payment
---|---|----|----
Charge-Off 1| $2,534.66| Still need to set this up
Charge-Off 2| $1,320.81 | Still need to set this up

For both cards, I have the choice to either pay off the entire charge-off balances or pay the settlement amounts. The settlement amount can be satisfied either with a lump sum or with monthly installments. If you need the exact details, just ask (same with the loans).

---

I also owe my university $5,338 for tuition. I owe this money because I failed all my classes one semester by not attending them. I dropped out in my 5th year because I was no longer able to receive federal aid since I didn't meet SAP. Long story short, I had 3.998 GPA, and then I failed a bunch of classes due to depression. This account has been delinquent since May 2016. In order to go back to school, I need to pay this off.

I also owe someone $590 for helping me a couple of years ago with rent and utilities.

---

Here is my budget info:

The income that's listed is how much I earned at my previous job. I worked 40 hours per week doing overnight stock at a grocery store, making $11.00 per hour. The minimum wage where I live is $9.00.

Income/Expense| Monthly Amount
---|---
Income| $1370
Phone| $48
Car Insurance| $92
Gas| $15
Pharmacy| $10
Hygiene| $12

---

I currently live with my parents (since I cannot afford to live anywhere else), and have been since May 2016, which is when I dropped out of college. My budget for most of the past year included a monthly payment of $288.50 for a charged-off credit card, a monthly payment of $108.65 for a loan (finished paying it off in July), and a monthly payment of $304.97 for the Direct Stafford loans (before being put on the REPAYE plan). So I didn't have exactly have money for rent. The only insurance I have is my car insurance, which I pay for. However, I will have to start thinking about buying other insurance for myself. I also don't have any savings. No emergency fund. Nothing. 

The only way I would be able to live anywhere besides home is if I joined the military and lived on base since everything is paid for (right?), and just use my paychecks to pay off my debts. If I stay living at home, I want to pay my share of the bills. My goal though is to pay off all of my debts as quickly as possible while minimizing the damage done to everyone's credit. This means I need to increase my income, decrease my expenses, or both. So my options are either to live at home or join the military, try to get a job that pays well, or get *two* jobs. ~~My decision to join the military would also be because I need to reacquire discipline and also to find a fulfilling job, if I can.~~ I have no passions really and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't have my bachelor's degree, but I was like 30 credits away from getting it before I had to quit school. I am pretty limited as to what jobs I can choose from in this town, which is another reason I've been considering the military. Also, although I continue to make poor decisions, I am actually pretty intelligent. I would score high on the ASVAB, and this would land me a decent paying job in the military, right?

So, all that said, what should I do? Slave away while making nearly minimum wage and stay living at home? Or join the service and still probably slave away with probably similar wages? And how should I be prioritizing my debts?

personalfinance,"Buy now with 10% down, or wait a year for 20%?","Hi PF, this is my first post. My husband and I have begun looking at homes with the intention to move before February 2018, when our rental is up. 3-bedroom homes in the areas we like go from $350-$650K, and we're not comfortable spending more than $400K on a home.

My husband and I currently have 40K for a downpayment, another 5K for closing costs, and 20K in an emergency fund that we don't plan on touching. However, if we continue renting and saving for another year, we can add another 60K to our downpayment, putting us above 20% for a downpayment, and removing LPMI. We're looking at a program where the lender rolls PMI into the loan and you pay a slightly higher interest rate – 3.5% on a 15 year, and 4.25% on a 30 year.

Some other relevant facts:

- 30 &amp; 32 years old
- 170K a year income, both make about the same
- No debt of any kind
- Will likely add 1-2 kids to the home in the next 5 years, and both of us plan to continue working
- Likely to move from this area in 5-8 years, depending on opportunities to advance our careers

The frugal part of me is telling me to wait for 20% and avoiding PMI, but I've seen prices in the area skyrocket year after year. Another part of me worries that the 400K house will be a 450K house in year and that we could be priced out of the area. Another part of me worries we're on the cusp of a bubble. Maybe we're splitting hairs, but we just want to make a wise financial decision.

BlockChain,Starting a crypto-blog… Why shouldn’t I?,"The recent year one’s been hearing a lot about *bitcoin* and *mining*, *blockchain* and *crypto currency*, *ICO* and *tokens*, from early morning till late night... Thus a lot of ordinary people expanded their vocabulary as much as six words! While dollar and euro are eating their hearts out as bitcoin hits growth records, we know almost nothing about other crypto-currencies, despite they are already more than one thousand... 
By the way, recently my vocabulary has been enriched with one more word combination - ""*fiat money*"".  This is not the amount for which you can buy a product of the most famous Italian car manufacturer ... :)))) 

I think I should start this conversation about crypto-currencies from the beginning, with a little digression into the past. 
 The Latin word ""fiat"" is literally translated into English as ""*Let it be so*"" or, if shorter ""*decree, ordinance*.""  Put it bluntly, the money that is issued by the government or the central bank of any country or Federal Reserve System is not tied to the gold standard or any other commodity security – that is what economists call fiat money. It was our favorite gift since  childhood, we simply did not know the correct term for it!  :D  
Of course a few centenarians remember that long time ago these pieces of paper were secured with gold… Then most of the countries of the world decided that *it would be much more practical to have money secured not by gold, but simply by the authority of the state*. Bold decision, isn’t it? ;) 
In this case any government when necessary can turn on a printing press and print as much money as it takes to cover the budget deficit. If ordinary people suffer from an inflationary shock - that's the problem of their own!

It seems strange at a glimpse, but bitcoin is a much more honest monetary unit in this regard!  In the bitcoin protocol, the final value of 21 million coins is clearly specified.  According to the mathematical calculations of its creators, the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. 
 Actually bitcoin would have never appeared without so-called *blockchain technology*. In simple words blockchain is literary but a chain of information blocks. All data about all transactions are linked in it. The blocks are constantly updated and their database distributed among a whole bunch of users. And since the system constantly compares its copies among them, none of its members can secretly scoop the pool because the system will notice forgery at once!  If desired, each user can track transactions in the system, while he can not use this information for a con game. To make a transaction, you must have access to the source code that is registered in the owner's wallet while in the common database only the public key is reflected. 
Once again we’ve got convinced that all ingenious is simple.  But only after it is explained in plain words and for a couple of times ...  :-P 
What else requires a simple explanation is the launch of so-called tokens or ITO (ICO).  But this is a topic of a separate conversation ...

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Madness: How to Simulate Bitcoin Prices in Google Sheets,"Original Medium post can be found here: https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/bitcoin-madness-how-to-simulate-bitcoin-prices-in-google-sheets-c61cb42f26ed

You know the scenario...

[Bitcoin had another huge increase](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/bitcoin-price-hits-6500-to-new-record-high-after-cme-futures-plan.html), but you missed the opportunity. You wanted to get in, but your gut instinct told you no. And rightfully so...no one knows where the price is going to go. What if you invested, and it had another 20% loss? These sort of price movements are common in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.

Seriously...how far can this Bitcoin price really go?

## BITCOIN IS A VOLATILE BEAST

Risk analysis must be a part of every decision you make. 

You are constantly faced with uncertainty, ambiguity, and variability. Variability, in the case of Bitcoin, unlike anything we have ever seen before. And even though we have unprecedented access to information, we can’t accurately predict the future. 

Luckily, we have methods that enable you to see all the possible outcomes of your decisions, and assess the impact of risk.

## WHERE TO START?

Running simulations can prepare us for the worst.

Monte Carlo simulation (also known as the Monte Carlo Method) allows for better decision making under uncertainty.

One of the most common ways to estimate risk is the use of a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). From Investopedia:

&gt; For example, to calculate the value at risk (VaR) of a portfolio, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation that attempts to predict the worst likely loss for a portfolio given a confidence interval over a specified time horizon - we always need to specify two conditions for VaR: confidence and horizon. (For related reading, see The Uses And Limits Of Volatility and Introduction To Value At Risk (VAR) - Part 1 and Part 2.)
&gt; 

A MCS can be run with many different models. Our own process will be:

1. Specify a model (for here, we will use geometric Brownian motion)
2. Get historical daily bitcoin prices
3. Calculate daily returns
4. Name the daily return range
5. Summary statistics
6. Simulate a year
7. Simulate a year many times
8. Multi-year summary statistics
9. Quick analysis of results

## STEP 1. WTF IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION?

The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a statistical method that is used heavily in the forecasting of stock prices. The reason the process is so attractive for this is because of the following:

- The change in price over one period of time is unrelated to the change in price over a disjoint period of time.
- The change in log(price) over any period of time is normally distributed with a distribution depending only on the length of the period.
- Samples of the distribution are continuous, with probability 100%.

The GBM is technically a Markov process, which is a fancy way of saying ""A random process whose future probabilities are determined by its most recent values."" Said another way, past price information is already incorporated and the next price movement is ""conditionally independent"" of past price movements.

Math geeks have a habit of making things infinitely more complicated than they have to be. I will do my best to make this as simple as possible.

The formula for GBM is as follows:

[gBm formula](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/LrTDGmxvAOQeMYgeaYqic/30e9e540b7bc2f18251cb5c5eda180d1/gBm_formula.png)

Where:

- B is the bitcoin price
- m or ""mu"" is the expected return
- s or ""sigma"" is the standard deviation of returns
- t is time
- e or ""epsilon"" is the random variable

This formula can be broken down into two very important terms: ""drift"" and ""shock"".

For each time period, our model assumes the price will ""drift"" up by the expected return. But the drift will be shocked (added or subtracted) by a random shock. The random shock will be the standard deviation ""s"" multiplied by a random number ""e"". This is simply a way of scaling the standard deviation.

## STEP 1A. THE THUNDER GOD ELI5

__The ELI5 version:__ The thunder god Zeus is a great god. A just god. 

But Zeus is subject to wild mood swings. 

Every day Zeus can shoot his magic lightning into the price of Bitcoin, and cause it to go up or down. 

Some days he is in such a good mood, that he shocks the price up by a random amount. On other days, he is in such a poor mood that he shocks the price down for opposing him. 

[Zeus Striking Down the Price](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4RSAalRVews6gmGIQ6qyIS/26485672b8093aa0812da83c41f4d824/Zeus_Striking_Down_the_Price.png)

And thus, we have the essence of GBM: a series of steps with an expected upward drift, where each step is hit with a plus/minus shock (which is a function of the stock's standard deviation).

## STEP 2. HISTORICAL DAILY BITCOIN PRICES

[Copy the raw data scores from coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/). Paste the data into your own spreadsheet. 

For this exercise, your columns will be: Time, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume.

[Columns Setup OHLCV](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/10jP56H9pwOA84aUGkQCI2/a4fc36280df042514b832d7e831aaeea/Columns_Setup_OHLCV.png)

Want to automatically pull in Bitcoin prices? [Use the Spreadstreet Google Sheets Add-in](https://medium.com/spreadstreet/an-easy-way-to-connect-digital-currency-services-to-google-sheets-21f18301f881).

## STEP 3. CALCULATE DAILY RETURNS
Calculate daily returns from the ""Close"" price. in H2 put the formula:

    =LN(C2/B2)

Drag it all the way down to the end of the prices to fill the entire __Returns__ column

[Calculate Daily Returns](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4j6Z64CEO4AQmwIsC6OMAk/e5eeba544f05e36b9d4cc12725c0e1c0/Calculate_Daily_Returns.png)

## STEP 4. NAME THE DAILY RETURNS RANGE

Create a named range from the returns column, called __returns__, to make our life easier. Highlight all the data in column H, i.e. cells H1:H1000, then click on the menu Data &gt; Named ranges… and call the range __returns__:

[Name the range returns](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/31FBUkZCooEiuyUA8GQ8U8/cf055bf7aaaa7fa50ec403617afd19ad/Name_the_range_returns.png)

## STEP 5. SUMMARY STATISTICS

Set up a small summary table with the close, daily volatility, annual volatility, daily drift, annual drift, and mean drift of our population. The formulas are:

In K1, enter:

    =C2

and name it __close__.

In K2, enter:

    =STDEV(returns)

and name it __dailyVolatility__

In K3, enter:

    =dailyVolatility*SQRT(365)

and name it __annualVolatility__

In K4, enter:

    =AVERAGE(returns)

and name it __dailyDrift__

In K5, enter:

    =dailyDrift*365

and name it __annualDrift__

In K6, enter:

    =dailyDrift-0.5*dailyVolatility^2

and name it __meanDrift__

[Create Summary Statistics Table](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/66tFP39GYoouSAekiq8OMW/448ff1811f21a720683de38bd0961b98/Create_Summary_Statistics_Table.png)

## STEP 6. SIMULATE A YEAR

Setup the yearly simulation table with Time, Normdist, Log Return, and Simulated Price

### Time
In J12 put 0, and in J13 put:

    =J12+1

Drag it all the way down to your preferred forecast timeframe. Here I simulated a year (365 days), so I copied down to J377

[Time](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/2vst5P5dCg26qcIgwyiSMO/14637739ef5a52b12bc9fc95f57c0688/Time.png)

### Normdist

Let’s set up the normal distribution curve values.

Google Sheets has a formula NORMDIST which calculates the value of the normal distribution function for a given value, mean and standard deviation. Since we ascribe to the random walk theory, we want to use a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1.

In K13, put the formula:

    =NORMINV(RAND(),0,1)

Drag it all the way down to K377 to fill the whole __Normdist__ column:

[Normdist](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/66S0tGvf0WOoakkM0O24gC/a2112d9debeea813a95848ae17667163/Normdist.png)

### Log Return

To get the percentage of daily stock movement, we will calculate log return.

In L13, put the formula:

    =meanDrift+dailyVolatility*K13

Copy the formula all the way down to L377:

[Log Return](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/3lgtv92L3qCCgM0s6msmOK/5286ea3fb2514a7612241da504ab4b88/Log_Return.png)

### Simulated Price

Now to the real meat. Let's calculate the simulated Bitcoin price.

In M12 put the Close price, and in M13, put:

    =M12*EXP(L13)

Copy the formula all the way down to M377:

[Simulated Price](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/3XlCqDcJ9ussqsWQcgkicm/539b3791f0fede29f6c0b9ccd84d78d7/Simulated_Price.png)

### Forecasted Bitcoin price for one year

Let's see what the pricing data looks like. 

Select from M12 to M377, then Insert - Chart and select line chart:

[Simulated Price for One Year](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/5YzfLXLRks6aiI8oyiwIic/858a6d66affcd7661c53046dcceaf490/Simulated_Price_for_One_Year.png)

We have now successfully completed one simulation. And depending on your results, they could look normal...or downright crazy.

## STEP 7. SIMULATE A YEAR MANY TIMES

We completed one simulation, but we want to run many different trials. 

Create a scenario tab, setup a table to simulate 1,000 different one-year trials. In A3 to A1003, put the numbers 1 through 1000. 

In B3, put the formula:

    =Close*EXP((annualDrift-0.5*annualVolatility^2)+annualVolatility*norminv(rand(),0,1))

Copy the formula down all the way. Name this range ""scores"":

[Simulate Bitcoin Prices for Many Years](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4TbShYFeRy8q0aMOq6Qcuo/5286ea3fb2514a7612241da504ab4b88/Simulate_Bitcoin_Prices_for_Many_Years.png)

## STEP 8. MULTI-YEAR SUMMARY STATISTICS

Set up a small summary table with the mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and range of our new population. The formulas are:

    =AVERAGE(scores)

    =STDEVP(scores)

    =MIN(scores)

    =MAX(scores)

    =E6-E5

[Multiyear Summary Statistics](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/5sZ33tUsFiQIQkWeCg2cWY/37752cda5c3e5e650c96537f55216dd2/Multiyear_Summary_Statistics.png)

## STEP 9. QUICK ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

My results will look different than yours (due to the random nature of NORMDIST and the time you pulled the Bitcoin prices). But let's take a look at the results:

    Mean	$27,147
    Median	$16,097
    St. Dev	$37,243
    Min	    $556
    Max	    $479,586
    Range	$479,029
    	
    3sd	    $1,486
    2sd	    $3,005
    1sd	    $5,850
    Cur	    $16,098
    1sd	    $43,896
    2sd	    $81,998
    3sd	    $190,129
    
**How to read:** We can be 95% certain that the price of Bitcoin will fall between $3,005, and $81,998 in one year.
    
__Wait really? Should I buy?__ No, this is not telling you to buy. This should be one tool of many to help you in your buying and risk decisions.

You know the scenario...

[Bitcoin had another huge increase](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/bitcoin-price-hits-6500-to-new-record-high-after-cme-futures-plan.html), but you missed the opportunity. You wanted to get in, but your gut instinct told you no. And rightfully so...no one knows where the price is going to go. What if you invested, and it had another 20% loss? These sort of price movements are common in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.

Seriously...how far can this Bitcoin price really go?

## BITCOIN IS A VOLATILE BEAST

Risk analysis must be a part of every decision you make. 

You are constantly faced with uncertainty, ambiguity, and variability. Variability, in the case of Bitcoin, unlike anything we have ever seen before. And even though we have unprecedented access to information, we can’t accurately predict the future. 

Luckily, we have methods that enable you to see all the possible outcomes of your decisions, and assess the impact of risk.

## WHERE TO START?

Running simulations can prepare us for the worst.

Monte Carlo simulation (also known as the Monte Carlo Method) allows for better decision making under uncertainty.

One of the most common ways to estimate risk is the use of a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). From Investopedia:

&gt; For example, to calculate the value at risk (VaR) of a portfolio, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation that attempts to predict the worst likely loss for a portfolio given a confidence interval over a specified time horizon - we always need to specify two conditions for VaR: confidence and horizon. (For related reading, see The Uses And Limits Of Volatility and Introduction To Value At Risk (VAR) - Part 1 and Part 2.)
&gt; 

A MCS can be run with many different models. Our own process will be:

1. Specify a model (for here, we will use geometric Brownian motion)
2. Get historical daily bitcoin prices
3. Calculate daily returns
4. Name the daily return range
5. Summary statistics
6. Simulate a year
7. Simulate a year many times
8. Multi-year summary statistics
9. Quick analysis of results

## STEP 1. WTF IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION?

The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a statistical method that is used heavily in the forecasting of stock prices. The reason the process is so attractive for this is because of the following:

- The change in price over one period of time is unrelated to the change in price over a disjoint period of time.
- The change in log(price) over any period of time is normally distributed with a distribution depending only on the length of the period.
- Samples of the distribution are continuous, with probability 100%.

The GBM is technically a Markov process, which is a fancy way of saying ""A random process whose future probabilities are determined by its most recent values."" Said another way, past price information is already incorporated and the next price movement is ""conditionally independent"" of past price movements.

Math geeks have a habit of making things infinitely more complicated than they have to be. I will do my best to make this as simple as possible.

The formula for GBM is as follows:

[gBm formula](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/LrTDGmxvAOQeMYgeaYqic/30e9e540b7bc2f18251cb5c5eda180d1/gBm_formula.png)

Where:

- B is the bitcoin price
- m or ""mu"" is the expected return
- s or ""sigma"" is the standard deviation of returns
- t is time
- e or ""epsilon"" is the random variable

This formula can be broken down into two very important terms: ""drift"" and ""shock"".

For each time period, our model assumes the price will ""drift"" up by the expected return. But the drift will be shocked (added or subtracted) by a random shock. The random shock will be the standard deviation ""s"" multiplied by a random number ""e"". This is simply a way of scaling the standard deviation.

## STEP 1A. THE THUNDER GOD ELI5

__The ELI5 version:__ The thunder god Zeus is a great god. A just god. 

But Zeus is subject to wild mood swings. 

Every day Zeus can shoot his magic lightning into the price of Bitcoin, and cause it to go up or down. 

Some days he is in such a good mood, that he shocks the price up by a random amount. On other days, he is in such a poor mood that he shocks the price down for opposing him. 

[Zeus Striking Down the Price](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4RSAalRVews6gmGIQ6qyIS/26485672b8093aa0812da83c41f4d824/Zeus_Striking_Down_the_Price.png)

And thus, we have the essence of GBM: a series of steps with an expected upward drift, where each step is hit with a plus/minus shock (which is a function of the stock's standard deviation).

## STEP 2. HISTORICAL DAILY BITCOIN PRICES

[Copy the raw data scores from coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/). Paste the data into your own spreadsheet. 

For this exercise, your columns will be: Time, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume.

[Columns Setup OHLCV](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/10jP56H9pwOA84aUGkQCI2/a4fc36280df042514b832d7e831aaeea/Columns_Setup_OHLCV.png)

Want to automatically pull in Bitcoin prices? [Use the Spreadstreet Google Sheets Add-in](https://medium.com/spreadstreet/an-easy-way-to-connect-digital-currency-services-to-google-sheets-21f18301f881).

## STEP 3. CALCULATE DAILY RETURNS
Calculate daily returns from the ""Close"" price. in H2 put the formula:

    =LN(C2/B2)

Drag it all the way down to the end of the prices to fill the entire __Returns__ column

[Calculate Daily Returns](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4j6Z64CEO4AQmwIsC6OMAk/e5eeba544f05e36b9d4cc12725c0e1c0/Calculate_Daily_Returns.png)

## STEP 4. NAME THE DAILY RETURNS RANGE

Create a named range from the returns column, called __returns__, to make our life easier. Highlight all the data in column H, i.e. cells H1:H1000, then click on the menu Data &gt; Named ranges… and call the range __returns__:

[Name the range returns](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/31FBUkZCooEiuyUA8GQ8U8/cf055bf7aaaa7fa50ec403617afd19ad/Name_the_range_returns.png)

## STEP 5. SUMMARY STATISTICS

Set up a small summary table with the close, daily volatility, annual volatility, daily drift, annual drift, and mean drift of our population. The formulas are:

In K1, enter:

    =C2

and name it __close__.

In K2, enter:

    =STDEV(returns)

and name it __dailyVolatility__

In K3, enter:

    =dailyVolatility*SQRT(365)

and name it __annualVolatility__

In K4, enter:

    =AVERAGE(returns)

and name it __dailyDrift__

In K5, enter:

    =dailyDrift*365

and name it __annualDrift__

In K6, enter:

    =dailyDrift-0.5*dailyVolatility^2

and name it __meanDrift__

[Create Summary Statistics Table](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/66tFP39GYoouSAekiq8OMW/448ff1811f21a720683de38bd0961b98/Create_Summary_Statistics_Table.png)

## STEP 6. SIMULATE A YEAR

Setup the yearly simulation table with Time, Normdist, Log Return, and Simulated Price

### Time
In J12 put 0, and in J13 put:

    =J12+1

Drag it all the way down to your preferred forecast timeframe. Here I simulated a year (365 days), so I copied down to J377

[Time](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/2vst5P5dCg26qcIgwyiSMO/14637739ef5a52b12bc9fc95f57c0688/Time.png)

### Normdist

Let’s set up the normal distribution curve values.

Google Sheets has a formula NORMDIST which calculates the value of the normal distribution function for a given value, mean and standard deviation. Since we ascribe to the random walk theory, we want to use a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1.

In K13, put the formula:

    =NORMINV(RAND(),0,1)

Drag it all the way down to K377 to fill the whole __Normdist__ column:

[Normdist](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/66S0tGvf0WOoakkM0O24gC/a2112d9debeea813a95848ae17667163/Normdist.png)

### Log Return

To get the percentage of daily stock movement, we will calculate log return.

In L13, put the formula:

    =meanDrift+dailyVolatility*K13

Copy the formula all the way down to L377:

[Log Return](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/3lgtv92L3qCCgM0s6msmOK/5286ea3fb2514a7612241da504ab4b88/Log_Return.png)

### Simulated Price

Now to the real meat. Let's calculate the simulated Bitcoin price.

In M12 put the Close price, and in M13, put:

    =M12*EXP(L13)

Copy the formula all the way down to M377:

[Simulated Price](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/3XlCqDcJ9ussqsWQcgkicm/539b3791f0fede29f6c0b9ccd84d78d7/Simulated_Price.png)

### Forecasted Bitcoin price for one year

Let's see what the pricing data looks like. 

Select from M12 to M377, then Insert - Chart and select line chart:

[Simulated Price for One Year](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/5YzfLXLRks6aiI8oyiwIic/858a6d66affcd7661c53046dcceaf490/Simulated_Price_for_One_Year.png)

We have now successfully completed one simulation. And depending on your results, they could look normal...or downright crazy.

## STEP 7. SIMULATE A YEAR MANY TIMES

We completed one simulation, but we want to run many different trials. 

Create a scenario tab, setup a table to simulate 1,000 different one-year trials. In A3 to A1003, put the numbers 1 through 1000. 

In B3, put the formula:

    =Close*EXP((annualDrift-0.5*annualVolatility^2)+annualVolatility*norminv(rand(),0,1))

Copy the formula down all the way. Name this range ""scores"":

[Simulate Bitcoin Prices for Many Years](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4TbShYFeRy8q0aMOq6Qcuo/5286ea3fb2514a7612241da504ab4b88/Simulate_Bitcoin_Prices_for_Many_Years.png)

## STEP 8. MULTI-YEAR SUMMARY STATISTICS

Set up a small summary table with the mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and range of our new population. The formulas are:

    =AVERAGE(scores)

    =STDEVP(scores)

    =MIN(scores)

    =MAX(scores)

    =E6-E5

[Multiyear Summary Statistics](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/5sZ33tUsFiQIQkWeCg2cWY/37752cda5c3e5e650c96537f55216dd2/Multiyear_Summary_Statistics.png)

## STEP 9. QUICK ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

My results will look different than yours (due to the random nature of NORMDIST and the time you pulled the Bitcoin prices). But let's take a look at the results:

    Mean	$27,147
    Median	$16,097
    St. Dev	$37,243
    Min	    $556
    Max	    $479,586
    Range	$479,029
    	
    3sd	    $1,486
    2sd	    $3,005
    1sd	    $5,850
    Cur	    $16,098
    1sd	    $43,896
    2sd	    $81,998
    3sd	    $190,129
    
**How to read:** We can be 95% certain that the price of Bitcoin will fall between $3,005, and $81,998 in one year.
    
__Wait really? Should I buy?__ No, this is not telling you to buy. This should be one tool of many to help you in your buying and risk decisions.

Total credit card debt: $31k

Total student loans: $1.5k

Total auto loans: $7.5k

Total household income: $115k

I work for a healthcare system that prioritizes going to our own facilities and encourages that by making a 3 tier plan instead of the usual 2.

If I stay within our own facilities, I have a maximum out of pocket if 2500, and a 1250 co pay. I have an HRA that is currently funded at $1,000. I pay $96 a month for this. The co insurance is 15%.

My husband works for the Feds and has GEHA insurance. It has a $350 deductible and an out of pocket maximum of 6000. The coinsurance is also 15%. It would cost a little under $112 a month to add me on.

The thing is, my tier one only covers my immediate city. If I need care anywhere else my coverage drops to tier 2, which has a $2500 deductible, 5000 out of pocket maximum, and 30% coinsurance. I'm into mountain biking and rock climbing and frequently travel around the state to do those things. My husband and I would also like to get pregnant, and his insurance covers 100 percent of maternity with no deductible. Mine is just standard deductible and co pay coverage. His also has international coverage.

Is this worth the extra cost? It's not much and would likely be pre tax.

My concern is I estimate my income to be right around that amount, and so I'm not sure if it's worth risking signing up for a plan with assistance if I end up being below that amount for next year. I think I would end up having to pay for the entirety of the year's coverage all at once?

On the other side, I could apply for exemption from the tax penalty if I estimate I'm under the poverty line. But again, I could end up being wrong about the amount I make and not end up not being exempt. 

What should I do in this situation? And please correct me if I'm wrong about my understanding of this.",finance
personalfinance,Electric Vehicle Credit Clarification,"I am confused about this passage on [nerdwallet's explanation](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/plug-vehicle-tax-credits-rebates-made-easy/) of the federal electric vehicle tax credit: 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, if you purchase a plug-in electric vehicle with a maximum federal tax credit of $7,500 and your total income tax bill that year is $8,000, you’ll get the full benefit of the $7,500 credit (and owe $500). But if your tax bill is $6,200, you’ll be able to claim only a $6,200 credit. The government won’t send you a check for the remaining $1,300 and you can’t carry it over to the next year.

Let's say I pay $30,000 in federal taxes in 2017. If I buy an electric car in 2018 that qualifies for for the $7,500 tax credit, and I have fully paid my taxes throughout the year, will I receive a tax refund of $7,500? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Junior in college, looking for the most effective way to start making payments on my student loans","Good Afternoon PF,

**Some Background:** I am currently in my junior year working toward a degree in mathematics and computer science (Currently 3.6 GPA if that matters). I've been living on campus since I started here and went from the more expensive dorms to an apartment off campus. My tuition is largely paid for by a combination of scholarship, Pell grant, State grant, and low interest federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. My living situation, however, has been completely paid for by private loans.

**Current Situation:** I am set to drop my lease effective January 2018 as I could no longer, in good faith, take out loans to live here when commuting is a possibility; I will be commuting next semester. Additionally, I just started at a new job that makes me $14/hr + quarterly bonuses as well as working with my dad on some web development/server maintenance for his company (although this is still being figured out so no idea how much I will be earning). I will be working at least 20 hours a week with my main expense being the $204 monthly for the transit pass to take the train to school and subway to work. This will leave leave me with at least a few thousand extra dollars each year that I wish to grow into a combination of savings and loan payments.

**Loans**


Type| Interest Rate Range| Principle Balance
---|---|----
Federal|3.76 - 4.45 | $14,750
Private|7.99 - 9.24 | $31,700

**My Plan:** In the next month or two I'm planning on opening a secured credit card so that I can start building my credit in hopes of refinancing those higher interest private loans down to a better rate; I plan to use this card for things like the transit pass and no pointless expenses. I want to build up an emergency fund within the next ~6 months and just leave it in savings. With the remainder I want to impact these loans in the most effective way that I can which is where I'm just inundated with different information looking for clarification. 

So if anyone out there has advice on how I can start effectively managing this or whether or not this plan will be effective is **Greatly** appreciated.

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Shopping for a mortgage refinance 10 months after initial purchase of primary home,"I have a couple of questions before I start shopping for a refinance.  I am refinancing because of slight increases in my credit score and home values, and slight decreases in interest rates since the beginning of the year when I closed on my home.  From the rate charts I've been looking at it looks like I could save about $150 per month and about $25K over the life of the loan by refinancing, plus pay off a couple credit cards that are running balances.

Question 1:  How do credit pulls affect my credit score when I begin applying for loans?  I am just on the borderline of one category of credit (680-699) and I am concerned that by shopping around to different lenders that it could push me down and lower the rate for which I can qualify.

Question 2:  What are some common fees that I might face when attempting to refinance my current loan within 12 months of acquiring the initial mortgage?  I heard you usually end up paying some sort of fees, but I'm not sure what to look for in my paperwork to be able to anticipate whether this is a factor or not.

personalfinance,"Yeah, it's another ""how much rent can I afford"" question. Looking to move and trying to justify expenses.","I know, these are tedious posts but hearing input from actual people instead of articles and rent calculators helps my thought process more. 

So. I'm 26, work in Portland, OR, but currently commuting from Vancouver, WA every day. The primary reason I'm still doing this is driven by rent as I'm paying *way* less where I am compared to comparable places in Portland.  But, living in WA means I'm getting double-taxed (income in OR, sales in WA) and the 2+ hours in traffic every day is really getting to me. I'm reaching a breaking point in terms of convenience and it's rapidly nearing a point where I need to bite the bullet and just become an Oregonian. 

My take home is right around $2900/month after salary withholdings for transit passes, health/life/disability insurance, and my 401k (about 10% with a 5% company match). I've got roughly $10k in the bank and no debt. My current rent is $845/month. Recurring expenses for car insurance/phone/utilities/etc. are usually around $320/month. Moving to Portland, I'd probably need to up my rent to at least $1200/month to get anyplace that isn't totally run down/is close enough to downtown to significantly reduce my commute. I know the typical advice is ""get roommates"" but I've been living on my own for 3 years now and I honestly can't imagine ever going back to sharing a space; being able to set my own schedule in my own space is hugely important to me, and giving that up would probably be worse than living with the commute time. 

Basically, I'm really starting to feel like getting all that time back in my life, plus being closer to friends in the city, would be worth it. But the rent increase feels like a kick to the stomach. Am I looking at a pipe dream or can I justify this?",finance

personalfinance,FedLoan Servicing seems like it's trying to scam me via direct debit.,"Okay maybe a bit of an overstatement but whatever. I'm grouchy now. 

So my IBR payment is due the 24th of every month. I'm also qualified for the PSLF. Last month I signed up for direct debit, and got an email confirmation that my application went through. The 23rd, I got an email saying ""Your payment is due tomorrow - but no worries! You have direct debit!"" 

I'm paranoid, so the evening of the 24th I open my account and it clearly stated ""October payment due: $0.00. Last payment received October 24th 2017"". I said COOL. THAT WORKED. 

Today I just so happen to be reviewing my bank account. I notice - oh.. there's no fucking student loan payment received or pending. I open my fedloan account and it says I'm 7 days late. I immediately make a manual payment and ring them fuckers up. 

The dude on the phone said that it's looks like on the 24th my bank rejected my direct debit because the account info was wrong (the only saved bank account I have connected to my loan and the same damn one I've made a years worth of payment using AND the one I made a successful payment using today!!). 

I said ""why did I not get any notification or email saying my payment was rejected?!"" **And he said the notification was sent to my paperless inbox on the fedloan website.**

W. T. F. so I get notifications about payments coming due, notifications that my direct debit is about to go through but then deliberately nothing when it ""doesn't work""???? Nothing saying my payment was late or not received?? 

I've never in my life paid any bill late. He said it's not a big deal because it's less than 15 days or whatever, but still. I can't help but think this is shady af. He said to submit it again, but I won't know if it actually went through until after my payment date. Why would my bank ""reject"" a direct debit? It's pnc, and I get notifications for everything. I have several automatic payments. Why would this automatic payment be rejected and not the manual payment using the supposed same exact account info?? 

Anyway sorry for the rant. I'm just very annoyed with fedloan. And myself, I should have reviewed my bank account earlier but the entire reason I sign up for direct debit is so I wouldn't have to check it like a hawk.",finance
personalfinance,"Inheriting money with 2 Kids in College, need strategies to maximize retirement savings and minimize Expected Family Contribution (EFC) with FAFSA and CSS","We will be inheriting some money from my mom. She was a nurse and worked hard for this money, and I am looking for advice so that we make good decisions. We will get about $100,000 in cash from her savings and eventually about $100,000 from our share of the sale of her house. 

We are a So CA couple in late 50s with a sophomore at a private college and a high school senior who will most likely attend a private college starting next year. My husband teaches at a college, and I freelance. 

We would like strategies to maximize this money going toward retirement and minimize it counting against us in financial aid calculations. We did not get much aid from daughter’s college last year, but we did get some (about $10,000).

We pay off our credit card each month and do not owe on a car.  We have a house loan with about $135,000 left on it with interest of 2.875 %. We have 10 years left on a 15-year loan. We need to increase our retirement savings.  

So far my ideas are: 

Maxing the amount my husband’s employer takes out for TIAA retirement, and starting a ROTH for him for this year. Send in a check for $6,500 for ROTH for me. 

Paying down part of our house loan, but I have no idea how much to pay down. It looks like about 5.6 percent of cash assets after some sort of allowance are calculated as part of the EFC by colleges. So it makes sense to pay down the loan so that money is not just sitting there.  What do you think? Any better ideas?

FAFSA and CSS seem to treat things differently and it is all confusing. It looks like the house and existing retirement assets are not calculated in assets, but contributions for the year are counted as income somehow.  Also, retirement money is not counted as income per se, but may have to be listed as received.  

Does it make sense to just pay a large part of the house loan off, or is that stupid because the interest rate is low? Also, would it be better to get the cash part all in one year, or half this year and half the next? Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Question on Line of Credit &amp; Credit cards.,"Hi, I'm Grace and I'm relatively new to Reddit, so I apologise in advance if I am posting something incorrectly. 

I did read the Personal Finance wiki in an attempt to find the answer, but didn't see it. 

Long story short: I have debt, and while working within a very limited budget, I am looking to reduce said debt. 

I have 2 credit cards, and a line of credit. 

I am wondering, when attempting to pay off my debt, what the best way to go about it is. 

Each month I pay the minimum balance on each of the 3 accounts. 

After that, should I be paying down my line of credit (which has the lowest interest rate) and then transferring some of my CC balance back to my line of credit? 
Or should I just pay the credit cards with the highest interest rates first, and then pay my line of credit last since it has the lowest interest rate? 

Also, should I be focusing on clearing the balance of one account at time, or a little from each?

personalfinance,Should I transfer my balance to save on high interest fees?,"Hello PF! I am finally digging deep after 6 years and working on paying off all of this debt I've been carrying around. The amount of interest I am paying to corporations is insane, but I digress and it's ultimately my fault anyways. 

**Background:** In the last month, I was able to pay off two of four credit cards using the Debt Snowball spreadsheet process, which amounted to $5.1K!  This was paid off with my quarterly bonus, taking on extra side work, and ultimately not spending money on stupid shit. 

I've calculated I can pay off my next highest card, which is $5K, by January, following this same formula. BUT my 4th card has a balance of 10K, with a 20% interest rate I am paying a monthly minimum of $271 and I am also hit each month with an avg. of $170 interest payment. I've calculated I can pay off this card by April using said above formula if nothing goes wrong and I can stay on track. I might need a surgery in the new year, so that could put a damper on things because of the deductible. 

**My question is:** in the meantime before I get to paying off this very high 4th card, should I look at a balance transfer or just suck it up? I notice that most have a 5% transfer fee, which is not ideal but looks like with 0% interest, at most I'd pay $500 - so I would save a few $ doing this. 

**What's my best move?** After I pay off this credit card debt... it's on to the 100K student loan with a 7.5% interest rate, as I am ultimately hoping to refinance this or do something else once my CC debt is paid off (that's a new Reddit thread!), because I will be back to excellent credit, according to credit karma's simulator anyway, as everything else is great on my credit, outside of using 73% of my total credit card limit.

As a married guy with a stay at home mom and a child, I was getting 6 federal exemptions every paycheck. This amounted to thousands of extra dollars in our pockets every year that I didn't have as single guy prior to being married.

My wife will be the custodial parent post-divorce, as they will be moving to a different state. So she will be claiming head of household, child tax credits, dependents (most likely).

This compounded with the child support coming out and the payments for other things like daycare etc are going to be rough. Are there any sort of tax breaks I should be aware of for the higher-earner, non-custodial parent, or anything else at all?

Some ways I'm preparing for this income adjustment are by changing health insurance policies (50% the cost) and changing my work hours to nights (an extra 5% gross), and moving in with roommates to pay for cheaper housing for myself.

So I'm in a situation and need some advice on how to go about where to put my money given my financial situation and debt. Here is my predicament..I have (rounding):

1) Credit Card Balance of $9,000 with an interest rate of 14%

2) Credit Card Balance of $7,000 with an interest rate of 12%

3) Auto Loan (unsecured) of $17,000 with an interest rate of 3%

4) $18,000 in cash from selling the car attached to the auto loan above

I took an unsecured loan out ($17k) to get the title for my truck so I could sell it private party and have the title in hand. I sold the truck for $18,000. So now, should I use that $18k to pay back the auto loan which is only 3% interest or should I pay off my credit cards at the higher rates and make payments on that auto loan (keep in mind that car is sold...but they didn't need the title since it was unsecured). Lets also throw the option of opening a 0% interest for 15 months credit card to defer some of the debt.

If it helps...I make roughly $110k a year so I'm not broke by any means but I am making monthly student loan payments, car payments, and rent payments..I mention this because realistically I can put ~$400 a month towards any of these.

personalfinance,Roughly 18K on 7.9% student loan. Pay it off with savings?,"My husband and I have combined our student loans. I am going on a month-long hiatus from work and will not be earning money aside from collecting unemployment. We will have our bills covered from our savings account (this also doubles as our emergency fund).  

Currently, we have $20,118.02 on our savings account. We transfer an additional $1000/month to it. 

After the hiatus, when I come back from work, I'll have a steady job for at least a year at which I earn $1300/ week. 

I pay an extra of $450/wk targeting individual student loans. We pay all other student loans at minimum. 

We have no other loans and debt. 

My question is: Would it be a shitty idea if I were to pay off my biggest and highest interest rate student loan with our savings after my hiatus and steady job begins? It's currently at $18642.07 (7.9%) and I pay it with the $372.10/mo. This is a PLUS loan which is technically under my mom's name but I'm responsible for paying for it. 

We would have an extra $2000ish for savings and an extra $1k-2k from our travel fund. 

If we paid it, I would increase paying off our regular loans weekly from $450 to $550. This would shorten our loan repayment time from 1.3 years to 11ish months.

stocks,My thoughts on Overstock.com and its upcoming ICO,"Overstock $OSTK is about to undergo an **SEC complainant** initial coin offering (ICO) for its token sale (t0). The first and only publicly traded company to do
Currently, the SEC views tokens as securities, by stating, ""Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities"" (https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings).


Recently, the SEC went further and issued a warning, stating “the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.” (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131)

This regulation effectively eliminates institutional money (pension funds, endowments, etc) from participating in ICOs (which may be a good thing). Anyways, Overstock is launching a token called t0 as disclosed in their 8-k filing (10/26/17), stating:

"" On October 24, 2017 Overstock.com, Inc.’s indirect majority-owned subsidiary t0.com, Inc. (“tZERO”) issued a press release **announcing tZERO’s plans for an initial coin offering**, or ICO. As described in the press release, tZERO expects to offer a percentage of tZERO's profits, distributed as a quarterly distribution, to holders of the tokens. ""


CEO Bryne states he expects the presale to begin in mid November until December. The token sale is for accredited investors only and CEO Bryne also expects to raise around $250-$500 million from the sale. The 8-k filing also states that the ""The proceeds from the sale are expected to fund, among other things, scaling tZERO's technology development and regulatory teams in order to maintain its leading edge, and potentially acquiring or establishing a custody and clearing firm to complement tZERO's existing infrastructure""

The token and accompanying blockchain platform is intended to solve settlement issues, where brokers use custodial shares to loan out stock to short sellers, but often loan out more shares than they have in custody (classic reserve banking), which happened to be a critical issue during the GFC. The t0 token and blockchain will issue a receipt for each share loaned out, and long story short the token will be able to disrupt the settlement industry. (according to OSTK CEO Bryne, settlement lending account for at least 75% of Goldman’s revenue. Others point to it being a $2.5 trillion industry).

Okay so where I’m confused is how to value this opportunity. CEO Bryne states they currently have **$120 billion** in inventory, up from $8 billion a few weeks ago. Each token holder (ICO doesn’t launch until mid November) will be entitled to a dividend paid out from the network. If OSTK is presumably a significant (majority) owner of the tokens, the proceeds from this industry should be materially accretive.

personalfinance,Advice on auto loan,"Hey PF. Any advise is appreciated. Sorry for the wall. Wanted to add context. 

Back in early 2013, my new wife and I co-signed on a used car. Interest rate was not great, due to age (20 and 21) and lack of credit history (first loan for both). All was good till financial hardships in mid 2014 caused us to decide voluntarily repossession was the best option (was not). We still owned an older sedan (no a/c) that ran okay. Around this time we moved in with roommates to help lower costs of living. Still being young we did nothing to help improve our situation financially.

Move on to early 2016, we find out my wife is pregnant. From here we decide to move in with her parents across the state to help even more with the bills and assist with the baby. Wife stopped working at this point (could not car pool anymore). Due to this move my commute would be 
going from in-town to 60+ miles one way. 

We decided at this point that we needed to get another car, based on thinking the existing one would not make the commute and no a/c for a pregnant woman in the south is bad. We gave our old sedan to a family member in need and went to carmax (I know). Thinking there was no other option we walked out with a 2012 chevy cruze (16k miles). The loan term was $15,000~ for 72 months at 28%. As of this post it is at $13,800 for 61 months at 28% (52k miles). 

Realizing that we need to get our finances together I started reading this sub and realized how bad I messed up. I tried to get the car refinanced through my employers credit union but that was a no go due to still owning money on the vol. repo. 

Are there any options for me to better this situation? Payments are $421 /m and while I can pay it now, it does not feel good and leaves me scrambling. Credit is 500~ per credit karma and I have no CC debt.",finance

Bitcoin,Very real risk factor for bitcoins future,"People do not understand the risks involved with bitcoins. By all means invest to your hearts desire, but at least accept the level of risk you are bearing. The United States constitution says, 

""The Congress shall have Power To...coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin....""

- ARTICLE I, SECTION 8, CLAUSE 5


What if congress passes a law taxing 10% on all transactions/transfers using bit coins? In the banking act of 1865 congress did just that on all bank notes that were not the standard USD. This forced all the banks/states that had their own currency to conform to a unified national currency and pretty much killed their currencies  overnight. 

Congress can pass a similar law regarding bitcoins instantly without outside approval from any other branches because of the power granted by the constitution.

THIS IS A HUGE RISK!

People believe that the big dogs of capital management firms (JP, Morgan Stanley, Goldman) may start trading bitcoin at a level higher than experminenting and novelty. I don't know if that will or will or not happen. My thoughts is the second it gets even remotely relevant and stable as an actual currency, congress passes a severe bitcoin tax. This would prevent corporations from viably even considering investing a bitcoin fund (unless its black market, which would be much smaller than the potential future ""legal"" market)

A possible reason why congress might pass this ""bit-tax"" because it could mess with demand for US dollars globally, which would hurt us a net debtor nation. Another reason would be to protect the fed from losing any domestic monetary policy control. This is important during times of recessions and it can be used to control the interest/inflation rate. One more reason could be to stop black market trading of currencies. Very bad for funding international terrorism, or you know DPRK's nuclear program (rhetoric congress can easily use).

So why yes there potentially lot of money to potentially be made in the short-run, there Is great risk involved. Long term, i believe the risk to be too great to bear. The risk perception is far lower than I believe is actually involved, especially reading comments on this sub. In the finance industry, if you do not convey the proper level of risk or you guarantee returns to a client, SOMEONE GOES TO JAIL. 


Be cautious and informed.

I'm in my late 20s, with $65,000 in federal student loans with Navient. I make $58k a year in one of the most expensive cities in the US, working two jobs. I'm full time with city government, and I also have a side job (basically just to make student loan payments and save). I'm currently paying off my loans through IBR, my monthly payments are $475/month and should be decreasing slightly at the end of the year. I always pay at least $600 and aim for $800 with the extra amount going to the loan with the highest interest rate (avalanche, of course). 

My loans are as follows:
1-$10812.19, 5.41% interest
2-$11622.67, 6.41% 
3-$10663.63, 5.41%
4-$21347.70, 6.21%
5-$10839.07, 7.21%

Recently, I've been considering re-financing loans 2, 4, and 5 with So-Fi. I have a 750+ credit score and will get decent fixed rates (4%-5%) no matter who I re-finance with. I anticipate signing up for 15 year loans and continuing to put $600-800/month towards loans per month, paying them off early (unbury.me anticipates Sep. 2027, so 10 years at $700/month). 

However, several of my coworkers are on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan, and I've been considering switching over. There's been a lot of talk recently about whether PSLF will remain, if they'll change who is eligible, etc. I know we can't predict the future, but I don't want to switch over with high interest rates, make the minimum payments for 8 more years, and then find out I owe even MORE money than I started with because they're closing it down. 

I anticipate that I'll stay within public service, although I am trying to move to a public university administrator position in the next few years. There is always the potential to switch to the private sector and if I've only been paying the minimums, I'll still own a ton.

personalfinance,Car dealership not refunding what is owed from allstate vehicle service contract that was cancelled shortly after purchasing new vehicle,"First time posting to this sub, but was looking for some information before I storm into the dealership tomorrow morning.


Basically purchased a new car back in May. I was told in order to get financing, I needed to purchase an additional allstate policy being that they claimed I'm not the most qualified borrower. The interest rate I was offered was close to 8% which I thought was bullshit but by financing the car there was an additional rebate I qualified for which was $750. I had the money to purchase the car outright with cash but I also was expecting a much lower interest rate with a FICO score being close to 800. I ended asking if the service contract would be fully refundable if canceled early and they said I would receive a prorated amount for the portion of the term I didn't use. So I figured even if I held on to the loan for a month or 2 I would still be ahead of the 750. 


So a few days after getting the car I called allstate to be sure the contract was refundable, and they said if I cancelled within 30 days I would be refunded the total cost. So I figured I would pay off the loan before the 30 days so I ended up only having a minor amount of interest to pay and most of the $750 ended up being savings.


I paid off the car in about 21 days, received documentation from the finance company saying the loan was paid off and went to the dealership to have the contract cancelled. They said they cancelled it and I should expect a check within 6-8 weeks. Well fast forward 6 months and I finally receive the check after basically putting the dealership number as a speed dial on my phone because I was calling them so much.


The original service contract cost me $2,895.00 plus tax. I calculated the tax rate they used because it wasn't listed on the finance papers and that rate was 8.865268%. So the cost of the service contract after taxes should have been $3,151.65, which is the amount I expected to be on the check.


So here is my problem, the check is for $2000.00.


I called the dealership once I got the check and saw the issue. The manager informed me the finance guy wasn't in and he would be in first thing in the morning. He explained he thinks maybe I was only refunded the dealerships portion of the contract and allstate still had to refund their portion but said I should speak with the finance manager about it tomorrow. Being that I know this guy is very heard to get a hold of I found out he comes in at 9am tomorrow and told the manager to leave a note for the finance guy that I would be there in the morning shortly after 9am.


After that call I called allstate to try to get specifics about dollar amounts they get and the dealer gets because my refund wasn't the amount I expected and they transferred me to the correct department which was closed for the day. That department opens at 8am tomorrow morning so I will probably call them tomorrow morning to see what they say before I go meet with the finance manager at the dealership.


I was wondering if there was anything I should be ready for during the meeting tomorrow? Should I be ready to get a lawyer involved? Is it even worth getting a lawyer involved over $1150?


Update: After meeting with the dealership today they admitted there was a problem with the check. They first told me the tax isn't refundable which I double checked with the state office of taxation and finance and they said was correct. As for the remaining $895, they said there is usually a cancellation fee for the contract which should be around $75 maybe more, maybe less.  They said they will cut a new check for me next week and was told by the finance manager that he will try to negotiate the whole $895 for me and have the cancellation fee be waived.

Looking through my contracts again, I don't see any mention of a cancellation fee. If they withhold the cancellation fee can I fight for it by claiming there is no mention of a cancellation fee on the service contract in anything I signed",finance

Recently Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (GRAW) had an update that ruined playing for many pvp fans. They have took away the thermal vision and made it only accessible to drones. The reason this is an issue is because the over the shoulder camera sucks in foliage and makes it impossible to see danger unless it’s already too late. I believe that if they were going to take it away they could have at least left it for the sniper class. They need it most and use range to fight why not make sense? Is that asking too much for a game designer to use common sense? WTF Ubisoft?,technology

personalfinance,Do my parents have a harder time getting a loan while my loans are in repayment?,"My mom cosigned for my student loans as well as my car loan, which I expect to be in repayment for about 6-7 years. Does this mean that she'd likely get a higher interest rate if she needed a loan for a house or car in that time?

personalfinance,"Just financed a car at 10.5%. My FICO score is around 750, but I've only had about 2 years' credit history. Is this normal?","A couple times before, I've saved up the cash and bought cars off of Craigslist. This week I bit the bullet and went to a dealership for a much more reliable vehicle. When I signed for financing, the best rate I could get was 10.5%. This seems outrageous. I want to know if this is normal given my credit history:

My FICO score sits around 750. I've had a credit card for almost 2 years, with all payments on time. Its balance has spiked almost to the $2000 limit once a couple months ago, but I've taken care of it and it's back under $100 as usual. Otherwise, I took out a total of $7500 in federal student loans for fall 2016 and spring 2017, but having just graduated I'm still in the grace period for these and haven't had any scheduled payments. I'm renting an apartment, but would like to buy a house someday.

I have so many questions. Is it normal to have this high of interest given my credit history? If not, what can I even do about it at this point? How soon can I refinance to a rate that seems sane? 

What about payment strategies? Is it wise to pay it off as soon as possible? I hear that paying the minimum each month will help my credit, but I would really like to not throw away money on interest-- especially since it's the biggest interest rate I've ever seen, on the biggest balance on my name.

EDIT: got it. Definitely was the wrong move to not walk out when I saw that figure. I'm contacting credit unions tomorrow. I'd definitely like to know some good resources on haggling with car dealers; I didn't even see any opportunity to negotiate.",finance

I looked online about the max you can earn before you have to pay taxes, one source said something around $6000 and I found another saying around $10000 (idk if one was for minors and the other is for adults or what).

And if I won't owe anything do I still have to have the taxes withdrawn from my paychecks?",finance

expenses:
Rent 500

Insurance: free (parents company pays the premiums, have another year here).

Food 400 ish (including entertainment events with friends)

Miscellaneous: roughly 300, incl gas/car insurance/etc.

 Basically, this leaves me with a grand a month in extra take home pay.  I'm currently debt free and have built up 2k in savings and $2k or so in checking.  My intention for the remainder of this year is to lock in living comfortably on this rough budget and build up to about 7k in on-hand savings, under the assumption that I probably need to buy a new(er) car in the next year or two when this one dies.  I want to do this now before I have to go on federal insurance and my $1k cushion gets eaten by those premiums.

My real need for input is what to do for the next two years: I basically get a $10k raise/yr of which I want to point at least 90% of at savings of some form or another.  I could basically max my TSP from that point forward but I don't know if that's the best option I have for retirement savings.

personalfinance,Update: it was not a Craigslist scam! BUT...,"But holy hell it was NOT worth the effort. 

I [posted recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/75ck84/craigslist_and_money_orders_i_dont_think_its_a/?st=J9JD4DYY&amp;sh=2d18f52e) about a sweet older lady who wanted to pay by money orderfor a decorative thing I was selling on Craigslist, and have it shipped to her. I followed my gut and sold her the item for the asking price plus 15$ for shipping. She followed my instructions and sent me a postal money order for exactly 50$. In the end, it was all good and it was not a scam. 

But... A few hiccups along the way: 

1) I spent more time than I should have researching postage/ground rates, and also sourcing the right-sized box, since it’s kind of a clunky item, just big enough to get into the 20$ range for any kind of shipping - when something costs almost as much to ship as it’s worth... anyway, it took me at least a week to get the damn thing boxed and weighed. She phoned to get an update on our plan. 

2) I don’t get mail anymore, so the MO sat in my mailbox for half a week before I realized it was there. She phoned to ask if I had received it. 

3) then I came down with pneumonia, and I spent a good 5 days in bed and totally lost my voice. She phoned to ask if I had made any progress and I totally could not answer her call (she’s working with a landline here guys, no texting/emailing). 

4) once the antibiotics kicked in, I dragged my ass to the post office (my favorite place) to cash the MO. They refused because the MO was addressed to a name that I go by, but is not my legal Christian name. Like, if my name were Harcourt St. John Pennywise, and I go by Jack. The MO was made out to Jack. The PO clerk and her manager decided they needed an official document showing “Jack Pennywise” at my address, but because I don’t do mail, and all that official stuff is filed under my legal name... I returned home and was able to find an invoice from a vet’s bill that Jack paid. I limped back to the PO; this time the manager was at the register and she didn’t blink an eye at the name discrepancy and cashed it without question. *Grrr.* 

5) at the fedex store, I paid for the package directly from the cash from the MO, but something was wrong with the till and it literally took them 10 minutes to find the three dollars in change. They were very apologetic but every time someone said “I’m so sorry for the delay”  I had to squeak “that’s ok, no worries” in my sad hoarse voice. 

5) I called my father and asked him to call the Buyer, and explain why he was calling and why everything had taken so long, the package was on it’s way, and to give her the tracking number of the package. I thought I was done. 

6) She phoned me a day later to say she’d received it and it was so beautiful, she was so grateful, and she was so sorry I was so sick, and was I feeling better, be sure to drink some honey and lemon water and get lots of rest... she was really sweet but *Lady, I gotta get off the phone!*

I am in my early 30s. I own a rental property with 2 units. The current mortgage balance is $192,000 at 4.75% interest rates. I want to get some inputs to see if a refinance would be worth it.  
Below are the information related to loans and the refinance. 

Current Mortgage information: 
Balance: $190,000
Interest rate: 4.75%
Monthly payment:1,260 ($495 in principal &amp; 765 in interest) 
Terms: 30 years mortgage at 23 years now.
estimated payoff date: Feb 2037
Remaining interests:$102,176.96

Refinance terms:
Mortgage: $190,000
Rate: 3.75% commercial rate since I don't live in the unit.
Monthly Payment: 1,382. ($787 in principal &amp; 594 in interest) 
One time refinance fee: $2,500 
estimated payoff date: Nov 2032
Interest would be paid: $58,710

Based on the above numbers, I believe I would save about $170 ($787-$495-122) a month due to a higher deduction of principle each month and over $43,000 in interests over the life of the loan. The $2,500 refinance fees would breakeven in about 14months.
Should I proceed with the refinance?

Thanks,",finance

btc,Random uneducated meditations on the future of government taxation &amp; regulation in a crypto world.,"I am woefully unknowledgeable about this, but I think it is of utmost importance when considering the efficacy and acceptance of crypto by governments, long-term.

&amp;nbsp;

One idea I've heard was taxation of transfers from fiat to crypto, or vice versa, as well as crypto to crypto.  This seems largely unrealistic to me, because I think it would incentivize hodling, and restrict flow of capital, ultimately hurting the market.  Perhaps I misunderstand the functional aspects of this plan.

&amp;nbsp;

Increased sales tax, and similar flat taxes have also been mentioned in passing, but I think the complete abolishment of any progressive taxation would be ultimately damaging to the economy, and further starve the middle class, increasing disparity.  This doesn't seem sustainable, but maybe someone could explain why it would be?

&amp;nbsp;

The only conclusion I could come to atm was the concept of licensing for banks/exchanges, and taxation not on crypto/crypto trades or fiat/crypto or crypto/fiat trades, but rather on any deposit.  While crypto can be held outside the bank, it would force banks/exchanges to function competitively with peer-2-peer trades and simple crypto wallets.  The biggest issue with banking, as it functions today, is how it seems to be almost a necessity.  Decentralized coins disqualify this necessity, which would force competition instead.  Taxing withdrawals would be a mistake, causing people to avoid spending, ultimately hurting the economy.  Taxing deposits wouldn't have this issue.  Or maybe I am way off base here, and someone can point out where I screwed up.  Can peer-2-peer be easily differentiated from exchange trades?  What kind of benefits would a bank/exchange provide? (eg. trade volume, interest rate, etc.)

I know some people just straight up don't like the idea of regulation or government involvement at all, but I am trying to consider all the angles here.  If anyone has some insight into this, it'd be greatly appreciated. :)",cryptocurrency

I ran out to kick a table for cover, and ""died"" as the animation for the kick began. Although, I didn't die... I was stuck crouched behind the table, but I was invincible! I was still able to move a little and shoot, but I couldn't stand back up. So, I went and did the same thing again but didn't crouch after kicking the table... BANG I was able to move freely, and continue on the rest of the mission without directly taking damage. I basically led tanks into battle with my bayonet for the remainder of the mission. Also although you are invincible vehicles are not and if they explode, you fail a timed objective, or commit friendly fire will revert you to the last checkpoint you reached. I don't mean the checkpoint you reached prior to the glitch I mean the one closest to where you were in the level. That's not all!!! You will still be invincible upon respawning! The only downside to this glitch is the audio fades out once you ""die"" so you will have to push on with no sound. I thought this was pretty neat especially because it was freaking hysterical standing in a trench full of nazis trying to melee you. I don't know if my circumstances were perfect, but I was able to do it twice in a row so if you choose to do try it best of luck! Oh and you still get achievements after completing the mission, it's pretty win-win.",technology

personalfinance,I love my house. Is it possible to go from renting it to owning it? How?,"Right now I live in a house that I absolutely love. It's gorgeous, and sits on a beautiful plot of land in one of the few undeveloped bubbles in my rapidly developing area. It has a combination of being incredibly accessible to work, school, and the downtowns of a handful of nearby cities, by car and public transit, while feeling like a private retreat in the woods. I could honestly see myself living here for the rest of my life, it's my ideal house in my ideal location.

It's currently rented to me by a property management company on behalf of some person who owns it - I've never met them, but their name is on the lease. The rent is lower than average for the area, probably in part because it's technically in an unincorporated area between two towns and there's no municipal water, sewage or trash, so it uses a septic tank, well water and private trash collection. The house value as far as Zillow estimates is also lower than average for the area, and it was foreclosed on a few years ago. For the value the house is estimated to be, even a fifteen year mortgage with a high-ish interest rate would have lower monthly payments than rent is right now by almost half.

I recently learned that there's going to be some developments nearby that are almost certainly going to raise the value of the property, and the entire area is growing really fast. I feel pretty certain that within a couple years, either A. the rental company is going to charge higher rent, or B. the entire undeveloped woodsy bubble that my house and a few other houses are in is all going to get bought up by some development company and turned into a suburb full of half a million dollar new houses. Either way, I'm throwing rent money into a hole or getting kicked out of the house I love. I want to own the house I'm living in.

I've never heard of anyone buying the house that they're renting - does that happen? Where would I even start, with the rental company or the property owner or a bank or something? How could I possibly convince them that selling the house that isn't currently for sale and poised to be even more valuable soon is a good idea? Is this a total pipe dream that I should give up on?

technology,The reply from my state Senator on Net Neutrality. My letter to him was ~5 weeks ago.,"Thank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) regulation of Internet services.  Hearing from you helps me better represent Kentucky in the United States Senate.

On February 26, 2015, the FCC approved an order that permitted it to regulate Internet service providers like public utilities under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, allowing tighter controls over broadband and mobile providers.  Additionally, the order prevented the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from fully exerting its statutorily established authority over the conduct of Internet service providers who engage in anticompetitive behavior, like limiting or outright blocking access to particular websites or services of a competitor.

For me, the FCC’s order brought upon great concern that this action would hinder broadband deployment throughout the nation, especially in Kentucky’s rural areas.  Unfortunately, that is precisely what has happened after its implementation.  Broadband investment across the country has steadily declined, resulting in less consumer choice and stifling innovation.

Fortunately, the FCC under its new chairman, Ajit Pai, recognizes the role the FCC should play in removing barriers that suppress advances in this vibrant industry.  The expansion of the Internet has been made possible in large part by a limited regulatory burden.  For this reason, I was pleased to hear that on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted to revisit the 2015 order and is committed to considering the public’s comments in crafting a new rule.

Please know, I will continue to support policies that promote an open and accessible Internet for all Americans.  I wholeheartedly believe that this may only be accomplished through a light regulatory touch.  After all, many of the incredible technological achievements we rely on today were created thanks to a lightly regulated Internet.  Rest assured, I will keep your thoughts foremost in mind as Congress continues to debate policies impacting the Internet.",technology
personalfinance,Considering refinancing my home to a 15 year mortgage with a cash out to pay off some high interest credit cards.,"I have about $11,000 from being seriously underemployed for a long time. I now have a new job that increased our pay to 341% of what it was this past year. So now our focus is to get rid of our debt. We are considering refinancing to a 15-year mortgage with a cash-out to pay of our credit cards which are mostly around 24% APR.

Another option would be to just get a home equity loan to pay of that debt, then pay the loan off as quickly as possible. I think 6 months should be doable to pay it off. I currently have around $150,000 in equity in the home.

Or I can just pay it off normally as fast as possible.

I'm leaning towards the 15-year with cash out, but I think my current credit score (650-ish) may not be great for the interest rate. But paying off my credit cards should help that.

Just looking for some direction as this is all pretty new to me.

Of course, these are taxed heavily.  All said and done, I have a lump sum of about $7,000 to work with.  Is that considered a windfall? :/

I pay my share of rent this week, which will eat about $1200.  I'm also moving in a couple weeks, but thankfully I paid the first month there already (blessing in disguise), so no more housing costs until January 1.

I paid my credit card bills (~$200 between the three) just before losing my job, so I'm good until mid December.  I was on an income based repayment plan with non-profit/public service forgiveness for my consolidate student loans through FedLoan.  That $225 is due next week.

Other budgeted expenses include auto insurance at $170 in a couple weeks, upcoming registrations in January for about $200 total (car and bike), and ~$50 cell phone bill at the beginning of each month.  I live with my girlfriend and her daughter in kindergarten, and we share rent, utilities, and food expenses.

I guess I'm just overwhelmed.  I will be filing for unemployment, need to apply to continue health insurance coverage since that went away with the discharge, and maybe try to get some assistance for food with EBT?  Are there any other temporary measures to look into while I look for another job?

I hope I chose the correct flair.",finance
personalfinance,Signed Car Lease and Now Dealer Wants to me to Sign New Papers,"I signed a lease on 10/30 for a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Then yesterday I got a call from the finance guy at the dealership saying he was Fedexing me now documents to sign as something was printed on the wrong line. When I received the new documents I compared them side by side to my copy of the lease I signed the other day and it appears they raised the price of the car and the residual $1500. My payments are staying the same but my lease buyout number is the residual so it would cost me $1500 more to buy the Jeep at the end of the lease if we really like it. 

What should I do? I don't see any benefit to me signing the documents so I'm tempted to say no (and I'm irritated that he said something was on the wrong line but that appears to be a lie), but I'm hesitant as I don't know if they could make my turn-in process at the end of the lease hell if I fight them on this or if they will mess with the check they are supposed to send me for $27k for the car that I traded in.",finance
personalfinance,"I have a $7,000 repair on a car I owe $12,000 on and is worth $8,000 before the repair. My credit is terrible. What can I do?","So currently, my credit isn't in the best spot (around 577), and I have a 2008 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT that I purchased in August 2016. I currently owe around $12,000 on the truck, and the other day it started making a grinding noise. After some back and forth, turns out there was an oil leak and there is now scouring in the engine, which means the mechanic is recommending scrapping the engine and replacing it, about a $7,000 cost.

I have about 2 months before I NEED need a car/this car back, and I have about $3,500 saved up.

I think my only options are to either 

A) trade it in for incredibly low (all quotes/offers have been in the $4K range at max), and take the ~$8000 hit in negative equity, and get a brand new car (most banks will only approve negative equity with a loan on a 2017/2018 vehicle), and make payments on it... however with my credit situation, my interest rate/monthly payment would be through the roof, around $650 a month. So in this scenario, I would take 2 months to pay off bills using the $3,500, and try to save as much as I could for a down payment while still working towards helping my credit score.

B) Cash out my 401K to pay for the repairs. In this scenario, it'd take about 2 months to get my check for the 401K. I have about $9,000 in there (just started 2 years ago and going slow on it), so I would need to take out the full amount to cover taxes/penalties, and then include that with the $3,500 I have saved to cover the full payment. The plus to this is that I continue making my $300/month payments, but I wipe out my 401K completely. I DID just switch jobs though, and I'm only 25, so hopefully it wouldn't hurt me too much in the long run.

Can anyone think of any other options I have, or let me know of anything I might be missing, especially in the 401K Cashout scenario? The most important thing to me right now is keeping my monthly costs low, as I need to continue paying student loans, so a +$350/month would hurt me a lot more than losing $7,000 up front, but I'm terrible with personal finance, so I might be overlooking something.

**EDIT**
Sounds like the best option right now is to shop around (doing that this Saturday after I get images of the damage), see what other shops will charge to replace, and then probably take the 2 months to use my savings to pay off my debt, and then make a decision then. I'll probably be checking back in - definitely not cashing out my 401K. Thanks for the advice everyone!",finance

personalfinance,(US)Girlfriend Widow 2 kids and $13K of debt,"I am in the process of trying to help my girlfriend get a hold of her finances as she has recently confided in me of the amount of debt that has built up over the past few years since her husband passed away. Being in the UK I don't know of ways and means to consolidate debt easily in the US.

So approximately $13,500 over 5 different cards (Store cards, paypal and one bank credit card). She is getting income currently due to the kids being young (Social security? - Brit sorry) but the interest rates are killing her paying it off. All of them are at 25% meaning that the interest per month is approximately $280 which is manageable however due to that it will take years to pay it off and really I want her to be saving that instead for her/the boys futures and education.

From looking into it she has asked her bank for a consolidation loan which was turned down and was offered a $1000 0% credit card which we looked into as a punt to help.

From my point of view I partially want to suggest to try and put it as a loan against the house they are in (Fully owned due to payout a few years earlier) however she is hesitant to do this because this house is the center of their life and there is nowhere else they can fall back on. (I have heard the repossessions and people being turfed out seems to happen more in the US than the UK).

Any suggestions due to the fact that the debt consolidation loan was turned down?

Bitcoin,Making Bitcoin Mainstream,"Everyone who has a stake in bitcoin has an active incentive in seeing the currency becoming as widely adopted and accepted as possible and this is something we should all be working towards. 

The next big jump for bitcoin requires your average Joe to see bitcoin as the safe, natural digital currency with clear value. The more people realise its use, the more demand for coins, the higher the price, particularly given the restricted supply. 

From my perspective, there are currently three big obstacles that are stopping the 'bitcoin singularity'. I am a medical student, but I extensively studied marketing, and I have some proposals about how to shift these obstacles. I would be interested in hearing what people here think.

**Obstacle 1:** High transaction costs. You want to buy bitcoin? It will cost you exchange fees. You want to transfer bitcoins? It will cost you incentive fees. You want to store bitcoin in the most secure way? It will cost you hardware expenses. To your average outsider it seems like you are losing money in fees get into bitcoin. Say you spend less than 500 dollars on bitcoin, that becomes a substantial chunk of your investment that a rise in value will not offset for months (or weeks by current surge, which likely won't last).

**Solution 1:** Someone needs to make a really simple infographic that can be circulated that does the following

*A) Compares SIDE-BY-SIDE the fees associated with running a card/bank account. Bank fees, card fees, withdrawal fees, and brokerage fees are all comparable expenses that people have just accepted. I honestly think people do not equate the two in their mind and this kind of information layout would mitigate the burdensome appearance of bitcoin. 

*B) Explains clearly why transaction costs are likely to go down in the future. I don't know if this is actually true. Presumably there will always be miners verifying blocks, and it seems like those algorithms are getting harder... Will transaction costs reduce? 

*C) At least demonstrates how to optimise the purchase of bitcoins to reduce transaction burden. Coinbase, for example, has a flat 'convenience' fee for transactions dependent on brackets. I think it would be simple to explain how that can work. 

**Obstacle 2 High technical knowledge:** Again this is an information communication problem. People are nervous/ignorant of bitcoin because they don't understand blockchain technology, or they don't understand why bitcoin specifically is more valuable than its competitors, they are worried by things like a hard fork if they research it, and/or they do not understand how to securely store bitcoin. I am aware ALL of this information is out there. As someone who went through the steep learning curve a while back, and has recently seen family members going through this curve, it really seems like nothing has changed in 3+ years. This information is poorly centralised - scattered out in chunks between nervous YouTube videos with presenters who simultaneously advertise things like bitconnect, or are pitching to a college-level/are swept up in the niche. 

**Solution 2:** We need a dummies guide to BitCoin. And it needs to be an actual dummies guide. If you had to explain Bitcoin to a 5 year old how would you do it? We need that to become Bitcoin's mainstream image. 

**Obstacle 3: High Volatility:** This is, I think, the biggest APPARENT problem, and both the least able to be solved by individuals. I have really been thinking and researching about this over the past few weeks. We often talk about one value of bitcoin being the ability to secure funds beyond the hands of incompetent/aggressive governments who install things like Capital Controls (in Greece) or a Bank Tax (Cyprus) or cause hyperinflation (Venezuela, Zimbabwe) or negative interest rates (Japan). Bitcoin is an obvious solution as a decentralised currency. But why would someone trust their life savings with it if it could just evaporate overnight. 

**And this is the thing. It won't JUST evaporate.** I think this is really the message that needs to be communicated. That Bitcoin has REAL value. It is hard, obviously, to quantify that value numerically. But we need a list of very simple concepts of bitcoin explained to 'the public'. Like the fact that Bitcoin is ANONYMOUS (to a large extent) and so it will always at least be appealing for people avoiding regulation (I honestly see this is one of the cornerstones of Bitcoin's value). The overall trend is up. That Bitcoin is yet to realise its true potential. That crashes HAPPEN but become less frequent the MORE people are involved.  That Bitcoin is a 'brand' now which people see as the face of cryptocurrency. That there are alternatives. 

**So what can we do about it?** - Basically, the Bitcoin community needs a solution to the average Joes who are recently asking questions. Of course, there has been huge media coverage because of the recent rush and people are looking into it. We need to convert those curious people into CUSTOMERS! So how do we do this? 

And this is the discussion I'd be interested to have!

TL;DR - We all have an incentive to make bitcoin MORE mainstream and in HIGHER demand. Current resources do not explain things well. Or if they exist are not centralised. How do we fix this?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Banking with Simple - a not so simple relationship story,"I've recently become quite unhappy in my experience with Simple. 

I started banking with Wells Fargo in 2004 as a teenager, but I eventually got fed up with them as time went on. I found out about the beta testing for Simple in 2013 and was accepted to participate.

At first blush, I adored Simple. Their UX on the app was (and probably still is) leaps ahead other banking institutions. The customer service was amazing. The text feature in the app; getting a real human in the U.S. (Portland), their friendly disposition, I loved them. It's incredibly telling of how poor other businesses implement customer service practices after getting a taste of this. I've never had better service with a business like I have with Simple. However, I wasn't ready to fully commit to banking with only Simple, so I kept them as a 2nd bank account. 

My distain for Wells grew larger over time and eventually led me to closing my accounts with them in February of 2016. Now I was completely hitched with Simple. 

The transition started off seamless. I transferred over my money from Wells, and moved my direct deposit to Simple. I was so happy and only spoke of their praise when they came up in conversation. 

The last couple of months have started to test my patience though... 

My debit card (mailed to me in December of 2016) has started to wear down. It wasn't a big issue at first. Some merchants offered the chip insert or have Apple Pay so I just used those. Maybe a couple swipes and eventually the card took. It didn't bother me too often, though the process was a gamble on which machine at the various merchants. 

A few months later and now the card hardly ever swipes. It seems like an easy fix... just get the card replaced, right?

Not so fast.

I've talked to Simple over the phone multiple times about getting a new card. However, their policy for this is beyond illogical. In order for a new card to be sent, they have to disable your current card. For 'security purposes'. I asked them how the new card is activated. Does it come activated in the mail? Can it used right out of the envelope? They said no, you have to call them over the phone to begin using it. 

This made my brain hurt. It makes no sense to me and I fail to see how this protects a customer. I asked them if the card cannot be used until its activated over the phone, then why does the current card I have need to be disabled? 

The only answer they could provide was that their parent company doesn't offer this ability. 

It puts me in bind since I don't use cash. My bills are all electronic. I use Uber daily to commute to work and elsewhere. Disabling my card until a new one arrives just isn't feasible for me right now.
 
When I banked with Wells Fargo I remember getting the option to have a 'temporary debit card' if I needed one during an intermittent time when a new debit card was being mailed to me. I don't see why having access to my money has to be this difficult with Simple. It doesn't make sense.

On top of all this... today Simple is having difficulty with their systems and cards are being declined with no ETA on when this will be fixed. 


I'm just frustrated and wondering if anyone else has left or become unsatisfied with Simple as well? Might be looking to get with a credit union instead.",finance

Ripple,Why I'm as bullish as ever and a few critiques,"It's been a bit of a rocky month over here. There was the controversy surrounding Swell last month, and as average, XRP investors, we weren't in attendence and we won't know how successful or not this conference will turn out to be in terms of signing up new customers. Time will tell on that...I will admit, like many others, I was disappointed in the live stream and the lead up to the announcements. The live stream felt like a complete afterthought, poor lighting, video, audio etc... I realize Ripple's Swell was more about the attendees but how you do anything is how you do everything and it left a bad taste in a lot of early and new investors mouths. As far as the big announcement, can we all agree that surprising the market with news is better than teasing it with news. Granted, Stellar/IBM stole some shine off of the Gates Foundation announcement, but if Brad hadn't primed the market with an announcement tease, XRP investors wouldn't have had such a 'meh' reaction to an awesome development. I understand how some of that could be chalked up to welp, 'shit happens', but the hype on Ripple's front could have been avoidable. 

So why am I still bullish and continuing to buy more XRP? We just partnered with the Gates Foundation, topped 100 in Ripplenet, went live XRP in US/Mex transactions, partnered with dlocal. The lock up is on schedule. A $300 million dollar incentive program went into action. That was all in the last few months. There are undoubtedly new partnerships in the pipeline. We have Interledger and the Fed's faster payments still in the wings. We see new offices opening up around the world. XRP has given investors one of the best returns this year, up some 2000%.

I just got my RN license and a new job as a registered nurse. I would be making about 95,000 an year. I start beginning of December. I am trying to make a plan for when I start making money and was looking for advice and direction.

Also I really need help with finances I feel pretty lost. If someone has like a breakdown of how things will work out I owe u big time.

I am sorry I was making like 1000 dollars a month so I have no idea how to handle this influx and want to be smart with my money and help build my credit.  

......................
Okay so details about my debt and payments

I pay about 175 dollars for my car insurance per month

My phone bill is 200 dollars. ( it’s me and my dad and I would like to pay for both of us to help him out.)
 
Ezpass which cost about 300 per month. (Overestimation)

And commuting expenses for work about 300 (overestimation) 

I have a discover card that I maxed out that I’ve only paid minimum 35 dollars. My plan is to pay the whole thing out in like the first month or two it’s only a 1,000 dollars.

I have loans from two bachelor’s degrees. I was a second degree nursing student.

Nursing school loans 
A parent plus loan that I took out for nursing school (it was a 1 yr program so I finished this august 2017)
61,510 with a 6.31% fixed interest 

Undergraduate loans 
A federal loan of 3,600 (listed as NSLDS) with 5% interest 

Then I have a 25,000  from Great Lakes loan 

EDIT: these loans do have an interest of 3.6% it’s just that the loans are still deferred until March when my 6 months end 

That’s all my debt. I might have some other payment stuff little ones that I would also settle I can’t think of right now but possible around another 1500. 

..........................
My goals 

Build my credit it’s super shitty these days.

My future plans is to save a lot and in an year or two I would like to buy an apartment.

I also will be moving close to my job I live in Staten Island and would move closer to work since the commute is crazy. I am thinking about finding an apartment for about 1,000 dollars also —",finance

personalfinance,Increase 403b contributions?,"I’m realizing now, at 32, that my 403b is way underfunded. I’m contributing 7 percent and my employer matches up to 4. So in total I have about $25k in the retirement account, $12k in a separate fidelity brokerage account, which I fund with a few hundred per month, and $10k in emergency.

I also have about $40k left in undergrad and graduate student loans—mostly private, with variable interest rates not currently exceeding 4.5 percent. Thanks to reading r/personalfinance,I’ve resolved not to be a minimum balance-paying schmuck-until-2024 and so in August I started putting down about $2k per month on the loans.

But that still leaves me with a weak 403b, even by Fidelity’s conservative estimates. So is it better to keep the employee contributions at a modest 7 and pay off the loans even more aggressively, or should I up it to maybe 10-12 percent and keep the loan payments at $2k? The contemporary wisdom is to fund the retirement account early in order to benefit from compound interest, right?

Other stats: single, no other debts, $70k salary with an 8-11 percent bump coming in March.

Pertinent info:

Student debt - total $40,285 (approx)
1. Direct Unsub Stafford Loan: $10,970.52 @ 5.96% fixed rate
2. DUSL: 7,757.17 @ 5.96% fixed rate
3. DUSL: $8,938.22 @ 5.16% fixed rate
4. DUSL: $12,618.86 @ 5.16 fixed rate

I pay $288.12 a month on these, as well as $100 a month to my grandma (she graciously paid off a loan for me, me paying her back at a very low interest rate).  My $288.12 payment goes towards my total loan balance.  I can pay extra on a single loan in a separate payment if I want.

Income: well.... kind hard to tell you.  I independently contract and am building up a clientele.  I hope to bring in at least $3500/month when I get a solid base.

For the purpose of this question, pretend that I have at least a $3500/month income.

Expenses/month:
Rent - $850
Health insurance - $400
Car expenses/gas - $240
Food - $150
Loans - $388
Utilities - $150
Fun money - $100


So, somewhere in the neighborhood of $3000-$2278 = $722 dollars extra a month.

personalfinance,Massive student loan debt (&gt;300K) repayment plan,"Hey guys, long time lurker first time poster to this thread. Wanted to run my plan for paying off my student loans past you guys who have some extra experience and might have some warnings or tips about this idea that I didn’t think of. Here goes:

Im a 27 year old who’s about 6 months into intern year of residency. During undergraduate, I was able to get away with taking out with a total of $10,000 of debt upon graduation. These are all Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. During my time in medical school I took out a total of $271,825 over 4 years, all Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans or Direct Student Plus Loans. Due to some interest accumulation that occurred on my undergraduate loans, I finished medical school with a total loan balance of $283,185.28. 

The first 6 months of residency my loans were in their grace period and I started crunching numbers to find a way to most painlessly handle this massive debt. 

My current situation is the following: $283,185 current principle balance, 45,710 unpaid interest, 328,895 total current balance. Mind boggling, so during the first 6 months of residency while my loans were in their grace period I started searching for the most painless way to handle this massive debt, and I came up with as follows:

I applied and was accepted for the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) program, which will limit my monthly payments to 10% of my discretionary income with forgiveness after 20 years. During the 4 years of residency, I will make between $56,000 and $65,000. Even at the end of my residency when my salary is at its highest, 10% at most will be $6,500 per year which breaks down to around $550 per month. 

First question: As you saw above I have 283K in principle balance and closer to 329K in current balance. My first loan payment with PAYE is due this month, and I know that capitalization occurs with certain events such as when the loan enters repayment. So I can expect that after this month, I will see a new principle balance of ~330K, and my new interest will be calculated on this amount, correct?

Assuming the above is correct, my $550 payments per month will not even come close to touching the monthly interest accumulation of 6.125%, which comes out to roughly $1,685 per month. So by the end of residency, I expect to be absolutely smothered in loan debt. Without getting to mathy, lets estimate 400,000 total debt growing at an interest rate of 6.125 on a principle balance of 330K. Once residency ends, I’ll become an attending and start making a salary closer to 200-300K per year. 

This will bump my 10% payments to finally being more than the interest accumulation, and I’ll have 16 years of payments to chip away at my total balance before it gets forgiven and taxed as income. So let’s plan for the low side of average and say I find a job that pays $250,000 per year with no increases over my career just to make it simple. My monthly payments will be closer to $2,080 and I’ll finally start to see my total balance go down. Now based on some rough excel math, at 16 years of these payments my total debt should be around the principle balance of 330K. 

The concept here is more important than the actual numbers, and here’s what I’m getting at. I know that the 330K forgiven will be taxed, and to be safe I’ll assume that it will be taxed close to 50% which is the highest possible rate. That leaves me sitting on a bill of somewhere around 165,000. Now, because the PAYE was only asking me to pay 10% of my discretionary income, I’ll have been saving for the past 16 years. And if I put the same amount of money that I was paying as I was saving into a savings account (obviously not because fuck those interest rates, but bonds or some other sort of safe vehicle that I will be able to liquidate and access at this expected time point), I’ll have saved 2000 x 12 x 16, or 384,000 – more than enough to cover the tax bill that I’ll be seeing upon forgiveness. This also means that over these 16 years, because only 20% of my income will go towards student loan related expenses, I should still have enough to put aside for retirement savings and other expenses (house, kids, life)

I know I’m young and don’t have experience with paying off loan debt, so I’m asking you fellow personal-financers if I’m missing something major here? Any tips or warnings I should keep in mind? I appreciate any input. I can add more specifics if needed, but again I’m trying to look at the big picture over planning down to the last dime how much I’ll be paying back (hence the rounding up on estimations of how much I'll owe).

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read about my situation - looking forward to finding out things I haven't even considered!",finance

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to adjust my W-4 so that my employer stops withholding federal tax from my paycheck? I want to pay in full myself. What are the pros/cons?,"It occurs to me that instead of withholding federal tax, they could give it to me in my paycheck. I could then grow the money and pay in full at the end of the year. Since the IRS knows my wages and receives the forms from my employer, the numbers should all work out the same. I know that I can do this through my W-4.

The main advantage is that I can save money by growing the tax before I owe it. As long as I plan for the expense, I don't anticipate any issues. Are there any serious downsides or gotchas with this approach?

Edit: Apparently I have a fundamental misunderstanding of when taxes are owed. This is apparently a bad idea. Never mind.",finance

personalfinance,Effective tax rate on foreign income paid out as dividends,"Disclaimer: This is hypothetical, as I am not a US resident nor VISA holder yet.
I am not seeking professional advice, but simple tax rate estimation as a result of my hypothetical move.

European, incorporated in Europe, considering to relocate to US on a working VISA, while working remotely. I am paying most of my salary via dividends.

This is my thinking:
I would be responsible to pay personal taxes to IRS, while being a resident.
My foreign dividends would be ""Qualified"" dividends, as country I am incorporated in has tax treaty with US.
The tax rate on dividends is 0% if you're in the first 2 income tax bands. 
Just because I would only be living on dividends, I would be on a lowest income tax band, therefore the effective tax rate would be 0%. 
This sounds too good to be true.

What am I missing?

Is there any state tax for the dividends on top of the federal one?

Can US government treat my foreign incorporation as US entity, therefore tax it as US entity? 
We do have: ""Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules"" in place in Europe, is there similar thing in US?

If that's the case and effective tax rate for dividends is 0% why Americans don't employ themselves via corporation and pay via dividends?",finance
personalfinance,How Should I Use the Money I Just Received?,"Okay, so I recently sold a vehicle I didn’t need and I got $3,000 from it. I now have about $3,200 in my checking account.

I also owe about $10,000 on an auto loan with a 3.49% interest rate. 

That is all the debt that I have, and this $3,000 will make a pretty decent dent in it. However, I’m not sure if I should dump it all towards my card, if I should put it towards the auto loan, or if I should keep it in my account and use it to make paying those bills as they come due each month easier so I can try and build up the funds that come in from my $2,400 monthly earnings and start making huge payments each month. 

Also, as a note on the auto loan, I currently have negative equity in it, which would be eliminated if I were to use the $3,000 towards my balance. The amount I owe on the car would then be equal to what it’s worth.

personalfinance,Financing Graduate School,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I am really confused right now about how I should plan on financing my graduate school education starting in Spring of 2018 (pending “official” acceptance). I plan on finishing within three semesters. 

Currently, the cost of tuition for my grad school for the spring semester would be about $16,000 (including fees). The next two semesters would be, total, about $23,000 (after fees). 

I know that the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan limit is $20,500 per year. I believe that I could rely solely on that for my first semester, Spring 2018. But the second and third semesters I would need to make up some ground. 

But my problem is this: I am currently in $1700 of credit card debt due to a very unfortunate set of circumstances that has made it difficult for me to save money and put a very significant portion of my income purely to rent. I know that the Grad PLUS loan eligibility is based on credit history, but the threshold is $2,085 to be considered adverse. I am working to pay it down because I am expecting some money to be coming in soon to help, but to completely pay it off by Fall 2018 might be difficult.

personalfinance,Starting Money Makeover Feedback and advice would be much appreciated!,"Hello everyone,
I am starting my money makeover finally, after repeated attempts to get my finances in order I have finally decided to get serious about ending my enslavement to my debt.

However all of this is still new to me and I could really use some advice and feedback if I heading in the right direction or if there is a better way to get rid of my debt faster.

First my current debt is at $12930.24 spread over 4 accounts 2 credit card 1 personal loan and 1 student loan. i have 2 other cards but those are at zero balances.

1. Chase Slate  $0 
2. Capital One Mastercard $0
3. Upstart Loan $2,288.49 15.26% w/ $243.55 monthly payment
4. WellsFargo Card $3,182.99 20.55% w/ $88 
5. Discover Card $5,157.68 but split $4,443.89 23.99% $813.03 0% (balance transfer) $153 monthly payment
6. Student loan $2,461.89 at 5.350% fixed w/ $55.42

So I admit that i have in the past I have tried to get my debt under control but I was never serious like i am now. What really screwed me over was the personal loan from upstart, the purpose was to use it for my credit card and I did use it for them but i kept using my cards and then things got really unmanageable for me. 

Now I am trying to get rid of my debt as quickly as possible. I have saved up $1,000 for an emergency fund, it is currently sitting in a Ally saving account.
Just yesterday I paid off the MasterCard that was $577.11. I have started to use YNAB more seriously and am keeping track of my expenses. I have also shredded all my credit cards and have sold quite a few things. I might be able to make another $500 for the remaining of my stuff. 

As for my expenses I have very few. I am blessed that my parents have allowed me to come back home while I get my money/life together.
As of right now they are my car insurance and gym membership. My car insurance is $227.49 / 6 mos and my gym member is 15 month. As for a cell phone I have the sprint 1 year free, so I just pay the taxes which is about 3 bucks a month. I do have a pet dog so dog food is about $50-70 every two months or so. That I haven't been tracking very good. But that's about it.
I spend about 25 bucks a week on gas, but that might increase with a new delivery job.
Food has only been a big expenses  because I always ate out for I am seriously trying to do mealpreps and am trying to set my budget for 200-250 a month for groceries. Cooking is still very new for me, even though I am about to turn 30. But since I workout every day I have been trying to be serious about it and make sure I am feeding my body what it needs.

As for my salary I make 1800 after taxes for my main job where I work 40 hours. Now I do work as a delivery driver for a local pizza company but I just put in my two weeks because recently I got hired a grubhub driver. My plan of attack is going to be to work my 40 hours on my first job spread over 6 days instead of 5, so Ill be working about 6.5 to 7 hour shifts then I will follow that up with a grubhub shift for possible 3-6 hours. Hopefully I can make some good money with grubhub, so far I've done only block but i made about $60 for 3.5 shift and that was on a Tuesday night from 7-10pm. Based on where I live the minium is 10 dollars an hour. So I am not really sure realistically how much I'll be making but I plan to use all those earning towards my debt.

The only thing that worries me is the wear and tear on my car, its a 1994 toyota corrolla with about 268,000 miles. I am just hoping it will last until the debt is gone, but i do take care of it and I have a mechanic who doesn't charge much to fix any issues that will come up.

So my question is based on what I shared what do you guys think the quickest method will be to get rid of my debt faster. At first i was planning to snowball, tackle the upstart loan next, and then the credit cards. I am not sure about my student loan though if I should continue making the minimum payments. My ultimate goal is to get back to school once i get rid of my debt. 

I also thought about once I finish paying the upstart loan I might try getting a personal loan from a credit union and see if i could better interest rate. I know in the past i screwed up with the upstart loan but I'm ready stop being a slave to these credit card companies. I know I got myself into this mess but I am ready to accept responsibility to get myself out it and make the necessary sacrifices. I just need a realistic plan to make sure I am heading in the right direction. 
Anyways I appreciate you reading all this text.

I recently discovered YNAB while lurking on this sub and I have been trying to create a budget in preparation for this upcoming change so I hit the ground running and don't waste time making poor financial decisions. In order to determine how much I have to work with I have been deducting 35% from my yearly salary, 30% for taxes and 5% for 401k contributions so that I can receive my employers match (100% of first 3%, 50% of next 2%). I get lunch for free from my current job and excluding weekends that is about the only thing I eat so I am unsure of how much to budget for groceries, especially considering I am picky eater (yeah i know..) and I can not cook, although I have no doubt I could follow recipes if I found ones I liked. Also how should I budget for inconsistent expenses like car repairs? I feel like one way would be to average how much I have spent on my car yearly, but since that's really just the basics (tires, oil, brakes, etc) it wouldn't really cover something catastrophic, so are their any good rules of thumb to follow in this regard as well as other common things that are not reoccurring expenses? Since I do not have much historical data to go off of in terms of my monthly expenses should I just make a rough budget for now and refine it as I figure things out?


**Housing Questions** 

One of the reasons I am trying to make a budget is to help me make the best decision for myself regarding housing. This job is a 3 year development program and after completing it I don't really have a desire to stay with the company nor do I particularly like the state so I will likely be moving back to Utah to work here. Being as I am planning on staying in KY for such a short time frame I am torn between renting or buying a place. I like the idea of buying a house big enough to have roommates (the company I will be working for has 100+ co-ops a semester and provides them with $550 a month for housing so it would not be hard to find roommates), and continuing to rent the place out after I move however I feel uncomfortable about the prospect of managing the rental from the other side of the country once I move back. On the other hand I am off put by the idea of renting since besides having a place to live I have nothing to show for the money I spend on it. Do you have recommendations on this front of how I should go about things? As of right now I am planning on renting month to month for the first 1-3 months of me moving to KY so that I can actually look at places in person and decide if I should buy something otherwise moving to a cheaper renting option. The downside of renting is that I may have to get a storage unit to keep some of my things although I am not sure how expensive of an option that would be. Any advice is appreciated.",finance

I'm moving out of my family members home where I have been charged 0 dollars in rent. I'm moving into a studio apartment for a little over 500 dollars a month. I picked up a second job to help with expenses but I'm not sure how to set up a budget. I've always been living with the mentality that I have money and I must spend it. 
I am going to Europe next summer for 2.5 weeks so I need help on how much I should save each paycheck to achieve the goal of 1,500 USD.
My expenses:
Rent: 585 a month.
Utilities: Included in the rent.
Parking: Included in the rent.
Car Payment: 312.86 with a 13% interest rate. I still owe 14k on it. This months car payment is 412.86 because I fell behind by income. I went to Texas for a wedding and my flights kept on getting cancelled.
Car Insurance: Paid off until I renew in January.
Southwest Credit Card: 2k credit limit and my current balance is 1800 dollars.
Green dot credit Card: 315 dollar credit limit.
Tuition expenses: 2,500 USD (Must be paid by March of 2018.) In August I will be enrolling in an Associates program.
Student Loan: 11k. (This will grow because of my Associates. I cannot get any financial aid at all. Just student loans. My parents made over a hundred grand in the last year so I do not qualify for anything. Stinks but such is life.)
Food: 100 dollars a month.
Gas: 100 dollars a month.
 
Income!
First job: 12.00 an hour with 40 hour work week. I'm able to work through lunch and pick up an additional shifts. OT pay is 18.00 an hour.
Second job: 9.00 an hour with 32 hour work week. I work nights and opening shifts during the weekends.

My European trip is already paid for. I have bought the flights and booked the Hostel Rooms. I cannot get any refunds or anything. So if I don't go I lose money. I will have the 2 weeks paid off. The last portion of my vacation I will not have any PTO and will just have to take a cut from paychecks. My employers are fine with this trip.

Please help me out with a budget. I'm not going to give up my car because the city I live in the public transport is non existent. Before I paid off my insurance I was paying 195 a month. I'll probably get a similar rate when I renew in January.",finance

solar,"Questions about Solar Installation (Orlando, FL - 11.6 kw)","I trying to decide on solar and I have questions about costs and equipment. And while being technically mind, I know nothing useful about solar with regards to practical application. Below is the scenario.


The price to install a 40 panel system system totaling 11.6 kw DC is $26,026. This 11.6 kw system installed on the southwest roof assuming very minimal shade will generate approximately on average 1300-1400 kWH per month depending on the time of year (summer or winter), which will offset approximately 80% (normally $200/month avg.) of the energy bill based on the past 12 months of energy usage data.   The system consists of the following components:

* REC solar TwinPeak 2 290 Watt panels (http://www.recgroup.com/sites/defaul..._rev_e_eng.pdf) 
* Power Optimizer P-300 DC (https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/power-optimizer#/) at each panel.

personalfinance,Use emergency fund to pay off student loans?,"So, I've made some good headway on my student loan payments, and now have them down far enough that I can pay them off all at once with what's in my emergency fund. However, if I did this, I'd only have enough left to cover maybe two month's worth of expenses.

The loans are right under $4,000, with about a 5.5% interest rate, and I have it set to autopay $70/mo. I have $400+ extra coming in each month, and right now I've got $100 earmarked for my IRA, $50 to a savings account, and $50 to a brokerage. The rest sits in my checking account for a rainy day or it I feel like throwing extra money at my loans. Last month I threw an extra $1,400 at it.

I'm due for a raise at work, which would help me either pay the loans off faster or rebuild my emergency fund. My car is paid in full, and I'm close enough to my place of employment that I don't actually need to own one if anything happens to it (it's a very reliable Honda, so I'm not too worried.) I'm also a renter, so that expense is fixed.

personalfinance,$63K in debt = $47K student loans +16K CC; Less than $30K income,"Just received an email 11/2 from Navient stating that my IDR monthly plan was increasing from $0 to $350/month, payment due 11/13. I assume this is based on our 2016 taxes, married filing jointly, $23K income with no dependents. I resubmitted my IDR renewal form last night hoping they desperately made a mistake but also need to prepare for the worst. I owe $35K in federal student loans, $6K private student loan (been paying the $50 minimum for years now), and my wife has a $6K federal student loan deferred. We also have $16K in credit card debt (the cards have been destroyed). 

**We're currently $63,000 in debt** 

**At what point do we consider bankruptcy?** 

We currently can't afford the credit card AND student loan minimums. We have no emergency fund, no IRA, and no family to ask for financial help. I work 48-60 hours a week, my SO works a wildly varying schedule anywhere from 10-35 hours a week in retail plus full-time student. We've trimmed; we've tracked; we've trimmed again. We're both looking for cash gigs for days ""off"" that don't require us to drive our own cars but nothing yet. Our Quality of Life is pretty much nonexistent. Our marriage has been reduced to phone calls and text messages but it's just temporary, right? I know student loans can not be included in bankruptcy but I could at least get rid of the credit card debt. There's no mortgage, car payment or anything else. If we continue to work at our current pace (i.e. I'm offered a permanent position), our projected 2018 income $36-40K. 

My FICO score is 622. I can't do a card balance transfer, tried it already, not approved. We have no desire to buy a home in the United States (within the next 15-20 years, if ever) and are perfectly content renting a cheap apartment. We have 2 used cars, owned, both needed for work. I commute 25 miles one way to work (started 3 months ago; temp contract) and my SO commutes 20 miles one way to work (started 6 months ago), in opposite directions. I've been tracking our spending and know where every dollar is going. To be completely honest, I don't care too much about credit anymore, I just want to be debt-free, contribute to an IRA and deal with cash.

personalfinance,What is a reasonable interest rate for a first time car buyer?,"Mobile, sorry for formatting

Went to car lot today hoping to find car with reasonable payments. 
 I have a credit score of 750 with only one credit line and history of  6 months. 
I have an income of 1500 a month with bills equaling 200 in total.
I signed part of the paperwork and received an estimate for payments 
For a loan of $9400 they told me I'd need to pay $296 for 69 months to pay it off. I did the math and I'd be paying roughly 20,500 for a $9400 loan.
I used http://www.calculator.net/interest-rate-calculator.html?
And I believe the interest rate is 31%. I called sales person back and they said it'll be pretty high since I'm a first time buyer and I can refinance down the road. I called the dealership and tried to speak to the sales manager, he sounded pretty surprised at the interest rate. He investigated and I was told they hadn't been able to look at all the bank offers since the banks were closed at the time and that I wouldn't pay that. He also mentioned that Missouri laws wouldn't allow such a high rate. I'm meeting with them Monday to figure out what's going on, I've put $750 down and have another $1250 for Monday.

Is this a normal rate for a first time buyer or was the salesperson trying to pull one over on me?

personalfinance,Mileage reimbursement guideline question,"I'm a teacher and work at two different schools. My employer reimburses us for mileage at the Federal rate, however they only reimburse whatever is in excess of our round trip between home and base school.

Home to base school is 8 miles. Home to my secondary school is 4 miles. Base to secondary is 3 miles. According to the rules, that means I'm on the hook for the first 16 miles I drive each day. 

One day per week, I'm at secondary in the morning and base in the afternoon, bringing that day's commute to 15 miles. Even though my job requires me to travel 3 miles during my work hours, I'm being told I'm not allowed to claim anything because I'm in the hook for the first 16.

So my questions: is this policy consistent with federal guidelines? Would I be better off waiving reimbursement from the school system and claiming it on my taxes (assuming I'm already meeting the standard deduction)?

This came to my attention because HR just went though and switched the base school of some of my colleagues to be whichever school is furthest from their home.

BlockChain,Kleros: justice for the unjusticed - #Sunday Interview,"Why did users switch from traditional mail to email? Because they saw it was a faster and cheaper way to deliver a message. Why are people switching from international bank transfers to cryptocurrencies? Because they are seeing that it’s a faster and cheaper way to transfer money – says Federico Ast, Ph.D., Blockchain Entrepreneur and Founder at Crowdjury/Kleros in Bithub.pl’s #SundayInterview.

**You claim to deliver affordable and transparent justice services for all, based on decentralized autonomous organization model. How exactly does this work? Is it dedicated to companies only or individuals as well?**

**Federico Ast:** *I think the easiest way to understand this is with an example of a type of dispute which happens every day.*

*Imagine that Giselle is an entrepreneur based in France. She hires Miguel, an independent programmer from Guatemala, on a freelancing platform to build a new website for her company. After they agree on a fee, terms and conditions, Miguel gets to work.*

*A couple of weeks later, he delivers the product. But Giselle is not satisfied. She claims that the quality of Miguel’s work is considerably lower than expected. Miguel replies that he met all the specifications. Giselle is frustrated. She cannot hire a lawyer for a claim of just a couple hundred dollars with someone who is halfway around the world.*

*Now, imagine that, at the moment of their agreement, Giselle and Miguel decide to use Kleros as arbitration mechanism. Instead of paying Miguel directly, Giselle sends the money to a smart contract controlled by Kleros. When the dispute starts, Giselle taps a button that says SEND TO ARBITRATION and fills a simple form explaining her claim. She also uploads the product that Miguel delivered and the messages sent back and forth with Miguel during the process.*

*Chief is a software developer who lives thousands of miles away in Nairobi, Kenya. While on the bus commuting to work, he is checking Kleros website to find some arbitration work. He makes a couple thousand dollars a year on the side of his primary job by serving as a juror in software development disputes between freelancers and their clients. He usually works in the Website Quality subcourt, which requires skills in html, javascript and web design.*

*Chief activates 2 pinakion, the token used in Kleros to select jurors for disputes. The more tokens he activates, the more likely it is that he will be drawn as juror.*

*About an hour later, an email hits Chief’s inbox:*

*“You have been selected as a juror for a website quality dispute. You can access the evidence here. You have three days to analyze the evidence and submit your decision”.*

*Similar email are received by Benito, a programmer from Cusco and Alexandru, from Romania, who had also activated their pinakion for the dispute. They were randomly selected from a pool of almost 3,000 candidates. They will never know each other, but they will collaborate in settling the dispute between Giselle and Miguel. On the bus back home, Chief analyzes the evidence and votes who is right.*

*Two days later, after all jurors have voted, Giselle receives an email that says: “Jurors have ruled in your favor on the dispute”. The money in the contract is automatically transferred to Giselle. Jurors are rewarded for their work and the case is closed.*

*This is a simple use case involving software. But there are many other potential use cases. Especially, now that a larger part of our commerce and life are moving only, so do conflicts. Kleros is a multi-purpose system that could be also used to solve disputes in e-commerce such as eBay, sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb and Uber, crowdfunding, e-sports among many others.*

I have acquired a bit of debt during this time, mostly for furnishings for my new home. 

This is their current balance and monthly payments

2k credit card @ 0% - $160/month
2k credit card @ 0% - $120/month 
2k credit card @ 0% - $110/month

I also have a bit of student debt. 

$2400 fedloan @ 4.41%
$2300 fedloan @ 4.41%
$2450 fedloan @ 3.61%
$2000 bank loan @ 7ish%

Currently I make a single monthly payment of $240 to fedloan and it gets distributed across the 3 loans. 

That last student debt I ended up moving to a variable but low rate credit card at my bank since the interest was considerably lower than the rate I got it from the original lender (11.5%)

I’ve been working very hard to pay the last one down the fastest since it is the highest rate. Earlier this year it was at 6k.  I just made $1000 payment to it last month (sold a laptop). 

My other debts are just the usual house and car payment. $1900/month combined. 

My questions are this:

1. Should I withdraw a 401k I have from an old employer to pay off the student debts? I currently have about $3500 vested in there. 

2. Tax time is coming up, I should be getting a considerable refund. Where should I apply it? I feel like I am drowning in revolving debt. 

3. Should I distribute my “extra” payments evenly across loans or should I put it all towards a single loan and pay it off faster then move it to another loan? Lately I’ve been putting it on a single loan (the high rate student loan). 

4. I also have a small savings account, $3500, should I use that to pay off the high rate loan?

Debt Management Plan:
Assets: I have a Corvette that I am selling back in Virginia which should yield me around $18-$19k. Its honestly worth around $22k, but it has received little interest so I have the price knocked down quite a bit. This is my only asset and will constitute a large portion of how I intend to pay off some of the larger debts. 

This is where you guys come in. Assuming I pull in $18.5k from the car; what is the smartest, most efficient way to allocate the funds across my debt portfolio? My thought is to knock out in the following order.

- IRS $2k
- Medical and Treatment $11.1k
- Pay back friend. This can wait though. He is my childhood best friend and is like family to me. He will get his return and I am grateful for his help in my time of need.

So what do I do? Is there any way to utilize the cash in a more cost efficient manner? The medical debt is on a no interest repayment plan and after bills I am saving enough to be able to throw more on the debt. However, I don't necessarily want to do that as I want to get an emergency fund allocated in case I lose my job. I do not foresee that happening, but the last thing I want to happen is dump all that money and then find myself in a situation where my debt is paid off, but I have no funds to pay my rent, food, ect. 

Nine months ago, I was laying in a hospital bed with a BA over .40 having delirium tremens withdrawals. Today, I am sitting in my own apartment in beautiful Colorado with the majestic Rocky Mountains at my doorstep. I wont go into my personal anecdote about addiction, but I want to share that getting sober was the hardest yet most rewarding accomplishment of my life. Recovery is first and foremost priority over even personal finances. However, managing my personal finances is so much easier to do in a sober state of mind. 

TL;DR: Addiction created a debt burden of nearly $20k after medical expenses, treatment, loss of income. Recovery has landed me back on my feet, relocated, employed, and able to repave the road I left behind. Basically, is my plan outlined above the best way to repave, metaphorically?",finance
personalfinance,Whole Life Insurance for slacker husband,"Married for almost 3 years. I'm making 35k a year in a catering business, wife is a nurse but wants to be a stay-at-home mom. I am looking to get term life insurance but wife and mother-in-law are dead set on whole life insurance.

I am constantly reminding my mother-in-law of her dead ex-husband who died of cancer after a lifetime of working part-time at Wal Mart. I have been fired from two jobs since we have been married, which doesn't help, but I am always willing to work a full-time job and a part-time job, even stooping so low as to make pizzas for federal minimum wage for a while. Right now I do $15/hour as a sous chef/kitchen manager and a part-time $9/hour fast food position.

Wife was in nursing school when we got married, so I left my school and my job to live where she was and put my school on hold while she got her degree. Now she has it, but all she wants to do is be a stay-at-home mom. I only have an associate's degree. I was meaning to be a teacher, but now I want to do software engineering or something similar. I could do online school, if I could focus and actually do it. There are brick and mortar schools but it would require a 30 to 45 minute commute both ways.

I want to take care of my family. We have a 14 month old baby and another on the way. I just hate that every article I read and every expert says term life insurance is what you want, but my MIL is convinced I need Whole Life in case I die after 31 years, because funerals are $16k, and her husband had debts to pay when he died.

personalfinance,I was told by multiple lenders that my old student loans are stopping me from getting financial help as was told to seek legal representation. I need help with this!,"Back in 2005-2007, I attended a college, which shall remain nameless, that lied to me to get me to come to their college. They told me that my rent and college-supplied laptop would all be covered by grants and college programs. Needless to say, they all got tacked onto my loans. Since then, I've been in the military who does have a Student Loan Repayment program, which is how I found out that my school duped me into getting personal loans, not federal, so no help there. 

Now, nearly 10 years later, the student loans that are on my credit have thrown my credit score into the 400's and is making my debt-to-income ratio unsustainable. In the past year, I have found out about the debt-collector statute of limitations laws in each state. I mailed my lender a copy of the law pertinent to that state with proof of it being over the required years to have it written off my credit. The lender came back with their determination stating they saw no reason to remove the loan from my credit report. 

I recently (less than 6 months ago) moved for work and tried to get some counselling as far as trying to get a mortgage. I was told by every lender that they cannot help me and to seek legal representation to fight the lender and prove that they need to remove themselves from my credit. They said if I don't I will never qualify for mortgages and always will pay top dollar when it comes for credit cards and auto loans. However, I don't have any money to get legal representation.

Any advice would be helpful, as I find myself stuck between a rock and a hard place.",finance

https://www.geo.tv/latest/166215-what-is-paradise-paper

**What is Paradise Papers?**

The Paradise Papers is a database comprising around 13.4 million documents, which reveals over 25,000 companies owned by the world's rich and influential individuals.

The documents were obtained from two companies in Singapore and Bermuda by a German newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). A major part of the Paradise Papers comprises leaked files from company 'Appleby'.

The files reveal data of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.

Below is a comparison of Paradise Papers with Panama Papers:

----

**Number of politicians and public officials**

* Paradise Papers: 127 politicians and public officials (14 current or former country leaders included) from more than 47 countries

* Panama Papers: 140 politicians and public officials from more than 50 countries

----

**Which leak is the bigger than other?**

Paradise Papers is bigger in number of records (13.5 million in Paradise Papers vs. 11.5 million in Panama Papers) and Panama Papers is bigger in terms of size of the leak (1.4 Tb in Paradise Papers vs. 2.6 Tb in Panama Papers).

Due to that, I would recommend to say ""one of the biggest leaks in the history of journalism"" instead of the biggest and then you could compare some of the different figures related to the data size between Paradise Papers and previous leaks.

----

**Journalists in Paradise Papers project**

Media partners, countries, journalists

* Number of journalists 381

* Number of media partners 96

* Number of countries 67

If you just consider the number of journalists, yes. There are more journalists working on the Paradise Papers than the Panama Papers at the time of the project release (381 Paradise Papers - 376 Panama Papers).

As for the number of media partners and number of countries, there are a few less. Panama Papers had 100+ media partners and 76 countries. The ICIJ currently has for Paradise Papers 96 media partners and 67 countries.

personalfinance,Roth or Traditional IRA for 2018?,"I am in the Foreign Service and my wife and I will earn approximately 150K in 2018.

Compared with this year, our federal tax bill next year will increase 10K (this year's combined income was approximately 115K; wife's job situation changes almost every year, as does our annual income). Is it advantageous to put the 34K away into traditional IRAs next year? Or perhaps there are better alternatives when it comes to minimizing taxable income?

Bitcoin,[Speculation] From someone who has researched bitcoin.,"I'm in debt, a lot of people i know are in debt. Life is unfair sometimes. But we all live by the rules of the bank, everything can be traced back to some banker, insurance company, and the federal reserve. It's the best system we have right now.

As a bachelor in business, i have learned that the entire system is held up by nothing. If the fed decides to print more money, they can do so, without any hard restrictions that can't be broken without a little bit of paperwork. 

So why can't i get out of my debt with a little bit of paperwork? I can actually. I can continue to consolidate my debt for the next 5-10 years if i really tried, without working. Using credit cards, banks, and loans. At any rate, my money has been manipulated at every turn. Taxed by my government, the point of sale, the interest, heck, in the grand scheme of things, i have absolutely no control over whether or not my dollar is worth what it is tomorrow. 

But bitcoin aims to alleviate this, and more. I have about two potential manipulators. The point of sale and the broker. Other than that a bitcoin in the U.S. is worth the same it is in japan, Canada, ect ect. If i decided right now to switch all my assets over to bitcoin, the only thing the banks could take from me are my wages. 

But not if those wages were in bitcoin..

i see bitcoin as being a gateway into a future where the people make their own decisions without the current establishment, meaning more freedom for everyone. Is this a good thing? Well, probably not, its going to enable all sorts of evil stuff to happen. But it's going to happen anyway, and as far as im concerned, the world is evil. But bitcoin gives us all a level playing field, not just the banks.

Today i invested $1000 in Bitcoin, which is all the actual cash i have. I'll be living off credit for the next 5 years. I may continue investing every dime i earn into bitcoin. After all, its the only way out. Is a life on the dollar really a life worth living?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,[HOUSING] Should I pay off my current mortgage before buying another house or put it towards a new house?,"**Into the numbers:**

* Income $250K/yr. before taxes
* Property value: $225k
* Amount owed on property: $350k (Bought in 2006, modified loan to 3.5%, $1870 mortgage payment)
* Family: Married, w/ 2 kids (6 and 1.5)
* Savings: $110k and growing (Not invested, sitting in checking)
* Retirement: $170k
* New Home Budget: ~$500k

**Story:**

So my wife makes $100k, I make $150k. Our 6 year old is in kindergarten in a terrible school district. We would like to move to a better school district with less crime.  Currently all of my money is in my checking account. I will be moving it to a saving account next week, so don't panic. I kept it there because I was planning on buying another house a few months ago but due to job issues, we are holding off. My employment isn't certain, but hers is. I may be switching jobs soon to something that pays less ($100k).  All of that saving occurred within the past two years by not investing in a 401k. My wife is still investing in her retirement. 

**About the current house:**

I bought the house we are currently living in during the housing boom in 2006 for $330k, it's now worth $225k.  I stopped paying the mortgage to get the loan modified so they rolled the missed payments in the principal which inflated the principal and kept the maturation date the same. I would like to rent the house if we move to another house.  I think I can cover the mortgage payments using rental income or maybe adding a few hundred to it. I likely won't make a profit each month with the monthly payment the way it is. I could also refinance using the money that we saved and lower the  payment (-$400) but I might get a higher interest rate. It's currently 3.5%, bankrate says the best loan is going for %3.680.  It would also be nice to not have to pay PMI (Only $50).  

**What I want to do:**

My thoughts are that I should put the money in the house so that we meet the loan maturation date, and take advantage of the lower current interest rate while paying off more principal.  Also, if I needed a smaller payment I could refinance easily later on down the road. Currently I can't refinance because the house is underwater. 

After putting $110k in this house, I want to save up about $50k for a down payment for a ~$500k home and rent this property out.

**Questions:**

* Do you think it's wise to not invest in our retirements to save up as much money as possible? I would have to invest 8% of my pay to receive the company contribution which would have been $24k less to invest. Growth at 16% at $24k would have been about $3k.  I was plan on loading the 401k heavily after purchasing the house. 
**EDIT:** Growth for the past 2yrs using S&amp;P was 26%. With company contribution would have been $13000 interest. So I passed up having $60k in 401k vs. 24k in bank account.
* Should I keep the house as a rental property or sell it?

* Should I invest the saved up $110k in the house or just roll it into the new house?

I’m a long-time lurker but just had a financial planning discussion with my husband and wanted to make sure that we’re tackling this the right way. If this is the wrong forum or format, please let me know.

I am a new doctor who graduated residency in June. Gross salary is 215,00, debt is approximately ~ 230,000 (mix of public and private) with 12000 owed on my car. The highest interest rate is 7.5% and the lowest is 3.5%; my largest loan is 130,000 at the 7.5% rate (of course). No credit card debt, no mortgage. I just paid off my lowest loan of ~8000 today and am left with 14000 total (emergency fund, checking account, saving for a down payment, whatever).

I match my employer’s contribution for retirement and pay for my own healthcare, total take-home during the month is approximately $8k after those expenses. My share of rent/utilities is ~ 1k. We have pets but no kids. Right now I’m spending just under $4k on loans every month.

My husband’s and my finances are separate, he’s solvent with savings and would like to buy a house with 20% down within the next 6 months to 1.5 years. 

My question is, would you:
1. throw everything you have at those loans, and when we go to buy a house get PMI or the ‘new physician’s loan’ 
2. split my earnings between a down payment and minimum payments on the loans until I have the down payment and then hurl everything at them 
3. Some other mix or another avenue I haven’t considered?

I’m not doing PSLF (I don’t trust it and I’d like to be debt-free within 5 years aside from our mortgage). I’m picking up extra shifts to help supplement the loan pay-off. I’ve also read White Coat Investor and The Total Money Makeover, I’m just trying to wrap my head around the enormity of what I have right now and also try to start a family and own a house.

personalfinance,"We're buying a house and due to our good credit and military service we have options. How can we make our money work the hardest: Conventional or VA, 20% down or nothing down and invest elsewhere?","We're buying a house for $248,000. My husband is a veteran so we qualify for a VA loan. The benefit there is you don't have to put down any money and you don't pay PMI. There is a 1.5% fee for second time use of the VA loan and our interest rate is 3.25%.

We also have enough money to put down the 20% and use a conventional loan at 3.88%. There would be no PMI and we could choose to use the house as a rental later down the line.

We plan to stay in the house 5-7 years. But, interest is so low right now we're wondering if we should use the VA loan, borrow the full amount (or close to it) and invest our money elsewhere.

This is just what we have readily available to use.

personalfinance,Made $12.5K this summer and Maxed out my Roth IRA at 18. Where to put the extra money to match inflation?,"Hello fellow redditors, I have a question that few teenagers my age end up asking, I've got a bunch of money and I don't really know what to do with it.

Where I got this money:

Over the summer at 17 I got a job at a computer recycling center. My job was to dig computer parts out of the recycling bins there that still had resale value beyond scrap price,and list and sell them on ebay or craigslist for Larger items. Corporations would frequently bring in pallets of 50-100 dell and HP desktops containing sandy-bridge core i5 and i7 CPUs along with 4GB of RAM, all of which are worth well over 10x more on the used market vs scrap. My job was to get this stuff listed, packed, shipped and sold to customers around the US. Because companies constantly brought in these ""old"" computers that were still worth money, I made $12.5K after commissions and taxes were all accounted for. 

My family background:


I come from a well off family. My dad is an investment manager and my mom work as a Market research analyst for UnitedHealth. I know my parents both make over 6 figures guessing by their jobs, but I have never been given a hard number. 


Since my Dad is an investment manager, he opened a Roth IRA for me. At the time I was 17, so I contributed $2500 and he was able to do a match contribution of another $2500 (because I was a minor) meaning my Roth IRA was close maxed out for the year.


Currently I am in college, all paid for by my parents. I have one of the lucky few individuals who has parents that can afford to fund my college entirely out of their salary, so 
i would be an idiot to not take advantage of getting a college education. I currently have a vehicle, but it sits at my parents house. I Do not use the car as I live on campus and I use public transit, so there is no need to own one (and have to pay insurance on it, which in Michigan is super expensive at 18). I also have no debts whatsoever.


I now have 10K left over. I worked really hard to make that money, and I don't see anything I would want to use it for in the next 3-4 years or so. Maybe when I graduate college and enter the workforce, it could be used to pay rent, but that's about it. 


Since I started working, I have been incredibly frugal. I would say well over 95% of the money I made from my job I diligently saved (I lived with my parents at the time, so I had $0 in living expenses). Of course in our low interest environments of today, my 10K is sitting in a savings account at Goldman Sachs, earning 1.3% a year.


I've decided to designate this money as A future emergency fund at least for now. But there's a problem. Inflation is at 3% a year average, and I am earning 1.3%, meaning that inflation is eating away the buying power of my money by about 1.7% a year. I want liquidity with my money, but I also want to have the same buying power years from now as I had when I made the money, so I don't want to see inflation eat away at my hard work.


If I leave my money in a savings account, I lose money in a low-interest environment, but do well in a high-interest environment. If I put my money in bond funds to try to earn a better return while keeping it out of high-risk stocks, then I run the risk of a high interest environment tanking the performance of any bond fund.


Here is what I was thinking: Leave 5K of it in the savings account, but place the other 5K in a vanguard short-term bond fund like the VFSTX bond-fund. In a low inflation environment, the 5K in savings will perform poorly, but the other 5K in the bond fund will perform better, thus helping to hedge against inflation. If interest rates rose, the bond fund will perform poorly, but the savings account interest rate will go up, again, helping to protect against inflation. Is this a good plan?

Other options:

I could put the money in CD-ladders, I-bonds, or other funds that requires your money to be locked up before it can redeemed. The reason I have strayed away from those is because the money cannot be redeemed at any time, and that really isn't the point of an emergency fund. All the money needs to be accessible in a 1-week time period, and these funds require you to tie your money up for a specified amount of time, so I don't want to use them.


At least this is a good problem to have. I have a bunch of money and I don't know what to do with it lol. I have never really had a lot of ""wants"". Give me food, water, shelter and internet and I am happy, so there's nothing I want to buy at the moment.

TL:DR: I have 10K and I want to match inflation while still have immediate access to the full amount, what do I do?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT:

thanks for the advice everyone, here is what I decided to do. I may or may not need this money in the next 3-4 years to pay for something like a car/a house, so I need to keep it relatively low-risk (fluctuations of 10-20% should be okay). But with a 3-4-year time period, I can invest some of it in bond funds to get a safe return. Here is the breakdown:

I am splitting up the 10K into stocks, bonds, and keeping some in my savings account. Here is the breakdown:

1. 2.5K is going to stay in my savings account earning me 1.3%

2. 2.5K is going to be used to buy I-bonds. I-bonds as of November 2017 currently have an APY of ~2.5%, so better than savings. 

3. 5K I am placing in a vangard Intermediate-term bond-fund like the VBIIX. It's more risky then the above choices, but safer than all stocks.

More to add:

My college major is engineering, so I have plans to get an internship over the summer and make even more money. This money will go directly into my Roth IRA. I don't know how much money I will make, but I talked to the recycling center and they said I can pop in anytime I want over the summer and sell more computers (so I could do that while having an internship). Doing this I could conceivably max-out my Roth IRA again next year.",finance

I didn't have to divulge any personal information the system didn't already have, and the nice young woman I was transferred to read me my transaction history without any further verification, most of which I can confirm from my credit union's app. Now that my card has been permanently blocked I'm going to see them tomorrow to have a new one issued.  

What bothers me most is that I haven't been outside my home city in almost three months. I've shopped at maybe ten different stores total in that time and never used an ATM (I don't go out much, work from home, and don't drive). Most stores I visit use chip and PIN, although a few are chip and signature. I haven't had to swipe my card unless I'm at a gas station for snacks. I'm sure the card could have been compromised months ago, but I'd think it would have been used before today.   

What steps should I take from here to ensure the integrity of my personal information? Also, who should I contact, if anyone, at the stores in question to let them know that not only might they have a card skimmer and PIN camera in their midst, but it's actively in use?

gaming,What would be a dream/ideal game for you?,"After beating Xenoverse 2 and the talk of a new history I imagined a Xenoverse not revolving around the time patrol. 

CaC: 
Frieza Clan: After a war within the Frieza Clan your family sent you out into space to escape King Cold and Frieza's wrath. You crash landed on earth

Human: a young martial arts sought out Muten Roshi to help them become the greatest fighter in the universr

Saiyan: Basically Goku's backstory only with you landing on earth instead of him

Namekian: A member of the Warrior Clan sent to find the Nameless Namekian on Earth.

Majin: A piece of Majin Buu escaped into the world (not very familiar with the Majin Saga)

How gameplay works.

True DBZ episode: Don't defeat the villain in the time limit.
Example= Vegeta crawls to his pod you're exhausted Krillin has his sword and ideally you'd be given a choice to spare or kill which begins you on your path to Ruthless or Generous but if that's too lenient save it for.

Fighter episode: you beat the villain within the time limit you get to make decisions because you still have the health and energy to do so.

And so on you could make allies and enemies and change the entire history of the universe. And more importantly since you are the Goku of the universe when you become a God or equivalent it makes more sense than a random time patroller handing Blue Goku, Blue Vegeta, golden Frieza, and metal cooler buffed their asses single handedly. 


And old idea I used to want is when playing resident evil 2 I always noticed some doors can never be opened and no idea what was behind them especially the second floor hallway near the stars office so you playing as basically someone cleaning up and going into these hidden areas .

financialindependence,Side hustles with a demanding job and young family?,"Short story: I have a well-paying, but very demanding corporate finance job. I have a toddler and infant at home. I just bought a house and blew tens of thousands more than expected in a fixer-upper. After graduating ~10 years ago with &gt;$100k in student loans, I still have $30k to go and am fed up with my lack of progress.

In the spirit of this sub, I am getting my arms wrapped around our profligate spending, but there is not a lot of low-hanging fruit. Therefore, I am looking to increase my income. 

The problem I face is that I will get home from work in time to see my kids and put the toddler to bed, then relax for an hour before spending time either working on the house or finishing something for my job, often til after midnight.

The house stuff is winding down, and I am hoping I am getting more efficient with my job, but I feel like there are few potential hours in the week to earn more. My kids are very demanding as well, so I need to be able to give my stay-at-home wife a break when I get home. 

I have been wanting to maybe get into independent consulting to leverage my professional skillset, even improve it, but I don't think I can ever find the time while still seeing my kids on a regular basis. Realistically, I think I need to develop passive income streams.

Anyone else here in a similar employment/family situation, but with a side income stream? Am I wrong about not being able to utilize my professional skills?

EDIT: Thank you all for the input! I really expected to hear that I should be getting after it and sacrificing time with the family/sleep for longer-term pay-off. Really did not expect the consensus advice to be enjoy the time now.

The job I have now is a serious resume builder, so another year or so should allow me to jump to a higher-paying position. I'll ride it out and enjoy my family.",finance

technology,Net Neutrality Alternatives for Keeping the Net free.,"I don't know where best to put this, so I thought I would write a text post and ask what r/technology thinks. I wrote my law school thesis on Net Neutrality this past school year. It's obviously a fascinating topic. 

My research showed that there are two potential options, and the better of the two is oft overlooked. On one hand, we could place the entirety of the internet under Title II, and control it via federal regulation from regulatory authorities. This seems to be the current consensus. The other option is interesting, and leaves open the opportunity for smaller ISP growth in a burgeoning market. The second option is to have the Democrats put forth a new Communications Law that codifies into law the three bright line rules of the 2015 Open Internet Order (No blocking, No Throttling, and No Paid Prioritization). Couple that new law with antitrust enforcement from the DOJ to keep major corporations from infringing upon the rights of municipalities and smaller ISPs. 

The FCC is a federal agency that falls under the authority of the Executive branch of the United States government. It promulgates rules, not laws, as most of you know. The 2015 Open Internet Order is not codified law. It is regulation promulgated by the regulatory authority. Thus, it is weak, and can be changed far more easily. We can see these things switch back and forth administration after administration. A piece of legislation is much more difficult to change. 

I understand Title II plus regulatory authority of the FCC is the seemingly available option for now, but we're talking about the next 100 years or more of internet policy for the entire country. 

My research showed that there is a vibrant ISP market, contrary to popular belief. We have over 4,400 ISPs nationwide. There are also municipal programs in their infancies all over the country. Seattle decided against building a 480-660 million dollar network (but built a 1 billion dollar stadium for sports teams). Utah is working on municipal broadband, as is Chattanooga, TN, and the state of West Virginia. 

Our broadband growth is limited by anticompetitive behaviors of the major three ISP players, I understand. However, what most people do not consider, is the idea that your current BIG THREE provider will become your regulated utility provider once Title II is solidified as the regulatory authority to define the internet as a utility -- if things go our way. 

Section 706(a) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives broad authority to the relevant regulatory authority for control over the utility. Many people say, ""But the FCC has chosen not to enforce certain measures they have the right to enforce!"" That's true. It's trending toward future enforcement, though. The FCC could set rates, charges fees, and have already set provisional floors. 

The provisional floors are the scariest part of having the internet under Title II. Right now, the requirement is 25 MB/S download, 3 MB/S upload. It's a good goal to have to get the nation up to speed, right? Well, that floor can also act as a ceiling. If Comcast only has to provide that minimum nationwide, and is protected by the FCC to do so as it will be provided a legal monopoly over current territories where it will act as the utility company since it is already the provider in those regions, then Comcast is not forced by competition to provide any speeds faster than 25 MB/S download and 3MB/S upload.

This could have a stagnating, chilling effect on the development of the internet infrastructure of the United States. I know that we could be royally screwed if Net Neutrality isn't protected. I'm not advocating that the BIG THREE be left to their own devices. I'm simply advocating that there is another way -- codified legislation of the Net Neutrality principles and vigorous antitrust enforcement -- that would maintain some aspects of the free market in order to see what our little ISPs are made of after all.",technology
personalfinance,"The Great Loan Payoff Riddle: How to Wisely Use $35,000 to Pay Off 10 Loan Accounts?","Fellow PF Redditors,

I have been granted $35,000 to pay off my student loans and I have been struggling with the best approach to minimize interest paid at the end of the life of all loans.

Here are the 10 accounts in three different payment groups that I am currently making payments to (values rounded for simplicity):

**Nelnet Federal**: $358/month

* Group A: $2,310 at 6.55% with $27 minimum monthly payment
* Group B: $3,960 at 6.55% with $47 min
* Group C: $4,690 at 5.75% with $54 min
* Group D: $4,614 at 5.35% with $53 min
* Group E: $3,902 at 4.25% with $43 min
* Group F: $2,119 at 6.55% with $25 min
* Group G: $1,999 at 6.55% with $24 min
* Group H: $7,169 at 6.55% with $85 min

**ECSI Heartland Federal**: $109/month

* $4,157 at 5.00% with $109 minimum payment

**Earnest Personal**: $1,467/month

* $85,773 at 4.54% with $1,467 minimum payment

Using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a0zyYTtZoI&amp;t=4s) calculator, it seems like the best approach is to eliminate the account with highest interest rates (federal loans) as opposed to the account with the highest principal (personal).

If I were to make a one-time payment to pay off all the federal loans and make additional payments ($358+$109) towards the personal, I will have paid $8,295 in interest over 4 years and 2 months by the time I have paid off everything.

Conversely, if I were to pay off $35,000 in my personal loan and continue paying off all 10 loans at the current rate, I will have paid $10,707 in interest over 5 years and 8 months.

I understand that with federal loans, you have flexibility with payment terms if anything were to affect my employment and therefore my financial situation.

However, assuming that I maintain a similar financial situation for the next five years, I want to know if:

* there is miscalculation with what I arrived at above
* there is a better way to go about than paying off all federal loans
* I am missing something? (tax, investment, etc.)

CryptoCurrency,Why I am Not Investing in Bitcoin,"What is Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency that is “mined” using computers. These computers use time and energy to decipher algorithms which lead to coins circulating into the currency. Some types of coins, like Bitcoin have a fixed number of coins that can ever be mined while others are limitless. As more coins are mined, the next coin becomes harder to mine, and it will take more computer power to find.

Blockchain is a new technology that has come from Bitcoin and it is essentially a record of transactions of every bitcoin. This list of transactions is an evolving record and is added to simultaneously with any transaction. This means that anyone can see any transaction. The value of this technology is that it is decentralized, and no one really controls it. There is nobody to profit on the movement of value and it should create a more efficient market. However, central banks and financial institutions around the globe are beginning to develop their own technology. It will help these institutions become more efficient, and they hope to better serve their clients.

Why I am not investing

Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies are a bubble. Because of this, I will not invest in them. The long-term outlook of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does not seem great to me, and I will explain why.

The Anatomy of a Bubble

According to James Montier, in his article Behavioral Investing: A Practioner’s Guide to Applying Behavioral Finance, there are five stages of a bubble, and I believe we are currently in the third stage. The five stages are: displacement, credit creation, euphoria, financial distress, and revulsion.

Displacement

Displacement is a market reaction that creates profitability in one area, while shutting down profitability in other areas. Now, this does not have to actually occur to begin a bubble. The perceived idea that it will occur in the future is what starts the bubble. The Dot Com bubble started because the internet was going to revolutionize the way that people do business. The same can be said for Bitcoin. It may one day revolutionize the way people exchange money, but how? Like the Dot Com bubble, investors are throwing money into cryptocurrencies without really knowing the magnitude of change it will create.

Along the lines of not knowing the magnitude of change is the fact that these currencies are unregulated. At any time one government or another can setup laws that either hurt the viability of the currency, or outright ban it. A popular conception of cryptocurrencies is that they are used to exchange money without any government intervention or insight. They are used to launder money or exchange illegal goods on a black market behind the backs of regulators and law enforcement.  All it will take is enough bad press of the currency for law makers to act on it. When ransomware thieves around the globe are asking to be paid in Bitcoin, politicians will eventually denounce the currency to win more votes.

Credit Creation

This stage of the bubble is formed when there is monetary expansion and/or credit creation. This fuels the fire, and causes the bubble to inflate. As more money is thrown into the asset, prices go up. As prices go up, it fuels even more expansion because people are seeing great returns and want to get in on the action. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Currently, United States investment assets are inflated, especially in the bond market (read “Unintended Consequences of Easy Monetary Policy“). Highly liquid markets fuel asset bubbles, and in this case, they are also fueling Bitcoin. As investors have more money to invest, they need to figure out where to put it. If they cannot find an asset that looks great because valuations are so high, they turn and look at Bitcoin and think “Wow it has returned 2, 3, 400%, I want in!” This in turn raises Bitcoin prices and makes another investor put their money in too. This is the self-fulfilling prophecy. Investors perceive the asset as being a good investment when really it just the demand for the asset pushing prices up, not value.

Euphoria

Euphoria is the third stage of the bubble, and I believe Bitcoin is in this stage. This stage is when the returns of the asset are so great that people invest because of the fear of missing out. Their friends tell them that they made all of this money in Bitcoin, they see charts popping up on their newsfeeds that say “If you invested $10k 7 years ago, you would have over $700 million…” This inflates the bubble. People see these images and get upset that they have not already invested. $10k into $700 Million? Who doesn’t want a piece of that action?

Another euphoric characteristic of cryptocurrencies is that every company seems to want their own. Companies are having ICOs, or initial coin offerings, where they start their own cryptocurrency and raise money through the offerings. Burger King released a version of cryptocurrency called the WhopperCoin. This is just like the Dot Com bubble. “Companies” opened a website and went public. Investors threw cash at them simply because they had a website. The same is happening with these ICOs. Investors are throwing cash everywhere with the hope that one of them will be the next Bitcoin and turn their $10k into $700 million.

Financial Distress and Revulsion

These are the last two stages of a bubble. Financial Distress is characterized as insiders see the end is near, and they start to get out. They sell their shares because they know they are not sustainable, and that share prices are going to fall. I am not aware of insiders of Bitcoin, but eventually people are going to cash out, and it is going to cause enough damage to scare everyone out of it. This will cause a spillover into the other types of cryptocurrency, and only the very strong will be able to survive.

Revulsion is when people are hurt by the bubble popping. They are hurt so badly that they refuse to go back into the investment, even if it becomes a good value. This is the final stage of a bubble.

Some readers may be thinking that the I am wrong and that this will change the future. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will change the way people pay for groceries, pay for movie tickets, and pay for their Amazon orders. They may not see or they simply ignore the similarities of Bitcoin to the Dot Com bubble. Well here is my rationale on why a global currency, without the rule of government, will not occur.

Future Global Currency?

If you were to ask me while I was taking my college economics classes “What is the quickest way to make markets more efficient?” I would have told you a global currency. A global currency would get rid of exchange rates, it would make transactions a lot easier, and it would make investing easier as well. It makes markets more efficient because there is no reason to worry about exchange rates. You would be able to go to any country and spend the same currency as your home country. It is like having a Euro in the Euro Zone, but for the entire world. The problem with the Euro however, is that some countries want a strong Euro while others want a weak Euro at the same time. If the Euro was not competing against other currencies, none of that would matter though. You would also be able to order anything online from anywhere, and not have to worry about exchange rates. Have you tried to order something you had to pay for in a different currency? It is intimidating and it will usually cost you extra money in fees.

It would make investing easier as well. A global currency means that you do no need to worry about exchange rates and revenue return. Suppose a company is in a US Dollar strengthening environment. As the dollar strengthens their goods become more expensive. The exchange rate works negatively in their favor, and it reduces their returns. the company either leaves prices the same, and sell less, or they lower their prices and their margins take a hit. Either way, the company loses revenue and their balance sheets weaken. The current monetary structure requires analysts to determine the future strength or weakness of the currency, and how that will affect revenue streams. A global currency can eliminate this. So with all the good a global currency can achieve, why won’t we have one in the near future?

If there is anything the recent Brexit vote and election of President Trump have taught us is that people do not trust immigrants, foreigners, and globalization. Books can be written, and many have been, on why these are all important and good factors to a capitalist economy. However, not enough people understand, or want to understand how these help. Because of this, a global currency cannot be achieved.

A global currency would have to be run by someone. It would require a panel of people from around the world to make monetary and policy decisions. There is enough people that feel the United Nations, NATO, and International Monetary Fund do more harm to their country then good. They have elected a president that threatens to restructure, leave, or pull funding from these organizations. They see globalization as a bad thing, so how could they ever go for a global currency? Simply put, there will be foreign people making decisions, and because of this they will never trust it.

The Future of Bitcoin

Left unregulated Bitcoin may stay around, but only to fill a niche market of money laundering and black market deals. Once it is regulated, it is hard to see what it becomes. It may become an internet currency, where users can only purchase these coins to do a transaction, but most of their funds remain in a normal currency.

Blockchain, on the other hand, will stick around. The technology is already being invested in by most big banks, and even the Federal Reserve. This tool will make financial institutions much more efficient. If it can be properly implemented, bank processes will be cut down. This will save time, and hopefully keep extra dollars in their consumers accounts.

personalfinance,Using HELOC to pay down mortgage faster?,"I’m wondering if anyone on here has knowledge on the method of using a heloc as a “checking account” to keep the interest rate payments low because you’re putting all your income towards that balance every month and use that line of credit to make large payments towards your mortgage to pay it off faster and obviously pay less in interest. I️ know there has been some skepticism on this topic on past posts but the concept seems to make sense to me, and most of the skepticism seemed to come from people who didn’t take time to fully understand the method. I️ understand the risk of a variable interest rate with a heloc but supposedly you can find ones where you can lock in a rate. I️ also understand that you need to have a positive cash flow for this to work. I’m looking for possible reasons why this might not work or people who have done this themselves and how it worked out for them. I’m also not looking for the whole “it doesn’t make sense to take out a higher interest rate loan to pay off another loan” argument because that is over simplifying it.",finance

The difference between the two is something I understand.

And the Apply as Refund option says: ""This selection only affects accounts that aren't in repayment yet AND are within 120 days of you receiving loan funds."" Technically I would not be able to pick this option if I translated that right. Im confused as to why it is still an option at this point.

If I have the option of the two which would be best? I plan on making a monthly payment that is 55% more of the current monthly dues.

personalfinance,Laurel Road Parent Plus Refinance,"Has anyone ever refinanced their parent plus loans into their name using Laurel Road?  I've been shopping around for rates on this and Laurel Road seems to have the lowest rate for me.  Basically, my dad has a parent plus loan for me at about 34k at 6.7% and my mom has one for about 27k at 6.4%.  I want to refinance them altogether into my name and got an offer from Laurel at about 5.35%..  To me this would be worth getting it out of my parents names, getting a lower rate, and just the convenience of having them all with one servicer.  I considered looking at having one of them cosign but it only brought Laurel Road down to about 5.1% (I also looked into SoFi but their rate w/o a cosigner was like 6.3% and with was about 5.1%).  My parents are divorced and are obviously separate financial entities so I really have no argument in using one of them as a cosigner (essentially taking one of my parents debt and laying it on the other, which I'm sure would affect their credit).  So as of right now, I'm thinking my option is to go with Laurel Road's offer to refinance without a cosigner.  Does anyone have any experience with them or parent plus refinancing? My application was accepted and they said 5.35%..  Can I expect this number to stay the same or is there a chance it will go up matching more of something like SoFi's rate in the sub 6's? Does the 10 year fixed rate actually remain fixed or is it written somewhere that this could increase?


To my knowledge, parentplus loans are considered federal loans which implicates possible federal loan benefits (forgiveness, stopping payment if I can't afford), but I really don't see myself using any of these.  Is there any other reason I might shy away from using Laurel Road from this aspect?",finance
personalfinance,Forced to take a loan to pull bank account back from the deep red (Germany),"After a series of bad decisions over the past two years I am now pretty much forced to take a credit of around 7k Eur. Around 5.5k from it will cover my credit card (2.5k) and the overdraft (2.5k and counting) on my bank account. The rest is a small buffer. 

&amp;nbsp;

It is hard to translate some terms from German, so please bear with me :(

&amp;nbsp;

**- Credit conditions**

My loan is for 8250 Eur total. 7k Eur from it goes to my bank account, 1200 is for the additional insurance(s) they are offering me (sounds a bit expensive). The base insurance is for the case I pass away; since I ride motorcycle this is pretty much mandatory for me (it is good to have anyway). There are also other benefits added to it: unemployment insurance and long term disability (incapable of working) insurance. The former seems to be useless to me as I work in the IT sector and im very capable. The latter might be useful due to my somewhat dangerous hobby (motorcycles). 

&amp;nbsp; 

* Loan period: **84 months**, completely free extra payments. 

* Interest: **9.49%** effective yearly interest rate, **Total interest** paid: **3250** Eur.

* Monthly payments: 137 Eur.

&amp;nbsp;

**- Income**

* 2250 / month
* Not guaranteed payments of up to 500 Eur / 3 months, yearly bonus of around 1-2k
* Will be getting much better the next year or two, im at the start of my career so I expect another 7-9% in spring, sadly split between the regular pay and the bonus.

&amp;nbsp;

**- Cost of living:**

* Rent: 500
* Retirement (private): 320
* Utilities/Internet/phone bills: 120

* Food: 200
* Drinks/food with friends: 250

Once I factor in the 137 Eur for the loan, im left with around 600 Eur of extra income. Motorcycle maintenance costs (currently low, oldish reliable bike) will be on top of this. And I also need to set aside a bit of cash each month. Wow, actually not a lot of breathing room.

&amp;nbsp;

**- Questions**

1)	First question: is 1200 EUR (for a 7k loan) a reasonable amount for an insurance? They are of course slapping it on top of the loan I want to take, which makes the whole ordeal more expensive. I can ask them to leave only the base insurance (death) so I dont leave a nice surprise to my parents in case I pass away prematurely. I am just not sure that this will noticeably reduce the amount.

&amp;nbsp;

2)	Loan period is 84 months, 9.49% effective yearly interest rate. Is this too long for such a credit and isn’t it making it too expensive? Whenever I get some bonus from work I can set aside at least the half and advance on my credit that way. Wouldn’t it be better to reduce the period by 6-12 months if im going to be doing this anyway?

&amp;nbsp;

3)	Would paying off a year worth of loan as extra payments have the same effect as taking the loan over 72 instead of 84 months?",finance

personalfinance,Currently have a $1000 CD 0.35% CD that matures yearly.,"I currently have a CD through my bank that matures yearly. I've had it since I was 16, and I put $1000 in it. It matures yearly, on January 1st, and has a locked in interest rate of 0.35%. 

I'm just not getting much from this, and I didn't really intend to get this when I got it when I was 16. I was getting a personal loan, so I could get some credit, and it paid back into this CD. 

I spoke with my banker when I closed my account at that bank earlier this year (they wanted $10 per month for me to keep my checking account, no thank you), and he said on January 1st, I have 5 days to withdraw or renegotiate a better rate for the CD, and then it closes for another year.

My question is, what are my investment options when this matures at the first of the year? It's barely gaining $1 per year, so I'd like to either make more money off of it, or throw it into a motorcycle for personal pleasure/increased gas mileage (saving money on gas). 

I currently don't have any other investments except for a few hundred dollars in bitcoins, just for kicks and giggles, and that's paid off well so far. But I'm not sure that I want to invest this money in that, or like I said, either save on gas, or make it maybe find a better rate, or another alternative.",finance

personalfinance,What Would You Do? High Earner. Good Debt vs. Bad Debt,"Hi Reddit. I have an question about debt that I'm hoping you can help with. This is a throw away account because last time I posted on this sub I got beat up pretty good (bad debt + high earnings) and I'd rather not give myself away. Anyways, at the time of my last post, I was very new to making good money and straddled with debt due to leveraging credit to help get my wife through graduate school. I came to this sub because I was frustrated with the amount of debt we had and wanted some help. The truth is, I should have been patient. It's amazing how time + money can change you're situation.  

On to the question at hand. The only debt I have remaining is student loans and our mortage/car and I wanted to get your take on how you would handle it if you were in my shoes. A little about me. 

Financial Profile
- 35 years old - male

- Make roughly $200-250k annually (however, only $100k is base salary and the rest is commission that comes non regular (3-4 months will be $0, 3-4 months at $1-2k and 3-4 months at $2-10k and maybe 1-2 at $10-50k). 

- Mortgage - I owe $350k on a house that is worth $550-$575k

- 401k - $120k balance - I contribute 10% of my monthly salary and get a company match at 6% + extra 3% (so 9% match total). 

- Roth IRA - $25k balance. I contribute to that when I can. It's irregular, but I try to max it out every year.

- Personal Stocks - $100k - this is ESPP and personal money. On the ESPP, I must hold for a minimum of a year, which is fine by me for tax reasons.

- Cash - $10k

- Wife's student loans - $110k ($700 monthly payment). Roughly $30k of the loans have an 8% interest rate. The remaining loans are low interest rate (4%). 

- My student loans - $10k ($80 monthly payment)- low interest (4%).

- My wife had been working full time for the last 5 years, but recently stopped to stay at home. She has never had any retirement accounts or benefits. She may go back to work in the next 2-3 years. 

So, if you were me, would you take what money I have in stocks and pay off  student loan debt? All of it? Just the high interest loans? 

Part of me wants to pay it all off, but another part of me feels like we shouldn't do that. Remember all retirement comes from me, my wife has none. Plus, I'm doing better on the stock market (up 22% this year and 15% over the last 3), so why not let my money accrue and then pay it all off 5-10 years down the road? We can easily make our monthly payments as is stands today. 

Also, keep in mind that it's very hard to use large sums or pay much extra monthly due to my irregular commission. I need to save money when I get a good commission check to help cover bad months. I also invest so heavily in retirement (ESPP = 10%/ 401k = 10%). That we often live check to check (we try not to touch our ESPP and think of it as retirement as well). Obviously when I get a very large check I can apply some to student loans, but even a $30k commission becomes $15k after taxes, and everything and like I said, we try and save that for lean months. We probably do spend more than we should on entertainment/travel etc. Also, what they say is true, you make more, you spend more. But I don't feel all that bad about it because we work hard and we don't sacrifice our retirement. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Kay jewlers is screwing me around,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here…and naturally, I’m seeking some help with an area I simply don’t know much about. At this point I’m desperate and would appreciate it more than anything if someone knowledgeable had 5 minutes to look over this…


Bit of a background: I’m recently engaged, with a solid income. My student debt is paid off, and I have a little over $20k USD to my name. 

I also have never had a credit card. I’ve had a debit card for the past 7 years, and have always, always paid cash for everything. Cars, tuition, etc. Never had an student/bank loan (I was fortunate enough to borrow money from my grandfather, then pay him back…no taxes, no interest, etc..)


Anyhow, the pickle I’m in:

I was picking a ring for my fiancée. I kept insisting I wanted to pay for it all up front. (Normally I’m the one doing the persuading…but the salespeople at Kay were relentless). The sales guy talked me into getting a “Kay jewlers card”, talking about how I needed to build credit by making payments on it. Fine, okay, I concur this is a good idea. Pay a fraction up front, get the ring and the wedding band, all is well. 

Now come the problems. I can’t set up my user account on the internet. No biggie, I call customer service and after a lengthy wait the rep assures me the issue is “fixed” but I can pay over the phone if the online account ever doesn’t work. (since it’s connected through my SSN + birthday). I pay over the phone for that month. 

Next month rolls around. Can’t login to user account again. Call customer service again. They seem unaware of why I can’t log in – they suggest I go into the store. Pay over the automated phone service again. 

See where this is going? Salespeople in store can’t help me. They refer me to calling the corporate line again. Pay over the phone by talking to a robot again. Rinse and repeat, 5 months later.

I’m fed up with it, but even more of a problem, I’m realizing I don’t even understand how a credit card works. I pay my bill over the phone every month, and this “kay credit card” sits untouched in my wallet. 

I’m upset that nobody at that company can help me out either. I’ve tried time and time again to get access to my online account but have failed every single time. 
So I’m asking….would it be plausible to go demand to pay off my entire ring in one payment? I just hate dicking around on the phone for x amount of time each time I need to pay my bill. 

I don’t give a crap about building credit at this point, I just want to break the chains holding me to this organizations crappy customer service. 

I’m asking you all: Is there a way to benefit from me paying it off all at once?
Like I said, I don’t know anything about credit cards. I feel like an idiot because I don’t have anyone else to turn to for help (my finacees never had one either).

 I just want to come out of this on top….

personalfinance,I have paid off 10k of debt so far this year! Thanks Personal Finance!,"Here is how I paid off 10k of debt in a little under a year. It wasn't easy, and I had to change my mindset and my style of living, picking up a second job at first but its doable. This community has helped get me on track. Sorry for wall of text and bad formatting. I hope that this story and what I have done will help others.

Some background: 22M had a easy job supervising at a factory. Pure luck to land such a good job, No college degree, Just 3 years of debt. I never finished my degree in Computer science. I got a supervisor job making 17 n hour in the mid west. I was able to get unlimited overtime and as you can imagine I lived at work. I was bringing home 1800+ every biweekly check. I worked a lot but I also made a lot. Having more money that I could spend made me develop some bad habits, I always ate out, I didn't pay attention to how much I was spending. Here are some things I did that may not be wrong choices for everyone , but were wrong for me mainly because I didn't think long term. I bought a new car, I financed a $12000 Acura, put 3k down. Loan for 9000. Payments 179 a month. I could pay that easy! Insurance for my new car went up, Young single guy, I went from 50 a month for my 2002 Saturn sedan to 170 a month for my Acura, Whatever. I make plenty. I just got my own place-I need furniture- Finance 2000 for living room set. 150 a month. I can afford another payment! Who cares! I had applied for a credit card because..Free money right?! I make enough to pay a credit card. 1200 limit, Maxed out shortly after. I liked spending money and not watching it come out of my bank account. I never considered interest or how to properly use a credit card. At this point I meet a woman who I really like, Any spare money I would spend on her, or going out with her. Dinner, Bars, concerts. I didn't have a limit. Money never seemed to be an issue. I could just work more hours.
Fast forward a little bit

We moved in together, she came with a dog, and she wanted another one. I bought a dog. Never thought about the costs of feeding and taking care of 2 dogs. I bought her a car, I financed 19500 for a Ford Escape. 380 a month. I can work more hours..You see where this is going? I decided I didn't want to rent anymore, rent was 650 and I wanted my own place. I make plenty of money I am just going to buy a house. I actually saved money by buying a house, rent went from 650 to a mortgage of 420. Still wasn't thinking about debt to income and how these things affected my credit. Want to marry this woman, I finance a ring 50 bucks a month. (She said yes!) Kirby salesman shows up and I bought a 2000 vacuum because i had money to spend. 75 a month Our washer and dryer broke. Instead of buying used or scratch and dent I went new and financed 1500 on a lowes credit card.

Get an opportunity to take a more stable job, Something in IT where my feet could get in the door without a degree, get paid 19 n hour so an hourly increase but I lose overtime. I made a spreadsheet and look at bills. Its going to be close but It was doable. I talk it over with my future wife and we agree its going to be tight but its worth doing long term.

This is when I realized I didn't have a dime to show for all the hours working at the factory. I had absolutely nothing in my savings account. This is also when things started to go downhill, I got t-boned coming home from work one morning, I didn't have gap insurance on my car loan, I got stuck with the remainder 7000 debt on a car I no longer have. Then the trip to the doctors after the crash. 1000 dollar trip. Two months later I had to have my wisdom teeth out there was another 2000 in debt. Things kept going downhill, and I didn't have a emergency fund, and I couldn't work more hours. I was stuck. After adding the new debt as a household we had negative -19 dollars at the end of the month. This was a wake up call. I couldn't pay my bills. I was honestly scared, I felt vulnerable and really stupid. At this point I sat down and looked at things I could cut out to save money upfront.

I had a couple good things on my side, I had a company car so the issue of transportation was temporally solved. I also had a company phone so I could get rid of my personal one. Getting rid of my personal phone, +100 Stop paying insurance on a car I no longer have. +179 I set up a budget and started paying attention to the things I didn't need like eating out. I canceled my gym memberships because I could work out at home. +40 I read that tackling the debts with the high interest rates will be the best bet. I decided I would take that approach after I freed up cash to make it easier overall. I got a second job in the meat department at Kroger to help pay down the furniture, freeing up 150 a month. +150 (Kroger didn't pay much I made about 250-300 a month working 4 hours a day after work during the week) every little bit helps though. This is where things started taking off, I started to take all of the profits and applying it to one single debt. I started with credit cards, The majority of my other debts were interest free for a certain amount of time. I was able to pay off two cards that I had only been making minimum payments on +50 I got a bonus at work and applied all of that to my dental bill. +99 I got a raise at work and had +100 a month for pay raise. My wife worked a little overtime when she could to try to help out. That made the process easier. We used all of the extra to throw at whatever debt we were tackling that month. It took about 4 months before I really started to see it start to ""snowball"" and grow. I am applying around 1200 a month now to debts each month.
Through the entire process I tracked our misc spending. I wanted to reward myself for making progress but I didn't want to blow all of my progress. I compromised by only going out for dinner once a month instead of ever week. I stopped going into the store when I got gas, little things that added up. https://imgur.com/7NGtBaO

I started with a budget, Changed how I spent money, got a second job, and made it a full time job running numbers and managing my finances. I became obsessed with my spread sheets, my budgets. Even with paying all of this off we have been able to take a week long vacation where we traveled to Maine and have slowly been able to transition into doing more leisure activity and spending. I kept track of all my debt with this sheet here is a current snap shot https://imgur.com/O6BDcec

Here is a current budget- Most of our cash balance is going to paying off the rest of my Acura, and building a 6 month emergency fund. We have about 4 months now. Gas and electric are rounded up to offer some buffer in other areas incase there is a fluctuation we average 100 for electric and depending on the time of year we go 50-100 on gas, Our buffer is around 100 a month. Maybe we tracveled a little more and payed more in gas, or we went over our spending budget because I needed new shoes. The buffer may not be the most accurate but I found it helped me stay within a budget and helped me feel like I was still on track the months I messed up.

I'm wondering what the legal ramifications would be if I were to apply for another unsecured auto loan but use the money to consolidate some debt at a 4.5% rate instead of something closer to 7.5% for a personal/consolidation loan from the same provider.

Is it just unethical or is there some level of fraud? Obviously 3% isn't too much of a difference if the risk are high but I'd like to get the best rate possible if there's no risk.

I have great credit and I'll have no trouble paying off the loan, I just want to get it consolidated to cut down on the interest rates and simplify the budget.

My life has always been led by small financial blunders, but I've always managed to pay my bills in full and on time - save for being able to ""pay myself first"" by putting money into savings. 

Sadly, the most money I've ever seen in my savings account at one time has been $800 (I am 22), before promptly blowing it all away because of a car repair. Now all that remains is a measly $50 which has been true for the better part of half a year. I owe $1500 on my maxed out credit card, and I'm beginning to struggle with paying my bills.

personalfinance,Which type of loan to pay off first?,"I have a couple thousand dollars that I'm planning on putting toward my debt. I have several student loans totaling about $32k and am currently in deferment. I also have a car loan for roughly 16k (although Citizen's Bank is apparently super difficult to figure out anything other than how to make a payment, so I can't see my current balance).
For the student loans: I make periodic payments when I can, and my highest interest rate is 5.33%, which I would pay on first.
For the car loan: I have an automatic payment set up and an interest rate of 4.95%.

It makes sense to me to pay on the highest interest loans first, but a professor recently told me that the way student loan laws are changing, I'm better off paying the minimum because it's likely that I won't be required to pay the full amount in the end anyway, and non-student debt will be a bigger factor when I want to apply for a mortgage years from now.

personalfinance,I cannot afford to lose my sanity (US/PA),"Long story short, earlier this year I got laid off as a software developer. I quickly got a job doing retail, and earned a bunch of certifications while being underemployed (A+/Network+/Security+/Project+/MCSD). I've been managing my bills the best to my ability, cut out expenses, but fact of the matter is I'm hemorrhaging money.

I just recently got a part-time job as a specialized software developer at my local university to compliment my full-time job, doing retail (started last week). My retail job is $10/hr with no benefits of any kind, and I honestly do not know what my part-time job pays, but as I'm a principal investigator on this interactive project I know it's more than $10/hr. I also drive Uber; I have a second vehicle that I use just for driving Uber in.

Last week I worked 80+ hours total between all three gigs, and this week will be around 85+. Next week, it'll be around 80.

To say that I strongly dislike my retail job is an understatement, and I really want to give notice because *something has to give in my schedule*. In two weeks, I have a full-time job interview lined up at the same university that has the part-time job. As I'm already an employee, if offered the job I could start immediately.
Catch being, it's also a possibility that I *won't* get the job.

What should I do? Financially speaking, my emergency savings is running low and I'm financially fucked either way (quitting or not quitting) if I don't get the full-time job.

Due to an $10K investment into a business earlier this year that flopped, I'm not expecting to pay much in the way of federal taxes on my Uber income. I could drive more to offset the lack of retail income, and then dedicate more time to my part-time software engineering job - this job has a strong possibility of becoming *full-time* if the tech demo I'm working on is a success for the department.

Any suggestions?

personalfinance,"Thinking I should refinance my mortgage, but not sure...","I bought my house 3 years ago as an FHA first-time home-buyer.  I have $136k left on it, and I am decently sure my house is worth around $180k.  I didn't know when I first bought it that the Mortgage Insurance would last the entire length of the mortgage.  Home-values in my area have gone up, and I got a really great deal to begin with, so I'm confident that I have at least 20% equity.  

So that brings to me thinking that I should refinance to save the money I feel I'm wasting on the PMI.  

Quick stats:

* Original Loan Amount - $144k

* Left on Loan - $136k

* Current Effective Interest Rate - 4.125%

* Principal &amp; Interest per month - $700

* PMI - $150


The other thing in the back of my head is that my wife and I are really starting to think about having a baby.  This affects the house in that it is a pretty small house.  We can manage in it with an infant, but we'd probably move by the time the kid is a toddler.

So with all that in mind, is it a good idea to refinance at all, and if so, do I just continue with a new 30-year fixed...would a hybrid ARM be good to save money, or is that just risky...  I started looking at rates and was being quoted about the same at the few places I was looking:

Loan Type     --     Interest Rate      --      APR       --     Monthly Payment

* 15 Years Fixed     --   2.990%     --         3.105%	--     $939

Bitcoin,Money is a game. Why would you ever choose to play a badly designed game?,"Above game theory there is a formalized branch of mathematics known as-  
  
#Game Design Theory  
  
Well there isn't to my knowledge, but there totally should be.  Maybe there already is and it's existence has been kept a secret because it's too powerful.  Anyway, game theory attempts to phrase all mutually complex interactions with formal mathematical descriptions... Whereas game design theory formally defines various games that one could design, with the end goal being to create the most attractive and compelling games to a perfectly rational participant.  Humans are rarely rational creatures so the proper effects of this can usually only be seen on very large (i.e. planetary) scales. 
 
Language is a good example of good game design theory winning out.  Religion was another.  Computer operating systems yet another.  The best languages and religions that we invented as a growing species were ones that followed certain patterns and had certain qualities.  These grew organically as their development was too complex for a single human to author.  Note that I didn't say any of these 'game systems' were perfect, just good enough that they provided the average participant a benefit that organisms outside the game did not have... Which was enough to ensure the games' continued existence and success on the meta-civilization scale.  
  
Though there were many languages, Latin based systems won out (amid other possibilities) due to certain egalitarian qualities at their base layer, allowing the average player to enjoy a huge number of benefits, even when interacting with someone much already fluent. 
 
Consider religion too - though many consider it a great evil of our society, and though true that many horrors have been committed in the name of religion, it was an important social glue for civilization for many eons.  The best religions were the ones which allowed anyone to achieve a high degree of divinity and were easily accessible.  They were games that fed off certain human needs, and they provided their players with not only innate perks of playing (*""hey, no more worrying about what happens after death! it's actually gonna be okay... if you play our game!*"") but also they gave all players an equal platform and new type of language on which to exchange power, value, and affection.  (*""totes sending prayers boo!  miss uuuu💜💕✌️""*) 
 
I leave it to the reader's imagination how the most effective and viral forms of OS were also the best designed 'games"". 
 
------------ 
 
*""Is this off topic?""*  
*""No, go fork yourself.* **You're** *off topic*"".  
  
Welcome to the new world of  
#Blockchains as a game  
  
They, like many marvelous new systems before them, are indeed abstract games.  And they were designed with certain principles at their core.  Let us call a game that gives an author a massive disproportionate advantage not just an asymmetrical game but an **asymptotic one**.  Such games correspond to early religions where one player was deemed the God Emperor and had powers and privileges that no other player could ever possess, no matter how hard they worked. 
 
New rational players, if given a choice, should never play such a broken game.  However for many earlier humans, they sadly didn't have a choice.  Threat of physical violence compelled them to endure such horrific games, and indeed the threat of physical violence is one of the chief tools to coerce unwilling participants to play your shitty design.  
   
*Now here is what I consider one of the greatest miracles in the history of civilization*: **The first true blockchain, Bitcoin, was a new type of game with true egalitarian rules at its outset**.  I have trouble thinking of other games which gave all willing participants such astounding equal opportunity, though democracy and came pretty close.  Anyone could become a minter of this new currency, and the only advantage Satoshi (the 'author') had was that they knew about it before anyone else.  And even this advantage has been mitigated in the best way possible by ensuring the original tokens have never moved.  Such celestial-tier elegance of design is most assuredly beyond the comprehension of most humans.  
  
A good game gives equal possibility of victory to all participants, regardless of when or how they start playing.  Now, egalitarian doesn't mean equal.  Indeed, many of the benefits of a game system cannot exist when all players are forced to remain equal... Such a thing destroys the very concept of a game.  Nature will never be equal.  There will always be powerful and poor in a system.  However, in the best games even the poorest and newest players are still fundamentally playing the same game the author was.  
 
#Friends Don't Let Friends Play Bad Games 
 
The entire idea of an ICO is antithetical to the idea of a well designed game.  It immediately creates a line of insiders and outsiders (**power players vs. normals**) and ~~decimates~~ centimates (*a new word I just made up which means double-decimates*) the value proposition of a new blockchain. 
 
By people like Vitalik being a known entity which arbitrates and influences token assignment (which literally already happened after the DAO fiasco) and holds a titanic amount of value he spawned himself with (meaning he just started the game that way and didn't earn it fairly in equal competition with other players) it means Ethereum is a shitty designed game - the religious equivalent of ancient Egyptian theocracy.  It's only marginally better than the Federal reserve which forces people stuck in the USD game endure their masters creating new wealth out of thin air in perpetuity.  
 
**Bitcoin** on the other hand has done quite the opposite - allowed all players an equal chance to accrue tokens alongside the ongoing authors of the system.  No sole player is a God-master of this game system, and when charismatic personalities rise and try to exert undue influence on it, we inevitably see their egos get stomped.  *Quality designed games always trump poor ones, in many cases even technically superior ones*. 
 
Fortunately we don't have to make such a distinction.  Just commit yourself to only supporting elegant and fair blockchains from a game design theory standpoint.  By being part of a game system you are entering a powerful bond of communication and cooperation with your fellow players, one which if cultivated properly will allow you to socially and financially evolve exponentially faster than players stuck in broken systems.  There's a reason we don't have Egyptian God-kings anymore. 
 
Physics is a game too, but we just don't get to choose whether we want to play it.   Fortunately it's a good one since we all have a totally egalitarian set of rules we abide by.  You are apparently (you're reading this shit aren't you?) involved in some of the most advanced game constructs that our universe has ever knowingly created. And since blockchains are games you actually get to *choose* your involvement in... Why would you ever willingly be part of an asymptotic one? 
 
Fuck ICOs.  Send them your prayers boo 💜🙏🙌 because they're gonna need them to pass along to their God-kings once the shit hits the fan.

SDSU offers the Perkins loans and I plan on taking the maximum I can out ($12,500 I think, my parents are not eligible for PLUS loans). This leaves me with $19,550 to pay for SDSU and living there. 

I created a budget containing Rent, Tuition, Groceries, Gas, Books, Subscriptions (just spotify), and personal expenses. It came out to be ~$22000 for the year.

My summer job should make me ~$3600 and I'll also be working during the semester until summer. I've estimated this to be around a total of $7,500 to be made by the time I hit college.

In light of the meme-like rise of ""buying the dip"" as an investing strategy, I found this article a timely read as we look toward 2018. The article reiterates several macro themes we are all familiar with, but whose implications for investing strategy remain up for discussion. For instance:  

* **Soaring equity valuations** – Are they too rich to be reasonable, or are they supported by otherwise strong fundamentals, earnings momentum, and an ongoing Goldilocks environment?    

* **Rethinking risk/returns of different asset classes** – Examining the [earnings yield](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsyield.asp) for equities vs. bonds shows that equities are demonstrably the highest-returning investment this year. But if we give stock to the idea that equities are overvalued, should we shift to cheaper assets like fixed income and cash? 
 
* **The prospect of tightening monetary policy from central banks**, namely the Fed and the ECB, adds uncertainty into the mix. What will the rolling back or even reversal of quantitative easing hold for world markets? 

* For that matter, one might consider **changes in economic policy** e.g. Trump's coming Fed appointments, the prospect of tax cuts, and of course news from around the world.

btc,"Don't be fooled by the ""trillions"" of dollars of derivatives","We often compare bitcoin's potential to various market sizes such as gold, fiat money supply, equities, bonds, etc. But often the *big* punchline is the size of derivatives market being ""hundreds of trillions"" of dollars. I just wanted to inform the community that its wildly incorrect to be considering that amount, because derivatives are really complicated and basically it isn't any actual wealth held by anyone and can't be claimed. 

For example, when a new financial derivative like an interest rate swap is made, it's set at a ""fair value"" and is actually worth ZERO at that point in time (neither positive nor negative for the buyer or the seller), but the notional amounts could be millions or billions of dollars which are merely used as references to calculate a *change* in value for payout over time.

Another example, summing up all derivative notional values is as nonsensical as trying to add up every driver's collision insurance policy and claiming that sum as a form of wealth, but meanwhile of course we know that much wealth does not exist and is not held by the insurers.

personalfinance,Getting started investing while living abroad,"Hello all,

At age 27 I've finally gotten to a point in my life where I'm starting to put away money into savings instead of splurging every pay packet.


I'm a New Zealand citizen currently living in Singapore and see myself living here for at least the next few years, my job might offer me a chance to relocate to another country again in a few years time.

 I have about 35k NZD in student loans back at home with an interest rate of 4-5% (interest free if I move back to New Zealand) , currently paying them off at the minimum required while living overseas, 3k per year. 

I have an emergency fund that would last me a long while if I ever lost my job and had to go home to NZ. 

My savings account in Singapore is only earning about one percent interest and so I'm interested in investing into some index funds with some of the money I'm squirrel in away each month as I've read here that it's a good way to start saving towards retirement.

As someone living abroad what are my options when it comes to investing?

Should I be sending money back to New Zealand and investing it there, or investing it here in Singapore?

If I was to invest here what would then happen when I decide to move to another country or back home to New Zealand?

Alternatively is there some kind of online global way to invest in this way where moving countries wouldn't complicate anything? 

Or should I forego even thinking about investing until I pay off my student loan? 

Apologies in advance as I'm completely clueless when it comes to investments!

Thank you to anyone who might have some advice for me!

Edit: some more info incase it matters!

Earning 4000sgd per month. 

No other loans outside of student loans.

It's pretty expensive to live in Singapore but I'm ending each month with about $1000 left over so would like to invest maybe $500 a month and use the rest for travelling.

SG and NZ dollar are almost identical in value.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Discussion: Macro economics and crypto currencies,"Reposting this from /r/ethtrader. Hope that's ok. 

I had an interesting discussion with a colleague today. Imagine a world where cryptocurrencies are widely adopted and considered currencies (or alternatively: it has become the default global currency).

In modern macro economics, policy makers and central banks can affect a country's competitiveness through interest rates which in turn appreciate/depreciate a currency, which consequently impact the prices of goods and services in that country relative to other countries. That would by definition not be possible with a decentralized cryptocurrency, as it is purely driven by supply/demand. How would the macro economic environment be impacted in the example of a world with a global cryptocurrency? If you no longer can affect countries' competitiveness through interest rates, then how could it be affected? And should it?

My colleague also made a claim that all fiat currency markets are zero sum-games, in which one person's win is another person's loss. Crypto on the other hand, is not, he claims, and made the classic ""it's a ponzi scheme"" argument. What would be counter arguments in this case (where I'm arguing crypto's case, not bashing fiat)?

Hoping we can keep this relatively serious.",cryptocurrency

Previous bills by the state Legislature authorizing an expansion had been vetoed by Governor LePage. Additionally, a special election is being held in HD-56 of Maine's lower House. Democrats retain a narrow 77-72 majority in the state House (Republicans retain a narrow 18-17 majority in the state Senate).

personalfinance,Am I saving too much?,"Hey PF Gurus! Need some advice as well as some thoughts. I am 32 years old and a manager for a telecommunications company. I make about 72K a year and I have a 401k and a pension. With my pension the company contributes 12% and I contribute 3%. On the 401k the company contributes 3% and I contribute 6%. Combined on all those retirement accounts, about 24% of what I make goes to retirement and with my only debt being my mortgage, I save about $1600 a month now. I have 20k in savings and owe about 99K on a house worth 150K. The reason I want to keep saving is I would like to pay off my house in less than 4 years. Am I crazy for wanting to pay off my house so early? The interest rate on my  house is 3.875% and I'm about 5 years in. Pension is worth about 24k and 401k worth 48K at current moment. Any thoughts and opinions would be helpful.",finance
personalfinance,fraudulent FedEx charges turned over to Transworld debt collection... What do I do?,"Hi all, I'm not 100% what to even do about this. 

Back in May, I ordered a $50 item that was heavy off of eBay and paid through Paypal. It came faster than I expected as the seller had overnighted it, which I thought was weird. 

Fast forward to last night - I got a collections notice from Transworld Systems Inc to the tune of $232. What I was able to gather from a call to the debt collector and then FedEx Revenue Services and the airbill scan included in the envelope was that apparently, the seller had provided a fake FedEx account number and a completely illegible name and address. So, since FedEx couldn't collect the charges from the seller, they came after me. I get the feeling this was done on purpose, as there's no reason the seller would have charged me $50 for an item that was worth $60 and cost $232 to ship. FedEx claimed they sent me three invoices, none of which I received. This debt collection notice is the first of it that I received. 

I called the debt collector, they said they would investigate the legitimacy of the charges and answer within 30 days. I called FedEx Revenue Services and they confirmed the charges are legitimate and I'm obligated to pay them since I receive the item. I called Paypal and they can't help me, since they only cover whether the item was as described or not. I haven't called eBay yet, but I looked and the seller is still active on eBay who sold me this. 

so, /r/personalfinance, where would you go from here? I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to pay the $232, as it's a real slap in the face and I don't have the budget for it right now. What happens if I don't pay it? Will Transworld drop it since it's a relatively small amount in the grand scheme of things, or just ruin my credit?

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage company question,"So let me first start by saying I have never missed a mortgage payment - ever.  I'm on my third home (landlord) and have multiple units.  That is currently my living and my income is around 55,000.  I own several units outright (no mortgage)

I also have excellent credit (low 800's)

I also have one luxury unit that has a large mortgage and I have an interest rate at 4.625%.  I have a long term renter that has never been late or missed payment (but that part doesn't really matter)  

I contacted MY current mortgage holder to refinance and they said I didn't have the income to lower my payments (well, they actually said I didn't have the income to get a new mortgage, I just added the 'lower my payments' to show the absurdity of the situation)

So I have seen advertisements for 'no income check' applicants that promise the funds (with no closing costs!) and have a better rate. (places like cashcall or quicken loans, I think)

They sound a little risky if I thought I would have a problem.

We just sold $11,000 in shares of stocks in husband’s employer and aren’t sure what to do with the money.  We are thinking it would make the most sense to put it in the taxable account, but we aren’t sure if that’s the best choice.  We could also put it toward the mortgage, but aren’t sure that makes sense because we are most likely moving in the next five years--and possibly as soon as 2-3 years from now.  

We have also considered refinancing (our current mortgage is 30 years at 4.63%, but we could easily move to a 15 year with a lower interest rate because I’ve gotten some fairly significant pay raises since we bought the house about 3.5 years ago).  Not sure if that makes sense, though, if we are planning on moving relatively soon.

personalfinance,What do I need to do to move my auto loan to a different bank/lender?,"Hi, and thank you for reading. My current lender keeps pulling some really shady and aggravating moves on me, and my monthly payment keeps climbing up a little at a time (among many other complaints I have with the company). I want to transfer my loan to a different bank, which I think would be done through refinancing (I'm not 100% sure on vocabulary), and I was hoping I could get some advice/suggestions in some of the areas I'm a little hazy. 

- As far as I can tell, I can't access any of my loan information online without opening a checking or savings account with this bank, giving them my SSN and a picture of my drivers license, and making a minimum deposit into the account. This lender also only communicates through phone or paper mail. What information about my loan/account should I request they send me so I have the necessary tools in hand to refinance with another bank?

- I bought my car brand new from the dealer in February 2016, so I've been making payments on time for a year and 8 months, and I think it was a 6 year loan (might be 7. Information I need to get from this lender). Have I paid enough interest that I'm going to ultimately be paying more for the car by refinancing now? Does paying it off with my current lender early save me any money if I get a better interest rate with a new lender? Will I still have roughly 4 years left on the loan, or is it going to reset to 6 years?

- How/where should I shop for a new loan? Should I check out my local banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, or are there other options? Is this something I can shop around for on my own, or should I find an agent, or someone who does this for their job (if that's a thing)? 

I'd love any and all advice on this situation. This is really new territory for me, and I don't want to get fooled by some smooth talking agent into screwing myself because I don't know any better. Let me know if I need to give some more information on the situation, I wasn't sure what was relevant and I didn't want to bog the post down with unnecessary details. 

Thank you in advance. I literally just got off the phone with a rep from this lender and I'm so furious with how my issues have been handled I've hit my last straw. I need to get away from this bank.",finance

finance,Let's make forecasts about the next 10 years,"It seems that most people got the previous 10 years wrong. Those that predicted the housing crash of 2008 tended to get the collapse in commodities, gold and silver, and the rally in the US stocks, including tech stocks wrong. The boring /r/investing - type investors that trusted the central bankers and the US government surprisingly did very well.

So, WSB - if you had to make bets for the next 10 years, what would be your predictions and why? I will start, and if you don't have your own ideas you can tell me why mine are completely wrong:

There will be sovereign debt crises among the worlds' ""safest"" debtors, including the US government. This will really fuck things up for institutional investors, because suddently the risk-free rate will turn out to have been very risky.
Why: let's take the US as an example. People have been lending money to the US government at very low rates for 10 years and longer. The US now pays the same amount in interest as in 1980 - for whatever reason people have been OK to lend money to the US government at lower and lower rates despite the US racking up more and more debt instead of repaying it. If the rates go up, the US cannot even pay the interest on the debt - that will freak out the investors and cause the interest rates to go much, much higher, uncontrollably. The only people willing to lend the US money at low rates would be the Federal Reserve. That will lead to the US defaulting on a part of their debt through inflation, destroying much of the value of the USD. This will also make investors worry about other sovereign debt - in Europe, Japan and elsewhere - causing similar problems there as well.

The biggest wildcard is how China will be affected - whether they will let their currency get much stronger relative to the USD (good for China) or not. If relative valuations of currencies stay approx. the same as now, stock indices around the world will not be too much affected in real terms, apart from some short-term shocks, but gold will benefit hugely as governments will rush to exchange their devaluing foreign currency holdings into gold. If China allows its currency to appreciate, then US companies will really suffer (along with US consumers) and US stocks will tank. In fact, stocks around the world will experience a massive shock, but Chinese stocks should come out as the big winner as their companies reorient towards the domestic market.

Bitcoin may do well in the interim as well in case the first-world experiences hyperinflation, and people start actually using bitcoin at the grassroots. But I see a very slim chance of governments around the world letting that happen for long. But there is a slim chance that even though bitcoin is in a bubble right now (people only buying it to sell to the greater fool, not to use it), it may transition out of a bubble without the prices dropping as people actually start using it for day-to-day transactions.

Banks - the conventional wisdom is that rising long-term rates are good for banks. Banks borrow short-term and lend long-term. Short term rates going up are bad for banks, long-term rates going up are good for banks. Currently the spread is uncharacteristically small, which is bad for banks. The assumption is that as the spread increases with the rising rates, banks benefit because the long-term loans they make are adjustable-rate. I think the conventional wisdom will turn out to be wrong, because if long-term rates go up significantly people (who have no savings, plenty of debts and are living paycheck-to-paycheck if they are lucky to have a full-time job) will no longer be able to pay off their long-term debts like mortgages, leading to widespread defaults and losses for banks. So the markets may be too optimistic on banks in a rising-rate environment and in the next 10 years, it may be a good idea to short banks relative to the market. In the inflation scenario I described in point 1 you get people effectively defaulting on their loans through inflation, so that's bad for banks as well. This is a tough trade though, because banks will go up all the way until something gives - either the governments can't pay their debts, or the general public. Gold, however, doesn't have much lower to go, everyone already hates it (even WSB), making it a safer trade than shorting banks.
I don't see any way in which this scenario doesn't play out, and I would be really surprised if it doesn't play out in the next 10 years.",finance
personalfinance,Can I invest in an index fund without hiring someone?,"I’m married in my 40s. We have an 8th grader and a 5th grader. We contribute to our retirement accounts. We pay a mortgage, his student loans, and regular bills. No other debts.

We have about $200k just sitting in a MONEY MARKET account- not mutual fund. I was thinking of sticking $100K in a Vanguard Index fund and just letting it be. How do I choose one? Do I need a financial planner to tell me what to do?

We are fortunate to have maybe an extra 3-4K left over each month, so I’ve been sticking it in the mutual fund, and it has added up. But I’d like make more interest.

I've changed my W4 to withhold at a higher single rate so that will bring down the bill to about $1,000 but that doesn't solve our long term problem. 

We can adjust her W4 to “Married but withhold at the high single rate” but why wouldn’t the restaurant tax her at the right amount? 

Servers, have you had this kind of experience? 

EDIT: Added some details

We can cover the $1,400 no problem, don't even have to use emergency fund. We just want to make sure we don't get a big tax bill next year :) 

Also should mention again (if it wasn't clear above) that I've already adjusted my W4 to withhold at the higher single rate with 0 allowances. That should bring the bill down to about $1,000.",finance

personalfinance,529 College Savings Plan tax breaks via family contributions,"We have 3 years before the kids hit college.  We've been putting away only about $200/mo. each towards a Maryland 529 plan for most of their lives, so we're only a fraction of where we want to be.  We don't live in MD anymore, but our parents do.  I don't see any reason why we can't send the 529 contributions through them and have them get the state tax deductions for that value, which at their relatively high tax bracket should give at least a 10% instant return on the funds contributed, right?  I haven't seen any fine print that prohibits this, other than the $10k per person per year IRS family gift limit, which we should easily stay under.

We also have a bunch of big expenses coming up over the next year or so:  $20k to replace the roof on our house (which is what our neighbors pay, our HOA doesn't let anyone use the cheaper asphalt roofing), as well as ~$20k to replace our 10-year-old family car so the kid can start driving the old one next year.

Currently we've been able to save $1k per month (in addition to the $200/mo. for each kid's 529), and have just over $10k saved up, ostensibly for the roof.

My plan has been to transfer that $10k to my in-laws for the 529 plans, with the hope that they'll get at least $1k back on their state taxes next year, which they could split with us or more likely toss into the 529 plan for next year.  (Also want to get them into the habit of gifting our kids tax-deductible 529 contributions instead of cash for special occasions).  Then borrow the $20k from my 401k plan, so at least we're paying the interest back to ourselves over the next few years, minus the $100 loan application fee.  Similarly, we'd finance a ""new"" CPO car for 3-5 years, since it seems like there are good interest rates on those... like 0% and stuff.

The mortgage is our only debt right now, we refinanced last year and got rid of our home equity line of credit, so we can't use that for the roof.  I'm guessing that it might be advantageous to have a separate roof repair loan and a car loan on the books when it comes time to file the FAFSA. and then have the ability to pay them off shortly thereafter... when our financial lives aren't under such an intense a college financial aid microscope... but I don't know.  We have 2 kids off to college for about 7 years... what are the experiences of others for prepping and weathering through that part of life?

Versus just paying cash to fix our roof next year and trying to catch up contributions to the 529 plan ""later""... I think it's worth the effort for the MD tax deductions and a couple more years of untaxed growth... though really all of our money is going to end up with the schools anyway, it's just a matter of ""when"" :P",finance
personalfinance,"Thinking about consolidating credit card debt, question regarding interest rate.","I recently started making a budget and added up all of my credit card debt.

personalfinance,[auto] I need a new car for safety reasons. Don't have a lot of money and want to make sure I do this right.,"I'm having a baby in January, and my 1994 two door camry is not going to cut it for me for safety with her. My boyfriend has a 2004 forester, and that will likely be what whoever has the baby (usually me) will be driving. This is not an ideal setup as his car is still not as safe as I would like it and   he's not super excited about hashing to drive my POS camry. We have a small amount of cc debt (about $3500 combined) and we have been trying to pay off like 200- 400 dollars a month each on our cards to get them paid down as much as possible before the baby is born. Both of our cars are experiencing some issues that are going to cost too much to fix and I don't expect them to last a whole lot longer. Spreading ourselves thin we would be able to make a car payment no more than 350 a month. We have very good credit and we both have lines of credit already and credit cards with a combined limit of about 50k with 10% apr. If we were to get a car we would obviously want to do an auto loan with a lower interest rate though. 


We may have the opportunity to buy a 2002 lexus rx 300 from my aunt and she will give us a really good deal on it. Not sure what kind of deal it would have to be to make it worth it, as the car is getting up there in age and kbb puts it around 5k. Also if we wait a few years until she dies (this sounds shitty but..) my boyfriends grandma has willed us her 2016 forester that is payed in full. But I know we can't count on that. (and don't want to..) 

It is very important to me to get something safe. That's number one priority. I would like to get something as nice as possible that I can rely on and that will last at least 10 years into the future. (at which point any of our current options would be ancient).

personalfinance,Aggressively contribute to retirement or aggressively pay down debt,"Hello PF, just wanted to get your opinion on how to balance paying into a retirement fund vs aggressively paying down student loan debt. I already have a pretty solid emergency fund, so that is not an issue right now.

I just started at a company that has a 401k with some matching. Even though the wiki says to pay down debt before going ham with retirement, I feel like contributing aggressively now would allow me to let the retirement fund grow for a longer amount of time, which would hopefully outpace the loans with an interest rate between ~3.5-4.5% in the future. With compounding interest, I think that 30 years from now whatever I put in today will be worth way more than the total interest on these loans would be. So I would pay like a few thousand dollars more on the loans but that could translate to the 401k or other retirement account growing tens of thousands more a year.

Am I thinking about this wrong? Should I just contribute enough for the matching into the 401k and knock out the debt over the next 1-2 years, then worry about retirement or keep a schedule to pay off the debt in 5-6 years and contribute a bunch to retirement? Thanks guys.",finance

Bitcoin,Sidechain explained to people from the traditional system via analogy: The USD was a Sidechain of Gold between 1944 and 1971,"With the Bretton Woods treaty on 22 July 1944, the FED guaranteed to pay out 1 ounce of gold per each 35 USD (or to buy 1 ounce for 35 USD, i.e. a 2-way guarantee). So, everybody could use easy-to-handle USD bills instead of clumsy gold nuggets to pay the daily coffee, because of the fixed 2-way-peg between gold and USD, guaranteed by the FED. So USD was a ""proxy"" for gold.

This mechanism is to a certain extend quite well comparable (not ""identical"" of course) with sidechain and can serve as a first didactical explainer. For example you have a sidechain token called 1 rootstock that is worth 1 bitcoin, and protocol rules (or trusted members of a sidechain commitee - depending on the kind of peg) guarantee the bi-directional exchange between the two. Bitcoin is more ""clumsy"" (limited capacity), whereas the sidechain is more flexible and offers higher tx capa, so people will rather use rsk than btc tokens to pay their coffee.

Let's take the analogy a step further:

On 15 Aug 1971 president Nixon announced to quit the 2-way peg between gold and USD. So the Gold sidechain named USD survived 27 years and then became an ""independent"" chain (they created a new peg politically, this time to oil, but that is another story).

Price question: May the same happen to a future bitcoin-pegged sidechain?

We'll see. The next 22 July 1944, this time the crypto version of it, is yet ahead of us. Let alone the next 15 August 1971.

I've been reading through a bunch of different posts on consolidation and student loans, but I can't seem to find one that answers my predicament. 

I'm in a position where I started undergrad about 10 years ago (all private loan debt), got a masters and have 2 years left of medical school (all federal loan debt).

TL;DR: private loan debt payments due (no longer eligible for deferment), still in medical school and can't make payments. Wondering if consolidation is my best option here, or something else I haven't thought about.

Total:  $5670

That leaves me with $940

I want to dedicate $600 of that to paying down the second mortgage, but I am conflicted on how to go about it.  

#1. I could simply pay an extra $600 a month which would get it paid down in about 28 months.

#2. I could use my credit cards.  Between my husband and I we have 6 cards with $58,000 of available credit.  (We do not carry balances on these and they are paid off every month)  The idea being that we use the 0% interest offers and only use 30% of the credit availability.  For example.  Card has a $10,000 limit, I would use $3000 to pay down debt.  

The reason I want to do it this way is that I'm trying to reduce the amount of interst I pay on this loan over the course of the loan and large payments early on could reduce it by several thousand dollars.

What do you guys think?  Carrying cc balances makes me feel icky.  Is it worth the icky feeling?  What could go wrong?

personalfinance,How best to use 25K to pay off debts.,"So I have mostly made my decision on how to use this inheritance i have received but I wanted to run it by you guys to make sure I am doing things that make sense. FYI The debt listed below is my only debt and I have an emergency fund of 6 months expenses already saved.

Debt:

$54,000 Federal Student loans at 5.5% interest payment of $315 a month 
$20,000 Car Loan 2.99% Interest payment of $371 a month 

Options I have thought up

Option A) Put 5k towards my student loans and pay off my car completely. I would switch my loans over to a standard 10 year payment plan with $532 and interest paid of $14,813 over that time.

Option B) Put all 25K toward my student loans. This leaves a balance of 29K that I would still pay over 10 years with a cost of $8767 in interest plus my original car payment with interest of $1557.

So option B makes more sense on paper since the total interest of $10,324 is less than $14,813. However, I am inclined to go with option A because it gives me flexibility. It allows me to get rid of a large payment every month (the car) while paying down the student loans in 10 years. I am starting a family next year so I like the idea that if something went wrong, myself or wife losing our jobs or some kind of health crisis, there is no longer a large car payment and since I have federal loans I could put on IBP or forbearance if I need to.

personalfinance,I moved to the US this year. Should I build credit history &amp; score?,"I moved to the US from the UK earlier this year. As such I have no credit score in the US. I have no credit cards or personal debt, and I wish to keep it this way. However I need to consider that in future I may require a mortgage to buy a house in the US. I was listening to a podcast (Dave Ramsey) and he suggested that it was not necessary to build credit for a mortgage. He said that you could get a “manually underwritten” mortgage which essentially gives you the same interest rates as a good credit score would have.

I want to know if it’s preferable for me to do have no credit score, or to start building one.",finance

personalfinance,What bank has the best online features and self-service website?,"tlrd; Who's your favorite online bank, judging solely by their online features?

I needed a simple checking account to keep a modest, variable amount of money (&lt;$1000). I didn't need local banking - any online banking service would've worked. I signed up for one that appeared to have a decent interest rate, (the interest rate doesn't hugely matter, but all other things seemed equal).

I then learned that their actual website is rather terrible. It's clunky, hard to navigate, and transferring money is difficult and awkward.

What bank offers your favorite self-serve website? One that's easy to see transactions, easy to move money between external accounts, easy to submit paperwork (i.e. not via fax) etc.

I've used etrade before, but they still ask for paperwork via fax, and tend to push their brokerage offerings rather heavily. I just want a bank.",finance
personalfinance,"IRA Early Withdrawal, avoiding estimated tax payments and underpayment penalties","TL; DR I don’t want to make estimated tax payments for Q4 of 2017 for an IRA early withdrawal because I don’t think I will get hit with an underpayment penalty but wanting some feedback in case I’m dumb and can’t interpret IRS jargon

Edit: Thanks everyone :)

I tried to do my research and read through similar threads as well as IRS articles, and just posing the question in case I didn’t interpret things correctly.  

I withdrew a good chunk from my IRA for personal reasons in November 2017, and requested 28% federal tax withholding on my withdrawal.  The financial organization I go through withheld 28% and the rest was deposited into my personal checking.  I elected 28% based on the tax bracket that I expect to be in for the 2017 year.  

However, I did not take into account the 10% IRS early withdrawal fee and I am going to have to report this to the IRS on I believe form 1040 when I file my taxes next year, and this 10% is the amount in question that 1) I don’t want to make estimated tax payments on and 2) I don’t want to have underpayment penalties owed to IRS due to not making those estimated tax payments for Q4

2016 – My day job I paid X dollars in taxes, I work an hourly job and have employer withhold tax funds

2017 – I am working at the same day job, and with my annual raise (which was pitiful) and an annual bonus that I did not receive in 2016, I will make more than I did in 2016.  And then on top of that, I had 28% withheld from the IRA withdrawal.  

So my overall withholdings for 2017 will exceed my 2016 tax liability, and my understanding based off what I read off the IRS website is if my overall withholdings for 2017 exceed 100% of my 2016 tax liability (or 110% if my AGI is &gt; 150,000 for filing single), then I will not have any underpayment penalties if I do not make estimated tax payments for my IRA withdrawal in Q4, and can just wait until I file my 2017 tax return to report the 10% fee that I owe the IRS for the early withdrawal fee.  

Someone please correct me if I am really, really wrong with my reasoning.",finance

personalfinance,Questions about paying down high interest credit card,"This may be supremely idiotic, but I have a couple questions about paying off a credit card. I have a card with a $15,000 limit with about $4,700 balance. I’ve been chipping away at all my debt using the vertex42 debt reduction calculator, and this is my highest interest debt. On this card, I am always getting those balance transfer checks that are 0% for 18 mos or whatever, and I always just shred them. However, i received one today and it occurred to me that I might be able to get my $4,700 23% interest rate down to 0% if I write myself one of those checks then send it back to Chase. 

My questions are 1) if I do this, will it pay off the oldest balance first, which is the balance that I’m paying interest on? and 2) is this genius or moronic? I’m paying around $85 per month in interest so the one time fee of writing the check will still be less than the interest I’m paying in the long run. Thanks for your advice!!",finance
personalfinance,Bank changing terms of HELOC,"We went to our bank (not a CU, but a small local operation who is also our mortgage lender) to get a HELOC to build a barn on our property. We spoke with a manager, and although the loan would violate their 80% loan-to-value guideline, the manager assured us that they can often make exceptions (we have great credit and a solid income). So we filled out the application, and last week we received a committment letter in the mail, pending satisfactory appraisal. The terms were the same as we had discussed (2.99% fixed for 2 years then prime + .25%)

I got an email today saying that the appraisal came back fine (a little higher than we thought, but we'd still be above the LTV number with the loan). Except now, we're being told that we can either take less money (the amount that would keep us under the 80% LTV) with the interest rate mentioned above, or we can take the full amount we want, but the rate would be prime + .25% immediately (i.e. no two-year intro rate).

Can I go back to the bank with their letter and demand (nicely) that they honor the original terms? Or does the ""dependent on satisfactory appraisal"" condition give them a sufficient loophole to get out of their initial offer?",finance

personalfinance,Got rejected for a CC by my University's Credit Union...What now?,"Hi Reddit!

As background: I'm a 19 year old financially independent college student. 

I work many hours a week and have begun to build up my savings account, but I want to start building my credit too. 

Last Mayish, I got rejected for a Wells Fargo credit card because of a low credit score and for not having lived at my current address for long (I live in the dorms all school year and couch surfed last summer). Then this summer, I applied for my a CC with my University's credit union and was accepted! (Credit score was 653 - have never had any CCs before but have some federal stafford loans that I won't begin paying off until after graduation). However, I had difficulty proving where I lived and as school started I completely forgot about finalizing the application.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I try to finish the application with my new dorm address, but was told I had to reapply because my application had closed. I reapplied. Yesterday I received an email saying I was rejected because my application information had changed (probably my address), my account hasn't been open for long (I have a checking account with them but I never use it), ""proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high"", and lack of recent bank information. My new credit score is also 645 - eight points lower than a few months ago. 

Should I look into a secured credit card instead? I am very responsible with money and can trust that I can pay it off, but I am afraid of getting rejected again and having it hurt my credit more.

Should I check with Experian, etc to make sure that no one has used my identity in a way that would contribute to this low score?

If I freeze my credit, will I be able to still open a CC?

Are there better ways for me to start building credit?

personalfinance,"Recent college graduate, struggling with $3,500 credit card debt, interest rate, and anticipating incoming student loan OSAP debt to boot. SOS","Hello all, this is my first post to this subreddit and I hope someone can give me some direction on how I can manage this issue going forward. I want to manage this before it snowballs worse than it has. I know this might be repetitive, but I see a lot of questions on here for people with more debt but also more complicated situations than mine. 



**TL;DR Situation Details:** I'm a Canadian 23-year-old recent graduate of my second program in college. I have done 3 academic years back-to-back, completing my graduate certificate program this past August. Over my two programs, I have wracked up $2,500 in credit card debt by the end of my most recent program, with interest I cannot keep up with and payments I can not make consistently. I am currently sitting at $3,433 in debt as of today, and I’m not even positive where it all came from. OSAP loans are supposed to start 6 months after graduating, so it’s fast-approaching -- and I can’t even handle my credit card debt much less a ~30,000 OSAP loan. I didn't receive any financial support from my dad since I moved out, and he is not in a position to help me financially now. He is helping me right now by supporting the household that my other sister and I live in with him, and he does not charge me for rent or otherwise. 



    Background information:



In 2015, I had to move about an hour away to attend college and began paying rent on a room in a house for about a year and a half. From August of that year until August of 2016, I worked ~35 hour weeks on part-time, minimum wage salary. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the term, but to refresh, OSAP (Ontario Student Assistance Program) is essentially a loan from the government to Ontario residents entering post-secondary education. They give you money dependent on your personal situation and income, and you begin to pay it back 6 months after you graduate. As I did two programs consecutively, I have two different OSAP loans I have to pay back.

My problems began in my second academic year of my first program. My account with OSAP was set up to pay my college directly from my loan account with them, so that I was never supposed to see the money that was dedicated to my tuition installments in my personal account. The leftover from each installment that didn't go to my school would be deposited in my account. Long story short, they messed up, gave me all the money that was supposed to go to the school, notified me too late and I used the remainder of my money (which was just enough) to pay the fees to the school, which left me with very little. I lived off a combination of my Mastercard and whatever I made from work, which began my debt collection. It wasn’t much at this point, but my program was very heavy in product usage and transportation, so much of the couple hundred was in train fare and kit replenishment.

As I was wrapping up that program, I got into my grad program which was beginning two months after I was to graduate. I worked my butt off for two months and started my grad program in September, and started digging my grave. Being a grad program, this program was not like the first and left me almost no free time to work, was twice as expensive for half the length of the previous course, and was more demanding in transportation fees and material costs towards the coursework. So, effectively I was working the only two days I was available outside of school and once again. On top if it, I'm sure eating a lot at school and buying takeout because of late studio hours was not helping me whatsoever. My OSAP was covering my college fees, my job was covering just enough for rent, and that meant anything else between train fare, groceries and posterboard for a project was going onto my Mastercard. It was tight living for a year, I was not eating well or sleeping much but I made it! My reward was a lot of credit card debt, and because I made so little I was not and am not able to pay consistent payments towards it. At times I would make the minimum payment, and other times I would go double if I had enough room in my Chequing account to leave money for emergencies.


    Where I’m At Now:


I moved back home in September because I could not afford to save money and/or pay back debts on top of supporting myself on the income I made at my previous job. I thought it would be smarter to spend a year at home, rent-free and working as much as possible to pay off debts and save for first-and-last on a new apartment closer to the city, but looking at how the past two months have gone and my bank account statements, it looks like it'll be more than a year. I’ve not been going out when invited because even a $20 dinner is a blow to my poor Chequing account, and I’ve tried to be responsible with my spending by not purchasing frivolously. Luckily, my dad is of the mind of ""I would never charge my kids to live at home"" and so my only real bill right now is my phone bill -- I moved back in with all of my things including my ""backups"" (shampoo, soap, deodorant etc. I would buy on sale for when I run out) so I've not needed to purchase much outside of what's already in the house. I've also refrained from buying groceries or snacks and just eating what is already at home, to avoid unnecessary spending. 

A big problem is that my current job that I got shortly after moving home and it’s *garbage*. I wanted a step up from my previous generic minimum wage retail job, something somehow related to my area of education, but it turns out to be worse than my previous job. My shifts are *very* sporadic, 1-2 shifts a week, and I make a dollar above minimum wage. Needless to say, I am looking for a new job. The problem is, this throws me off my personal plan for the next year in terms of saving up and moving out, but it also means that I am STILL not making nearly enough to make my $133 minimum payments to my credit card let alone paying it off as fast as I’d like, even without rent and other bills. This is BEFORE my OSAP payments have been initiated, which makes me even more worried. I have no more savings, no RRSP, no TFSA left. Nothing. I have $140 in my Chequing account, and that’s all. My credit limit is $4,500 which is an issue to start with, my interest on this card is 19.99% (?!!), and I made a $200 payment on October 23rd when it was $2,993. I don’t know the first thing about money, interest, credits and managing my personal finances, but I feel like I blinked and now I’m drowning in debt. I definitely didn’t pay close enough attention in college but the past few years were a blur or confusion and trying to stay afloat.


I initially wanted to make an appointment a month ago with my bank to find out how to better separate my income into savings accounts, and how to budget for my year’s goal, but now I just want to talk to them to figure out what the hell to do. 


Any advice is GREATLY appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Purchasing a Hotel and need advice on my two load options,"Hi all,

I would apprecia any advice as I don't know which option to take. 

I am purchasing a hotel in a beach town in Mexico... I am a vacation rental property manager here and 6 months back I was asked to manage a hotel as well. 

The hotel was very poorly run before I took charge. Poor staff training, terrible decoration and ambiance but it was very well maintained and in a great location. 

A few months ago I aproached the owner to purchase the hotel as I have already put alot of work into it and it is turning around. 

The owner bought this hotel for his wifes family but since they are not interested in runing it any more and hes american, he really just wants to sell it and even offered me 5 years interest free financing but he wants the price to be fixed in USD. So every year i would pay him 20% of the property. 

My other option is to take out a mortgage and pay the property off in ~20 years. However interest rates are really high in Mexico about 12%. 

To me it seems like an easy choice to go with the free financing. However with inflation being what it is in Mexico (~6.5%) and it being an election year I worry that if a devaluation of the peso comes along like it did last year that I will be paying more with the interest free loan that with the conventional mortgage because the owner wants to be paid in USD. 

What are your thought? 

Thanks in advance for your time and advice.",finance
solar,What am I actually paying per watt?,"I got a quote and started the process to get a Solar City setup.  My wife is having second thoughts after reading all the bad reviews online.  I know I'll probably have to pay a cancellation fee at this point, but I haven't signed anything since doing the original loan application. 

 I think I'm doing my math wrong.  It could be right, but I don't know.  I probably should have looked into this a lot more, LOL.

I'm in Florida with 30% tax credit.

It breaks down like this:

15,600kw system.
 - Solar Power System $40,636
 - 2 Powerwall 2 units $11,000
 - Powerwall instalation and hardware $1,600

Total Loan Amount: $53,236
Federal tax credit amount $15,971
Net system cost after credit: $37,266

I'm doing the $ per watt as the whole $53,236, which comes out to $3.41 before credit, and $2.89 after credit.

To try to find the actual cost per watt, should I only do the Solar Power System cost of $40,636?   If this is the case, then I'm paying $2.60 per watt before credit, and $1.82 per watt after.  Is that correct?  

The system was originally $63,300, and the salesperson said he'd give us a 20% discount, but I'm not seeing that since it's actually coming out to $53,236 total loan amount, which is more like a 14% discount, no?


Originally the sales rep said this would offset 80% of our energy, but after they sent me a drawing back a few days ago it said it would only offset 74%.  I told the salesrep that and he said the batteries would make up for that and push it back to 80%.  I'm not sure what to believe about that.

Other than this I was quoted by Vivant Solar $42,500  before tax credit for a 11.6kw system.   We almost started this, but we had stuff come up and decided to wait a few months.  About two weeks ago is when I called solar City, and compared to Vivant Solar, the price seemed much better for more watts and being able to get Powerwall units, even if I'm paying a tad bit more.

I'd appreciate any help!   It might help my wife still consider it and make her feel better.    any input on Solar City?   The salesperson has been great to us for the most part.   The only awkward part was when the person I originally talked to was let go a day after talking to him, then texting him to ask him if he was still coming only for him to tell me he got canned, LOL.   I mean, I feel bad, but that was weird.",energy

Is this correct?

I'm looking to park a house downpayment in VBILX (2.6% yield) and VICSX (3.14% yield).

Even if it is correct, and the funds lose value in the near future, can total return after yield still make diversified bond funds a relatively safe place to park money you want to spend in the next 3 years? That will beat high yield savings accounts?

I have about $12,500 in student loans from my four years as an undergrad, all from 3 separate loans, 1 unsubsidized and 2 subsidized.  Using the Federal Student Aid (FSA) repayment calculator it looks like my weighted average interest rate for the whole $12,500 would be around 4.085%.

Now I've recently started a job making about $41,000 a year, and using the FSA calculator I have 5 real options when it comes to repayment, 4 of them being plans offered for repayment:

1.) Standard repayment plan:
  With this plan I'd make the same $127 monthly payment over 120 months (10 years) resulting in a total payment of $15,234.

2.) Graduated repayment plan:
   With this plan I would start out paying $71 per month and gradually (see what they did there?) work my way up to $213 per month over the same 10 year period. The total amount payed for this plan would be about $15,917

3.) Revised Pay As You Earn Plan (REPAYE):
   This plan has monthly payments that are about 10% of your discretionary income, divided by 12, and starts with payments of about $192.  This plan ends with payments of $268 per month but only lasts 63 months, totaling $13,980 paid.

4.) Income Contingent Repayment (ICR):
   For my current income level this plan would start with payments of $95 per month and end with payments of $110 per month over a 159 month period.  This totals out to about $16,313 paid in the end.

5.)Pay it all off now:
  Now here's the real monkey wrench in all of this and source of my dilemma. I have the ability to pay it all off right now.
After my grandparents passed about 4 years ago and their estate was all divided among the family I was left with about $40,000 of somewhat liquid cash. For its simplicity, this would be the easiest option, but from what some of my family has said it might not be my best option. Without giving me hard facts or examples, I've been told that it may be better to make the payments on the loans that I have, and make the money left to me work for me as long as the interest rate on it is higher than the interest rate on the loans.

If I do end up going with a payment plan I'm leaning toward the standard plan, seeing as the payments wouldn't be too bad each month and the total amount paid would be middle of the road as well. Now I am by no means financially savvy, which is why I am asking for your help, so does this make sense?  How would I even go about using that money to make more than I would be paying on the loans? Are there any options I am not seeing that you think I should explore?

Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated, as I am pretty lost at the moment. If there is any other information that would be helpful I'd be happy to provide that as well.",finance

In addition, we probably receive at least $6,000.00/year in tax returns (or at least we have the last 4 years), so that could be use to calculate additional income. 
 
Should I look at student loan consolidation or a total loan consolidation with the credit cards? We only purchased our house within the last years, so we only have $10,000.00 in equity in our house. We have two vehicles that are owned out right, but total worth on both would be at about $18,000.00.

personalfinance,Macy's new employees are encouraged to open a store credit card (26% APR) to obtain their employee discount,"I recently picked up a part-time seasonal position at Macy's for some extra holiday cash. I've been working in retail off and on over the past 15 years, and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places, but it's been a few years since I've worked for a big retailer like Macy's. I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the 20% employee discount  is only available through a prepaid card (like a gift card I guess, not terrible but not great), or through their *actual store credit card*. They conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork, and even allow you to apply right then and there.

I've been through this type of application process before, but I've never seen something so brazenly unethical. These are often young adults or older people applying for these positions, filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin, and they're being targeted with a (hard hit, thanks auto mod) hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate. Is this new in retail? Seems like a disturbing trend if it is.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Just wanted to get the word out.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies, everyone. Really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards, business practices, and obviously PF. The consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending, as long as they are managed responsibly. I respectfully disagree, in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people (namely, new employees) that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit, but I will agree that it's fair game to solicit employees. I just think it's kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an ""easy"" solution for employees. Employees should just get an effing discount, period. But we're all free to work and shop where we please, so feel free to support smaller/local businesses that don't subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations.",finance
personalfinance,Car payment options,"I am looking for a way to free up some finances and I'm pretty much at a point where I can't free anything else up with my current income. As it is I will have roughly $400 extra spending cash each month after all bills including rent and groceries. The extra $400 typically goes to various things like lunches during the week (only as needed, no frivolus eating fast food twice a day, everyday. Maybe twice a week at that. 

At the moment, my car loan is the biggest regret that I have right now but it was an unforeseen necessity at the time. Roll back to April 2016, car at the time was giving major issues and it was better to buy a new used vs repairing. In the process I incurred a~$18,000 loan at 16% interest (my credit was pretty atrocious at the time, maybe 470 at best). Since then I have been majorly working on my credit and getting it to a place where I (ideally) wont suffer from high interest rates, at least not as high.

As you can imagine, I would like to be able to lower those payments. Currently shelling out $420 per month until 2022 if I pay the vehicle off completely. I'd like to get out of it, or lower my payments much sooner then that. As it is, I currently owe $16,400 and based on NADA ( I know not what dealers use nor is it the exact amount I would expect) trade in value is $8K - 10K. Essentially it seems that I will be upside down roughly $6K - 8K depending on what I can get from it if I trade it in. 

The only option I see at the moment are:

1- Keep the vehicle and keep making the payments on it until I'm no longer upside down (estimated at around 1.5 to 2 years) and refinance or trade in.

2 - Trade in for a vehicle worth around $8K - $10k, tack on the remaining value of my previous vehicle, try for a lower interest payment in the process with a few more years in terms of car payments.

Currently, per WF FICO credit score I'm at 655 (Experian), per Credit Karma, I am at 616 (TU) and 621 (Equifax). I just paid off an agreement with Aaron's to which I expect will bump my score a few points (it did this with one of my other agreements I paid off last year). I'm continuing to make on time payments and lower my overall credit while still keeping accounts and not adding anymore for the time being.

Are there any other options that I could potentially have at this point? Is there an option that I mentioned that would be preferred or recommended over the other?

As mentioned, I am looking to lower my payments. Hopefully by about $100 per month to which I could then use as extra payment to the vehicle and get it paid off sooner. 

If there is any other info that is needed to assist please let me know.

personalfinance,How to contribute to 401(k) if Employee Contribution Match = Flat 20%,"Hi everyone,

My current employer offers a 401(k) contribution match of a flat 20%. Not 100% up to 20%, but 20% up to 100%. This contribution match offer diverges a little from the PF flowchart recommendation on employer matches, so how would you suggest I contribute to the 401(k) plan?

I understand that 20% is fairly generous, so should I simply contribute as much as I comfortably can? My old employer had a contribution match of 100% up to 6% that was not as generous but made it easier to determine how much to contribute from each paycheck. The reason I'm asking is that I have a significant amount of student loans with interest rates between 4%-6.8%, so I need to carefully balance saving for retirement with aggressively paying off my debt.

financialindependence,Sanity check - rolling leverage during accumulation phase: is this a good plan?,"I keep getting offers for lines of credit with an interest rate of 2.99% for one year. 

At that interest rate, I feel like it would make sense to take out a loan equal to a bit less than my projected investments over the course of the year and then pay that back using the monthly amounts I would normally have put into my investment accounts. Since this would be done one year at a time, the total debt would be relatively small.

For example, if I planned on contributing $10,000 this year, I would take out $10,000 from my line of credit and put it into my investment portfolio, then each month for the next 12 months I'd make a payment of $846.89 to the loan (repaying it in full at the end of the year). At that point, I'd re-evaluate if any further leverage is attractive for the coming year and, if so, repeat the process.

Does anyone else use rolling debt to help speed up their accumulation phase? I'm still filling my tax-advantaged accounts, so I couldn't deduct the interest, but even so it's a positive expected return.

Additional risk due to the leverage is pretty minimal as it would not represent a large % of my portfolio or relative to my salary. Am I missing something? Is there a reason this isn't done more often?

Thoughts on this plan or experience using leverage in this way are welcome.

Side note: Would it be better to use 0% credit cards to pay my living expenses and then use my salary to invest, then repay the cards, instead? Even though the effective interest rate is better, that strategy seems a lot more complex and risky to me. Likewise using margin accounts at Interactive Brokers, which offers a lower interest rate but doesn't work with tax-advantaged accounts (and can get margin called).


EDIT: Just to clarify - I would not be SELLING any stock as part of this plan. I'd just buy all my stocks for the year on Jan 1st and then spend the year paying the loan off (instead of making my usual stock purchases) so my total holdings would end up being net the same - just getting that slice of extra time in the market.",finance

MachineLearning,"[D] How is a binary classifier that guesses values based on distance away from known values in any way an ""intelligent machine""?","Let's say I feed a tiny bit of data into a machine: 3 = true, 5 = true, 10 = false, 12 = false. Then I input 4, and ask the machine to guess if it's true or false. The machine uses the data it's been fed, 3 is true, 4 is 1 away from that, 5 is true, 4 is 1 away from that, average distance from the value I know are true = 1. 10 is false, 4 is 6 away from that, 12 is false, 4 is 8 away from that, average distance from the values I know are false = 7. 1 &lt; 7, therefore distance from ""true"" is smaller than distance from ""false"", so machine predicts that 4 = true.

This may be a very tiny example, but this is the way I've been basically understanding what a binary classification algorithm does. I fail to see how this constitutes an ""intelligent machine"". This seems like basic programming, it calculates an average distance of a new value based on al lthe distances of ""true"" vs ""false"" values of the values it already knows, then simply spits out the binary value with the smaller distance. This doesn't seem like a ""learning"" algorithm at all, it looks to me like this is a fixed algorithm that doesn't change its behavior and just does the same naive dumb thing to guess true or false every time. I mean, I could program this without using any of the popular ""trendy"" machine learning algorithms in use today, I could program this with zero knowledge of machine learning at all. Like, why would I need a ""sigmoid function"" or a ""support vector linear space"" or something else unnecessarily complex to make this? Sure, if you feed it more data to train on, then it might calculate a better and better average distance for true vs. false just by the sheer volume of data it already knows. But this really doesn't seem to me like it's an ""intelligent machine"" at all, it seems like it's applying a fixed equation on possibly variable amounts of training data, and will only perform differently if there are different amounts of data it's trained on. I thought machine learning was algorithms that don't define fixed behavior, this just seems like very fixed behavior to me, the amount of data changing things doesn't change the fact that this is a fixed algorithm.

So would somebody please help me understand why this ISN'T a fixed algorithm and why something that makes a T/F guess in this fashion constitutes an ""intelligent machine""?",technology

My parents agreed to take out the parent PLUS loan so I could attend school with the condition that I pay it back in full. 
There are two direct PLUS unsubsidized loans - one for each year I attended university.

The first PLUS loan is at $24,521.69 with 6.31 interest rate and currently $440.57 accrued interest.

The second PLUS loan is at $23,117.40 with 6.840 interest rate and $450.23 accrued interest (my parents paid off the interest while in school so it isn't as high as it could be).

I also have 4 loans of my own:

Direct subsidized: $5,500 at 4.29% interest rate

Direct unsubsidized: $2,000 at 4.29% interest rate

Direct subsidized: $5,500 at 3.76% interest rate

Direct unsubsidized: 2,000 at 3.76% interest rate


My current income is about $1,100 a month, my rent and utilities usually comes out to about $550 a month. I have a very small amount of wiggle room with finances.


I'm not sure if I should follow the repayment plans offered. There are also income-based and income-contingent repayment plans and this is where I start to get confused about what option is actually best. I'd rather not hike up the interest just so I don't have to pay as much each month. 

I'm hoping someone can guide me through what the best financial option would be - or where I could find comprehensible information on this.

personalfinance,Losing My Overtime Pay - Need Help!,"Long story short, I think I might be getting my overtime pay taken away from me by my employer switching me from an hourly IT technician to a salaried employee.

A bit of a background: I’ve been working at this company for just over a year now. A few notable things that have happened over this year include our office doubling in size from about 140 employees to about 290.  I wish I was exaggerating, but we basically built out an entire other floor beneath us and have fully staffed it since the build was complete. Another huge part of the last year is that my manager (essentially my only help for this position) has went fully remote out of the country to assist another team and will not return. He still manages our email queue, however, a bulk of the work such as fixing computers, setting up meetings, troubleshooting, etc. are all hands-on here in the office.

These key changes have led to me working, on average, about 7-8 hours of overtime a week. With my current pay sitting at around $22/hour, I rely quite a bit on that time-and-a-half pay at the end of every paycheck. While it is obviously good money without the OT pay, I still think my extra time should be paid considering my position. There are even sometimes I work 70-80 hour weeks to launch large projects, but very rarely about once every 2-3 months.

My main questions are #1 how common is it for a company to suddenly take away Hourly pay from an employee after about 13-14 months? My other question would be #2 if they do propose to take away my hourly time, would there be anything I should demand in return? I already get full benefits, and the company has a nearly endless amount for growth. In my short time here, I already will be getting someone under me to pick up the slack of my manager before he left. I also get a TON of exposure to our senior leadership since I work at the global HQ for our firm, and have built relationships with quite a few of them.

People tell me I excel at my position (so far). Offices usually love the IT guy in the office since he always fixes everything, but there have still been countless moments where both my manager and executive leaders have gone out of their way to tell me how much of an asset I am to the company. I honestly do like it here and would like to stay if possible, however, with the loss of my overtime pay, I’m not sure if it would be worth sticking around.

Hopefully most of this made sense. Really glad to finally be able to vent a little bit about my concerns and am looking for any and all advice possible. Please let me know, /r/personalfinance !",finance
personalfinance,"About to make $60k from selling my house. Pay towards student loans, or roll it into a down payment on new house?","I graduated PA school with $185k in student loans. For the past 4 years, I've worked in family practice in rural areas. Its been fairly crappy, but I've got my loans down to $91k, so that's been awesome. The VAST majority of this was through a state sponsored program to pay off medical loans for providers. The state however has a $100k cap. I will have received a hair over $99k, so re-applying isn't an option. 

There is another option through HRSA to repay the loan, which would get me $50k for a 2 year agreement to stay. However, the cycle doesn't open until March(ish), and then no funds are awarded until about October of next year. That's when they start the clock on the agreement, so it would actually be October of 2020 before I'd be out of contract. I can't last that long in rural family medicine any longer. 

I've accepted a job in Seattle, and we'll be moving in Jan. The new job doesn't have loan repayment, but it will be working for a non-profit company, so I would qualify for the 10 year public service forgiveness. Which is if you make 120 payments (minimum counts) while working for a non-profit company or companies, the remainder of your loans are forgiven. So... That would be about 6 more years of minimum payments before the remainder of the loans would be forgiven. 

Enter the house money. We put 10k down on our first house in 2014. We just sold the house for much more than we paid, and after realtor fees and closing and blah blah blah, we should walk away with about $60k. 

The question at hand: Do I roll that $60k over to a new down payment on another house? Do I put it all on student loans? Do I put some on loans and some on down payment for a house? Truly a conundrum for me. On the one hand if I plan on getting loan forgiveness, then it only makes sense to put all of that money down on a house, and continue with the bare minimum payments out of my pocket to maximize the loan forgiveness amount after 6 years. But I'm not sure I can bank on the loan forgiveness program to be around 6 years from now, after DeVos and the Trump administration get done pillaging it, not to mention whoever inherits the mess when they're done with it. 

Buying a house in the Seattle area is a nightmare price-wise and will need every cent of that $60k for a down payment. It would take me years to save that kind of money for a down payment again. 

It would be quite nice to be free from the student loans though... 


Student loans: 4 separate loans. Three over $25k at 7.8% (Thank you grad plus loans), and one loan is about $12k at 6.8%, all together they total $91k and change. 
Minimum combined payment on these 4 loans is $490/mo under the revised pay as you earn program through FedLoan Servicing. 

So assuming nothing would change (which I admit it would over time) lets say minimum of $500/mox6 years = $36k. So, $91k minus minimum payments over 6 years is still damn near $90k 6 years from now. So forgiveness would be in the $90k range, but it will cost me $36k of my own money to get there. 

OR, I take it all, the $60k from the house, plop it down on the student loans, drop it immediately down to $31k, and pay that whore down over the next 2-3 years and be student loan free, but have nothing to put down as an investment in my housing situation, thereby be a renter for the next 3 years. (For those who don't know, rentals in seattle for a 3bd are in the $2-3k+ range). 

Too long? Sorry. 

Advice?

EDIT: If I refinance through a private lender, I lose the ability to have the public service loan forgiveness. Also lose the low $490/month minimum payment.",finance

I can pay these minimum payments without issue and I'm looking to contribute a bit more monthly to these student loans in general (so right now I'm paying $314 + $74 = **$388** per month, looking to expand that to ~$600 a month).

How can I best allocate this $600 to pay the least amount of interest, which is the obvious goal of anyone with a loan? The Nelnet loan appears to be a bunch of different loans combined, resulting in a minimum monthly payment that I need to pay. When I view the numbers, it see a bunch of ""groups"" of mini-loans each of which have their own balance and interest rate. I'm not sure how Nelnet arrives at the amount of $314 monthly payment and how that's being distributed to all these mini-loans. I see one of the mini-loans having an interest rate of ~6.2%, even higher than the Discover loan's. When I manually make a payment, there is an option to select how much I want to manually allocate to each mini-loan.

I assume I don't simply want to pay all $600 to that mini-loan (so without paying anything to the other loans) until it's fully paid off and then move to the next loan, right?

I'm about $500 short of fees for a full semester, but all the private student loans I've researched require a minimum loan of $1000 or more. Federal loans are not an option for me because I'm under my parents' income on paper. Overborrowing by that much does not appeal to me, but is this my only choice? Also, just a note: I was raised in a very sheltering family so I might not be as savvy to anything relating to finances... Any tips/links to tax crash courses would help (I live in California if that's relevant)",finance
personalfinance,Question About Student Loans,"Hey all, so I just graduated and my loans start soon in December.  I'm looking at my repayment options, and I have a ton of loans. My intention is to pay them off in 10 years (or less if physically possible). So I had originally chosen the 10 year plan. But now that I look at it, I might be better choosing the extended 25 year plan. The reason being I have 2 types of loans, regular, and grad PLUS. my grad plus loans have higher interest rates than my others. So under the 25 year repayment plan, I'll have a smaller minimum payment, and can put the extra all towards my loans with higher interest rates. This makes sense to me as I'm sure it does to you, but what i want to know is, is there a catch? As i browse my loan servicer's website they don't say anything about the two plans other than i'll pay more interest in the long run on the 25 year plan, duh. 


What I really want to know is, does choosing the 25 year repayment plan change my interest rate on my loans? or is that fixed no matter what repayment plan I choose, be it 10 year or 25 year?


The only downside I see to the 25 year is that you need more discipline to continue making more than the minimum payment. Im ok with this and would treat it like a 10 year, but it does give more flexibility provided something should happen, sickness or whatever.


Any help you guys can provide would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Paying off CC Debt w/ Tight Budget,"I currently have 4878.37 in credit card debt, from last year, and I was looking at the best way to pay that off. I currently make about $800 a month, and spend $350 a month on rent, $50 on utilities, and about $300 on food and other expenses. These are my only expenses; I work about 20 hours a week, although I’m not looking to work more until the end of the Spring semester.

My tuition is paid for by scholarship, however I get no other money from the school. As the balance is split between 3 cards, I end up right around $85/month paying the minimum, and then throwing the extra $15 at the higher interest card. 

I’m considering 3 options, and was looking for input:


1. Keep paying as much as I can afford, and work 60ish hours during next summer to pay it down as much as possible then. 

2. Take out $1900 in student loans for the spring semester, and use that to pay down the highest interest debt (all but 1900 is interest free until July 2018, $1900 is @ 24%). Pay the rest off during the summer.

3. Withdraw $1900 of $10,400 in Roth IRA contributions, to pay the debt @24%, and then pay the rest down with income from the summer. 

If anyone is curious, I originally was told by my parents that they would pay for my living experiences. I kept charging things to my card, and my mom said she would give me $800 a month for living expenses. Instead, she gave me enough to pay off the minimum payments and kept saying she would give me money to pay off the rest, once she got her bonus. That never ended up happening, and hence, I’m stuck with the bag. 

Edit: While I may not be able to technically use my student loans to pay CC debt, I could use them to pay my living expenses, and use my income to pay the debts, effectively using the loans to pay the CC debt. 

Also, the interest rate for the loan is not given online, although I could find out from the FinAif office. Given that it is Federal Unsubsisidized, I imagine it should be between 5 and 7%.",finance
personalfinance,I have excess funds that I don't know what to do with.,"So my job pays well enough for 19, and I have about 5k in the bank, so it's not like this is the only money I have we're talking about.

But many years ago my grandfather put ~1500 in a Penfed Savings account, and is currently just sitting there.

As of now I do nothing with the funds, but let it sit there. Should I be using this extra money to invest in retirement, or is there something else I should be doing?

Right now my finance knowledge consists of ""save all I can, and minimize costs"". Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Need a car, but am I being colossally stupid?","I recently got a promotion at work after being there about a year and a half that was almost a 25% jump in pay (hooray!). So now I can afford to have some luxuries on top of being (finally!) financially responsible (401k to company match, further snowballing out of cc debit, etc.), which in this case means a car. 


For some background: I am now 25 and made some dumb financial decisions in my early 20s. I made decent money right out of school so I bought waaay too much car and lived beyond my means. I swallowed my pride and sold the car about 5 months ago. Lesson learned, I guess. I put a large chunk of the equity towards debt and the rest towards needed expenses. Now, I bike everywhere to save money and force myself to exercise. However, with my new role, I have to do some local travel and really do need a car. Taking an Uber will neither be convenient nor budget friendly and I live in an area with pretty terrible public transportation.  


Because of bad decisions (see above) and having not earned great money for the past 2.5 years, I  have about 1k in savings that I refuse to touch for a down payment. My budget for a car ideally is around 8500 with some wiggle room. I am leery of going with a true beater because of limited cash on hand in case of emergencies and I can afford the payment (new comp is ~47k gross in a low-mid COL area). Plus, I need the car sooner rather than later. With my new compensation, I could probably save up a 10% down payment in fairly short order at that price point (month or 6weeks), but I hesitate to spend it on a down payment if I really don't have to. I feel it would be much better served in an emergency fund or going towards debt. I have good credit (~710), so I should be able to qualify for a 3 year loan at a decent rate based on the research I have done. My plan was to shop around for pre-approval and compare with what the dealer can give me. 


But I feel like I need a sanity check before I think about doing this since this seems like it could backfire. Pretty much every piece of car buying advice strongly recommends 10-20% down. It's what I did when I bought my first car and it definitely kept me from being upside down. I don't know if I really need to in this case, however. I can afford nearly double the estimated payment (based on likely interest rate and total financed amount), so I am not super worried about being upside down. I am more worried about tying up liquid cash that would be better served elsewhere. Am I nuts to consider this?

Edit: All of my calculations include the miscellaneous costs associated with buying a car to the best of my ability to calculate (tax, tag, title, etc.) if that changes anything.",finance

CryptoCurrency,My Analysis/predictions of a bunch of Cryptos,"I have been in crypto technically for 2+ years but, since last spring gotten very into it.  Here is my opinion on a bunch of coins.  I know I don't know everything about crypto, but I also know nobody (except maybe Satoshi) can say for sure how this will play out.  Here's my analysis(half-assed bullshit guesses). Yea I'm very bullish.

**BTC**
The king. I think it has the best likelihood of mass adoption.  Wales want to see liquidity before they jump in.  But more importantly they want to see big marketcap.  They don't want to be a huge % of a market and not be able to pull out if it drops.  I think there will be a tipping point in the near future where all of a sudden major financial companies start to pour in investments and millionares/billionares dump tons of money in.  Wales are what takes us to 50-100k per coin.  Also at a critical mass of marketcap the stigma of ""betting on bitcoin"" will turn to ""putting it in bitcoin"".  Still too early to call a winner, but once they dive in  it might be too late for other coins to top it.  The tech that is massively adopted is not always the best.   Yea there are fees, but it is still better than a wire transfer.

**ETH**
Very strong. Accurately valued imo.  I think it might go down a bit in the next year or so to 280 and stay, but I also think it will only take a few very successful Dapps for it to explode. Good leader too.  I think the move to POS is great and I think the people behind it are very dedicated and pumped.

**LTC**- solid coin.  Stability and a good leader.  It could become the silver to the gold.  I see it continuing to be very high volume.

**BCC**- No idea.

**XRP**- maybe great for a short term gain but I see major problems for it long term.  I know a lot of people here don't like it because they think it's centralized but that's not why I don't like it.  To me the problem is that for the ""product"" they offer to banks they can easily face competition and lose.  There are already other coins that do similar things.

Jan 1 2018: .23
April 1 2018: .40

**NEM**
Cool idea. I really like their coin and PoI.  I think this coin has a chance of being massively adopted.  The only problem is that they don't market much and don't get hype going.  If they saw another big 20% burst I think they would snowball and more people would look up what they were about.  They have small volume which isn't good,  but I think it is because those who are in it see it as the best tech.

**NEO**
Another coin that could be massively adopted.  I don't see it going down too much anytime soon.  After all the China FUD it only took a small hit and is still in the top 10.

**DASH- PIVX is better in EVERY way.

I think many can agree that this is the biggest question mark.  I think it is the riskiest coin, but also potentially could see the most incredible gains.  If the ball starts rolling with this and if they every get to the point where they can remove the coordinator I think it's lights out.  GG.  The question imo is can they get to that point while still being relevant and while people still believe in them.  They have to get many people using the coin before they can get to that point.

Why so Bullish?  You already know
Where should ppl put money? 
Banks... almost no interest.  If they raise interest rates they could crash the market.  Either way $ will be printed in mass.
Bonds.....  terrible rates give me a break
Stocks.....  Market will probably go up but could crash any time.  Not as liquid as crypto (I can't buy a computer with stock on robinhood).  The whole point of stocks used to be owning a part of a company and having a say.  That part of the value of a stock is long gone and diluted with these mega corps and everyone just hopes for capital gains.  We all know where to go for gains.
gold/silver... maybe.
Crypto... Sky is the limit.  It will soak up all the money that people hide, new money from the young kids in tech sectors, old money who want to pass crypos to their kids, and any sector that see's the benefit of it.

personalfinance,"Serious student and credit card debt, bad credit, nearly finished with degree... help!","Hello, this is my first time posting here. At the moment, I am in a complete financial mess after years and years of school and being completely ignorant about the consequences of continuous borrowing. I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I'm in serious trouble. I fully acknowledge that I have made some bad decisions, and I will pay the price (literally) for years to come. I am posting here in hopes of having some advice on how best to tackle my monstrous debt with an abysmal credit score.

I (31/m) have completed a B.S. and M.S. in Chemistry in the US, and am now nearly finished with a PhD in Chemistry in France (three year program; one year left). For info, I chose a degree in France because there is a well-known expert in my specific field here, and I'm working in one of the top labs in the world in my field (it's not just something I'm doing for fun, it was a strategic choice). I receive a salary of about €1500/month ($1700/mo).

This is my current student loan and credit card debt situation:
- Federal student loans: $50,000, interest rates between 3.4-6.8% fixed (currently income-based repayment at $0/month)
- Private student loans: $55,000, interest rates between 5.7-7.2% variable (currently in repayment with $650/mo minimum payment, I try to pay at least $100 more than that)
- Credit card debt: $10,000, 18% variable (currently paying slightly more than the minimum each month)

Note: I have not taken out student loans during the last two years of my PhD because my university in France is not a Title IV school (so I'm not eligible); therefore, I put many expenses on my credit card. About half of the credit card debt is from school-related expenses, the rest mostly from travel and some admittedly frivolous spending on my part.

Now, about my credit dilemma... I have a horrible credit score (550) due to several months of not paying my private student loan payments when they started rolling in last year. As a result, my private student loans were nearly placed in default. This is all a result of a cascade of terrible decisions, procrastination and irresponsibly ignoring the situation.

I used to have a plan made with my parents that they would help with my student loans a bit once I finished my PhD while I secured a job. However, due to recent serious medical problems for the both of them and a lot of unforseen expenses, chances are they won't be able to help as they had hoped, if at all. I will assume from this point on that I'm on my own.

I've never been smart about my finances, but I want and need to start now. I am going to take some online classes in bugeting, and two good friends of mine have agreed to check in from time to time to see if I'm on track.

I have a little over one year left for my PhD; I cannot increase my salary or take on another job. I plan to keep squeezing by until I finish. I am fairly confident that with my educational background, experience and networking that I can find a job not long after my PhD starting at 25k/yr minimum, probably higher but likely not exceeding 50k/yr. 

My biggest questions are:
1. Overall, how screwed am I?
2. Is there a better way to approach my debt payments? Should I focus all of my extra cash on my credit card debt for the moment?
3. I would like to refinance my student loans, but my credit score is so low that I can't do it alone. My parents might be able to cosign though, is that possible even though my score is so low? Their score is pretty good (though not sure of actual score)
4. How can I improve my credit score? How long will it take to get it out of the 'very poor' range? 
5. Will such a bad credit score actually prevent me from getting a job after I have my PhD? How often do employers check credit scores in the hiring process?
6. What other general advice do you have?

Thanks for any help at all. With the stress of the PhD and ill parents, the thoughts of all my debt and reminder of my terrible past decisions are starting to become suffocating, and my mental health is suffering severely. It is also impacting my focus on my PhD, which I need now more than ever. If I am able to have some sort of plan, it would help a lot!",finance

personalfinance,Denied for student loan refinancing and getting a monthly payment I can reasonably afford.,"I am 31 yo who recently starting my career after being in school for the past decade and I am coming out of my student loan grace periods. As I am getting my repayment details, I am learning that I am very near underwater based on what I am bringing home each month versus my loan payments, and I was looking for insight into refinancing my students loans to give myself a payment that will leave me reasonably in the black on a monthly basis.

&amp;nbsp;

My current financial status-  

&amp;nbsp;


* Total debit: $127900
* Car loan: $1379
* Credit cards: $1473
* Student loans: $125050

Credit score: 759

&amp;nbsp;

I was recently approved for the income driven plan for my federal loans, and as of now my payments are at $0/mo since I've had essentially no income over the past few years from school. I am a nurse and am hoping to take advantage of the PSLF program, but I mainly did this to buy me some time to figure out what to do with my more substantial private loans. My current monthly payment is about $860.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I am spending about $1270/mo on rent + utilities and $144/mo on a car payment (will be paid off in ~9 months), my budget for food is ~$120/mo. I bring home after taxes between $3000 and $3400/mo depending on whether I'm working day or nightshift. If I have very little discretionary/ancillary spending, on average, this should leave me with ~$1400/mo max. to spend on paying down my debts.

&amp;nbsp;

Since my federal loans are at $0 for the time being, I am focusing on trying to refinance my private loan debt of $88000 to give me a more reasonable monthly payment or somewhere between $600-700/mo and to get rid of the awful 9.99% interest rate on that one loan. However, Earnest, SoFi, and Credible have all declined me and/or asked for cosigners and I am at a loss for how to proceed. Should I be attempting to refinance/consolidate both private loans, or would refinancing the 9.99% loan give me a better chance or getting approved? Is my debt-to-income ratio simply too great for any refinancing situation? Am I going to have to break down and get a cosigner to even hope to get refinanced?

financialindependence,WSJ Article - How to Get Entirely Tax-Free Retirement Income (From a HSA!) Text inside,"I thought this article from the WSJ was interesting since so many of us are doing just this.

**How to Get Entirely Tax-Free Retirement Income**

*If used wisely, HSAs give savers a triple benefit--pretax deduction, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals*


When it comes to saving for retirement, I now use two accounts: My 401(k) and a health-savings account.

Many people overlook HSAs as a retirement-savings vehicle because they are typically used to pay current medical bills. But these accounts, which Congress authorized in 2003, come with more tax advantages than 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts when used to cover medical costs—whether now or in retirement. And there are ways to use them to create tax-free income in retirement.

Saving for medical costs makes sense given that they are a major expense in retirement. A 65-year-old couple who retires today and has no reason to expect an early death will need about $265,000 to have a 90% chance of having enough for Medicare premiums and the 38% of medical costs Medicare doesn’t cover, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute. (That amount doesn’t include dental and long-term-care expenses.)

The HSA “is the most tax-favored savings vehicle in the tax code,” says Leo Acheson, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc. who wrote a recent report about HSAs.

As with a traditional 401(k) or IRA, an HSA allows you to set aside money without paying federal or state income taxes on it. Money in HSAs grows tax-free and, if used now—or later—for medical expenses, can be withdrawn tax-free. In contrast, with a traditional 401(k) or IRA, income tax is paid on withdrawals. (Alabama, California, New Jersey and New Hampshire don’t provide a state tax deduction for HSA contributions and Alabama, California and New Jersey also tax HSA earnings.)

Because of the HSA’s triple tax advantage—the upfront tax deduction, tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses—experts recommend that those who can afford to contribute to both an HSA and a 401(k) kick in the maximum to both.

For a 401(k), the current annual limit is $18,000 for people under age 50 and $24,000 for older investors—numbers that will rise to $18,500 and $24,500 in 2018. The annual caps for HSAs are $3,400 for individuals and $6,750 for families in 2017 and $3,450 and $6,900 in 2018—with those who are 55 or older permitted to kick-in an extra $1,000.

Those who can’t afford to put the maximum in both should first allocate enough to their 401(k) to get the company match and then switch to the HSA (and later return to the 401(k) if they can save more), experts say.

To open an HSA, you must be covered by an HSA-qualified health insurance plan. Among other things, the plan must have a deductible of at least $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for a family, thresholds that rise to $1350 and $2700 in 2018.

I signed up for such a plan in 2016. To help build a buffer against my plan’s $6,800 out-of-pocket spending cap for in network services, including a $2,800 deductible, my company deposited $500 into my HSA. I put in the $1,300 I saved on premiums by using the high-deductible plan instead of the conventional plan. Eventually, I added $2,050 more because I wanted to make the maximum annual contribution allowed, which, for individuals, was $3,350 in 2016. In 2017, I contributed the $3,400 individual limit.
The biggest payoff with an HSA comes when the money set aside isn’t used for current medical bills and instead compounds over time for use in retirement, says Rob Austin, director of research at 401(k) record-keeper Alight Solutions LLC. “The longer you let HSA money grow, the more valuable it becomes.”

To see why, consider my approach: For the sake of a simple, round number, let’s assume I have a $75,000 salary. That means that after paying federal income tax at a 25% rate, New York state income tax at a 6.45% rate and FICA tax (which finances Social Security and Medicare) at 7.65%, I get to keep 61 cents of each additional dollar I earn—not great.

By saving in an HSA, I can shelter all 100 cents of every additional dollar I earn from taxation forever, assuming I use the money for medical bills.

Due to the HSA’s extra tax advantages, each dollar I put into my account will turn into $2.19 after 20 years, assuming a 4% annual inflation-adjusted return, according to Vanguard Group By contrast, the same dollar will be worth just $1.64 after I take it out of a traditional 401(k) in two decades and pay income taxes on the withdrawal. (The example assumes a 25% federal income-tax rate and ignores state tax.)

In an HSA, “savings can compound to produce higher returns than those available from other accounts,” said Maria Bruno, senior investment strategist at Vanguard.

Even if I decide to tap my HSA to cover current medical bills, it is still worthwhile to contribute, said Roy Ramthun, a consultant who specializes in high-deductible plans and HSAs. The reason: The upfront tax deduction allows me to keep the 39 cents per dollar I would otherwise have had to pay in taxes.

To withdraw money tax-free from an HSA, you have to use it for qualified expenses. Those can include not just medical bills but also dental and vision-care expenses, premiums for all types of Medicare plans except for Medigap, and a portion of long-term-care insurance premiums.

If you use your HSA for nonmedical expenses, you will owe income tax on your distributions—and a 20% penalty if you are younger than 65.

If you are organized and stockpile receipts for past medical costs you paid out of pocket since establishing the HSA, you can file for reimbursement in retirement. Doing this will allow you to supplement your retirement income tax-free in years in which tapping other accounts would push you into a higher tax bracket or expose you to higher Medicare premiums.

“You could conceivably buy a boat or motorcycle with HSA money if you have receipts for qualified medical expenses” you paid out of pocket in the past that are equal to the purchase price, said Eric Remjeske, president of Devenir Group LLC, which advises banks offering HSA investment platforms.

personalfinance,Refinance FHA PMI into Conventional ...,"My current mortgage has a PMI of ~$300 a month on my mortgage payment of $3,100. Current interest rate is 3.7%.

I contacted my lender and they said they are willing to refinance my FHA loan into a conventional without any charge (state fees, property assessment, etc are all free). There are two options:

1. The property isn't valued enough and in this case the PMI will be covered by the lender for a slightly higher interest rate (saves me $80 a month off my current payment).

2. The property is valued enough that there is no PMI and the interest rate is slightly higher than my current one saving me ~150 a month.

I have great credit (740) and my income is $120,000 plus bonus, etc. The mortgage refinance is being recalculated to finish at the same time as my current mortgage (approx 27 yrs). 

He said this will save me money as I am not eligible to deduct the PMI as my income is too high. The extra interest will actually decrease my taxes owed according to him.

personalfinance,Buying vs. renting - cost impact (Brooklyn -&gt; Westchester county),"My family (wife, stepdaughter) and I were living in Brooklyn and moved out to Westchester county to purchase a house. I figured it would be interesting to share with you the monthly impact on our budget. I excluded constant items such as my monthly MetroCard pass, which I'm paying both before and after moving.

Brooklyn (2 br, 600 sqft)
- rent: 2,600 (not rent-controlled, below typical rental price for 2 br in Brooklyn)
- electricity: 50 (annualized average)
- gas: 78 (annualized average)
- renters insurance: 0 (didn't take one)
- NYC income tax: 157
Total: 2,885

Westchester county (3 br, 1,500 sqft)
- mortgage: 1,530 (3.875% interest rate, APR 3.957%)
- mortgage insurance: 0 (we had enough downpayment not to need it)
- HOA: 450
- home insurance: 91
- property tax: 777
- gas + electricity: 200 (expected annual average)
- water: 55 (expected annual average)
- MTA-North monthly pass to Manhattan: 239
- school bus monthly pass: 20
- STAR exemption: (215)
Total incl. STAR exemption: 3,146
(3,362 excl. STAR exemption)

Conclusion:
- ""hidden"" transportation costs must be factored in to assess the impact of the move
- not having a car (we're biking and walking our way around) is key to have the move make sense financially speaking
- we're paying more compared to renting for 2-3 years due to HOA fees, but things will even out from year 3, as we're stabilizing our accomodation cost instead of being subject to annual rent increase :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Virtual beanie babies?,"So I have a few grand in bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.  It's up 20% over the past couple of months.  It's just a pure gamble.

I see people on here literally taking their life savings, one guy just yesterday, and putting it into what are essentially virtual beanie babies and I'd like to hear your counter-points. 

Crypto is inherently worthless. (We can say the same thing about dollars/euros, but we can agree that they at least are much more widely accepted). Gold, silver, rolexes, guns, etc. at least have some inherent value/usefulness.

There are no barriers to entry to new coins - as we can see.  So those of you spreading your bets across multiple coins, it's an infinite chase.  You can point to new technology and the cap within coins, but the number of coins is limitless.

In new coins, the only guaranteed winners are those who create the coins and take as many as they like, then pump it up for suckers and dump it as they see fit.  As bad as the fed is, when Janet Yellen prints $100B, she doesn't automatically keep 10% for herself. 

So to me, they aren't currency at all. They are collectibles.  Yes, it's semi-anonymous, semi-instant transfer, etc. But the attraction of a limited availability makes it look a lot more like baseball cards or tulip bulbs. The fluctuation scares most vendors and rightfully so, and without them, the ubiquity can't happen, pushing it further from being a currency.

Like I said, I've got money in, but the majority of my investments are in US and global index funds. Spreading risk is healthy and history is littered with ugly bubbles including our recent history.

personalfinance,Questions on rolling over an IRA + 401(k) to the TSP,"I just recently got a job in the federal government and have an IRA with Vanguard and a 401(k) from my old company administered through T. rowe Price. Now I have a TSP and am contributing to it pre-tax. I am no longer contributing to the IRA or the 401(k), which I was contributing to pre-tax. I want to rollover those two accounts into the TSP but am having trouble understanding the process. Questions below:

1)	In order to initiate this transaction, I basically have to fill out a form (TSP-60) and deliver it to my 401(k) provider and Vanguard. This is basically stating “move my money over to this account”. Correct? 

2)	I can not find out who to send this form to for Vanguard. Whenever I try to search for this process on Vanguards site, all it has information on is if I want to move money from another account to Vanguard, which is the opposite of what I want to do. 

3)	The T.rowe price site is the same, it only has information on how to send money to the T. rowe price account. I think I need to contact HR at my old job and find out how to do this… does that sound right to you? Does anyone with experience in this area have to do that? 

4)	Can anyone else walk me through this process? Has anyone done this process before for their Vanguard IRA or any other account, moving their balance over to the TSP? I am trying to do a direct rollover.",finance
personalfinance,401k and HSA questions,"I made another post with too much information last night, but I had a couple specific questions I was hoping to get feedback on.

I'm 31, income: $64,000 base and another $20-30k from overtime. Have student loans and car payments, owe let's say 38k all together, all interest rates under 4.25%

Currently have $21k in my 401k. I was going to up my 401k contributions to 9% Traditional and 9% Roth. My company will match a total of 5.5%. 401k is through Vanguard with excellent funds. 

Switching to HDHP and will start an HSA. Company will contribute $1200 and I was going to contribute $2400 to max. Currently healthy, but will eventually have a family etc and wanted to build HSA up in anticipation of that.

1) If I have an excellent 401k with Roth options, do I need to start a Roth IRA? I could mostly likely max out a Roth IRA in addition to the 18% I'm about to be putting in, but I was wanting to use that for debt repayment.

2) Is it worthwhile to max out my HSA now when it will be years before I will have any major health expenses?",finance
personalfinance,Graduating MS student trying to get a handle on my financial roadmap,"**Background**

Title. I'm 22 and a MS student in my final year of college for a degree in computer science (specializing in computer security). Due to a number of internships and scholarships, I'm in a secure place financially. I want to take the money I have and optimize where I put it to get the most out of it (obviously). I think I know what I'm doing, but realistically, I'm just a grad student, so I'm sure I'm doing something wrong.

**Income**

As mentioned above, I'm currently a MS student that is fully funded, so I'm not incurring any additional educational debt anymore. Furthermore, I receive 3777.78 per month as a stipend. However, nothing is withheld from this (no FICA/Federal/State), so I know I'm going to owe tax big time when I file.

**Debt**

I have some loans still from my undergraduate education:

Federal Unsub Stafford:

6,333.20  @ 3.86%

7,414.29  @ 4.66%

2,246.17  @ 4.29%

Federal Sub Stafford:

5,433.00  @ 4.29% 

Private Loan:

11,532.11 @ 5.62%

All my federal loans are still in deferment, so I don't HAVE to start making payments on them now, but I can if it makes sense. I currently make a payment of $250/month towards my private loan (I've been paying it since when I took it out), but I think with rate its accruing interest, I should try kill it faster.

**Expenses**

$250.00		-&gt;	Loan payment

$468.33		-&gt;	Rent

~$80.00		-&gt;	Utilities

~$120.00	-&gt;	Food

$156.00		-&gt; 	Car Insurance

~$50.00		-&gt;	Gas


I typically spend $200-$300 on ""fun"" expenses/luxuries, which includes things like eating out, buying beer, going to events with friends, etc. Obviously these could be cut if money was tight.

**Savings**

I've been maxing out my Roth IRA with Vanguard for the past two tax years, and it's currently sitting at $11.5k. I have it fully invested in VTTSX (Target Date 2060). I've already contributed $5500 for 2017.

Additionally, I've been stuffing away money in a brokerage account (looking to make a down payment on a house in the next 2-3 years). I have about $11.7k in there, invested in VSMGX (LifeStrategy Moderate Growth).

Finally, I have ""buffer fund"" of $3600 that I use to pay for groceries, utilities, rent, etc. At the end of the month, I top it off back to $3600 and put whatever's left over from my stipend after that into my brokerage account. This is usually around $2500.

**Transport**

The city I'll be moving to doesn't have great public transport, so a car will be a requirement to get to work. Fortunately, I fully own my car (2009 VW GTI with 140k miles on it). It needs some love every once in a while, but it's fairly reliable and I'm pretty handy and can fix most things. Ends up being maybe $400/yr in maintenance/repairs. I'm likely going to want to fix the AC in it come summer, but I've survived this long without, so that's optional. I plan to keep this car for the forseeable future (drive it into the ground).

**Current Plan**

I'll be graduating in May to work at a national research lab with a salary of ~100k in the Boston area. What I'm trying to do here is plan for the next few years. I know that I'm going to have to relocate to be near my job, and that's going to pull my rent from $468 to likely $1800-2000. My goal is to be &lt;5 miles from work, so I can bike most days in the summer (save the miles on my car). My current plan is to rent for a year of two, and if everything is going well, I want to make a down payment on a house. A decent started home in the area will go for 300-400k, so I'll be looking to save up ~100k for a down payment. I've had a small credit card for the past year with a limit of 1750. I've always paid the bill in full each month, so I have FICO score of 775 (according to Discover).

**Given this, I have these questions:**

1. How can I mitigate/pre-empt the large amount of money I will owe to the IRS at the end of this year as a result of nothing being withheld from my stipend?

2. Should I countinue with my current strategy of making a smallish payments on my private loan/ignoring my loans in deferment and dumping money into my brokerage account, or should I start trying to kill the loans?

3. When I contribute to my IRA, I've been doing it in one lump sum on the first day of the year, with the idea that the longer it sits in the account, the better off I am. However, I've heard that it might be better to space contributions out over the course of the year to better protect against market fluctuations. Is there any merit to this?

4. If I just pay my loans in full, how badly will it impact my credit score? Currently, these loans are my oldest accounts, (only had a credit card for the past year or so), so paying them off in full would mean the average age of my accounts is ~1 year.

5. I have no idea what I'm doing with my portfolio. Is having my IRA fully invested in a target date fund okay? With my brokerage account, I'm just looking for somewhere to put my money that's *relatively* safe, as I don't need it now, but I'll be looking to use it in the next few years.

6. Is planning to buy a house in a few years stupid? As a condition of my scholarship, I'll be locked into working for a national lab for at least the next few years, so the likelihood of switching jobs in the next 5 years is almost 0. Past that, I'm pretty sure I'll stick around (I've interned at the lab before, really really enjoy the work culture that's the opposite of the startup 80/hr week), and job security in my field is almost absolute, so it seems like it would make sense to buy a house over continuing to pay &gt;1.8k month in rent.

7. Can I keep my parent's health insurance after I graduate? Or do I have to look into getting my own?

personalfinance,Parents Retirement Strategy,"Hello PF,

I am seeking some help for my parents in their upcoming retirement. My father is retiring this December from a Texas school district, age is 72, and my mother is currently retired, age is 70. I am trying my best to make sure they don't lack for money, or a strategy once the paychecks stop rolling in.

He has a few options that he is considering doing to maximize the amount of money that they will get in retirement. Because of his years with the school district he gets to draw from TRS, and Social Security. Mother can only draw from Social Security. There are 4 ""plans"" that we are looking at. 

**Plans**

1.) Allows for an income, after taxes, of approximately $8,200. This is a comfortable amount to cover their expenses, and my mother will be guaranteed this income after my father passes. EDIT: This $8,200 includes what they receive from Social Security.

2.) Same as Plan 1, but this pays a $100K lump sum at the beginning of retirement to do as you see fit. The actual monthly payment from TRS is lower in this plan, but my father has looked into dumping this money into an IRA, for growth as well as having a minimum distribution of $1,200/month pulled from the IRA balance.

3.) Same as Plan 1&amp;2, but this pays a $200K lump sum. Same basic strategy as Plan 2, but they might consider paying off some loans with this money, I will get into that further down.

4.) Same as before, but this pays a $300K lump sum. Same basic strategy as Plan 2, although the minimum distribution was increased to $2,000, but they might consider paying off some loans with this money, I will get into that further down.

**Loans**

Currently the largest draw on their income is the house payment, and 2 car payments. We are considering using some of the lump sum money to pay off one, or all of these loans, but only if it would be more advantageous to pay taxes on the lump sum withdrawal versus paying the extra interest on the loans.

**House**

Refinanced in 2016 for 15 years. Interest rate is 3.25%, Principal is ~$160K. Monthly payments do include an escrow payment, ~$740,  that will continue even after the loan is paid in full. 

**Car 1**

Bought in 2014 with a 5 year loan, 3.5% interest, original principal is ~$47K. Remaining balance is ~$28K.

**Car 2**

Bought in 2016 with a 5 year loan, 3.9% interest, original principal is ~$33K. Remaining balance is ~$28K.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion, they should go for Plan 3 from above, and use the original lump sum to pay off the house, and possibly one of the cars. With any remaining funds from the lump sum, they should invest into a an IRA. However, my only real problem with this is the fact that I'm not entirely savvy on the rules/penalties of the different IRAs with someone my fathers age. He, and I both don't want the advantages of paying off the loans to be outweighed by paying taxes on the IRA withdrawal. 

If there are any extra details that need to be added, or something clarified, please ask. I will be available for responses. I appreciate the help in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Investment strategy for first timer (~4K/month),"Looking to tap into the wealth of advice on this forum as many others have. Mainly, in terms of what my savings/investment strategy. I am 28 years old and until this point have mainly used my extra income to pay down my student loan balance. I am unmarried and rent. A snapshot of my current financial situation:

After tax monthly income = $8,000

Employer contributed profit sharing retirement plan = ~$14,500/yr.

Loans (balance/monthly payment/interest rate) = 
1. Car (-25,000/476/1.9).  2. Student (-11,000/462/3.865)

Savings = ~9,000 in AAPL
Retirement (Roth IRA) = Total = ~21,000 (AAPL=10,000, LYG = 6,000, VGSTX = 3,500, VTIVX  = 1,500).
Checking = 6,000

Rent/Utilities = 1,200/mo
Misc. Budget = 1,800/mo.

The rest of the loans average between 5.75 and 6.49% These are all spread out between Wells Fargo, Mohela, and Great Lakes.

I've looked into student loan re-finance sites like SoFi and a few others, but they all require me have finished my degree, a condition I don't meet. We each have excellent credit, and stable job histories, I just haven't found the right program.

personalfinance,PHEAA Teacher Loan Forgiveness problem,"This is my sixth year as a public school science teacher in a low-income school. As such I qualify for the forgiveness of up to $17,500 after my fifth year of service.

I applied for forgiveness through PHEAA in June but have heard nothing more than that they put my loans in forbearance. I just learned that PHEAA is massively screwing up applications for loan forgiveness:

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/business/dealbook/student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit.html

My question: what state or federal agencies would be best to contact about this situation? The Department of Education has no information about the application since they are waiting for PHEAA to make a determination, but when I contacted PHEAA a few weeks ago the person I spoke to on the phone told me that I just needed to wait until they contacted me, which they have not done yet. My loans leave forbearance in December.

Thanks for reading, hoping someone else has been through this and has advice for me.

personalfinance,Better to pay down car to equal equity or refinance now?,"I have a vehicle that I got a really bad interest rate on when I originally bought it (due to low credit) and I also rolled inequity into the loan (I know, I know).

Well, since then (about 9 months), I've paid off all my credit card debt - about $12k - and raised my credit score from ~590 to a bit over 700.

Amount owed is currently $32,476 @14.18% interest rate. The car is likely worth around $23k, maybe a little less.

So I know that interest rates are front-loaded but I also know that with that much inequity getting refinanced at this point may not drastically lower my interest rate.

My question is, should I refinance now at the lowest possible rate (with my better credit score) or spend some time paying down the car as fast as possible (I can make double payments easily)?

CryptoCurrency,How should crypto banking be done?,"The need for loans is not going to disappear with the adoption of crypto assets. People will still need capital to start a business or build a home. 

As of now I have seen two types of solutions on how to do crypto banking: 

- P2P banking, which is basically peer to peer lending  with a smart contract as the mediator. 

- Normal banking, where the crypto bank controls the capital like a normal bank, only with less interest and under the guise of 'decentralized'. 

Is there a third option? 

The problem with the first solution is that it makes lending highly personal; you can personally lose your money by lending. Personal lending is something the modern world has moved away from, and I don't think we should introduce it again under a new guise. 

The problem with the second solution is that it looks and feels to much like the banks we have grown to despise. 

SOLUTION: 

What if a crypto bank wouldn't own any of its customers holdings? What if lending risk could be shared between thousands of people through specialized algorithms? 
I imagine people putting money into a given crypto bank 'pool'. The pool would be open source and transparent. 
When people want to lend, they have to ask the whole pool (thousands of individual holdings).

This could be done through risk assessment algorithms (access to credit history, liquidity), and if deemed trustworthy, the whole pool would lend together. 
Each person would lend a fraction of his holdings, and the risk would be shared. 
With thousands of loans, interest rates would accumulate and each lender would receive interest rates as if he loaned out his money to one person, when in fact he has loaned to thousands of people (thus diversified his risk).

In this way, the bank is just the medium, and it's core responsibility would be to oversee this process and make sure it's as safe as possible. 
The bank would take a very small portion of the accumulated interest rates, but would of course never issue currency or own the customers money. The bank would just be the platform, as it's meant to be.

Did I manage to explain the idea? 

I really hope someone creates a bank like this!",cryptocurrency

I have the following questions and don't know who to ask since people who answer the phones at Masshealth really don't know definitive answers. I have a lot of medical expenses and it would be disastrous to have Masshealth taken away from me retroactively.  Who do I ask these questions?  A CPA?  Not sure they would know either...

1.  My 2017 annual income is way below Masshealth income limits (mine will be about $5000 total annual).  However in December 2017 I'll earn $2000 (the limit is about $1300 / month).  This shouldn't disqualify me from coverage in December, though, since the year's amount is still way below 133% federal poverty level -- right?

2.  Are deductions not included in my self employed income?  So I deduct business expenses first, and that amount is what is used to determine eligibility in Masshealth?

3.  Are assets counted in eligibility determination?  I am under 65.  I have asked the people at Masshealth multiple times and they tell me my assets (savings account) aren't considered but I want to make sure.",finance
personalfinance,"$32k in debt, is there a better way?","I am currently in debt $17,350 in credit cards and have $15,000 left on my vehicle. I financed my vehicle with no debt, but due to poor planning (life events) I racked up credit card debt quite quickly.  
  
Credit Card interest rates vary from 20.24% to 26.24% across 4 cards ($484 per month at minimum payment).  
Vehicle interest is at 4.99% ($475 per month). Insurance is $222 per month.  
Other expenses sit at $780.90 per month.  
Monthly income averages $2,700.  
I moved back home so I have no living expense there, other than providing all of my own food.  
  
As best I can figure I need to cut back expenses. I have been looking over meal plans and how to save there, as food is by far my largest monthly payment (roughly $400-500 per month). I am going to cancel all media accounts (streaming video/radio/gaming). I am looking into getting a cheaper internet and phone bill since I can't justify high speeds anymore or even a smartphone bill. I believe I can reduce my ""other"" expenses from $780.90 per month down to roughly $400 per month.  
  
As is I can make roughly $738 per month in extra payments. With reducing my living expenses I can manage about $1088. I don't want to spend it all as I have recently been trying to get an emergency fund going. I currently have about $2,500 in ""cash"" should something bad happen. Most of my cards are within $250-750 of their limits so I know I can't use those as a safe backup. Regardless I think putting $750 per month, of my $1,088 ""extra"" cash, towards the highest interest rate credit card seems to be the best idea. Doing so would, with my limited knowledge of math/interest, have my debt paid off in a little over 3 years.  
  
I am mostly curious if this is a good plan. I get daily letters from loan offices that I simply do not trust. If I could get a loan approved I would imagine a credit union or bank would be the safer route. However I applied for one consolidation loan at a credit union where a friend works and I was denied. As such I have not perused that path any further for the sake of my credit.

personalfinance,(CAN) Put 50% downpayment on condo or wait and rent instead?,"So im in my mid 20's. Will be staying in Toronto long term. Parents have put 150-200k specifically aside to buy a condo downtown toronto. Im going back to school for my masters which will take 2 more years. We're thinking of either

a) Buy a condo, put 40%-50% as a downpayment on a condo up to 380k (right now we're looking at around 350k but we have a budget of 380k) Average maintenance fee is around $250, proportionate to square footage and tax average at $170. Interest rate we've been quoted at 2.25%. So the monthly total given a 50% downpayment and average maintenance fee and tax would be about $1200, excluding hydro. Location wise, we're looking at in demand areas in the downtown core.

b) i'll rent out with roommate for now and either put the downpayment money aside and let it grow or invest in something.

Which scenario here would be better? Would waiting be better and see in a couple years when i graduate what happens or next year? Or buy now since we have the money?

I paid my own way through college, using a mix of grants, scholarships, PT work and student loans. Like many new grads, I got a little carried away my first year or two after graduating and incurred some more debt. However about a year ago I got serious about paying it off and started using the snowball method for the small psychological wins and continued motivation. I've already paid off one small credit card of ~$2800 and made a huge dent in another credit card to the tune of ~$8000. I am currently at the following:

- $1400 remainder of credit card debt at 0% interest
- $8000 car loan at 3.9%
- $20,000 student loans, broken up into: $1600 @ 6.55%, $3100 @ 5.96%, $6500 @ 3.61% and the remainder ~$8800 @ 3.15%

I also have a 401k at work, last I checked was just over $20k saved. I had been putting in 8% but decreased to 3% which is the max my employer matches so I could free up some cash to funnel twds debt. I keep a very lean emergency fund, saving for only 2 months of expenses that can't be covered on a credit card and am living at home with mom to save some money.

Minimum payment on my car is $240, student loans is $245 and the credit card is $100. I pay an additional $1000-1200 per month on the credit cards currently, then plan on snowballing it into the car payment to finish that by May. Once that is done, I intend to knock out the student loans with the 6.55 and 5.96 interest rates. 

After that, I'm not sure whether I should continue snowballing my debt payments into the student loans to get those done (would be approx summer of 2019) or paying the minimum on the loans and saving some money for a down payment on a condo. I really want to stop renting and start building some equity. I'd feel comfortable applying for a mortgage once my car payment is out of the way.

Fellow redditors, does this sound like a reasonable plan? What would you do differently (aside from the avalanche method... I need the small psychological wins to keep going). Thanks in advance for the advice.",finance

I need to know what I should do now to get as much as a head start as possible for investments. I am very aware that with my family's current financial descent, I am in the calm before the storm, which means that I need to prepare as much as possible for the net few upcoming years.

The school stopped loaning me money and sent a $7000 bill to collections which I've begun to pay off this year (~$196 per month, which is the lowest they would go).

personalfinance,Can someone critique my plan to pay off my debt?,"**22 yo here who has accumulated about ~$4,500 of credit card debt.** 

I recently graduated from nursing school and currently make $26/hr but will make $40/48 per hour (day/night differential- I rotate every month) once I'm off orientation in February. 

I had 4 credit cards but have successfully paid off 2 so far. Other bills include my rent which is $2,000/mo (I know) and electricity (~$100/mo). No student loans. With my rent being so expensive and my pay being docked while on orientation- I only have $500 left over each month for credit card payments, groceries, etc. 

Not going to lie- I'm an idiot when it comes to personal finance. I wish I had taken a class in college. Anyways- if anyone has any book/video recommendations I'd happily welcome that. I wrote out a plan today for paying off my CCs. I'll post it below. I'd appreciate any critiques or advice.

Plan is to pay off CC #2 first d/t the lower balance. Is that the best thing to do? Interest rates for each are almost identical.

**Credit Card #1 = $3,327.04 (min. payment $110)**

* December (-110, min. payment only) = $3,217

* January (-110, min. payment only) = $3,107

* February (-110, min. payment only) = $2,997

* March (-110, min. payment only) = $2, 887

* April (-400, payment increase) = $2,487

* May (-400) = $2,087

* June (-400) = $1,687

* July (-563, payment increase) = $1,124

* August (-562) = $562

* September (-562) = **$0 paid off**

**Credit Card #2 = $1,169.64 (min. payment $25)** 

* December (-200) = $969

* January (-200) = $769

* February (-200) = $569

btc,LOL!!! Censorship dam cracked wide open on /r/Bitcoin,"Yes /r/Bitcoin, when you use heavy censorship and disinformation agents to fool people into HODLing BTC, make people lose 100%+ profit within 48 hours, and make them watch another chance of a life time quickly slip away with their money stuck in your bullshit Blockstream Core Segwit 1MB mempool for over 24 hours, they're just not going to even pretend to listen to your bullshit.

They're just going to speak the truth, and you can't ban them all because there are just too many of them now.

When you say HODL and they watch 100% profit go poof, hiring a shill to call it an ""attack"" isn't going to work, as far as they're concerned, you're the one attacking their wallets.

Money speak louder than words and no amount of shills can change their mind now, yes, go ahead, print another 100mil Tethers to pump BTC, and create a few BCH/USDT markets to push BCH back down with fake money, our friends from China saw you coming 3 months ago and they will bleed you dry with ease.

Most of the brainwashed idiots over at /r/Bitcoin have no idea this is just the beginning, they have no idea how long have we been working on this double head fake, we're going to nail BTC to the wall, suck BTC dry and leave Blockstream with a hollow mummified shell that they spent over 2 years and 100million to tie down.

Half the 100,000 tx clogged in the BTC mempool at this moment are from people rushing to buy Bitcoin Cash YESTERDAY.

We know for a fact many from Blockstream/Core/DCG are dumping BTC for BCH while at the same time telling idiots to HODL BTC.

For now BTC will be on USD Tether life support, while we keep turning fake Tethers into profit, then eventually BCH/BTC will hit the 3000/3000 mark, flips over and all hell breaks loose.

Guess why this happened on a weekend.

I had around $160k in student loans a year ago, and paid off $60k this year, leaving me with about $100k in loans. 

I recently refinanced at 3.35% interest rate for a 5 year fixed on the remainder. 

I am currently saving 7% in my 401k, plus my employer match (which is only .25% because they have also have a pension that kicks in after 3 years, match is only up to the first 6%). 

I am 30 years old, and my 401k/IRA savings overall are probably below norm (a little over $50k). 

My loan interest rate is pretty low, so I feel like the normal advice is to invest. However, my 401k is already very aggressive (100% equity ETF's, about 25% of which is small and mid cap). 

I also may want to buy a house in about 5 years or so (will cost about $1.2M here, my fiancee makes $80k and I expect decent salary appreciation for both of us, so it should be affordable for us), so I am also considering starting to save for that. 

Also somewhat soon, will need to pay for a wedding, and want at least a nominal increase in living standards (e.g. our rent is less than 10% of our combined income at $2200, it's nice, but I'd like to live next to the beach; I uber everywhere instead of having a nice car)

personalfinance,How do I find a place to live when I’m broke? How do I manage school and work?,"my mom keeps making hints about wanting me out of her house and a few weeks ago she got a little tipsy and pretty much told me I’m her biggest regret. I kind of already figured that out for myself, but I️t still sucked hearing I️t. 

Anyways, I need to move out ASAP and I’ve been constantly looking for living arrangements and I can’t seem to find any that aren’t sketchy or out of my affordability. Joining the military isn’t an option. 

I’m in community college, but I went to student services and financial aid and they both said they can’t help me outside of recommending student housing for neighboring colleges. 

I talked to 18, yes 18 student apartment complexes and none of them could work with me on my situation (bad credit, no guarantor, spotty job history — I’ve only had my current job for 3 months and I would have to quit I️t to relocate closer to school which means finding another job ) 

Which I figured would happened. I turned to the internet, and while I’ve been saving as much $ as I can, selling things online and on CL, I haven’t had much luck either. While I do save money, I still have to spend money monthly on 

gas - $30
food - $40 
water bill - $30 
electricity bill - $90 (my half)
cell bill - $50 (I have unlimited everything and use my phone as WiFi for school work) 
car insurance - $140 


I️ can only afford about $400 a month for rent right now. The motels aren’t that cheap, AirBnB isn’t that cheap. I called a few churches and they said their rooming houses start at $600 a month and I would need to convert religions and attend church daily. 

My current job I only make $400 a month and I sell things on the side, but I’ve heard rumors our boss was losing money and may start cutting people. I’m a great worker and I’ve started kissing a lot of ass lately and picking up shifts for people but I’m still the last person to be hired. 

I want to stay in school because I get my federal loan from them and because I want a enjoyable future. 

I called two women’s shelters and both told me that I didn’t qualify as someone in emergency need (even though my mom has threatened physical abuse) and that I should use them as a absolute last resort. 

I have crawled through CL listings and made my own listing which just resulted in men hitting on me or creepy (and I do mean creepy) couples. I’ve made a listing on roommate websites, no response. The only requirement I have is that I don’t have live with a single man. That’s I️t. 

Other people I contacted on CL want 3 months rent plus a security deposit, which I don’t have. I’m sure my mom will kick me out soon. 

I’m incredibly stressed with having to find a new job, new transportation, and a new place to live. I don’t have any family and when I mentioned a bit about my situation to friends at school, one girl said she wanted to move out ASAP and that her credit score was 700+, but she doesn’t make enough $ to lease an apartment and her conservative Indian parents won’t co-sign for her either.

[–]peptocurrency[S] 12 points 7 hours ago 
Sure, here you go: Digital Currency Group, owned by central bankers, owns Blockstream, the company responsible for development and operation of the Lightning Network, a sidechain which, once operational, stands to remove the power from miners and centralize transactions within Blockstream's control (i.e. Digital Currency Group's control. i.e. central banker control).
On top of this, BitGo, yet another company invested in and partly owned by the Digital Currency Group, offers ""special security"" to the operation of sidechains (i.e. Lightning Network) to prevent double spending (since Lightning Network would consequently be running transactions outside the blockchain).
TL;DR: Digital Currency Group (funded by MasterCard), owners of Blockstream and Bitgo, (the companies responsible for LN development and operation), is run by central bankers. It doesn't get much more clear than that.

Bitcoin,Capitalism,"What we have seen in the last few months and especially the last few weeks is not an attack on Bitcoin. The reality is that Bitcoin is a asset you can hold, the price of which is determined by what someone else is willing to pay you for that asset. Nothing more nothing less.

What we are seeing is pure, unregulated, old fashioned capitalism. We have two similar competing products: BTC and BCH and they are battling it out to the death so to speak. One will win and one will lose. It is not up to Roger Ver or Jihan or Blockstream who is the winner but the market. The market will decide what the fair value is for both coins using such metrics as scarcity, usability, acceptance, etc. Whilst people or groups or governments can influence the market to some extent they can't decide the market.  

I suspect that for many people on Reddit this is a concept that they've not really encountered before. In the last 10 years QE, bail-outs, TBTF and artificially low interest rates have shielded many people from the 'negative' effects of capitalism Can't afford your mortgage... No problem we'll just lower the interest rates to 0%. Been scammed by a Nigerian Prince? No problem the banking industry has a special  fund to bail your stupid ass out. etc. 

In order to maintain balance in a system the negative aspects need to result in actual hardship to the individual, otherwise you end up with a system that is not capitalism but one where the gains are privatised but the losses are socialised. This is the system that 95% of people use today.

The two major problems with the above system is that 1) As businesses and individuals are not allowed to fail they are effectively being rewarded for their mistakes, this leads them to make even greater mistakes. 2) The market is essentially destroyed as true price discovery can not happen.

In the long term the current system described above is not sustainable and will eventually collapse.

Bitcoin and crypto's in general is probably the most open and free market that has existed in the last 50 years. Any losses will not be socialised but be born by the individual. This is necessary for true price discovery.

On this Reddit I have seen people demanding that Roger Ver is arrested for exchanging (potentially) BTC for BCH. They are his Bitcoins he can do what he wants with them. Sell them, hodl them, destroy them that's his business. If this concept is a problem for you then I would suggest that it is not wise to be investing in to Bitcoin and put your Dollars, Pounds , Euros or Yen in to a traditional bank.

You hear much about how 'broken' capitalism is in the present world. The reason why it is broken is because it is not capitalism. What we currently have is a system where the worst parts of capitalism and socialism have been combined to create a centrally planned illusion of wealth funded by debt and papered over by market manipulation. To expose this system for what it has become is the reason why Bitcoin exists.

In conclusion capitalism is good, it will determine which coin comes out top, there will be winners and losers. The winners will be the ones that can weigh up both sides objectively and form a opinion and stick to it, the losers will be the one that make a choice based on emotional attachment or those who are indecisive.

personalfinance,30 years old. How am I doing financially? Seeking for guidance and critique,"Hello r/personalfinance readers,

&amp;nbsp;
I have been reading this subreddit pretty much every day for years. This is my first post here, so bear with me. I am in need of serious guidance/critique. Please feel free to be honest. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**: I am 30 years old, unmarried, no kids. I have a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from a northeastern university. I have held up odd jobs here and there and have employment gaps on my resume due to depression/ feeling worthless. I never went into debt nor have made any stupid financial decisions as of yet.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have been living with my sibling since college years. I gave up and felt rejected when I didn’t find a job in my field and kept getting rejected for job openings. I used to be depressed in college years, feeling apathetic due to living conditions and family atmosphere. Lack of a professional career/ income has fed into my depression over the years.

&amp;nbsp;

Since high school, I have lived under the principle to never be in-debt. This has caused me to not take any risks and be fiscally conservative since college. I didn’t have any work experience after college graduation, nor did I have enough money to my name. So, I took up a job when I was given a chance. Since my income has been unsteady over the years, I saved whatever I could from my paychecks. For the past 7 years, I have not made more than $22,000/year. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly Budget**: 
&amp;nbsp;

Here is an approximate monthly budget: 

&amp;nbsp;

Item | Amount | Note
:--|:--|:--
Rent | 420 | (300 to 420, roughly owed to sibling)
Phone | 43 	
Internet | 51 	
Gas/Electric | 120 | (Yearly average)	
Car insurance | 40 
Groceries | 250 | (Varies)
Clothing/ Laundry | 23 
Transportation | 97 	
Misc/Fun | 100 |
**Total** | **1144**

**The Ask**: So, how am I doing? I have a healthy emergency fund of 15,500. I know I am not in debt, but I feel I’m not going anywhere in life. I live like a poor man’s life and keep on dreaming about having a nice break that never comes. At 30 years, I have no respectable work experience. The most I have earned was working $20/hr and that job lasted 5 months. I am tired of thinking I can’t get a decent job. I feel a potential employer will throw away my resume as a joke, being insignificant. When I think of applying for jobs, I end up looking for labor type of work and I feel that I don’t deserve a blue collar job because my resume speaks volumes of a directionless/ unmotivated adult.  

&amp;nbsp;

I feel I’ll never be able to afford to own a house, have kids, provide a better future for them or retire peacefully. I have been living in constant financial anxiety for the past few years. At 30, I still can’t stand on my own feet and afford a place to live by myself. I have been relying on the graces of my older sibling and not have to worry about paying rent (Have saved up for back rent separately). I don't feel like a fully functioning adult. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am now starting to realize I need to jump start my life and be on my feet. I want to reach the goal of having a net worth of 100k by the time I am 33.5. Saving 20k/year is a tall task for my circumstances, but I want to believe in this goal and make it a reality in the future. What can I do besides getting a good job? I have no sense of direction. 

&amp;nbsp;

Kind regards,

personalfinance,I have buried myself financially by getting three payday loans to pay my rent for November.,"Two $375 loans (2 monthly payments each, $103
One $800 loan (monthly payment $220)


All of these loans are 12 month loans with retarded interest rates.


I'm looking for advice on how to tackle this.  Should I work with a consolidation company?  I think they will have me default on the loans, which would even further destroy my credit.  Should I try to pay them off one at a time check, by check?  I will need some outside financial assistance with this route.  Girlfriend, parents, etc.


I will not be able to buy Christmas presents for my family this year.  I hope they understand.


These are horrible decisions I made because I was too prideful to ask for help from anyone.  Thanks for listening.


TL;DR - I took out three payday loans, the payments equal about half my take home, looking for advice on how to dig out

Edit:  Wow! Thank you for all of the advice.  I've not only strengthened bonds with my girlfriend and family with what I've taken away from this, but I'm going to get out of this mess before it gets worse.  I've feel like a new person.  It's really stupid what I did, but I've learned so much it's nearly worth the debt.  In the end it's just money.

personalfinance,Recently Paid Off Credit Card Debt: Trying to Decide Which Debt to Tackle Next,"So I paid off my credit card debt this weekend (yay me) and I'm thinking through which debt to tackle next.  I will be applying the credit card payment of about $500 to the next debt.  

The first is student loans at about 6.8%, 15K and a monthly payment of $289.  I've paid all the interest already at the beginning of the loan and will be paying just principal with both payment and additional.  

The second debt is a car at 1.2%, 24K and a monthly payment of $525.  I'm still paying interest although the additional will go towards principal only.  

Financially it makes sense to pay off the student loans because of the higher interest rate and quick win, however, I'm leaning towards tackling the car.  The psychological win of reducing the greater debt with higher payments and having those higher payments to apply to the student loan appeals to me.  I realize this goes against all conventional wisdom.  My question is this: Has anyone gone for the psychological win over financial win in their quest to payoff debt?

TL;DR; Is it worth it to go for a psychological win in paying off debt over a financial one even if that win defies conventional logic?",finance

personalfinance,Finance home renos or move? (Purchased home),"Hey PF,

I recently moved to a new place for $400k last year with 20% down to a home in one of the best neighbourhoods in town. It was an older home 75 years old but was recently slightly renovated although they had awful choice. I'm in Canada so received first time home buyers credits which pretty much offset upfront costs.

However, I definitely underestimated the amount of work required on things like the following:

* massive lot = mow, yard work, rake, for days and days
* many small fixes = never feel like you're relaxing (ex. is garage roof leaking, put on a new roof myself and had to straighten and brace the detached garage, 30 cracked panes of glass in the old wooden windows = lots of glazing and painting on ladders, rotting basement wood finished without proper insulation = gutting and hauling job)


I haven't put that much into the place since I've done a lot of the work myself maybe about $2,000 in total. But I still see lots of work: insulate and frame the basement, gut and reno the kitchen/bathroom, landscape the backyard since there's almost no grass, redo the crumbling driveway, decide if it's better to replace or live with older windows. I also underestimated how annoying it was to live next to a popular street, it's only 1 lane each way but cars with fart cannons go down and I've resorted to ear plugs to sleep some nights.

I figure we could sell this place for about $20k more than when we moved in as a lot of the main issues have been dealt with, but if we gut and reno the kitchen/bathroom we may be able to get about $50k and put in an additional $10k. We could always sell privately to try and avoid the realtor fees, but a home that has been reno'd to a high enough standard would be about $150k more than this place, but less hassle and hopefully quieter nights. Alternatively we could move much farther out increasing our commutes to 50m each day instead of 20m but get a brand new place for $400k. edit:: interest rate was locked in for 5 years at 2.3%, comparatively if we had to renew it'd probably go up to about 2.9% for the 4 additional years.


Has anyone else been in a similar situation and what have you done about it? Also, myself and the fiance are hoping to get married in a year or two, but have that all saved for in cash. About $30k saved for the wedding and $20k as a buffer at the moment.

personalfinance,"Should I wait another year to apply for grad school, again?","I am 29 years old, single, got my Bachelor of Social Work about 4 years ago, so I have another 2 years to get my MSW with advanced standing. Last year I applied to my top choice school and got accepted. It is a private school, but it is highly rated in the US for my degree and is the only school in the nation to offer the ability to personalize your concentration, which is great for the direction I want to take in my career (edit to add: leadership and administration). Changing schools is not an option for me. 

I deferred my acceptance because I wasn't in a great place with my mental health, and I also thought it would be great to get in a better place financially. My mental health has improved slightly, and I am closer to living in the school's city (which has a very low cost of living), but my financial standing has suffered greatly, mostly due to moving across the country and other frustrating setbacks. Now I am nearly 10k in debt between credit cards, a car loan and other various debts (including taxes). No savings except for moving costs, which will be happening before the end of the year, whether I apply this time or not. I'm about 8 hours away and staying with my parents for the last couple of weeks trying to recoup some of the money that was spent moving and getting a different car unexpectedly. Staying much longer is also not an option for me.

It's about time to apply again, but I can't really see how I can improve my situation enough in the next 6 months and support myself through 3 semesters of grad school. Because it will be an advanced standing program and I will have field placements for the duration, I will have little time to work. I'll max out my federal loans just on tuition, but I was offered scholarships from the school and I will be applying for more scholarships outside the school. I am also hoping to do a research fellowship, which may help financially, but will limit my ability to earn a monthly income. I have a couple side hustles I'm working on cultivating, but all of these ideas are going to be hard to maintain in my experience with mental illness. 

I'm really torn because it is torture having to work low-paying BSW jobs, and if I take another year it will be 5 years of waiting and really cutting it close to the advanced standing cut-off. I am eager to get it done, but I also don't want to put myself in a precarious financial/mental situation during school. 

Do you guys have any thoughts or experiences that can give me some perspective? Any of you suggest powering through it? Or am I really risking it by going for it this year?

Edit: My current earning potential as a BSW is between 25-35k. With an MSW, I would modestly expect it to be between 45-55k starting out, but I'll have an administrative focus and will likely make more as the years go on.",finance
personalfinance,Minimum monthly payment towards principle varies up and down?,"I have a Nelnet student loan and I'm checking my payment history. I've been paying the same minimum payment of ~$315 each month, but under ""Applied to Principal"", it varies drastically. 

For example:

August = $154 
September = $212
October = $238
November = $181

How can I apply as much as possible to principal besides increasing my monthly payments? And instead of increasing monthly payments, would it better to pay a lump sum of say ~$3,000 towards the loan now and then continue to pay the minimum monthly payment, or just spread that $3,000 evenly across these monthly payments? 

How can I calculate how much I will be saving by doing a lump sum now over spreading that money across my monthly payments? I want to know if it's worth doing a balance transfer of $3,000 using my credit card to pay off the credit card balance during the 0% interest rate period of 12 months (which I can do comfortably).

He recently started a military residency program and will be active duty for the next 7 years (in 3.5 years, our income will increase by about $44k/year.)  

After his military commitment is up, we plan to buy a house, and I want to be on track for retirement savings. In the next three-ish years, we’d also like to buy two (newer) used cars. Here is a breakdown of our typical monthly budget:

**Living Expenses**

Rent: $1600/month

Utilities: about $450/month

Insurance: $160

Grocery &amp; Gas: $550

**Savings**

Basic savings: $1000/month ($6500 currently in account)

TSP Retirement: $350/month  ($1k currently in this account; 5% match starting Jan 2018)

Misc: I have about $6k in a public employee retirement account 

**Debt**

My Student Debt: $198/month
			
    Subsided  $5,169.42 	3.40%

His Car: $306/month 

    $7,510.73         5.34% 


This leaves us with almost $1500 to do whatever we want. Recently it’s been spent on board certification fees, travel to see family, and furnishing our new house. No kids currently, but it’s likely we’ll have one in the next couple years.

I feel like we have a lot going on, and it’s hard to determine where I should allocate our ""extra"" money. I’d love some recommendations on what we could adjust and a long-term savings account for a house. I assume our regular savings account is best for saving for cars, but I’m betting we should be put more in retirement. What is a good % for our age? What else could we be doing to maximize our income? 

Thanks!

I like Cisco because I believe it to be a solid tech play with a lot of cash stashed outside of the US, I think the income repatriation tax decrease will be part of any tax bill (if there is one). It also has a nice dividend. I have been reading for a long time it is undervalued, but it does not seem to grow much

I got into RTN because I wanted exposure to the defense industry.. I think the next few years will be more volatile than the last few (as far as military conflicts go). 

I bought EPD and SU a couple weeks ago, I think signs that oil will rise in the short-medium term is a pretty solid bet.. I believe EPD is undervalued and has a pretty sweet dividend, and SU has showed investors it can operate very cheaply if necessary (their cost was 22$ a barrel when oil was 33$)

In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks], and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

Combined gross annual income (pre-tax) is a little over $90,000 per year. Debts are around $20k. I have a car loan that is at $13k at 0.9% interest, so monthly payment on that is around $250. My wife has a personal loan around $8k at 6% from consolidating credit card debt awhile back. She's doing great chipping away at it! That's pretty much it for our monthly obligations, besides regular cell phone bill ($50), and utilities in our apartment.
 
Realistically - how much house should we afford? It would be our first house, but we aren't looking for a fixer-upper, as we have no idea how to do anything like that. We have enough for a downpayment, but we'd pay PMI. Credit scores are above 800.
 
I really want to get into a house soon before interest rates go up, plus I want to start building equity rather than the opportunity cost of using my money for rent. This year as been all about extinguishing debt -- my college loans are paid off and I paid off my older car -- until someone crashed into me and totaled it. :(

While doing all the above - we will be saving $1k per month to recoup our savings. Eventually, I'd like to pay extra towards to loan to blitz it (at least 1/12 extra to simulate paying biweekly).

Bitcoin,Everytime your bank charges you a nice little fee- just remember how much they take advantage of you.,"Established banks have almost no risk involved in what they do. If worst came to worst they could simply call the fed to bail them out.

 They take your money, put it in a pile and loan it out to someone in need and charge them a ton of interest on it. I mean, at least now we have a lot more crowdfunding and investment going on. But sometimes a bank loan is the only way to go in life (for property, for example).

Crazy how society hates this kind of control yet every time they set up a direct deposit they are basically saying ""please control me, i need to be controlled"".

I just got charged a fee by my bank because i dropped below a certain balance threshold very briefly, i actually had forgotten about this threshold and saw that i was charged a nice $50 for my negligence. 

So not only do i not get any earning capacity on my money whatsoever, but god forbid i dont give them enough money to reach my threshold or i am punished. 

Actually debating on taking all my money and putting it in crypto. So tired of this bullshit",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What is a realistic pace for paying off student loans? Should I be paying them off early?,"Alternate due to personal/financial information.

Due to a number of personal and financial reasons, I am withdrawing from school, and won't be going back until I've paid off my student loans and saved up for several semesters out of pocket. I am trying to calculate when that point will be.

I just started a new full-time job that makes me about 30k pretax. I live in Minnesota, so federal and state taxes bring that to about 24.2k.

A list of my loans.

* 6500 in federal loans (serviced by Great Lakes) at 3.76%, 120 months.
* 2200 in Perkins loans (serviced by my school) at 5.00%, 120 months.
* 2000 in private loans (serviced by a hometown bank) at 3.25%, 60 months.

The standard payments for all of these add up to 124 per month, but I'd like to pay these loans off sooner so I can get my life/finances back on track. How much would be a decent payment be that still allows me to contribute to savings?

Other financial considerations.

* Rent and insurance is 550 per month (ostensibly a one-bedroom, with two roommates).
* Utilities are roughly 90 per month.
* Health insurance will be 257 per month when I enroll on February 1. Expensive, yes, but to me it seems worth it to have a lower deductible, copay, and out-of-pocket maximum compared to an HSA.
* Phone service is 50 per month.
* I don't own a car, so I rely on a transit pass through my employer for 53 per month.
* Most everything else is negotiable, but I'd still like to save up money in addition to paying off loans quickly.

gaming,Why the XBOX ONE X will ultimately fail even though its a better piece of hardware.,"First lets talk about why Microsoft in theory is a terrible gaming company. 

Microsoft is run like a stuffed shirt over inflated toxic business. The reason why the hardware was done right is simple. The hardware is fact based not creative or talent based. Getting the specs, numbers and engineering together was not very subjective. When people where in those meetings they had facts and numbers to back up there corporate powerpoint's presentations allowing them to move forward. 

The reason the console is safe and ultimately a failure is the very same cooperate microcosmic that drives excel and outlook. The same group that drives the console effort might as well be developing office.   

It takes talent and creativity to drive exclusives and foster those relationships. Those things are not really encouraged at Microsoft. Its why they spent so much money on a system that has almost 0 exclusives and why games like Scalebound where scrapped as it didn't meet the focus group sales expectations. Add this to the fact that noone wants to work with the highly toxic Microsoft publishing team anyway and you have a complete recipe for failure.  

This was Microsofts game to lose. This is the first time in there cycle that they have had the more powerful system. There is litterally 0 reason to buy a One X even given the fact that it outperforms the ps4. Not only will we not see any improvement in cross platform games but we have... what Crackdown 3 to look forward to to show us the real power of the xbox one... or better yet a racing game?? 

The company is never going to change unless it ousts the current CEO and guts the majority of the terrible executives it has and completely redoes its internal culture. The chances of this happening are closer to 1 in 100,000,00 people who are passionate at gaming don't work there and probably never will. We are finally seeing the tangible proof of all of this realized through its latest offering.

I’m a 22-year-old college student (still a freshman) who recently moved out. I had $1k in savings (it was a lot for me) before moving in, now I have exactly $1.
I’m renting a house with two other girls, so split evenly we each pay $420 for rent and anywhere from $100-250 for gas/utilities/internet. That’s all really cheap for where I live. Unfortunately, I only work ~20 hours a week and get paid two, sometimes three times a month, just barely making $700/month. 
I seems like I have to buy things or spend the money as soon as I get it. I was paid just three days ago and my account is already in the negative. This is the third time in a row I’ve hit negative and each time I do, my bank charges $38. I use the YNAB app but it takes almost a full week for any transactions to show up on it. My mum is wonderful and is helping out currently but we can’t tell my dad because his abusive behaviors are what forced me out in the first place. I need to be self sufficient but most of what my spending money goes to is either food or games - I know that the latter is the issue but breaking off of them seems impossible. 
I need help breaking this habit of spending everything I have. If any of you have ideas for me, I will try anything at this point. I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine anymore.
If there’s any other info needed, please let me know. Thank you!

EDIT: I do use federal financial aid for school, and my parents are willing to help with school, so thankfully it isn’t an issue. I try not to spend more than $50 on groceries and I can make that last all month. I’m also currently in the running for a promotion to full time at work, and my evaluation is in January which *should* come with a raise. If neither of those pan out, I will be looking for a second job.
I really appreciate all of the answers so far, it’s helping me put all of this into perspective!",finance
personalfinance,"Only have about $4200 in a 401K, currently unemployed, would it be a good idea to cash out to help with bills?","I'm 36 years old, in the state of Illinois. Lost my job a few months ago, not getting any unemployment benefits. I went through my little savings that I had and I'm out of cash.

I have a 401K with Voya, which has about $4200, of which $2,800 is vested. (If it matters, this 401K is from 2 employers ago. Even after I left that job, I didn't touch it and kept it there) I called to withdraw it, and they said after the Federal withholding($560) and their fees ($125), I should get about $2200. They will have to contact the previous employer and get the paperwork started.

I do have a job interview later today with Home Depot. Even if I start working within a week, it would probably be a couple of weeks before I see a paycheck. And I could use this money for gas for my car, some bills, etc. (I'm currently on SNAP so food on the table is not an issue).

I don't know what to do. Part of me telling me not to touch it, some savings is better than none. But another part of me is telling me to just take it out. It doesn't seem like a lot of money to me. And I could sure use it now.

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Options on salliemae loans,"Hey all. I'm graduating in about 6 months which means I have about a year before I need to start paying student loans.

worldpolitics,NATO is headed for a very messy break-up By Stephen Kinzer,"IF YOU'RE AN American citizen, cancel plans for that vacation in Turkey. Don't invite your Turkish friends to the United States, either. Recently Turkey and the United States stopped issuing visas to each other's citizens. This is more than just another travel ban. It is a geopolitical spectacle unique in modern history: two allied countries blocking normal back-and-forth travel. An old relationship has gone deeply sour.

It's hard to imagine that Americans will be forbidden for years to visit Topkapi Palace, or that the Grand Canyon will remain off limits to Turks. Indeed, limited visa processing resumed Monday. But, even if the visa standoff is fully resolved the breach it symbolizes will not quickly heal. Turkey has been member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - making it a military ally of the United States - for 65 years. Officially it still is. The reality is different. Turkey has written itself out of the Western alliance. Rather than accept decisions made in Washington and at NATO headquarters in Brussels, it now behaves like a Middle Eastern country pursuing its own interests. Turkey has become the first NATO dropout.

It may not be the last.

The causes of this crackup are a witch's brew, with ingredients including Russian weaponry, Kurdish guerrilla fighters, a sanctions-busting gold dealer, two preachers, and a goon squad of presidential bodyguards. The brew is flavored by deep suspicions of the United States that permeate much of Turkish society. A recent survey found that just 13 percent of Turks admire American ideals, while 72 percent fear the effects of American power. This antipathy suggests that Westerners have long misjudged the Turks.

After secularists led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk seized power during the 1920s, they decreed that Turks must turn away from their Muslim and Middle Eastern heritage to become more European. Several generations were force-fed this creed. Then the Turkish political system opened up enough to allow the masses to express their true views. Many voters and political leaders turned out to be pious nationalists who do not want to live in an American-dominated world. This challenges two delusions about the Turks: first, that most of them are Westernized secularists at heart, and second, that as loyal ""NATO allies,"" they happily join Middle East wars and other made-in-Washington security projects.

Roots of the current crisis in US-Turkey relations go back at least to 2003, when Turkey denied the US Army permission to cross Turkish soil on its way to invade Iraq. A few months later, American soldiers in northern Iraq arrested eleven Turkish security officers and, in images that are now seared into Turkey's collective memory, hooded them while they were detained. Civil war in Syria has sharpened this strategic dissonance. The United States armed Kurdish factions that Turkey considers enemies. Turkey returned the favor by allowing Al Qaeda and other militant groups to ship weapons and fighters across Turkish territory into Syria.

Anti-Turkish emotions in Washington flared in May, when an evidently amused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was filmed watching his bodyguards pummel protesters outside the Turkish embassy. Erdogan is demanding that the US extradite a Turkish cleric who is living in Pennsylvania, and whom he blames for organizing a coup attempt last year. He has offered to free an imprisoned American preacher in exchange. Last month he raised the ante by arresting a Turkish employee of the US embassy.

Erdogan is also worried about the looming trial in New York of a Turkish-Iranian gold dealer with whom he is said to have had corrupt dealings. He has also announced plans to buy a missile defense system from Russia - unthinkable for a NATO ally. He has even countenanced talk of pushing American planes out of the sprawling military base at Incirlik, near the Mediterranean, from which they carry out missions supporting wars throughout the region.

Turkey's defection is the latest and most vivid symptom of NATO's failure to adapt to the 21st century. It was created to confront a single threat: the Soviet Union. That threat gave the alliance a clear mission, held its members together, and justified America's dominant military role in Europe. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States could have declared victory, reduced its role in NATO, and turned European security over to Europeans. Instead it did the opposite. NATO remained an instrument of American power. It admitted a host of new members and is opening a sprawling new headquarters in Brussels.

NATO, however, will never again be the powerful and united force it was during the Cold War. Turkey is splitting off because it now sees its own security goals as more important than those of the alliance. Other countries will make the same calculation. They will follow Turkey's example: pretend to be NATO members while going their own way.

Decay from within is not the only problem facing this calcified alliance. Worse is its lack of purpose. The American generals who run it must justify its existence by conceiving new missions. They have come up with two.

Today NATO systematically confronts Russia with troop movements, arms buildups and maneuvers near Russian borders. At the same time, it supports American ""out-of-area"" wars in places like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Turkey has no interest in joining either of those projects. It feels no obligation to do so. That certifies its effective withdrawal from NATO.

Prickly nationalism and an evolving sense of self-interest helped push Turkey to this point. So did America's insistence on maintaining an old-style NATO after the Cold War ended. One other factor looms in the recent past. Turkey tried for years to enter the European Union. It was repeatedly rebuffed. With that historic choice, Europe slammed its door in Turkey's face. Naturally the Turks began looking for friends and partners elsewhere. Even strategic alliances are not forever.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Reality check for day traders,"""If you're sitting at the Poker table and you can't tell who the fish is, it's you"". 

For those that believe they're actually successful ""day traders"", answer these following questions:

1) What is your average ROI over span of 1 month? Factor in the margin interest rates if you trade on margin also.

2) What group of people do you think your earnings come from or losses go to?

3) Do you extend your investment horizon if you couldn't sell above your average purchase price?

If I'm not mistaken, the general strategy is to anticipate the peaks and troughs in order to sell and purchase at the respective points.
4) If this is the case, does this not work against the general idea of cryptos being a major future tech? (Read: If the peak most, if not all, day traders detect is actually several major entities buying into the crypto)

5) How much money would you have made otherwise, had you just held onto your initial purchases (exact amount, down to the dollar, not just some rough estimate).

If you cannot answer all 5 of the above questions coherently. You're a fish. If you can answer all 5 questions coherently but need to calculate any of the above, you're capable, but have not considered what kind of people your opposition is. The reality is, the tried and true day  traders wont bother answer these questions, as they know the answers before the questions were even asked. The quantitative work is all done, and can be referred to a spreadsheet they upkeep from a day-to-day or at the very least, weekly basis.

Don't convince yourself that you're a successful day trader. If your bet is Bitcoin as a tech works, you're much more likely to be more successful just holding the coins and ride the wave up.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"MBA student, credit score dropped 100 points in 6 months due to ""too many new accounts"" but they are all student loans. Graduating next year and will need significantly better score to rent a place, etc. How to improve?","I am currently an MBA student at a relatively good school (but not an Ivy), and graduating next spring. I have already accepted a position at a Fortune 10 company, with a good salary slightly over 100k. 

I have had an excellent credit score my whole life, up until a few months ago. Always over 750. Now it's 640 or so. I have 100% payments on time, am not using a significant amount of my available credit (although I do have ~5k in credit card debt, see below). When I look at my credit report and score report the only negative thing is the amount of new accounts open in the past year. Well they are ALL federal student loan accounts. And there are several loans, because MBAs are fucking expensive. 

**Background on my financial situation**: currently we live more or less paycheck to paycheck on my partners 40k/yr salary. We also have a toddler and a newborn.  Partner has some student loans, I will graduate with about 70k, and then we have the credit card debt. We are doing what we can to chip away at CC, but more importantly to not increase it between now and graduation. We live as frugally as possible with a tight budget. 

**My question:** I am graduating in the spring, but in January I will be taking my last installments of student loans. I don't know why there are so many, but each loan is for is for like 6k or so. How can I improve my credit score from this??? **Should I consolidate all of my student loans? will that just add another account on my credit report, and close all these others**? Will that make things better or worse? 

When I start my new job we will be moving across country, and we will need a place to rent. We have rented from a family member for the past few years, so cheap rent but no official rental history. I am very nervous about being able to secure a place with a bad credit score.",finance
personalfinance,Should I Refinance My FHA Home Loan To Lower A Interest Rate FHA Loan?,"Current Situation:  My family and I have been in our house for just over 10 years.  We bought it in Dec. of 2006 for just under 157k.  About 7 years ago, I refinanced to get a lower fixed rate of 4.875% and lower our monthly payments.  I have never been late on or missed a payment and my current credit score is in the 800's.  As far as how much we owe now, it is just under 130k.  I do not know the current market value of my house.

Question:  Saturday, I got a letter in the mail from my current FHA lender saying that I could lower my mortgage to a lower fixed rate (New Lower Rate: 3.750% --- New APR: 4.117%) with no closing costs.  My mortgage company claims they will waive the bank fees and pay the third-party vendor fees.  It will be refinanced as another FHA loan (not converted to a conventional load).  Should I refinance?

While I am not hurting for money at the moment, saving money is always good in my eyes.   However, I am not clear on how much I would save here or if it would be better in the long run.  What would happen with my PMI?  Would I have to pay that for a longer time?

As far as I can tell, I should be able to remove the PMI on my current loan after paying down just under 5k, which will bring the unpaid principal amount to below the 80% mark on the $156k loan.  I currently pay just under $1200 a month (this includes escrow and interest), which is a little over $300 a month against the principal amount.  So if I am correct in my math (which is sketchy sometimes), I should have that last 5k paid off in about 1.5-2 years.

As always, thanks in advance for any and all replies.

hydro,Large root growth vs leaves for new lettuce in fog-ponic,"I took a Hefty tote and put about 1 gallon of water with 2g Masterblend Tomato, 2g of Masterblend Calcium Nitrate, 1g of Epsom salt and added 2 atomizers (5 min on/off) and 2 lettuce seedlings. After about 2 weeks since I started them from seed, the roots had some explosive growth and were a couple of inches long and enough to reach the bottom of the tote. I'm afraid of bacterial growth in the water do to the fact the vaporizers heat some water up to create the fog and would prefer roots were only fed via fog. Here is a [link](https://imgur.com/Nl7KI5i). The roots have been stained from the cal-mag solution I added this morning but were perfect white coming out of it.

personalfinance,For those scammed by sending payments through Western Union,"Last year, a friend of mine lost over $1500 through a scam that involved sending payments through Western Union. These posts frequent this sub and I know have impacted others besides ourselves.

Today, I found exciting news that the FTC is now allowing claims to get your money back from Western Union. Please find additional information below:

The Federal Trade Commission is alerting consumers who lost money to scammers who told them to pay via Western Union's money transfer system between January 1, 2004 and January 19, 2017, that they can now file a claim to get their money back by going to FTC.gov/WU before February 12, 2018.

""American consumers lost money while Western Union looked the other way, "" said FTC Acting Chairman Maureen K. Ohlhausen. ""We're pleased to start the process that will get that money back into consumers' rightful hands.""

""Knowing that its agents were involved in fraudulent schemes -- and knowing that it had a legal obligation to detect and report this criminal conduct to the authorities -- Western Union failed to act, leading to massive victim losses,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco. ""Returning forfeited funds to these victims and other victims of crime is one of the Department's highest priorities. I want to commend our prosecutors, the FTC, and our law enforcement agent partners for their hard work that led to vindicating the rights of these victims.""

The refund program follows a settlement with the Western Union Company, which in January 2017 agreed to pay $586 million to resolve charges brought by the FTC and the U. S. Department of Justice. The FTC alleged that fraudsters were able to use Western Union's money transfer system to get payments from their victims, even though the company was aware of the problem and received hundreds of thousands of complaints about fraud-induced money transfers made for fraudulent lottery and prizes, family emergencies, advance-fee loans, online dating and other scams. The company also allegedly failed to promptly discipline problem Western Union agents, and failed to have effective anti-fraud policies and procedures.

Affected consumers should go to FTC.gov/WU to file claims, learn more, or get updates on the claims process -- this infographic describes the process for filing a claim.

Some people who have already reported their losses to Western Union, the FTC, or another government agency will receive a form in the mail from the claims administrator, Gilardi &amp; Co. The form will have a Claim ID and a PIN number to use when filing a claim online via FTC.gov/WU. Gilardi was hired by Justice Department, which is responsible for returning victims' money as part of its settlement with Western Union.

Filing a claim is free, so consumers should not pay anyone to file a claim on their behalf. No one associated with the claims process will call to ask for consumers' bank account or credit card number.

The FTC's case was investigated with the assistance of the U. S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Toronto Police Service Financial Crimes Unit, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Spanish National Police, and the Offices of the Attorney General for Arizona, Minnesota, and Vermont.

The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. You can learn more about consumer topics and file a consumer complaint online or by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357).

personalfinance,401k contribution vs. loan payments,"Hi all, I've been reading /r/personalfinance for a couple of years now, and am finally in a position where I would really appreciate some advice. Some context: I just left university, am making approximately 93K a year, have a $16K auto loan at 3.5%, and 4 federal student loans, which combine to be around $29K total with an average interest rate of 4.1%. The worst interest rate of those is at about 4.6%.

I'm entering my third month at my new job, and initially I elected to defer 10% of my pretax income to my employer's 401k in high risk funds. There is no employee contribution matching. We get an annual discretionary amount that I will receive starting Feb. 2019. Usually around 5-6% of my annual income. The kicker is I only become 20% vested in the discretionary employer contribution after 2 years, 40% after 3 years, 60% after 4 years and so on...until I'm fully vested. 

I can't be sure that I'll be with the same employer in 6 years, so after reading through the ""Prime Directive"" here again, I'm a little unsure if I should keep contributing to my 401k or skip to step 3 and start shoveling that 10% at my loans instead...??

Another secondary question: As it stands right now, if I pay my debt using the rollover method at $800 a month I should have it covered in about 5 years, I think. About $2.5K of those $29K in student loans capitalizes in December. I've been saving 20% of my take-home to knock that off before it does. I plan to continue saving 20% of my take-home until I've built up an emergency fund. Is that a good plan as well?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Understanding Nuls - A Chinese Perspective,"Article Translated from media.weibo.cn

Two days rose as high as 800%, popular foreign communities, in the end what happened? Correct understanding of NULS
On November 8, Binance posted online NULS. As the law of breaking 99% of Singaporean currency on the spot on Ann Arbor, the currency circle was so hot that it pulled from one to eight in two days. The turnover went up from a few One hundred thousand (speculators) to 100 million enlarged, and then as of November 13, stabilized to about 4, the daily turnover of more than 10 million yuan. And TG group a few days, foreigners have entered 1000. Many coins ring old and new people are encircled, in the end what happened.

The introduction of the NULS in the currency security is like this:

Nuls is a highly customizable blockchain infrastructure and is a global open source community project for blockchain. Nuls consists of microkernels and functional modules to weaken the new thinking of the main chain, to achieve a highly modular underlying architecture through the stripping of events and services, and to provide operating mechanisms such as smart contracts, multi-link parallelism and cross-chain consensus to reduce development and The cost of use, and promote the blockchain business application process.

To know NULs , first of all, we must first know that in May this year, crowdfunding print chain (inchain, official website: https://inchain.org) .

Official website printed chain self-introduction is this:
Inchain is a public chain project located on the bottom platform of the business application of blockchain. It is the first professional commercial application of blockchain ecosystem. From the underlying architecture authentication management hierarchy, Inchain signs double signcryption registration binding management, which, along with a high-level arbitration system developed by management Intermediaries and Printing Chain, meets the decentralized commercial-level regulatory requirements of the decentralized network. 

To this end, anti-counterfeiting traceability will be the first application of Inchain. The Inchain team will devote itself to building a comprehensive self-service application based on anti-counterfeiting traceability. This application will accumulate a large amount of merchant and user resources for Inchain to form a traffic center.

In simple terms, a printing chain is the underlying public chain of a blockchain business application, similar to NEO / EOS, and anti-counterfeiting is just the first application. Because of the team's practical style, projects and commercialization have always been in sync. And so far, already in the commercialization of development, there are already more than a dozen companies, such as Elephant Alliance (Beijing) Science and Technology Co., Ltd., which has been engaged in strategic cooperation, (Elephant Alliance is the core of ""San Tong"" And ""Three Tongs"" products were put forward by Premier Li Keqiang during his inspections of quality inspection in 2014.

So, what is the relationship with the NULS and InChain?

NULS can be said to be a voluntary global community of open-source blockchain community projects that are core members of inchain.

(1) What is NULS?
Nuls is a customizable, modular blockchain infrastructure project that consists of microkernels and functional modules to weaken the mindset of new backbones and to enable a highly modular, underlying architecture with event and service de-provisioning Smart contracts, multi-chain parallel, cross-chain consensus and other operating mechanisms to promote the business process blockchain process.

Nuls has developed a set of industrialized blockchain technology standards that provide alternative intelligent contracts, multi-link parallelism, consensus mechanisms, P2P networks, storage, encryption, multi-level accounts, following the principles of hot plugging, modularization and parallel expansion piece.
""We hope that through the blockchain technology, we will help create a decentralized business model for the lack of a centralized trust system in our daily life work and solve the conflicts of trust between individuals and businesses in society. Based on Nuls, this simple foundation backbone, we will provide a wealth of modular components, the same as the CPU, hard disk, memory, motherboard assembly into a computer, the user can freely choose consensus, storage, contract, arbitration, account system, anonymous Strategy, permissions and other modules, assembled into a sub-chain for their own needs. Subchain A customizable blockchain infrastructure is not limited to a public chain, it can also be a private chain or a federated chain.""

In a nutshell, NULS is a modular (customizable) blockchain infrastructure that modularizes functionality and allows individuals, businesses, and governments to assemble as one sub-chain at their discretion and not limited to the public chain , Private chain or affiliate chain. Just like assembling a computer, you need a CPU, a hard drive, a memory, a motherboard, a keyboard, and a mouse (the camera functions can be assembled according to your needs).

We believe that the blockchain, with the technical characteristics of its distributed storage, being open and transparent and capable of delivering value, will exist as the basis for enterprise applications in the future. So far, however, it has been hard to see whether an application or project around us is really developed based on blockchain technology. The crux of this phenomenon is the use of chained blockchain technology, limited performance. The data on the chain is huge, synchronization is difficult, and technical updates are hampered by decentralization. In order to solve these problems and promote the commercial application of blockchain, Nuls was born.

Currently, the block development of the blockchain performance is limited, many projects and applications are from the beginning to the end are unable to truly commercialize and technology updates due to decentralization (typical example of BTC to upgrade communities have to speculate yearly) and therefore, NULS is to solve these problems, and to promote the commercialization of blockchain .

(2) The necessary conditions for commercialization
After market research and analysis, we found that there are some problems in the development of the blockchain. The shortage of technicians in the blockchain and the high cost of research and development cannot be alleviated in a short period of time. More and more applications require blocks Chain technology support; the existing blockchain performance is limited, cannot communicate between different chains; institutions tend to use the coalition chain, the private chain, and the two to the trust is not complete. Nuls can provide a reliable solution to this.

(A) flexible and easy to use blockchain infrastructure
Nuls offers complete Turing-complete modular development for developers and users. Developers and users need not to study the underlying technical details such as cryptography, consensus mechanisms, storage methods, etc., and use simple and quick programmable environments to directly interface with commercial applications, thereby reducing the commercial cost of the blockchain.

(B) adapt to massive blockchain application scenarios
At the application level, it is expected that blockchain will serve as the underlying foundation for many organizations and individuals in their work and life. Nuls is able to cope with various application scenarios in the future through modular, multi-link parallel and intelligent contract operation mechanisms And the different needs of the bottom of the blockchain.

(C) high-performance driven blockchain commercial landing
Commercial applications have high-performance requirements. Nuls is committed to solving the performance limitation of the existing blockchain. By using parallel expansion technology, Nuls separates the main and subchannels through the multi-chain parallel operation mechanism of ""main and sub-chains"" Business to meet the millions of TPS needs.

(D) the balance between data transparency and commercial secrecy
For organizations, data confidentiality and security are paramount, while the openness and transparency of the blockchain give organizations some concern. Nuls protects the confidentiality and security of business data in the sub-chains through data isolation and cross-chain auditing to solve the balance between data transparency and commercial secrecy.
It can be seen that the four points of NULS are four points of flexibility, adaptability, high performance (meeting millions of TPS), transparency and commercial confidentiality. And that's one of the four conditions necessary to solve the commercialization of the blockchain, which is consistent with the Ethereum platform but more powerful.

(3) the value of tokens
NULS tokens as a transaction fee.
Registration sub-chain, the need for NULS mortgage (mortgaged NULS can only be used for sub-chain running consumption).

Sub-chain operation continues to consume NULS tokens.
To create a healthy Nuls ecosystem, all Nuls-based operations require payment of a certain amount of NULS tokens, including but not limited to proof of data for sub-chains on the backbone and transactions on tokens. In order to balance the payment of the token is always in a reasonable interval, will not increase with the NULS token beyond the reasonable range, the system will be based on community votes to adjust the benchmark rate.
Sub-chain base currency and NULS intelligent exchange.
The backbone of the base currency is NULS, access to all sub-chains of Nuls, can support their own base tokens, the basic token as Nuls's smart assets; sub-chain can also issue contract tokens, called IOU assets . The Nuls bottom system provides conversion of NULS tokens for smart assets. Subchains To issue smart assets, a certain amount of NULS needs to be secured, with the initial ratio set by the publisher itself. Once a Smart Asset is released, a NULS Pool and Smart Asset Pool are immediately generated, and any user with NULS or Smart Assets can be redeemed at the latest rate adjusted by the market.
The value of the smart assets of the sub-chain is improved, the corresponding NULS capital pool will precipitate more NULS.

As such, the value of NULS appreciates with the increased quality of sub-chain smart assets.
NULS system, built-in NULS tokens, is the blood of the entire system, will be used to participate in consensus rewards, transaction fees, registration sub-chain mortgage function, consumption of NULS tokens, NULS can be intelligent exchange with sub-chain.

(4) Technological innovation:
The Nuls backbones default to the POC (Proof-Of-Credit). Node credit standards, lock a certain amount of margin to join the consensus, the consensus node re-sorting each round out of the block, withdraw from the consensus margin unlock.

Nuls community will continue to develop consensus mechanisms such as POW, DPOS, POS, PBFT and POOL verification pool for users and enterprises to freely choose.
The Nuls community acknowledged the unpredictable nature of technology upgrades and business applications, embraced the modularity of Linux kernel design and developed the Nuls kernel. The Nuls design follows the "" Everything is a Module "" principle, with modular support technology to update and apply fit.
It can be said that NULS is a multi-strand parallel + cross-chain consensus, the underlying modular.

(5) Summary
The NULS technology is robust and well-structured (it is said that more than 50 days have been discussed by several architects who have been in business for more than 10 years) to incorporate the modular thinking behind LINUX kernel design, where commercial thinking stands out compared to other blockchain teams/communities, focusing on the commercialization of the blockchain.
In addition, NULS main-net online line comes this year, the printed chain will be based on NULS become one of the sub-chain.

Community members told me that NULS has a clear and clear-cut target in the near and medium-term and long-term.

The first stage: the main-net online and improve the surrounding ecological and commercial landing.
The second stage: large-scale commercial application of landing, enclosure process, the former inchain is occupying the anti-counterfeit traceability market, NULS is occupying the blockchain basic services market, exploring the combination of blockchain + big data + artificial intelligence.
The third phase of the realization of the blockchain + big data + artificial intelligence landing.
I think the possibility of a NULS becoming a LINUX or Android in the blockchain is great.

(1) investment late now?
Not late. The current market capitalization of 1.5 billion, the current domestic basic chains compared are with only QTUM and NEO.
Of course, we compare the ETH, 200 billion market capitalization, there are 1300 times the profits.

I contribute 6% to my 401k, so I gross about $75,000 (not including a bonus).

Then I have an $1,800 mortgage, $2,000 monthly child care, $500 car payment (which will be paid off in July), gas, groceries, electric bill, phone bill etc which I split with my husband (who has a very similar income and about the same amount of student loans but at a 2% interest rate).

I've got about $35,000 in savings right now.

What is the best way to quickly pay off my student loans and handle my finances?",finance
personalfinance,Newly 18 and mostly on my own,"For a while now my family hasn't been the best. I've been really upset with things at home for many reasons, dogs not being fed like they should, house being a complete mess, very bad financial planning, and a mom that has recently started going out a LOT. This is all just a bit of back story.

I'm now basically living with my girlfriend and her mom, not officially, but her mom had started letting me stay over when I was over late and she hasn't objected for a couple months of me staying 5/7 days a week. This being said, I've had to watch my little brother for 7 years, a LOT. I'm continuing to help her out because she is working for a union where she gets hired, finishes a job, and gets layed off. She is on her last 3 weeks of unemployment not having a single job offer besides out of state which isn't a choice for her with a 11 year old child. On top of all of this, she has to have surgery in a couple weeks with no weight for 4 weeks, and a full 6 month recovery. My dad, who doesn't live with us has been pushing me to get a job for a couple months, heck, even reccomending it since I turned 16. Now I want to actually work because I need it. Since I'm 18 now, my child support is ending soon, it lasts until the end of school if we file, so we filed but the people filed it wrong, which ultimately makes me have nothing for about a month while they get it filed and fixed. 

This leads me to needing to get a job, both for normal things like gas, and for a little spending money. I've talked it over with my mom and she basically has stated that she cannot have me getting a job, saying ""If you make even 500, I cannot claim you on taxes."" And telling my grandmother ""I don't know what I will do if he gets a job."" obviously in reference to me. This knowledge is currently unknown to my father, but is still pushing me to get a job.

Basically, my mother is on her last 3 weeks of unemployment, ""close to losing the house"" and has to have surgery soon, meaning she will be even more out of a job for a while. I want a job but she has to have someone to watch my brother for Tuesdays and Thursdays when she goes to school. I've helped for a long time, and I'm starting to think it's time to cut it off. But she doesn't have any money for a baby sitter. 

Do you think I should get a job and continue my life as I will need to be supporting myself and a girlfriend presumably in a couple years, as well as a new car soon, or should I stay helping my mom, helping her watch my brother and not getting a job so she can claim me on taxes?",finance

personalfinance,Options for student loans without a cosigner?,"Hello personalfinance. Thank you all for taking a look at my situation.

I am currently in my second year of college, and I am starting to get concerned with how I am going to afford the rest of my schooling. I have been able to get thus far with family helping out with some savings and cosigning on loans, but I can't count on that to continue and I want to make sure that I can finish my education all on my own if need be.
I am on track to finish a semester early, so I need to come up with 1.5 years of tuition and fees, which comes in at around $30 grand total after my current scholarships and government loans. Here is a breakdown of my situation: 

-total cost per semester is around $22 grand  (including housing and meals)
-I get $5k academic scholarship  
-around $8k in federal loans  
-I am working ~20hrs a week to afford:  
--$150 car payment a month  
--$75 a month for interest only payments on my current private student loans
-- food, incidentals, gas, textbooks, etc  

I have a good credit score(720), but I still have a pretty low income, so I'm not sure if any private lenders will lend to me without a cosigner? I have been applying to scholarships but I'm not counting on that to take care of everything.  

I would have no problem dropping to be a part time student and getting a second job, but I would lose my academic scholarship and I would take much longer to graduate. This is kinda my 'last resort' plan.  

Is there anything that I can do? I'm worried that, even if I do find a private loan, the interest rate without a cosigner will just be impractical. Can I increase my federal loans? I think that there is a pretty low limit to how much I can take out myself, but I could be wrong. Can I get a PLUS loan myself, or does that *have* to be a parent? Is there a limit to how much we can take out in PLUS loans? My parents would be willing to try and help me out, but they have been denied when applying to other private loans.  

Is there anything I am not thinking of? Does anyone have any tips? This has been a bit of a rough time for me. I am busting my ass being a full time student on track to graduate early and working 20hrs, and I am really trying to make this work so that I can get my degree and start my life properly.

investing,good time to get into the market?,"I have really messed up with my investing partly due to timing issues and partly due to fear of the big crash.. just to give you a cliff's notes:

2006-07 : just got out of debt finally and built up a small savings of $20k by early '07, contributed some to my 401k with a balance of $30k, wanted to buy a home but in SoCal prices are still super high.

08-09 : spooked by the epic crash - both stocks and housing, worked in a job with no 401k matching so did not contribute (mistake #1)

09-10 : focused on building up home down payment, kept it liquid in case of any buying opportunities.  This was a time where it was really difficult to qualify for mortgages even with 20% down.

10-11 : job burnout, had about $130k saved up by now, was planning on putting $100k towards a home but took a year sabbatical instead to travel which was my dream, so did that and returned late '11.

12-14 : re-adjustment to the work force, kept saving, did not invest, instead thought I should keep things liquid in case a buying opportunity for a home came around, but instead home prices skyrocketed suddenly and inventory dropped, in '13 it was pure mania in SoCal with real estate.  By the end of '13 I gave up looking for a house.

14-15 : wanted to get back into stocks but everyone was talking about a big crash, the experience of 2008 was in my mind and losing my money was unfathomable, I guess I just did not understand financial cycles very much unfortunately and stayed out (big mistake #2)

15-17 : started contributing again to my 401k at work regularly, re-invested the balance from my old 401k from '06 which was just gathering dust in cash reserves, currently at around $100k in my 401k and maxing it out.

Now the main question, have around $350k now in cash, which is absolutely insane because if I had invested this in the market I would've possibly had close to a million dollars by now, especially if I had invested in the Nasdaq.  Anyways, all that is water under the bridge.  What is important is that I have learned important lessons that complacency is extremely expensive.

I have been following reports that we are at the tail end of a bull market, in the 9th innings etc.  Even the founder of Vanguard, Jack Bogle, says it's overvalued.  I have no idea where to go from here.  I have given up the idea of buying a home as prices in SoCal are in the stratosphere right now so i'm not interested.  I want to put the $350k I have into the markets but I am gripped by fear if there is a 50% crash tomorrow because they don't pass tax reform.  There are so many uncertainties ahead - Trump impeachment, North Korea, healthcare crisis, student loan crisis, debt crisis etc.  S&amp;P P/E is not low historically as well.  On the other hand tax reform could pass, the Fed could continue ZIRP and the Dow could rocket to 30,000.  I am in an ultimate dilemma here.  Either way I am screwed.

investing,Macroeconomic Theory: The market isn't as overvalued as it seems,"I'm going to be talking really big picture. I know this is a very complex issue, but I'm not trying to write a thesis here. Just trying to get an idea out and see what people think. So on to my theory.

Everyone keeps saying the market is overvalued, but I think it may not actually be. What if the value is justified? Technology is increasing efficiency so rapidly in so many areas which allows firms to create more value in their goods and services or sell them for cheaper. The higher value and cheaper goods and services allow other firms to do more and so it spreads. 

For example, we are in a stage where automation is starting to be adopted by more and more firms. Automation increases efficiency and that frees up capital to do more things like R&amp;D or expansion that would have been taken up by the cost of the goods and services. This gives them a higher current value as they can do more for less, and a higher predicted future value because they are contributing more to R&amp;D and expansion.

What all this effectively does is change the ratios that investors look at to determine how valuable a company is. The ratios that used to signal that a stock is overvalued no longer apply because companies are creating more value at a lower cost than ever before as well as having more future potential. So analysts look at all these numbers and ratios and say everything looks overvalued, but the market is still going to draw in money because the value is really there. 

This is why the tech sector is currently so hot as they benefit the most from advancements in technology (duh). Not only do they benefit from the tech, they make it and sell it to others. Firms able to capitalize on the tech also benefit greatly, but even firms that can't use it as effectively still benefit. A rising tide raises all ships as they say.

I know there are a lot more factors. I think interest rates are also playing a big part, but there are many other smaller things to consider too. I do think the biggest factor is the tech though which is really starting to take hold all over the world and there's still more on the horizon. 

So that's my theory. I'm going to bed, I'll be back in 8 hours to discuss or see my post was ignored.

Disclaimer:

I'm not trying to advocate any sort of investing strategy. I'm not an analyst, but I do spend a lot of time thinking about things like the economy and the future of the human race. As with anything you read on the internet you should take what I say with a grain of salt. I think I may be on to something, but I'm more or less just going by my gut because I can't back any of this up with numbers.",finance

1. I consider BCH a legitimate contender for the bitcoin name. I consider bitcoin's *failure* to raise block sizes to keep fees reasonable to be a large (non-consensual) change to the ""original plan"", morally tantamount to a hard fork.
2. Theymos's censorship.

Bitcoincash,The Most Eventful Day in Bitcoin History,"##Bitcoin's network split called off

The proposed software upgrade or “hard fork” to occur on Nov. 16 was canceled on Nov. 8, due to disagreements between many prominent CEOs and key players in the Bitcoin space. 

The SegWit 2X fork would have increased the block size from 1 to 2 megabytes and thereby double transaction capacity on the network. This upgrade was aimed at helping the scalability of Bitcoin. However, following a lack of consensus within the community, implementing the hard fork was suspended. In fact, it has always been a controversial topic — many Bitcoin companies have not actively supported the move. The main fear was that it would split the community into two branches. 

Mike Belshe, CEO and co-founder of a major Bitcoin wallet provider BitGo, announced the cancellation in an email on November 8. One of the leaders of the Segwit2x project, he argued that the scaling proposal is too controversial to move forward:

&gt; Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth.

BitGo’s Mike Belshe, Xapo’s Wences Casares, Bitmain’s Jihan Wu, Bloq’s Jeff Garzik, Blockchain’s Peter Smith and Shapeshift’s Erik Voorhees all signed the statement.

Quickly following this news, Bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high as people were glad that the community divide seemed over. However, that euphoria soon faded as the reality kicked in that fundamental issues with Bitcoin remained.

##What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin?

Well, no one really knows, but here's a bit of insight as to what we think could happen.

In 2017, the Bitcoin network capacity hit the “invisible wall.” Fees skyrocketed, and Bitcoin became unreliable, with some users unable to get their transactions confirmed, even after days of waiting. Today, people are paying up to $25 USD for a transaction to be processed, which says a lot about the usefulness of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin usage stopped growing; its market share among other cryptocurrencies plummeted from 95 to 40 percent as many users, merchants, businesses and investors abandoned it.

The cancellation of SegWit 2X leaves two competing bitcoin chains now: Bitcoin SegWit 1X (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). 
With SegWit, data is stored differently in each block, which improves the capacity of the blockchain, however only marginally compared to the capacity available with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

The improvement in capacity from SegWit 1X is 70 percent with no plans for any more significant updates within at least the next 18 to 24 months. The SegWit upgrade is a small capacity increase at best, and it's already showing it's not going to handle exponential growth or worldwide adoption. 

Bitcoin Cash was born on August 1, 2017, as a result of a few major players from the very early days of Bitcoin becoming fed up with the direction the cryptocurrency was headed. Bitcoin Cash immediately raised the transaction capacity by 800 percent as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. Currently, there is ample capacity for everyone's transactions, and huge developmental progress has been made to allow massive capacity increases up to 1000 times the current BTC SegWit network. This means low fees and fast confirmations for everyone.

However, Bitcoin cash is still quite far behind, so which bitcoin will win?

##Let's start at the beginning...

 In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, published a paper titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Most people are aware of this, but the exact title needs to be repeated because today, even the most basic facets of Bitcoin are being challenged. 

Regardless of “which side” of the scaling debate you are on, it should not be contested that Satoshi always planned for and advocated simple, on-chain scaling. (On-chain scaling is a term that basically means using the Bitcoin network itself to process all transactions.

Unfortunately, this is not the proposed plan of the Bitcoin network’s core development team. They intend to implement a supplementary technology called the “Lightning Network” to process the extra transactions that Bitcoin can't handle. Not yet proven to work, this technology is at least 18 to 24 months away from being ready. It also takes Bitcoin in a much more centralized direction as a small group of people will be running this secondary transaction layer, earning money from fees and controlling how it works. 

Giving a small group of people this sort of control sounds pretty familiar, don't you think? Reminds us of a thing called the USD? We need to get away from this.

We KNOW that on-chain transactions work; they've worked for 9 years, and scaling on Bitcoin Cash is working.

##Now to today...

It seems more and more users, merchants, businesses and investors are beginning to realize this. Today, we've seen the biggest “pump” in cryptocurrency history, with Bitcoin Cash going from a low at $1,280 USD to a high of $2,799 USD. Peaking at a whopping $41 Billion USD market cap, almost tripling in 36 hours, and to top it off, the trading volume was $11.5 billion USD in 24 hours. 

We've never seen numbers like this, and it's happening for a reason. The potential for Bitcoin was so great; however, it went off in the wrong direction due to a small group of people who wanted to control it.

Today, Bitcoin Cash has made huge progress on the “flippening,” a term used by many in the community referring to the possible future event when Bitcoin Cash overtakes Bitcoin to become the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. 

If the flippening occurs, there's a very bright future for Bitcoin Cash. The aim is for it to become a world currency used by billions of people, one that does not discriminate based on levels of wealth, one that is equally usable to those earning $1 a day or companies earning billions.

Right now, one billion people are living in slums. They cannot hope to escape without some international form of trade. This can be achieved with access to secure and low cost money, which is what Bitcoin Cash delivers. We hope that in the next decade, Bitcoin Cash starts to offer hope and a way out of poverty.

Bitcoin,Saving your Coins...,"4 ways to store your coin

Small Amounts - Electronic Wallet - on a computer or phone using an app like Bitcoin Core.  This is BY FAR the worst way to store anything other than small amounts.  A computer is easily hacked, malwared, hardware drive failure, etc.  Having an electronic wallet with small amounts for trading is very reasonable but nothing over small amounts.

Medium Amounts (up to $250k and usually less) - Third Party - Uninsured exchange? keep no more than you would in an electronic wallet.  That exchange can take your money and disappear.  Search for Mt Gox.  If you do use an exchange; one of the most trusted ones is Coinbase.  This is because they are federally insured by the US government up to $250k USD.  This is a reasonable store of value until you get close to their insurance limit.  Note FDIC insurance covers non-US citizens as well.  I don't work for them.  Exchanges are good to be in when there are network/transaction slow downs like the BCH non-sense.  

Large Amounts - Hardware Wallet - Assuming you have seed phrases stored safely (like in an actual safe or safety deposit box) this is BY FAR the safest way to store coins.  However it is not without risk.  You can lose/have stolen your hardware wallet so make sure you have your backup phrase and/or backup backing paper wallet safe and secure.  In addition, it is possible that whoever made your hardware wallet intentionally or unintentionally through software bugs can steal or lose your money.  Appraise the manufacturer.  I would only recommend Trezor and Ledger based in Czeck Republic and France respectively.  NEVER BUY A HARDWARE WALLET FROM A THIRD PARTY like amazon.  Always go straight to the source to reduce risk.

Misc - Paper Wallet - This is not necessarily paper; you can carve it in wood or etch it in steel.  It's a way to store your coins with 'zero technology'.  The danger is that if you lose it, someone else finds it, or even takes a picture of it.  You lose your coins.  It is cheap but insecure depending on how you store it.  I would highly recommend breaking up your coins into several wallets and storing paper for each separately to mitigate loss.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Is bitcoin.com cyber squatting?,"Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else.

----------------
Firstly trademarks do not have to be registered although it's is best to do this, but in a decentralized case like ours, it might be difficult.
Bitcoin is famous decentralized network. 

further ...and more importantly from a legal advise forum..

A domain name may need to be given up to the trademark holder or the use of the domain name stopped, however, if the trademark is a famous one and the use of the trademark in a domain name confuses consumers into thinking the holder of the domain name is connected with the holder of the trademark. Or a domain name may have to be given up or the use of the domain name stopped if the use of the trademark in the domain name dilutes the value of the famous trademark

Isn't that exactly what we are seeing?

I suggest one plan of action might be to do a hodlr signed petition vote (prefer snapshot of blockchain to do this rather than a time lock verify approach given the network is under attack.   Then we can show domain name arbitrators who is in fact bitcoin.

personalfinance,I would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.,"Basically what the title says.

Once upon a time, I had a BA in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and I would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. I paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. I wanted to go in a different direction.

I had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and I decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something I was very interested in. I applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. No thanks, I had bills to pay.

The military had always been something I'd considered and I did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. Turns out the Army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what I was looking for--Paralegal Specialist, and since I had a degree I would enter the military as an E-4. The Army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

It's now a little over four years since I raised my right hand-- I now work for the Department of Justice. My military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. The high-ranking connections I made in the Army JAG Corps combined with the job experience I received are what landed me this position. I have thousands of dollars in the bank that I saved because I didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while I served. I'll be able to use a VA-backed loan to buy a house when I choose to, and if I want to go back to school I can do so for free using the GI Bill.

I write all this because I read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. And I think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

Of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. You could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. You could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. It's all luck of the draw really. I was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but I know many aren't so fortunate. It's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario. 

But at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction I wanted to go and set myself up financially. I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.",finance

Anyway, I went to file a police report the next day, and they said it's not a crime, and I need to take it up with the seller. Unfortunately because of my release authorization, the seller couldn't do anything about it.

So 5 days later, I went back to the police station, and they said they need proof from FedEx that the package is stolen... I thought ""well they're not going to admit it was stolen"", and all I managed to get was confirmation that it was dropped off. 

The following week (almost 2 weeks later), they finally allowed me to file a police report.

I suck at budgeting/spending/saving. I have always been pretty impulsive when it comes to purchases but now that I'm married and have a 1 year old it's long over due that I correct my financial habits so I can provide for my family and us live a decent life. 
 
I've been in the marines for about 4 years and recently changed jobs within the military to an IT based job. I'll get all the certs and experience needed to transition into an IT job in 4 years when I get out. I make about 6,000 a month right now, my wife takes care of our kid and is unemployed. I have 8k~ in credit card debt with my credit union that I received upon enlisting. The interest rate is terrible at a whopping 18%. 

I need help getting this debt taken care of and I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I added my wife to my account because she's fantastic with money but I still struggle to make good decisions. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Is there a good ELI5 post somewhere about life insurance?,"My fiancé and I are trying to pick a life insurance policy and we are SO overwhelmed. 

We both make a good salary (him about $200K, me about $75K) and we have a small amount of compulsory obligations that we could handle individually (mortgage payment of $1,175 and car payments of about $400). No credit card debt, a lot of student loans but as they're all federal student loans I believe they'll all be forgiven if we die. We're working on an emergency fund, but we kind of just started making good money recently (woo being done with dental residency) and we're currently trying to save to pay for our wedding.

personalfinance,School from ten years ago is holding my transcripts hostage.,"This semester I started back to school, and in gathering everything I needed to start back, I asked for my transcripts from a school I attended ten years ago.  I got a notice back from the transcript company that said they couldn't release the transcripts because the school was saying I owed them a balance of 1,300, and I wouldn't be able to get a transcript until I paid the school the balance.  Please know that I keep a very good eye on my finances and credit and have never gotten a phone call or received anything in writing saying that I owe them a balance over the ten years.  I'm current on my monthly payments for federal student loans that I'm paying for for when I went to school there.  The school I'm currently attending won't let me register for next semester's classes without this transcript from this school, even though I've explained to them this entire situation.  In their defense, I understand they don't know me from Adam, and they have standards that they have to follow.  Anyways, upon calling the school that says I owe them money many times, I was finally able to get someone on the phone yesterday. The lady I spoke to on the phone said that the debt was marked with a possible discrepancy and that she'd get back to me as soon as she could.  She did get back to me by email saying the business office says it was for a class I dropped ten years ago that the student loan didn't cover.  I've asked for a bill or formal piece of paper saying I owe the money, but so far no response.  Is there anything I can do on this matter without shelling out 1300 bucks just because someone says I owe them?  So far, they've been able to give me no proof of the debt, and even if they could provide ""proof"", how would I know that it's legitimate?  Thanks in advance for any help or advice on this matter.  I really feel like my advancement in my current school is being held hostage.",finance

personalfinance,"401k loan - lower contribution and pay off quicker, or maximize contribution?","two years ago i found myself in a tight spot and pulled what i'll call a ""sizable"" 401k loan out against my account. i set the payment schedule to pay it back in 4 years, so i'm half way through the loan repayment.

The interest rate on the loan is only 4.5% and my current investments in my 401k are 15% over the last 12 months. The payment amount per check basically matches my contributions dollar for dollar. It seems to me my money is best spent investing since the returns are higher and technically the interest of 4.5% i'm just paying to myself.

The only risk i can see is that if i lose my job i am on the hook for the balance. i don't see that happening, but anything is possible.",finance
btc,Why I think Bitcoin Cash is wwwwaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy better than legacy bitcoin,"The bitcoin whitepaper, and the writings of Satoshi ( satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org ) show an outline for a system of decentralized, peer to peer, electronic cash.

This system achieves:

 * **Decentralization** by splitting up the ability to change a financial ledger and mediate transactions, which is currently centralized in the modern banking system. (one company can censor your tx, freeze funds, etc; by making many people do this and making it profitable for them to be honest, bitcoin is decentralized as long as there are multiple miners)

 * **P2P** by allowing people to send directly to the address of someone else, no middlemen or extra settlement networks needed for bitcoin to work and scale to the whole world by advancing along with technology and preparing for the future.

 * **Trustlessness** because any person can make a tx, not have to trust the decentralized miners to process it, and know it's more profitable for these system maintainers to allow a tx than to censor it. Anyone can use random sampling to check a balance or tx on any mining node or non-mining node (which don't actually support the network security) with knowledge that they can validate their transaction with great security very easily from their cell phone.

 * **Electronic cash** by being able to be used like cash. Anyone can spend or receive, there is a very small transaction fee of less than 5 cents and often less than 1 cent that is lost by the spender when any transaction is made, the great volume of these transactions go to support miners who maintain and run the network. Like successful worldwide organizations, taking a small fee on a large volume of items allows the system to sustain itself.


This system was **originally called Bitcoin**. What most consider to be a hostile take over of Bitcoin happened around 2016. Of the few (less than 25) bitcoin code contributers and developers, about half were hired by one company. For whatever reason the development of Bitcoin stalled at this point and it wasn't until people got fed up that things changed. 

**In August 2017 Bitcoin split into two currencies**. 

The **legacy bitcoin stayed the same** and kept temporary measures installed in 2011 which have resulted in high fees and difficulty to use, along with the increased desire to add a middleman network (LN) which would lower the revenue of miners who maintain bitcoin. The legacy bitcoin network also added a complex set of core which changes some core principles behind the inner workings of bitcoin and changes fundamental aspects of security and game theory. This code addition is known as segregated witness and was largely dismissed by the community until some people agreed to add the segregated witness code if others would remove the temporary limit that is causing high fees. There has been little use of this code since it was installed and it hasn't helped anything which the few who wanted it claimed it would, the temporary limit was also kept and thus Legacy bitcoin keeps high fees. High fees cause long wait times. To make matters worse the legacy bitcoin chain added something called Replace By Fee, or RBF. This allows someone who made a transaction to rebroadcast that tx with a higher fee (greater personal loss) in the hopes in can better compete with everyone else who submitted a transaction so that their transaction appears more attractive to miners and can be mined faster. With full blocks this can reduce a wait from a few days to a few hours (still far from Satoshi's 10 minute plan).

**Bitcoin Cash upgraded** by removing a temporary fix put in years ago that is no longer needed. Without full blocks there is no fee market, everyone can use bitcoin just fine and they don't have to worry about if they paid enough to get their transaction confirmed. Bitcoin cash confirmed all transactions in the next block for a minimal fee of usually under a cent. The upgraded version of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, also removed RBF, this means it is no longer practical for people to double spend a transaction and thus people selling items for bitcoin can trust a transaction as soon as it is broadcast (0-configuration txs are safe again, before i could buy something, go outside, reboradtcast those funds going somewhere else with a higher fee and since not everyone can get into a block the miners will take my higher fee tx before the lower fee one and I can get most my money back and steal from sellers, bitcoin cash fixed this problems)",cryptocurrency

investing,Flowers Foods (FLO) up 8.2% in last 5 days,"A large portion of my portfolio (30%) is in Flowers Foods, which was invested when I was very young.  I am not comfortable holding so much in a single asset, and am looking for guidance on how I should approach an exit strategy.  The rest of my portfolio was with Edward Jones, and was a complete disaster.  I recently liquidated that portfolio earlier this year when I decided to actually look at what I was invested in, and moved into Vanguard index funds.

Concerning Flowers Foods, and based on my limited knowledge, I believe they have solid management who understands that the current dietary trends mean they have to cut waste and shift towards more organic offerings.  In the past 3-4 years they've established Project Centennial, which seeks to reduce their management headcount and address inefficiencies.  They've been successful with their semi-recent acquisition of Dave's Killer Bread, which makes organic non-GMO whole-grain fresh bread.  Their dividend of around 3.5% is a nice offering, and is increased from time to time.

Around August of 2016 the stock got hit pretty hard from news of a possible class-action from their drivers whom they subcontract instead of hire as employees; moving the price down to about $15.  I decided to invest a bit more on that news, and am happy I did so.  That concern seems to have been alleviated over time.

Another interesting fact I found from backtesting is FLO, during the period of the 08' crash, did not experience a massive downturn, but instead gained around an increase of +8% where most assets fell 40-50%.  I would assume that's because a staple like fresh bread is considered a safe investment during downturns.  Of course, past performance does not guarantee future results, but I've considered that at my age, this might be a solid holding as a hedge against downturns as opposed to holding bonds in this rising interest rate environment.

I know consumer staples isn't exciting like tech stocks, but I'd appreciate any further analysis anyone might be able to provide.  Also, any advice on how far I should go in reducing my holding, and whether I'm crazy to use the holding as a hedge.",finance
investing,"Robert Shiller jumps on the ""passive investing is dangerous"" bandwagon","Link [here](https://www.pragcap.com/is-robert-shiller-right-that-passive-investing-is-dangerous/) (with link to the original CNBC interview of Shiller within).

I'm disinclined to believe Robert Shiller is missing obvious points like the fact that passive funds aren't 100% passive or that active investor activity drives passive fund composition.

There are millions of people across the country who couldn't even tell you what a yield curve is and are nevertheless dumping billions of dollars into passive funds expecting a 10% YoY nominal return. In an economy growing at a 3.5% nominal rate (at its *maximum*) with interest rates approaching 2% the only way for this to work is for corporate earnings to encompass an increasingly large share of GDP. Shareholders are inclined to drive profits higher at all costs and investors must accept more and more expensive valuations. This is of course good for people who have assets and bad for people who don't, which drives inequality to greater and greater levels. But the average person doesn't recognize this. They are all inadvertently feeding the beast by dumping more and more of their cash into equities.",finance

Currently I have a fair amount of liquid cash, about $10k in savings and $20K in a checking account (probably should have done something with this money sooner but no going back now).

For the past two tax years I have maximized my Roth IRA.

I don't have any dept per se. Only credit card which I pay off monthly and I currently lease a car, which is $400/month with insurance.

My main questions:

1. Is there anything I can do to maximize my federal financial aid?
2. How should I prepare my finances for pretty much being unemployed for the next two year?

I hear retirement accounts aren't taken into account for finical aid so maximizing my Roth IRA would be good, but I am also concerned about loosing that liquid cash.

personalfinance,"Received $10,000 from dad's funeralgoers sending condolence cards. Splitting among me (21, graduating college senior) and 2 siblings(18, college freshman/16, high school junior). Best way to save/invest the money?","Hello!

My dad passed away in October and apparently it's tradition to send cash in condolences cards. This cash totaled up to USD$10,000. It's currently sitting in my savings account at my credit union. I wanted to know what the best way to save it is. If it'd be better for me and my siblings to split the funds and save it in different ways, that's an option. Just looking for advice on what to do.

From reading the FAQ, it looks like I should either put my share in a 401k or pay off my student loans, but I'm not completely sure. I have a total of $35,000 in principal in federal student loans for the last 4 years of school. My brother will also probably end up with that as well. My sister is also looking to go into a 4-year college and will probably end up borrowing too.

personalfinance,Car Loan vs Lease?,"I may have something seriously wrong with my car's transmission that makes it not worth fixing. I got the car for $1800, and have already put in about $1000 of work into it for a variety of things including tires. It has 215,000 miles on it.

With having to potentially get a new car- I know leasing is an option but don't know a lot about it. My parents have leased their cars in the past and haven't had issues with it. My dad is paying off the one that he initially was leasing now. From what I understand most if not all maintenance is covered by the dealership.

I have pretty good credit for my age (20F) in about the 600-700 range, but I'm not sure how a car loan would play out and especially on a used car that may still need repairs after I buy it.

I can really only afford a $150 payment a month or less right now with my credit card/school debt:

$1000- credit card ($400 of this is school fees)
$490- my aunt
$500- car payment to my dad

cybersecurity,North Korean Trojan: Volgmer,"US-CERT NCAS Tactical Alerts TA17-318A/TA-318B | 
REF URL: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318B 
Overview
This joint Technical Alert (TA) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with a Trojan malware variant used by the North Korean government—commonly known as Volgmer. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.

FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses—listed in this report’s IOC files—to maintain a presence on victims’ networks and to further network exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP addresses to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.

This alert includes IOCs related to HIDDEN COBRA, IP addresses linked to systems infected with Volgmer malware, malware descriptions, and associated signatures. This alert also includes suggested response actions to the IOCs provided, recommended mitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents. If users or administrators detect activity associated with the Volgmer malware, they should immediately flag it, report it to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give it the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.",technology

36. A federal task force is formed to deal with the bait and switch phone tactics that corporations and hospitals use to make people pay for services they haven’t received. Part of that service is a speedy billing. Any charge that hasn’t been sent to the recipient within thirty days is deemed null and void.

37. The tariff system will be reinstated to protect the jobs of the citizens of the United States of America. All products arriving from other countries will be subject to a tariff tax.

38. Gerrymandering is prohibited. Proportional Representation replaces it. 

39. No member of congress is allowed to have a net worth in excess of four million dollars.

Also signs saying: “We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.” are illegal, and posting one is punishable by a one thousand dollar fine, and a one month jail sentence. If a corporation sets this reservation as policy; it is fined one million dollars per sign, and their top CEO serves the thirty days in a federal prison. The moneys accrued are used to construct public bathrooms in all depressed areas of the cities the corporation does business in, and the corporation is taxed to maintain said public bathrooms; half of which have warm water showers.  

44. The Department of Weights and Measures is increased a hundred fold, and all items coming into the United States of America that claim to be stainless steel have to be one hundred percent stainless steel, or they get sent back to where ever they came from. If the company discounts the product, and tries to resell it back into this country; the product shall be refused entry. We only accept products with integrity. Our people are valuable to us.

45. When law officers give tickets for bad rear lights, and break lights to a driver, if the motorist makes less than twenty thousand dollars a year, the officer will issue him a coupon so he can bring the car to a gold star station and have it fixed for free. The state will pay for the installation. All gold star stations that do not respond promptly to the coupon, will lose their gold star status.

The federal government will take control of all products that can completely heal a condition, and distribute them to the general public for free, two years after they are discovered. The companies or individuals who invent the cures, will be compensated generously by the Federal Government to the degree that the cure offsets the price it would have cost the Federal Healthcare system to otherwise deal with it over a three-year period.

 one year in prison with out a chance for parole for  the executive

personalfinance,"Need help budgeting for 2018 - new salary, bonus structure, tax changes, etc. Unsure of where to start.","I am turning 30 in a few months and want to use that milestone to get serious about my finances and take better control. The last couple of years have been great from a professional perspective with increasing my base salary to well above the 6 figure mark and also negotiating a great bonus structure. On the personal/financial side though, I haven't been even remotely responsible and haven't done much with budgeting and overspent and indulged a lot along the way. While the professional side has been great and very rewarding, it is also a bit depressing to see/know how hard I have worked and not having nearly what I'd hoped to show for it at this point.

Where I am at now is trying to plan for the remainder of 2017, which is easy enough because I already know what my take home pay is from each paycheck from now until the remainder of the year. Moving into 2018 though, I am just unsure about the best way to calculate what my expected take home pay should be each period with some of the new (maybe?) tax changes coming into play. I think the most difficult part though and what I am hoping to get help with, is I also can't just apply a blanket percentage of expected withholdings to each check because my quarterly bonuses are withheld at a different rate.

The short version is what I am hoping to accomplish is putting a plan together for 2018 that gives me a clear expectation of what my take home pay will be for each pay check (the 1st and 15th of every month) and also my quarterly bonus (usually received on 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 and 10/15). From that, I plan to update my direct deposit information and have a specific % or $ amount go to an Ally checking account for paying bills, an Ally savings account, Vanguard for Roth IRA contributions and a Bank of America checking account for everyday purchases with a debit card. I just want to be able to 'set it and forget it' as much as possible based on this plan I lay out going into the new year.

I also just found out that this past pay period I maxed out my responsibility for Social Security for the year, so from this pay period through the end of the year I have an additional $275 or so in take home pay. I calculated that in 2018 (based on the info below) that I would reach that mark around 7/15/18 based on the new $127,800 threshold, so am hoping whatever budget and model I put together can also account for that.

Additional information:

-Live in NC
-Single
-Base Salary: $115k (should go to $120k by 5/1)
-Expected Bonus: $20k-$25k on 1/15, 4/15, 7/15 and 10/15

If I could sum up this long post into two questions, they would be:

1. Excluding Social Security (which I want to track separately), what % should I expect to be withheld in Federal Taxes, State Taxes, Medicare from each of my 24 bi-monthly paychecks?

2. Based on the base salary information and expected bonus information, what % should I expect to be withheld from the 4 quarterly bonus paychecks (excluding social security for the reasons already discussed).

I qualify for PSLF. I borrowed $4,000 in Federal Perkins loans and ~$28,000 in Direct Sub. and Unsub. Stafford loans. My Stafford loans were transferred to PHEA (FedLoan Servicing) per the PSLF program, for some reason my Perkins loans weren't consolidated into my PHEA account as well--the PHEA representative said I could apply for the consolidation in 6 months (not really sure whats up with that, but there was a bit of a language barrier so I'll try again tomorrow and hopefully get a clearer answer, unless someone here has one). I make ~$42,000/year, single tax status, technically I'm a SC resident, but I work full time in NY--not sure if state of residency has that big of an effect. Since PSLF is a ten year program I do not foresee a large pay increase within that time frame--I am a state worker after all. . .

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Options for parent,"I am a long-time lurker and you all always provide sound advice, so I am hoping you all can give some guidance in an unfortunate situation.

Just for background - I am a 26/m making $80k/yr and make personal finance a priority in my life (have emergency fund,contribute 401k, paying off loans, etc while paying for all my own expenses).

The biggest issue financially that I have is helping support my mom. Long story short, she was widowed about 15 years ago and very poorly managed my dad's life insurance money. At the height of the recession she lost her job, and it took her almost 3 years to get a new full-time job. It was never a high paying job, but since that happened, she has always needed help from family/friends to get by. She finally sold her house and moved to a much cheaper part of the state, but even through that mismanaged the proceeds of the sale (was not a ton, but still was not happy to hear the story of this).

Anyways, one of the worst things she did was she took out a loan to pay for expenses that were planned to be covered by selling the house. Well 2 years after the fact, she lets me know that she is out of money and again needs help for a couple months before she can receive Social Security payments from my deceased father when she turns 60, on top of the low amount of income she already receives (~$26k annual pre-tax).

She has asked me if we could cosign on a loan for $14,000 - $9k to pay off this existing loan currently at 25%, and another $5k to get her by for 6 months. With not enough liquid cash I could help provide, this is kind of our only option (or how I see it).

I tried to apply for the loan solely to get a better interest rate, but I gave too much information away about the use of the loan and the bank required us to submit jointly. They countered us to only loan us $9,000 to pay off the existing loan (60 month at 11.4% interest). While this is an okay option, the other $5,000 is needed to cover all her expenses for 5-6 months.

We talked about this with the bank, and they said I could take out a new credit card with a debt transfer limit up to $15,000 with 0% interest for 15 months, after that it goes to anywhere from 12% to 24%. I am well-aware of the risks of this option if any balance cannot be paid off in 15 months, and am openly advocating not to do this in case of any type of worst-case scenario. But it could be beneficial if executed correctly.

Anyways, I was wondering if there are any suggestions on what we can do to get the best (read: easiest to manage/lowest interest rate, etc) loan for this situation. I am going to look at other banks to shop around to see if I can get any better deals, but struggling with how to talk with the bank to be as vague and specific at the same time? 
I understand this is not an ideal situation, it is what it is at this point, and I want to make sure it is done in the best way possible. I am aware of all risks and have collateral if needed in a worst-case (unfortunately, 401k, but again WOULD NEVER touch it unless necessary). Are there any other options I may have missed in considering? I am happy to go do more homework if that is needed.",finance

personalfinance,New program at Work. Seems Sketchy.,"I'm not sure if this is quite the right for this sub, so if there is a better one please let me know so I can change subs.

That out of the way, had a company wide meeting today and found out they have a new thing going on. Basically last year the company partnered up with a new startup that was trying to work against payday loan places. From what I remember it was basically a secured loan. You could put any amount in a week and at any point take out a loan with low interest rates. I never signed up for it because I already have two small credit cards ($500 limit each) and I don't even use them that much.

Well today in the meeting they said in January everyone will get a 5% pay increase. But you will only get it if you put it into an account with this startup. They said they will match it with a further 5%, so basically you are getting a 10% bonus to go into a secured loan. 

So it's your money, you just have to use it they way the say you do. (They're like this in other ways too: they try really hard to convince everyone to sign up to give donations to a charity. Call me cynical, but I can't help but wonder if they don't write all those donations off as tax breaks.)

Anyway, this whole scheme just feels shady as all hell. On one had, I'm all for sticking it to payday loans...but giving your employees a raise for the SOLE purpose of having a secured loan seems...so sketchy.

Monthly expenses: Rent + Utilities: $1400 (approx), and around $1000-$1200 on regular stuff like food, going out etc.

My company offers 30% match all the way to 18k, meaning they'll put in 5,400 of I put in the 18k. That's why I want to first Max out my 401k contribution (put per paycheck around $700 pretax). This will bring my taxable income down to $84,000 or thereabouts. Good idea? 

After 31% tax (approx federal + state + Social security and Medicare tax) my after tax will be around 59k per year. With my expenses, I estimate that I can Max my 401k.

Now here's my question. 

I currently have about $50,000 to throw at buying a house. I'm looking at getting something for around $300,000 just outside of Brisbane (hot town to the north). Not to live in mind you, just to rent out while I work on getting a bit more cash to buy a place in Sydney where I live. I should be able to get something in Brisbane where the rent will cover the mortgage at this point.

Here's the thing though. In 2 -3 years I'll be getting around $150,000 from the sale of a family home. Should I wait potentially 3 years to buy a house and have a considerably smaller mortgage, or jump in now and then chuck that cash at the mortgage when I get it.

My want to do it sooner rather than later is based on the general consensus that house prices where I'm looking at buying are expected to increase quite a bit over the next few years.

Oh! And the interest rate on the mortgage would be around 5.5%.

personalfinance,"26, amount of disposable income grew by 10x, but do I save it, pay off debt, or invest?","Hi everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

**Financial Background:**

&amp;nbsp;

I've been working in a 9-5 job for two years, and haven't done a great job of saving money or paying off my student loans.  I'm currently on a graduated payment plan, paying ~100 dollars a month now, slowly ramping up to ~300 over the next few years, to pay off about 15K worth of loans.  The interest rates vary, but the highest is 4.9%.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, I bought a car this year with a monthly payment ~300, interest rate around 3%, with a loan amount of about 15K as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**Recent Developments:**

&amp;nbsp;

I was recently given a 6K raise increase at work, raising my yearly salary before overtime to 75K, while also reducing my rent from nearly 2K a month to around 500.  Overtime is possible/probable, but probably best not to rely on in calculations.I may also be promoted again sometime in the next few months, possible increasing my salary by another 8K, but it's best not to rely on that as.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Question:**

What do I do with this extra disposable income?  Should I pay off all of my debt ASAP?  Save some large percentage of it and keep things fluid in case my housing situation changes, or should I be investing right now?

&amp;nbsp;

I've already maxed my employer 401K contribution, and plan to set aside some more for my HSA (how much is something I'm curious in as well) but beyond that I'm not sure.  I've seen it recommended to save up a 1 to 6 month cushion in case of emergencies, but is that strictly 1 to 6 months of wages after tax, or is it simply the amount of my bills?  

&amp;nbsp;


**Complications:**
&amp;nbsp;

Furthermore, I've been able to reduce my housing costs by moving from a boutique apartment into a month to month shared living situation, but as such there is less security in how long this agreement will last.

&amp;nbsp;

Also,  I work in the defense industry, and while things are currently booming, a bust in a few years is inevitable.  It's certainly possible that I might rise to become a manager and avoid layoffs by that point, but I'm making sure to gain skill sets transferable to other industries to ensure I don't find myself unemployable.  

&amp;nbsp;

Another avenue I'm currently exploring is becoming a contractor in a year or so as well, as that would massively increase my earnings in the short term, though I doubt this will influence the decision making process.

personalfinance,"Stuck in an awful town, opportunity to move has opened up. I need advice.","Hey, r/personalfinance. I know you guys get a lot of advice threads, so I'll try to keep this one brief and detailed.

Right now I'm living with my parents in a shitty little town in northwest New Mexico. I've been in this state all my life and I can tell you it is objectively horrible. There's not a lot of meaningful work, everybody is depressed, the culture is unapologetically redneck/white-and-other-assorted-shades-of-trash, and it's just not a good environment for me.

I moved out of the town for about two years to attend school once I'd graduated high school, but the college I was attending closed down due to what I'll politely describe as a 'mismanagement of funds.' .... It was an art school. None of the credits are transferable, and I'm not interested in attending another University. As a result of the closure, I had to move back in with my parents.

Right now, I am $600 in credit debt. The school loans come out to something like $10,000, and those will need to start being paid soon since I'm no longer in school.

I work as a sleep technician in a lab here in town. I get paid $12 and hour, 12 hour night shifts, three nights a week. It's not a killing, but in my position at age 20, I'm grateful for it.

Recently I've been discussing the idea of getting out of this horrible state with some former schoolmates of mine. They have a lease on an apartment in the suburbs of Chicago and want me to go there with them. I find this to be a dream opportunity. Illinois has always been a place I've wanted to be, and I feel like I may finally find a community of people who I can amiably interact with in a city like Chicago.

That being said, there is some trouble. I'm basically living paycheck to paycheck right now, slowly lying off the credit debt. At this rate I'll have it gone by the end of this year. 

The school loan debt, I'm not sure about. I never signed anything for it, my parents kind of handled all the paperwork, so I'm not sure when I'll be responsible to start paying on it, but I want to start as soon as possible.

In regards to where I currently live, it's been deteriorating my mental state for as long as I've been here, basically my whole life. Everything is depressing, outside all there is to see is sun-bleached sand, oil derricks, and white pick-up trucks with Confederate flags waving behind them. I'm on a bunch of different medication just to live here without totally imploding. I want to be gone from this place, yesterday.

My question to you is, what the Hell do I do? I make about $1,200 a month working at the lab. I have no work lined up in Chicago and have signed an agreement with my current employer that I won't work for any other sleep labs for two years. My goal is to be out of this state and living with reasonable accommodations with my proposed housemates as soon as possible, preferably by the end of 2018. How much should I have saved up when I head out there? What should I be prepared for? Do I need to feel bad about moving away from my parents again? What are my chances of surviving in the big city as a small fry from a hick town?

I don't mean this as a woe-is-me pity party. I legit don't know what to do so here's the numbers.

I lost my job and then my car that I owe $13k on needs a new motor, $7600. No warranty. Car books for $8k without needing repairs. I have $100 in the bank and get $200/week in unemployment. My monthly bills are ~$800 and my car payment/insurance is $400 of it. 

I have 2 student loans: $18k in Federal and $4k through my Uni's endowment. 3 credit cards all maxed out from previous car repairs totalling $4k. Medical debt in collections, $5k. I don't even have the title to the car because GA is withholding it until I pay up the remaining $400 registration tax not due till 3/2018. 

My knowledge of bankruptcy is on par with Michael Scott. Idk how it works, I just know it's something people do when they can't pay their bills. Can I just cancel my insurance and abandon the car/default on the loan and is that worse than bankruptcy?

Been in GA for a year and I'm about to rent a car and move back to my mom's in NY. Do I take up legal matters in GA or NY? Car loan is from a bank in NY.",finance

personalfinance,Taxes on income from business mileage versus a monthly allowance,"I will try to explain this the best I can. I haven't had anyone in HR explain this to me in a way that I 100% understand.

I drive my personal vehicle for business reasons sometimes. Because of this, my employer gives me $100 per month as an allowance, as well as 20 cents per mile.

I got paid today, and I noticed my take home pay was about $150 less than it usually is. Looking at the paycheck, I had about $500 listed as a taxable benefit. So, my federal and state taxes were a little higher because of it, and I still had an additional deduction for the entire amount of the taxable benefit.

I think I understand where the $500 amount is coming from. From November 2016-October 2017, I made $1200 (monthly allowance) plus $413.20 (about 2066 miles). If I was just paid the government mileage rate and didn't receive a monthly allowance, I would have received about $500 less, which is the amount of the taxable benefit.

So, can I expect to get some of this money back in my tax refund? My main question is why my tax deductions were higher while still having the full amount of the taxable benefit deducted.

Feel free to take everything on here with a grain of salt. 


I recently joined a group called Monster Investment Group. I talked to the owner on discord and they are a really chill person and i figured i would try to see if others were interested in joining. I dont own this group in any way i just thought i share it with the rest of you. Basically they offer 50% what ever they get referral wise back to you. (IE. if you invest 100$ they get paid by the site 5% or 5$ they give you half of that back 50/50 so you get 2.5$. The more you invest the more you in return.)


If you are unfamiliar with chain group i can give you a run down: -Less time your funds are held (I've seen 90-180 days for certain groups) -Each group has different investing types with different times (some offer compounding) -You get paid any interest you get from your investment ( for example with a 2% interest rate you would make any money that is held up back in less than 50 days) -Some groups allow you to do compounding interest. (they re-roll your interest into the initial amount invested) -You can see what other investors are investing in and mirror their ""portfolio"" which also adds transparency to the platform -Each group has (for the lack of remembering the word) emergency fund which acts as insurance if anything should happen


I hope this info gave you a little better insight on chain group even if it is brief. If you have more questions please ask.

personalfinance,$32k salary increase - How to budget with debt,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I've been a lurker for a while. I recently got a new job, where my income jumped from $43,000 to $75,000. I'm trying to figure out the best solution to manage my finances. 

My monthly take home pay will be $3,962 (calculated on smartasset.com after factoring 5% contribution to 401k and pre tax contribution to my commuter plan). 

I have 3 loans, 2 student and one personal. The personal loan I took out from lending club was due to mounting credit card debt (I know, I know). The details of the loans are

* Lending Club: $4,879.30 balance left with 9.44% interest rate
* Federal loan: $5115.47 balance left with 4.29% interest rate 
* Private Student loan: $15,053.86 with a 8.24% interest rate

&amp;nbsp;

My monthly expenses are
* Loan payments: $370 minimum across all 3
* Rent: $1175 
* Phone: $75 
* Utilities: $120 
* Groceries: $420 (definitely an overestimate, but just to be safe) 

After expenses, I'll be left with ~$1800 a month. 

After reading the wiki, I think prioritizing paying off the lending club loan would be the best move (I have a small emergency fund). But I do know that I have until April to contribute to a 2017 Roth IRA (I do not currently have one), and was wondering if it would be best to do that and payoff the lending club loan a little slowly. 

I'm just having trouble with what to prioritize, I still want to be able to do some fun things (so a couple hundred of that $1800 towards entertainment/eating out). 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Am I leaving money on the table by holding on to a house I no longer live in?,"(Throwaway for privacy reasons)

This is a decision I have flip-flopped on more than any other, so I thought getting some advice from all of you arm-chair experts would be great (this might sound snarky, but I'm sincere - I read this subreddit regularly!).

My wife and I bought our house in 2008 at the height of the real estate bubble for around $250,000.  We were one of those typical young couples that bought too much house when we made too little money (this was before I read this subreddit regularly), and we were house-poor for a while.  Luckily, we were able to improve our income significantly since the purchase time, and make a lot of headway on the mortgage.

We have done around $40,000 in significant improvements to it (all new windows, new roof, insulation everywhere, added natural gas heating).  The house is around 3300 square feet, and based on a realtor friend's estimate, it could probably fetch $260-275k selling today (we really bought at the worst possible time!).

My question comes up because we no longer live in this house.  

A new job that I started three years ago (non-profit sector) includes housing (mandatory - must live on property).   The new job was a significant dip in income (about a 50% cut), but we're following our passions.  We are renting the house we own to a pastor and his family (we like them and wanted to be a blessing to them) for far under market value (their rent is $700 /month, market value is probably $1200+ for a 4 bedroom in our region).

We owe about $120,000 on the house @ 3.5%.  Our monthly payment including escrow is $1300.

Here is the dilemma:  I don't anticipate leaving my current job for at least 5 years.  We love it, and it is a great organization.  When we originally opted to not sell, part of the reasoning was to have a safety net in case the new job didn't work out.

Our income and family are ""stable"" - we're able to save a decent amount each month, and often make double payments on the mortgage.  My income is about half of what my previous job was (love non-profits...), but it is rewarding in many other ways.  I'm currently making $50,000 / yr; and my wife works part time and brings in around $20,000 / yr.

We live frugally and are generally able to save around $1300 / month in addition to our IRA and HSA contributions.   We typically use this additional savings to fund a ""hobby"" stock portfolio, make additional payments to IRA, or make additional payments on our mortgage.  We have a healthy emergency fund, and we're able to be generous with the organization we work for and our church.  We aren't buying an island anytime soon, but for our age, family size, and income, I think we're in reasonable control of our finances.

Right now, our tenants rent nearly covers escrow + interest.


So here are the questions:

Should I sell the house and invest the proceeds? 
Or is the house itself a worthwhile investment with our interest and escrow being paid for?  
Am I leaving a lot of money on the table by holding on to this property?

Some of the questions I also think of are: ""If we sold the house, are my conservative investments going to keep up with the real estate market?  Will we be able to buy as much house in 10 years with the money we've generated?  Will interest rates be anywhere near 3.5%?

Anyhow - any advice is welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Using savings to pay off loans?,"**Relevant Info**

I am 23, I graduated a year and a half ago and got a job right out of school. I have 30k in student loans and I currently make 82k/year. 

I currently have roughly $20k sitting in my savings account and I was thinking that I want to use some of it shave off a good chunk from my loans. The question is how much should I use?

My take home is 4k/month and my monthly expenses probably average around ~$1500 (will go up a couple hundred in January when I move closer to work).

20k in federal student loans 

* split into 3 chunks
* highest interest rate is 4.66%, lowest is 3.86%.

10k in the parent loan offered by my university

personalfinance,Need help making a decision about how to survive my last few months as a student.,"I'm in my 4th year of medical school.  I have taken out the maximum allowable amount for non-private loans.  Looking at my finances and plans moving forward I probably need 3-5k more than I have to make it until I begin getting paid in residency.  The way I see it I have three options:
1) Withdrawal the ~4k I have in my retirement plan from when I was a teacher and pay a non-refundable 10% early withdrawal fee + 20% in automatically deducted taxes (that I should be able to get back when I file taxes since I have no income).
2) Float myself on my current credit cards.  I have one card with a 13% APR that I no longer have the grace period of not paying interest between statement posting date and due date and one card with 19% APR that I have paid off in full each month but am in danger of not being able to this month.
3) Open a new credit card account with 0% APR for 12 months and transfer what I need with the plan of being able to pay it off in full before the 12 months is up.
Solution 1 might not be able to get me everything I need but seems like a good place to start and it uses money I technically have.  That 10% withdrawal fee hurts tho.
Solution 2 seems like a terrible idea because my interest rates are high and I would lose the grace period on the second card.
Solution 3 seems like it makes a lot of sense but I don't want my credit to take too much of a hit (I have borderline good/excellent credit as of now) and if I can't pay it back in 12 months I'll be back in solution 2 territory.
As of now I'm leaning towards starting with option 1 now to get back to 0 on the one credit card and then seeing if i need to dip into option 3 as I run out of funds at the end of the year.

investing,Market Outlook Going into 2018? Will the Market Crash?,"The Housing Market Crash from 2007-2008 forever scarred both the domestic and international markets in one of the greatest failures both attributable to the financial institutions that provided the means for the crisis and the public who fueled the madness. 

Currently, we are enjoying one of the greatest bull runs of our lifetimes and both strong consumer spending and credit bolstered by strong company fundamentals are continuing to drive the markets to consistent all-time highs. So bullish is this market that countless shorts are getting eviscerated in this massive run as the rest of the global economy continues to rise as well. Even Japan, who had suffered decades of stagnant economic growth, is now beginning to gain back some of its strength back through strong economic strides. 

As Fed Chair Janet Yellen steps down, fellow board member Jerome Powell will be taking her place which is good for the markets as both share similar views. This continuation in the markets is a mark of consistency that will continue Yellen's work in the past which has helped the markets to recover. With all these factors in place, there is strong evidence to suggest that there is still yet more room for the markets to grow even at these all-time high levels. 

Bitcoin is emerging as the top contender for the next bubble and is represented as a significant risk to the markets. Although the valuation of Bitcoin is a little absurd, the cryptocurrency alongside others are not integrated enough with both society and the economy due to the lack of practical use for Bitcoin at this point in time. Considering that many still do not use payments (or even know what it is) in addition to the fact that most businesses do not accept Bitcoin payment, even if Bitcoin were to collapse, the current situation hints that Bitcoin will not be the bubble, at least not now.

Overall, the markets are enjoying a time of great prosperity and a renewed revival of the investment community. Although there are many caution signs to be aware of, being out of the markets completely is not the right option either.

I finally graduated with my master's degree last year and have been employed for about a year now. I'm recently engaged and saving for a somewhat large wedding in Fall 2019 and hopefully a house around that time as well. These are my major short-term savings goals (&lt; 5 years), but am also looking to invest for my future retirement.

I am 26 years old making $105,000 USD (salary). I also have commission/per diem job that brings in an extra $2000-$2500 (after taxes) per month depending on the month. My fiance is also working, making an approximate $90,000 salary (pre-tax).

I'm currently investing $800 per month in my 401k. Which comes out to $9,600/year. My company does NOT do a 401k match until I've been with them for 6 years.

I also just created an account with Wealthfront as I am NOT savvy when it comes to investing my money/stocks/etc and I somewhat believe this would be a good option for me for that reason. Currently investing about $200 per month here. 
 
I do owe 160k in student loans - average interest rate on all loans is about 6.5%. I am paying approx. $2,000 a month (minimum payment is $1850 on a 10-year payment plan).

I pay no rent as I am living with fiance's family. I will likely remain rent-free until we buy our house in late 2019. (I hope)

I lease a car and pay monthly. My lease + insurance = $379/month.

I have no credit card debt.

My fiance has approximately $140,000 of student loans with a similar interest rate as I do.

My plan is to use any money we receive from the wedding on a down payment on a home. I hope to have 20% to avoid paying PMI down the road. I live in a high COL area and will likely need approximately $100k to put down 20% on a somewhat decent home. I'm looking for advice on what to do with me and my fiance's income. While I feel fortunate to have the income I do, my student loans take up approximately 30% of my monthly income depending on the month, not to mention any other bills like my car, cell phone, expenses, etc. 

Would it be wiser to stop investing into my 401k all together for a few years and tackle my student loans? Or continue to pay approx. $2000 per month on the loans and attempt to max out my 401k and ditch the Wealthfront account for now? And should I have my fiance (also no credit debt) begin contributing to her 401k? She just started her job two months ago. Just some of the many questions I have so I am just looking for some general advice. I'd love to hear what you guys have to say. Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Seeking financial guidance to get my student loans and credit score back on track after going from almost homeless to earning six figures,"Alright, not to go too much into my past or anything, but I had been on and off work for most of my career and things really took a nose dive when my girlfriend eventually got fed up with my inability to hold a job and kicked me out. We had been together since high school, so when I was kicked out I lost everything. I mean, I had no money, no furniture, no place to live, not even a bank account in my own name. Everything I had been making since college had gone into a joint account which she primarily managed and I wasn't allowed to touch. So even when I was working, I never really saw any of that money since it was always going to ""pay her back"" for the times I was out of work. Thankfully after our breakup, I was able to hustle and work myself up from being near homeless to a nice job making $100k in less than two years. 

Problem is I'm 34 and my finances are a mess. My credit is shit. I've never even had a credit card, always just used debit cards (at least I have no credit card debt), or was a secondary approved card holder under my ex's cards.

I've got student loans, but I put them into deferment years ago when I was out of work and just sort of forgot about them, so I'm not even sure what their status is. Most likely in collections, which is an area I'm not sure about navigating. I'm not even sure how to go about finding out which company holds them now or how to work out some form of payment plan.

Some of the good things: I am living below my means (my salary is about 66 times my monthly rent). After paying back my family for loaning me money for first, last and security at my apartment, I splurged a little bit when I bought some essential items like a bed and kitchen equipment (what can I say - I was sick of sleeping on the floor and eating takeout or microwaved meals). I don't tend to make lots of foolish purchases or spend a lot of money on entertainment. I do tend to save up and then I'll look for deals to make a BIFL type of purchase whenever possible. Recently I put $5k into a money market account with Ally bank for some emergency cash savings (thought that would be better than a savings account). I've also got about $3k sitting in eTrade that I'm not yet sure what to do with. 

I'm trying to turn my financial life around but I really don't know where to start. I was lucky to even get into my apartment due to my credit report which they required before accepting my application. I do recall that on there was multiple reports of various debt companies (some of which I've never even heard of) all claiming my student loans. It was obvious because they all were in the same amount, but it made it look like there's over $100k in debt there instead of the actual $35k or so it was when I put them into deferment. So I'm thinking the debt got kicked around and then claims were made while I was out of work and near homeless.

I guess in general my two biggest questions are how can I quickly turn my credit score around and what should I do about my student loans?

financialindependence,Mortgage Payoff Analysis,"I have been doing some back of the napkin calculations around the best time to pay off my mortgage.  The way I see it there are many options, but I want to discuss the three most relevant to me: 1) pay it off ASAP 2) hold low interest rate loan for entirety of loan 3) pay it off at retirement.

Option 1
Pay off all debt as quickly as possible to eliminate monthly expenses and unnecessary costs.  There are many methods one can implement to accomplish this (snowball, highest rate) and those have been analyzed many times on Reddit.  This option benefits many in that it provides a goal, becoming debt free must feel liberating.  It also will reduce the monthly expenses of the individual thus increasing savings rate or allow for lifestyle creep. 

Option 2
This option has a more long term benefit, but can have more pitfalls along the way. Assuming the interest rate on the mortgage is lower than the average rate of return on your invested assets, an individual could be wise to pay the minimum on their debt and increase their savings rate.  Mortgage rates over the last few years have averaged around 3.5% and the long-term average on the SAP is around 7%.  If an individual could pay an additional $500 a month either to debt or savings, that 3.5% a year over ten years equates to an increased net worth of approximately $15,000.  That is ignoring the utilization of tax benefits both on the savings side(401ks, IRAs etc.) or for itemized deductions on the interest expense side.  This is over a short time horizon, given a longer one, the effects compound and are even more favorable.  

Option 3
Based on the brief analysis above, if you can stay disciplined and you have a lower rate interest rate on your debt than the average return in the markets, you should invest over pay down debt.  That is mathematics, but each person has their own preference for different reasons.  Where the math gets interesting is at retirement.  Assume you took the long-term approach and at retirement still have outstanding debt.  For this example, there is $50,000 left to pay off of a $100,000 30 year loan, where monthly payments equal $449 a month, your SWR is 4% and monthly expenses are $5,000(including mortgage).  If you keep the mortgage you will need a nest egg of $1,500,000, whereas if you pay off the mortgage you will need a nest egg of $1,415,300(1,365,300 for withdraws and $50,000 for payoff).

Based on the above examples, it seems prudent to pay the minimum on my mortgage until retirement, and at that point pay off the balance to reduce the needed withdraws. 

Would love to hear thoughts from those that have done this already or anyone else who has analyzed this before.",finance
gaming,I can't seem to finish games nowadays,"Okay so I have finished a small handful within this year so far but there are tons of others that I just can't push myself to complete.

I've had this problem before but never to this extent, I'm usually consistent at completing the games in my collection.

personalfinance,College dropout in serious trouble,"I made a throwaway as a few people know my username..

Anyways, I am a 20 year old college dropout who is in dire financial stress.

I went to a 4 year University for 3 semesters. During the last semester, I became very depressed and suicidal. Towards the end of the semester, I spent some time in the hospital. By the time I was released, there were only 2 weeks left until finals and I had just missed a good amount of classes. On top of that, I was already struggling so I ended up taking incompletes in all but 1 of my classes (the class had a contracted ""instructor"" meaning I was unable to take an incomplete in the class for some reason) which resulted in a GPA of around 0.9 and an automatic academic suspension. This hit me very hard.

But this is /r/personalfinance so let me get to that part of it.

As part of my mental state, I've had a really hard time taking care of obligations such as paying for tuition my final semester. In the end, I was never able to pay for it and the debt went straight to state collection and currently sits at about $10,500.

As a result of my debt, I now cannot attend another school until the debt is paid off which will probably take me a few years (if it was my only expense).

So currently I am stuck at a $11 dollars an hour retail position and living at home (I recognize that I could be doing worse). Prior to that I was unable to work mentally (and realistically still am but felt that I had to do something/was being yelled at everyday to get a job literally). 

Anyways, on top of the $10,500 I owe to state collections, I also owe money for the student loan I took out to pay for my freshman year. As I am no longer attending school because I am unable to (mentally and financially) they now want me to start making monthly payments of around $110 or a total of $7,500.

On top of that, I have other federal loans (at least a Stafford loan, I really cant remember) I took out that I have no idea how much I owe on.

And that's just Academic debt

Since my first hospitalization, I have been hospitalized 2 more times since then. I haven't been able to make any payments on those hospital bills yet but combined they are around $6000. On top of that, I have visited 7 different therapists and been in 2 hospital outpatient programs totaling me around $4000.

As I haven't been able to keep a job until recently, I did a dumb thing and took out 3 credit cards that are now maxed. On top of eveything, I'm a semi-serious shopaholic. I've been known to buy things I can't afford to try to feel good. Anyways, I owe around $1600 on the cards but I should be able to pay them off in the next few months if I make it a priority which is my plan. Beyond that, I have no idea how to proceed.

To tally everything. That's about $18,000 in academic related debt, $10,000 in medical debt and another $1600 in credit card debt. 

I have no idea where to go from here. Having any sort of plan I feel might help however instead of ignoring my finances like I have been doing for the last year as I've just been too scared to face it.

At this time I'd love to be able to focus on my health until I get to a better place mentally but I'm just not sure if I can afford it and the debt is one of many huge stressors in my life right now. I've sunk around $10,000 into trying to improve my health but nothing's really changed. 

Not sure if this was the best place to post this but here I am. If anyone has any advice for me or advice as to somewhere I can turn to for advice. That would be greatly appreciated.",finance

**Student loans**: none

Both of our jobs are extremely stable (Software Leader @ Fortune 50, Advanced Practitioner). 

We currently live in a downtown condominium where I walk to work and she drives, and get away with 1 car which is nice. PITI + HOA is $2450 and about 10% of our gross. Financially we live very comfortably. However, we are ready to get more space, but greatly value living in the area we do - especially because it means we can continue to have 1 car.

To get the amount of space we want, we're looking at places that are roughly $720k. We have 20% to put down, but would raise our PITI + HOA to $3850. We live in a relatively low cost state, and we could get something comparably nice in the suburbs (yuck :P) for $400-500k. 

Now to the meat - I've read personal finance blogs from top to bottom, and while on paper the PITI + HOA comes out to 16% (well short of 28%) it still *feels* really expensive, and we would be above 25% of our take home (for the Dave Ramsey religions of the world). Our taxes are fairly high as well (20% effective fed, 7% state), and who knows what's going to happen to my wonderful SALT deductions with the current political environment ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

I only rented it from my local redbox for the sole purpose of this review. I didn't break the boycott as I don't support AAA console games with a free to play business model and I sure as hell don't support EA. I just felt the need for a review of the game itself and nothing else. Enjoy.


I have played Battlefront II on my ps4 slim for about 5 hours now (with a hour break for dinner with my family in between). In that time, I tried the campaign, heroes vs villians, Galatic assault and starfighter assault. Here are the best game modes (in my opinion)

1. Galactic assault. 40 players. Heroes. Villians. Vehicles. Ships. All on a massive scale on lore accurate star wars planets. This mode alone is worth 80$. 9.5/10

2. Starfighter assualt. A lot of fun and pure star wars thrills. 7/10

3. Heroes vs villians. Has the potential to be fun but is bogged down by the lack of other players being troopers and making it a boring ass, endless respawn filled game of lightsabers battles that feel like smashing 4 action figures together. 5/10.

4. The campaign. Glorifed arcade mode on rails. Big dissapointment here especially if you know the outcome of the story. 4/10 only because it looks great visually and functionally works.

Progression. *overall* Progression is fine. Its the trooper and hero progression that is locked behind loot crates. That is a problem. It is also a problem that Yoda can take *a lot* less damage period because a player has gotten lucky on a paid RNG loot crate and recieved an epic star card. It *is* a problem that boba fett deals more damage to heroes because a player spent real money and got lucky with a crate. The star card system as a whole is fundamentally flawed.

Overall game... 7/10

personalfinance,Should I pay all my student loan interest now to make sure I get the full tax benefit?,"Hi PF!

I have ~$31k left in student loans. They are all federal loans, and I qualify for PSLF, but I still would have another 8.5 years to go on that. I have just been paying them down aggressively and do not plan to wait around for PSLF, although I appreciate having it as a backup option. 

I have been doing a combination of avalanche and snowball method. The interest rates on my loans vary from 3.1-6.5%, so I've been paying off all of the 6.5% ones from smallest to largest balance.

I've heard that there is a big chance the tax credit for student loan interest might be going away next year. While I have 31k left in total, about $2,800 of that is outstanding interest. I could probably knock most, if not all, of that out by tax time. Would this make sense over continuing to pay the 6.5% loans first?

Bitcoin,Is Bitcoin unsuitable to be a real currency and doomed to fail eventually?,"Just to clarify before i make this post: Im not here to spread FUD. Im here asking legitimate questions for which I havent seen any answers in the Bitcoin community.

I know most of you are dreaming of a scenario where Bitcoin becomes one of the dominant world currencies or even replaces current existing Fiat currencies. In accordance with this sentiment I wanted to examine whether Bitcoin could ever be suitable for such a level of adoption. For arguments sake, please assume that Bitcoin has obviously solved its scaling issues through either the Lightning network or some other magic that doesnt require the lightning network.

There are 2 doomsday problems with Bitcoin in my opinion.

1. The cost of verifying transactions. So by 2020 Bitcoin minning will consume more energy than the country of Denmark. Keeping this in mind, we will reach a point where governments will tax bitcoin minning, which will drive up fees. This in combination with less and less block rewards will lead to a situation where over 90% of minning profits come from fees. If the Bitcoin financial system will be as expensive to run as the energy infrastructure of an entire country, then these fees will be quite a lot higher than we have already experienced. Does this mean that we will eventually end up in a place where Bitcoins are worth 100k or more, however moving them is essentially out of the question, since fees might actually be several thousand? (Trying to further elaborate on this point, I wanted to touch on how Bitcoin actually stores value. Since I am not 100% sure about if this is technically correct, I will leave this argument in brackets. It is ultimately not required for the rest of my argument. Anyway, as far as I understood it, if you say you own 5 Bitcoins, this doesnt mean that your wallet has an actual balance of 5 bitcoins. It means that transactions in the blockchain can be attributed to a wallet with a worth of 5 bitcoins. Whenever a transaction is performed, then if you say wish to send someone 0.5 bitcoins, but you are only in possession of 5 one bitcoin transactions, then you send a bitcoin transaction worth 1 bitcoin and once the block is solved, you get 0.5 bitcoins back. This means that eventually we will have smaller and smaller denominations of bitcoin transactions, which makes the byte size of a wallet increase with time, however the value stored in the wallet remains the same. Therefore, transaction costs will always keep increasing. This isnt sustainable. If I am wrong in my analysis here, please correct me :) ) Therefore as far as I see it, a new long term solution to minning needs to be found. I dont see a future where PoW is sustainable. Therefore, Bitcoin needs to shift to PoS or another system or it will go under.

2. My second point as to a fundamental problem with Bitcoin is the fact that it lacks inflation. Failing to take into consideration has brought the Roman empire to its knees and its actual utility isnt understood by many. A simple illustration of this is the following article:

I have copy pasted 3 important paragraphs from the article to save you the click: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111414/how-can-inflation-be-good-economy.asp

Possible Benefits of Inflation
When the economy is not running at capacity, meaning there is unused labor or resources, inflation theoretically helps increase production. More dollars translates to more spending, which equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production to meet that demand.

Famous British economist John Maynard Keynes believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the ""Paradox of Thrift."" If consumer prices are allowed to fall consistently because the country is becoming too productive, consumers learn to hold off their purchases to wait for a better deal. The net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand, leading to less production, layoffs and a faltering economy.

Inflation also makes it easier on debtors, who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed. This encourages borrowing and lending, which again increases spending on all levels. Perhaps most important to the Federal Reserve is that the U.S. government is the largest debtor in the world, and inflation helps soften the blow of its massive debt.

I would like to hear other peoples take on these two issues. If these arent resolved I dont see Bitcoin surviving the next 5-10 years in my opinion.

financialindependence,Two WSJ Articles: The Rot Beneath Some Index Funds and No Sleeping Giant: Vanguard Grows - Source and Text Inside,"Good morning folks!  A couple of articles to share today.  The first one talks about how you need to be careful when choosing an index fund provider as you could be stuck with a pile of capital gains if they don't have enough incoming money to cash out investors.  The tax hit if you were holding in taxable would be obnoxious.  

The second article is about Vanguard's shareholder meeting (did anybody here go?) in Scottsdale yesterday.  They have **$4.8 TRILLION** in assets now and are piling up money.  I thought the two articles went hand in hand as Vanguard simply pays people redeeming out of their inflow for the most part.

**The Rot That Lies Beneath Some Index Funds**
Index funds are supposed to meet expectations almost exactly — but once in awhile they can hand investors an unpleasant surprise.

These mutual funds and exchange-traded funds passively track the performance of a basket of stocks, bonds or other assets. They seek to match the market, not to beat it. After costs and taxes, they should provide returns almost identical to those of the underlying investments they hold.

Then there is PNC S&amp;P 500 Index Fund.

Next month, PNC has announced, the fund will pay out $4.19 in capital gains per share. This week, the fund’s per-share value was around $19. So, even if you never sold a share, the fund will pay out nearly 22% of your total investment as a taxable gain.
Unless you own it in a retirement account, you’d owe approximately $325 to $515 in federal tax on a $10,000 holding, depending on your tax bracket. That would put something between 3% and 5% of your investment straight into Uncle Sam’s pocket. (To be fair, you would owe proportionately less in future taxes if you sell down the road.)

So, even though the PNC index fund has come within a third of a percentage point of matching the S&amp;P 500’s 17.4% return so far this year, its investors will fall badly behind the market after they pay their taxes.

How can that happen?

In general, when investors exit a fund, it may cash out of some of its holdings, potentially generating a taxable gain that must be paid out to the remaining shareholders.

In recent years, at least, more investors have wanted to buy index funds than sell, tending to make such portfolios unusually tax-efficient. Vanguard 500 Index Fund hasn’t paid out a capital gain since December, 1999, according to Morningstar; State Street Institutional S&amp;P 500 Index Fund hasn’t paid one since December, 2000.

A spokesman for PNC Funds declined to comment.

However, investors withdrew $63 million from the fund, or 38% of its assets, over the 12 months through Sept. 30, Morningstar estimates.

The manager of an index fund doesn’t have much flexibility on which shares to sell when investors want their money back, says Mark Wilson, president of Mile Wealth Management in Irvine, Calif., whose website CapGainsValet.com warns about taxable payouts.

That’s because such a portfolio needs to hold stocks in similar proportions to the index it’s seeking to match. So the manager can’t always sell selected holdings at a loss that would offset gains elsewhere. Instead, he or she has to sell pretty much across the board, which can generate unwanted capital gains.

Launched in early 2000, the $125 million PNC fund tries to match the market, before expenses.
Its prospectus explains that the fund manager may use futures contracts on the index, or various exchange-traded vehicles, “in addition to, or in place of,” the stocks in the S&amp;P 500.

Over the past 10 years, the fund has trailed the S&amp;P 500 by 0.29 percentage points, or a bit less than its average expenses over the period. So it has come close — but only before tax. PNC S&amp;P 500 Index Fund’s 7.2% average annual return over the past decade shrivels to 6.2% after tax, estimates Morningstar.

PNC isn’t the only index fund that doesn’t always behave like its underlying investments. Rydex S&amp;P 500 Fund is a $256 million portfolio that seeks to match the market with swaps, options, futures contracts and other indirect techniques, in addition to the stocks themselves.

So Rydex S&amp;P 500 turns its portfolio over at an annualized rate of 133%, implying that it holds its average investment for, at most, nine months at a time. Most S&amp;P 500 index funds have turnover rates of 5% or less, equivalent to an average holding period of at least 20 years.

The Rydex fund costs between 1.6% and 2.3% annually, the most of any S&amp;P 500 index fund, according to Morningstar. But it tends to underperform the market by a margin even slightly wider than its already distended expenses. In 2016, for instance, it lagged the market by nearly 0.4 percentage points more than its expenses. Extra trading costs money.
Ivy McLemore, a spokesman for Guggenheim Investments, which offers the Rydex funds, says the fund is used by — and most suitable for — short-term traders. It “has performed in line with expectations,” given its expenses, he says.
The word “index” is related to the Latin word for forefinger. Index funds are meant to be indicators. If you own one, it should passively track the performance of a broad basket of stocks, bonds or other assets — and its own returns should indicate, almost exactly, how the underlying investments performed.

If they don’t, something is wrong.

**Vanguard’s 2017 Prediction: A Record $350 Billion In New Cash**

*Vanguard benefiting from shift away from money managers who specialize in handpicking winners*

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.—Vanguard Group quadrupled in size over the last eight years. It is about to get even bigger.

The money management giant is on pace to collect a record one-year total of about $350 billion in investor cash by the end of 2017, Chief Executive F. William McNabb III said in an interview Wednesday following a shareholder meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz. That estimate hasn’t previously been disclosed.

“It’s an extraordinary number,” Mr. McNabb said of money flowing into the firm.

The expected haul, which would exceed Vanguard’s prior record by $27 billion, reinforces an industrywide shift away from money managers who specialize in handpicking winners.

Vanguard has become one of the main beneficiaries of the growing preference by investors for lower-cost, so-called passive funds, which track the performance of indexes. It pioneered the index fund for retail investors 40 years ago.

Vanguard’s outsize heft was a topic of discussion at its Scottsdale meeting Wednesday, the first firmwide gathering for shareholders since 2009. One Vanguard Group shareholder marveled at the wave of new investor cash the money manager has attracted in recent years and asked executives if they are taking any precautions to make sure that success doesn’t go to their heads.

“It is probably the thing we worry most about at Vanguard,” Mr. McNabb told the shareholder. “That success can breed complacency.”

The last time shareholders came together for a firmwide meeting Vanguard’s assets under management were $1.1 trillion and money going into its passively managed funds accounted for about 78% of total net inflows during 2009.

Now its assets are $4.8 trillion and passively managed funds accounted for 91% of inflows through the first 10 months of this year. Net flows into Vanguard funds so far this year accounted for about 51% of total net flows into all U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar Inc.

“We’re a very different company than we were 10 years ago,” Mr. McNabb said in the interview.

Some customers have complained of longer call wait times while Vanguard’s assets ballooned. Mr. McNabb said Wednesday the company has added 1,200 customer service staff members to a 5,000-person team in the last year. The firm’s processing backlog is down and wait times are shorter, according to Mr. McNabb.

“We just didn’t see the continued cash flow” that Vanguard eventually received, he said.

Shareholders in most funds approved six management proposals Wednesday, the company said, including the election of trustees and permission to hire or fire internal managers for the majority of the company’s 195 funds. The proxy vote was the largest ever by a mutual-fund firm, Mr. McNabb told shareholders.

Vanguard reserved a large beige-walled conference room at a Doubletree Resort that was divided by a collapsible wall. The first room had about 300 chairs and a second had additional rows of seating, should more clients than expected attend. It turns out the extra room wasn’t needed, as 205 shareholders showed up.

Customers made their way gradually to seats and filed one-by-one to microphones on either side of the conference room to ask questions. Executives answered from wooden chairs on a stage with a curtain behind them lighted with red light.

Retired insurance industry executive Robert Hestekind, 78, arrived from Northeast Mesa, Ariz., to learn more about the proposals for which the money manager sought shareholder approval and get a glimpse of Vanguard’s founder.

“I was hoping maybe we’d get to see Jack Bogle, ” he said. “He’s as big as Warren Buffett in my estimation.”

But Mr. Bogle, 88, who founded Vanguard in 1975, wasn’t in attendance at Vanguard’s meeting. Mr. Bogle received an ovation at this year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, where Berkshire Chief Warren Buffett said the Vanguard founder “has probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country.”

One Vanguard Group shareholder asked executives on stage at the meeting if the company’s mutual structure might change. Mr. McNabb’s reply: “The short answer is no.”

Mortimer J. “Tim” Buckley, who is set to succeed Mr. McNabb in January, chimed in, too. “I’ll second that,” Mr. Buckley said.

Mr. McNabb said the structure, in which the firm is owned by its fund shareholders, is “the single biggest source of our distinct advantage.” He credited Mr. Bogle for setting up the company that way.

Tom Kenney, a retiree who lives near Phoenix and used to work in advertising, came to the meeting to hear Vanguard’s view of financial markets. “It’s been going up and up and up,” Mr. Kenney said of markets, wondering when it might start to go “down, down, down.”

gaming,"To EA, Battlefront 2 was the last straw. Some of us knew about the exploitation and predation. Thank you for generating enough outrage to spread awareness to the masses.","For several years reddit has known about the predatory and exploitive nature of microtransactions. We've even seen the deterioration of trust in regards to pre-orders. Once upon a time I had no problem preordering upcoming games because I had full faith that the developers were passionately trying to deliver an experience they would be proud of. Since then we've seen a systemic disregard for quality and excellence that has given way to a thinly veiled, mass marketing driven cash grab. At first we had sympathy for the developers, it was easy to blame the corporate suits for cutting budgets and releasing products on shortened deadlines. But, as with any power hungry or greedy entity willing to act without conscience, they grew endlessly bolder.  Simply because we are individuals with no common banner we have allowed the feduciary contract to slip, and it has slipped, but never in our favor. There was a time when we could implicitly expect a game to be a complete self contained experience for a fair price. Over time, hope, anticipation, excitement and our own interest in gaining an advantage over our peers has fueled the erosion. Games slowly devolved from polished ""Gold"" disk, cartridge and CD releases to requiring day 1 patches (a safety net for a lack of testing provided by the internet). From day 1 patches eventually games were released missing actual content or functionality, when we balked, big developers jumped on the early access train - something that only independent developers actually need. But why get investment and take on responsibility when you can gamble with consumers money?

Content has also eroded. Gone are the days of a full, satisfying, complete game that wants for no further content. When DLC first hit the scene it allowed us to see over the horizon and further enjoy worlds we grew attached to. Developers poured all of their ideas into a game, and only once it was completed did they step back and think, wouldn't it be great if we could expand this area? Somewhere along the line DLC went from being a separate addendum to a completed work and instead split the first story into installments or separate pieces. Less for more. When we only reacted mildly, dlc turned into season passes, double the cost for your original game. Season passes weren't enough. Clearly we are leaving money on the table as some people are willing to spend thousands. Thus DLC gave way to microtransactions. The wonderful world of legalized, potentially underage, gambling and psychological exploitation of inherent human addictive behavior full stop. The microtransactions in Call of Duty struck me as absurd when they first came out. I hadn't been on the CS:GO skin train. The next step is to give actual in game advantage to whales and big spenders. If we let this continue we will indeed see a game before long that opens for preorders with bundles up to $500, is released as early access, has micro-transactions that lock all of the best features, gives advantage to those willing to pay and takes some as of yet unforseen unbelievably exploitative step further.

So for now, I want to sincerely thank EA. Thank you for taking one step too far, too fast. I hope, and will do everything in my power to ensure, that the rubber band snaps and we return to a place where we are not exploited during the very time we seek reprieve from our stressful lives. Long live PCMR, Long Live Consoles, Long Live Gamers.

Edit: Gold? It's because I included PCMR and Consoles in the closing statement isn't it?

EDIT 2: Several people have responded with arguments concerning how this will hardly impact sales numbers and how EA just won't care or change. This is absolutely correct. A small minority of us will not force a counter-financial change in a multi-billion dollar industry. And anger directed at EA will not help, they just happen to be the best at what they do. This is a much bigger issue affecting the entire gaming industry. While there are several alarming points we could make, one stands out:  **What we have learned to call pay to win, loot crates, skin lotteries, etc (as a functioning adult who may or may not have the money to ride said train), is actually a generation of young gamers who are being groomed to feed a compulsive gambling addiction in an unregulated market segment - well before they understand the value of money**. That message is what can go viral, engage parents and news outlets in one pithy headline, and create a sweeping change in the market. Once that ball is rolling, it will again be up to us to push it on every front where we have lost ground.

personalfinance,"(AT) complete financial breakdown, how did that happen?","Hey Guys.

Welcome to my post, where I would like to share my absurd personal situation with you, of which I still can´t believe of being the main person in it. 

I am 29 years old. Born in Germany into a turkish workers family. We have never had much money, but we always figured it out to live a comfy life. Well, my parents did. 

The most important thing my sister and me were thought by our parents was: No one will feed you in future! You have to work hard to achieve things. Nothing will be for free in this life.

I adapted this way of thinking. But I just wasn´t a good student. Grades didn´t really matter to me, it was just a random figure. However, I could make the most important step into the working world, my apprenticeship, in Germany called ""Ausbildung"". Without this, you won´t be able to get ANY Job in Germany. 
I was really succesfull and motivated, and I had good results, even in the ""Berufsschule"", a school where you go 2 times a week to learn the theoretical aspect of your profession.
My Boss even asked me after finishing the apprenticeship to go abroad to Austria and Manage the Branch there.
Hell yeah! I felt so bossy! 19 years old. Successfull, rent paid by the company, a shitty car, also paid by the company, cell phone, also paid by the company, young and adult with no responsibilities. 
Sounds great right? Yeah... I thought so too.

It turned out the Job in Vienna was just cleaning the shit the other ones did before me and it was the plan of the management to clean up the shit a bit, before giving the branch the mercy shock and disappear from the country.... but I stayed in Vienna.
I earned average money, but I could not manage it. In this time, as I had no responsibilities to care about I just spent my money everywhere.

The branch closed and I was looking for a new Job, bad company, bad money, but I wanted to stay in town, so I took the Job. After 6 Months I was asked to go to work with a friend, I accepted and they fired me 3 Months later. 

Jobless again, no money in my pocket. I was fed up with that shit and decided to study. During the time of my studies (4years), I never had much money, but I studied in the evening courses and went working full time. It was just enough. I was in debt, a lot of it. The bank wanted Money, I could not pay the rent and other things. It was the beginning of my financial Chaos.
I just did not pay bills because I did not know how, so I ignored them. Ignoring bills: Good Idea man! 
So dept grew and grew and grew and grew. 
I also had a boyfriend who was not very much into disciplin and paying things (bartender, alcoholic, sorry but true!)
Finally I finished my studies and worked as a Consultant, and I really worked my ass off. I earned not really much, but it was quite ok to live with it.... still, there were the unpaid bills I ignored, because I didn´t have money. So they started to impound me. One after the other. Almost a half of my salary was impounded.
I was so disappointed of myself, how was that even possible? Why didn´t I pay, why did I let it go so far. And how should I survive AGAIN? I worked harder and harder, I paid about 10k back, I was almost free. Suddenly, my boss fired me once he noticed that letters of the impound reached him. I was jobless, again.
The debt I was in reached an amount of about EUR 20k.

Meanwhile, I found a new boyfriend. We are still together, and I really love him.

I worked again and paid a lot of it, I found a new Job, it was a mistake to take it but the money was good. They fired me at this job again, even though I was succesfull. 

I was so fed up of the jobs. I felt like my personality does not fit into an office.
I started to make my dream come true. I wanted to become a psychotherapist. My boyfriend encouraged me to start it too. He believes in me. So I started it and paid a shitload of money for it already. EUR 5000 even though I was unemployed.

I just trusted my boyfriend too much. It seems like I tend to rely on others when I am in a relationship and stop caring about my personal situation.

Things started all over again. Debt in the bank grew and grew, other letters from debts I didn´t now came in (cell phone bill of my ex) and so on. My boyfriend helped me out with money, even his uncle did, with a lot of money. I promised to pay it back.

I started a new Job at an Airline, because I thought it´d be great to have benefits to buy tickets for holidays a lot cheaper. They fired me, even though I was great in my Job, but ""your direct personality does not fit in here"".
That was not the first time I hear this. 
I applied for another department, they refused me. Your personality does not fit in here, they said, again. I am too less pragmatic in their point of view.

Yesterday, my boyfriend came home after work. He told me, that he can ´t do this anymore. He thinks, it´d be better to leave me. I dont need to give him or his uncle the money back, but under this circumstances, it might be better to break up.

My whole world crashed. I am so deeply broken. Even though I heard all my life ""you are a very intelligent person"" ""you are the strongest person I have ever met"" and things like that, I feel like, I have no right to be in this world with my personality. It just doesn´t fit into a working place obviously. 
My boyfriend told me yesterday, that I have a very direct way to speak and that frightens the people. My sister told me, I am too confident in my way of acting so the others don´t like me.
I just don´t know how to manage all the things. 
I have no disciplin when it comes to money.
I have (obviously) no disciplin to make a job.
It seems like, I have a very high grade of education, but a very very low grade of selfawareness and self responsibility.

I am clueless and I dont really know what to do.",finance

personalfinance,"Refinancing my student loans, including trying to refinance my federal loans in with my private loans?","So I was just digging through all of my accounts and making some payment adjustments. I haven't been reading through them in a while. Over the past year and a half or so, I've really been working on getting my life and credit in order.

I paid off a loan, paid off some credit cards, bought a house, got a raise at my job and more. My credit score has increased ten fold because of all of these things.

So when I took a look at my student loans this morning, I was really put off when I saw my interest rates.

My private loan has about $41k left on it with an interest rate of 7.75%!! (this seems crazy high to me.)

My federal loan has about $20k left on it with an interest rate of 6.5%.

Banking,Help With Business Overdraft,"I would like to use my overdraft to my stock for my business, the value would be £2000. My only issue is, I'm not exactly sure, due to cash flow, when I would be able to pay this back. So would it be suitable to use?

The overdraft terms are as follows:

""You can apply for a business overdraft with a Start-up Business Current Account and borrow from £500 to £25,000 (subject to acceptance). There is an arranged overdraft annual fee of 1% of the agreed overdraft (minimum fee £50). The arranged overdraft interest rate and representative rate is 5.25% EAR (variable). (Bank of England base rate plus 5%) and the unarranged overdraft interest rate is 25.25% EAR (variable) (Bank of England base rate plus 25%). The unpaid item fee is £15. For more information, see Business Overdrafts.""

Basically, could someone explain how this works. For example; if I did use 2000 of the overdraft, would I have to pay it back immediately, or is the 5.25% interest rate yearly, so if I didn't pay it back until a year later i'd pay around £2100 back?

She asked me for advice and I want to point her in the right direction. Here’s the details:

She is a full-time student who only worked a work-study job (not taxable) and had over $15,000 in qualified education expenses for the year on her 1098-T. Both of her parents are deceased and she lived on campus for most of the year. She also paid over 50% of her expenses, so she does qualify as an independent. 

One of her family members gave her shitty advice and told her not to file at all because she had no taxable income. Because she didn’t file, she missed out on both federal and state education tax credits that she is qualified for. 

Is it too late for her to file a late return, and if she is still able to, how would she go about filing it?

personalfinance,Freddie Mac Appraisal Waiver,"Hi everyone,

Hoping to get some experiences from others here.

Two years ago, I bought a home for $280,000 with 5% down. Our mortgage includes $119.70 in monthly PMI, and our regular interest rate is 3.875%. 

Since buying, we have put in around $25,000 in upgrades (water treatment system, new front door, central air conditioning, upgraded electrical service panel, landscaping, water well pressure management system, among other things), and comps in the area have risen as well. I believe a reasonable valuation of the property today is around $315,000. We currently owe $252,000 on the property (conveniently 80% LTV based on what I believe the property to be valued).

Worth noting, we originally bid $305,000 on the property before being protected by a low appraisal.

In any event, I am in contact with a lender about potentially refinancing at 3.75%, no-PMI. Since I am not certain about the value of the home, I don't want to pay for an appraisal that may wind up coming up short of what we'd need to get to our 80% LTV. When I told my lending agent this, he mentioned a relatively new Freddie Mac option of getting an appraisal waiver (free, instead of the $695 that the lender would charge for their own appraiser).

My question: Has anyone used this appraisal waiver? What has the experience been like? Am I likely to have a favorable outcome (assuming I made reasonable estimates)? I am pursuing the option (without giving the lender permission to do a hard credit pull before knowing whether the $315k valuation would be accepted) but don't really know what to expect.

Thanks in advance.",finance

I have been considering CDs because that's the only thing I know about.  Can someone please help guide me to learn/figure out what to do to help grow my net worth?

I've been too overwhelmed by trying to figure out what to do with it for the past couple years; so I haven't done anything.  I just found out about reddit/personal finance and was hoping you all could help guide me.  Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Is it better to put money against mortgage or invest it?,"I’m trying to understand some factors that I should be considering when helping my mother figure out some finances. Currently she is 74 years old, has roughly $225k left on the mortgage at rate of 4.75% over 13 years. At this age, she is taking the required minimum distributions from various IRA accounts of roughly 15k-20k a year. Instead of this money sitting in a savings/checking account earning 1-2% at best, would it be wise to put that against the mortgage to help reduce the principal? 

In short, what factors should we consider when choosing where to apply this RMD? Should it be invested in something, applied to the mortgage, tossed in bonds?

personalfinance,"70K in debt, 60K in income, coming out negative each month. Help!","We are embarrassingly new to really looking into our finances, and I'm trying to get some ideas for how we can fix things.  It's me, my spouse and our 10 month old, with a (surprise) #2 on the way due in April. Below are all the gritty details in a monthly format.

**Work:** I work full-time and DH is a SAHD who does 15-25hr/wk of Uber/Lyft. I just got a new job/promotion in August, and I can't make any career moves until after this baby pops out.

Income (Net): 5,141.44


**Fixed Expenses:** 

Rent: $975 (1br house in metro area in MN)

Utilities: $186 (electricity, gas, water)

Cell Phones: $94

Internet: $65

*Total: $1,161*


**Cars:** I drive 15 miles (~40 minutes) to work, and DH uses car for Uber/Lyft. Both are set to be paid off by March 2019.

2005 Toyota 4Runner: $450 ($6,052 remaining, 3.49% interest)

2209 Hyundai Sonata: $158 ($5,649 remaining, 3.49% interest)

*Total: $608*


**Student Loans:** Those that could be consolidated have been, and we are paying minimum payments for all of them.

1: $460 (30,711 remaining, 6% interest)

2: $186 (13,984 remaining,mixed interest rate: 8.74 and 11.24) 

3: $137 (7,034 remaining, 3.7% interest)

4: $53   (2,230 remaining, 6.8% interest)

*Total: $836*


**Other Debts:** The hospital bill will be paid off right before #2 comes along, so we'll have to start paying another hospital bill within 3 months. I'm thinking we'll try to stretch it out next time so we can have lower payments.

Hospital (baby): $529 ($2,116 remaining, 0% interest)

CC (just 1): $81 (4,701 remaining, 12% interest)

*Total: $610*


**Spending/Budget:** Trying to keep it very high level. We cut our spending by 30% in October, and for this month we are trying to trim another 20%. The below number reflect our current goal budget for this month.

Gas/Oil/car: $510

Groceries/Household items: $820

Other/Miscellaneous (hobbies, clothing replacement, eating out, etc):  $623


**Saving**: We've got nothing. We blew through all of our savings with baby #1. Ideally, we want to be putting at least $250 towards our savings and $250 towards our CC per month, but we're currently living paycheck to paycheck.


Basically looking for guidance/ideas. Even taking out all the ""non-necessary"" spending, we are still coming out negative when you add in wanting to put money into savings. So far we've talk about moving, exploring the possibilities of moving in with roommates or just trying to find a cheaper place. However, our current house is really 1.5 bedrooms, and I think we're going to need it for when #2 gets here. I can't finding anything that saves us more than $200/mo by moving in with people, and we'd end up paying more trying to find any place that is 2 bedrooms.


We've also talked about moving down to 1 car, but I don't think we could sell either of our cars for more than the remaining balance on their loans. We've put a lot of wear and tear on both of them (the Sonata from Uber/Lyft, the 4Runner from us being in a band in a former life and traveling significantly with a trailer).


Anything else? I don't really know anything about this kind of stuff. TIA!!",finance
personalfinance,"Where to put $100k, FDIC insured. 88 Years Old.","This is for my 88-year-old mom.  

She has a bunch of money from selling her big house and buying a smaller less expensive one.  At her age, the biggest thing she's concerned about is keeping her principle safe, but she also wants to earn as much interest as possible.  She has many other investments, but this particular $100k she wants in something absolutely risk-free.  The other issue is that she's convinced interest rates will be going up, so she doesn't want to tie the money up for very long.

She recently opened a $100k 11-month ""no penalty"" CD at CIT Bank, which is paying 1.55%.

Is there reason not to open a second account at CIT with the same terms?  What other/better FDIC-insured product can you suggest for her?  Do you agree with her that rates will go up soon enough and high enough that opening 5-year CD's is a mistake?

Battlefield One - sucks (witness the player number collapse since launch)

Bitcoin,Help me understand Bitcoin as a currency?,"Hi! I'm a guy with an economics background and relevant to that are a couple of things about Bitcoin that I don't quite understand. But luckily, at a community like this, I have a chance to ask the people who know Bitcoin most intimately.

I don't question Bitcoin's value as a high-risk/high-reward investment. I definitely understand that value and Bitcoin represents a small part of my portfolio as a result.

My questions are regarding Bitcoin's potential as a currency.


&amp;nbsp;

1) I've noticed that the Bitcoin community takes great pride in Bitcoin being a sharply deflationary currency. Indeed, this is what makes it such an interesting investment! We've all seen the stories like, ""this guy bought a pizza for x amount of Bitcoin, now that pizza would be worth x bazillion dollars!""

But with this being the case, why would anyone ever spend Bitcoin? With a deflationary currency (as opposed to an inflationary one, like the US dollar) the incentive is always to ""HODL,"" not to actually spend it. After all, who wants to be the sucker that spent a million dollars on a pizza? Perhaps I'm missing something here.


&amp;nbsp;

2) Similarly, let's fast forward to a world in which Bitcoin is the dominant currency. This is the goal, as I understand it. If this happens, then debts too will be denominated in Bitcoin. Most (but not all) debts are arranged as fixed amounts. 

If Bitcoin is going to continue to err on the side of being deflationary, couldn't this be a problem? Imagine if you had $75,000 in student debt, and the next year it was up to $100,000. This could make debts very difficult to pay off if we lived in a world with a decentralized deflationary currency. Again, am I perhaps missing something here?


&amp;nbsp;

3) Putting aside the deflationary aspect for a moment, a major appeal about Bitcoin is the fact that it is decentralized. And I can definitely understand the value in this. Anonymity, privacy, etc. are definitely of value in a free and open world. 

But is there any concern about the potential implications of having no central authority? 

In the 1970s, the US was faced with stagflation due to an oil crisis. This issue spiraled worse and worse. Eventually, what killed the crisis was Paul Volcker (Chair of the Fed) intentionally putting the US into a small dip/recession to kill the spiral, and then swiftly bringing things back to normal. Essentially, the Fed ""turned the economy off and on again"" - and it worked.

Let's say in the 70's everything, including oil, had been denominated in Bitcoin. How might we have resolved this crisis?

Or, just more broadly speaking, in a world in which Bitcoin is the dominating currency, what steps can we take to fix severe deflationary or inflationary crises?

Thanks in advance for y'all's help in aiding my understanding of Bitcoin!",cryptocurrency

gaming,Why I am going to stop buying AAA Games.,"These past 2 years have been the biggest AAA shit hole I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Most AAA titles have been garbage or micro transaction filled shells of games. The only AAA publishers I can give any credit to are Nintendo and Bethesada. While the ladder has had their fair share of stupid decisions (creation club cough cough) it is minute in comparison to the bullshit that has happened to games recently. There's no heart, no care, all profit. Games no longer care about being games, they care about being money printers. Games like Destiny 2, Battlefront 2, Overwatch, and more have proven this to me. I haven't bought a AAA title this year that wasn't from the above 2 companies, because the rest of the industry is a shit hole.

ethereum,All my Ethereum stolen out of my wallet **UPDATE** My Thank You Letter,"First off, I'd like to thank everyone who worked with me yesterday to help me with the loss of my BTC and ETH.  I learned a lot through conversations with many of you and I can't thank you guys enough.  

In the wake of all this madness, a kind redditor reached out to me in a private message offering to reimburse the ETH I had lost, so long as I beefed up my own security.  We exchanged back and forth for a while, discussing better security measures and new options for storing my coins.  He was kind of enough to share his own knowledge and experience with me and I was happy to listen.  Whether or not he intended to actually help me recover my losses, and to what extent, was somewhat unimportant as I obviously had much to learn.  Ultimately, he generously gifted me nearly **all** of the money I had lost.  

I was blown away to say the least and don't ever recall a stranger showing me so much kindness.  I'd like to publicly thank this redditor (who has asked that he remain anonymous for good reason) for not only gifting me the coins I lost, but for educating me while restoring just a bit of my faith in humanity.  Something I think we'll all pretty short on these days.  

This experience has shown that everyone is prone to error and that you can never be too careful.  But it has also shown me that every once in a while, strangers tend to show some kindness to others.  Additionally, it has reaffirmed my belief that it is always the best course of action to admit fault in an attempt to learn from your experience.  Pretending you did nothing wrong *only makes things worse.*  I intend to build upon this experience and sincerely hope that I can do the same thing for someone, someday.  I am very excited about the cryptocurrency space as a whole and fully plan on becoming as involved as possible.  However, without the help of the community, I would have been totally lost.  Now, I can take this experience and share it with others to prevent future things like this from happening.  

That being said, if anyone who comes across this thread is curious about BTG (BitcoinGold) please be extremely careful about your information.  **Never** give out your personal seed for your wallet!  I know that should be obvious but anyone can be fooled.

Thanks again everyone, you've all been a huge help! Also, shoutout to /u/jprichardson (Exodus Co-Founder) for showing up and helping figure out the source of the hack.

**TL;DR**: I lost a significant amount of money in a hack and a kind redditor reimbursed me for my losses.

Edit: This is for those who are asking how the attack was carried out and what mistakes I made. (Mostly copy pasta from the other thread)

&gt; While it makes me feel like a dumbass, I did attempt to check MyBTGWallet as I was curious about BTG and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. Initially, I went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, I seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. So, I clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as I was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, I tried to assure myself it was legit. It displayed a valid SSL Certificate at the time of my visiting so I decided I would proceed. Unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. I'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. I guess I'm a little new and didn't think much of it when I was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? But the valid SSL had me fooled. I will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. However, I do think BTG and MyBTGWallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault.

/u/jprichardson expands more on in detail as to how this happened here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpwphw5/

As for safer practices.  I've ordered a hardware wallet and plan to store all of my coins on there from now on.  In the meantime, I've enabled 2FA on just about everything I own.  (Email, Facebook, etc.)  I moved all of my coins off of my desktop as many of you have recommended; as they apparently exhibit more vulnerabilities than other options.  I've also locked away all of my keys in a much safer, password-protected place, but plan to move all of those offline as soon as my new wallet arrives.  I've also reset my Google Chrome settings, deleted any saved passwords that might carry over to anything important, and cleared cookies, history etc. as well as changed all of my passwords to make them much more secure. 

As for advice from the anonymous donor.  Here are some of the things he shared with me.

* He advised that even with a hardware wallet, malware can intercept transactions and change the destination address before it goes into your wallet, so exercise extreme caution when making transactions and try and make them from a *clean* system ~~is~~ if you have access to one. 
* Exercise caution if you are a miner and try not to store any of your coins on said mining rig as they can be easy targets for malware.  If possible, use separate machines for trading, storing, and mining. Another option for this is to create a virtual machine where software is segregated -or- even consider swapping out HDDs (possibly one with Linux instead of Windows) to to trading operations.
* Double check that the address has not been changed in your clipboard by pasting it elsewhere before initiating your transactions.
* Minimize the amount of software on the computer you are doing your trading on to reduce risk of infection.  In addition, use a clean browser with no extensions (except for Metamask which apparently protects against phishing attacks).

personalfinance,"25 with a new job. Looking into buying a home, but not exactly sure what I can afford.","25 and just got a new job that pays 48k. I have another little side job that makes abt 3k a year.

My last job made 28k. With this new income I thought it be wise to take advantage of interest rates coming up from rock bottom.

I've tried my best to figure what I can afford and just want to run it by and see if anyone has some advice...

My current monthly expenditures (without rent;  I'm also estimating on the high side) are:

Internet: 70
Electric: 200
Phone: 35
My dog and his health related costs: 100
Misc subscriptions: 40
Car ins.: 120
Health ins: 0 (through work)

Total: about 1200

Houses in my area go for about 120-160 a sq. ft.

Because I'm young with a new income, I haven't saved for a down payment yet... I do have good credit score though (750). My bank offers a loan that doesn't require a down payment, but is about 5% interest rather than 4%. The cool thing is that I wouldn't have to pay a PMI premium with my bank. Saving some money there.

I've estimated that I could afford up to about 180 or 190k on the high end. That translates to about 950-1050 a month with home insurance. In my area there are very nice houses in that range. Does anyone have any possible advice, with this context, that could convince I can afford more or less house?

We have enough saved to cover 15% downpayment, closing costs, moving costs, etc.  I will have to wait a while before replacing floors and redoing the kitchen if I go this route.

If I put 10% down, that frees up another $10,000 that could be partially allocated towards those repairs.  My wife really wants to get them out of the way, and I know it would add value to the house, but I've always been told to try to put 20% down to gain more equity in the house to avoid being underwater.

For reference, the interest rate and will be the same either way.  PMI will be really minimal due to our credit and assets, and really isn't a big factor.  Minimum payments will be the same either way, and we plan to use a 30 year loan and pay above the minimum payment when we are able to.  We have our reasons for not doing a 15 year loan, but it's mainly to keep the minimum payment lower so that we have the security of a lower payment if things go south with one of our jobs.  I realize we will pay more interest this way, but that's not the question!

Unfortunately, the lists for the Virtual Boy and the Game Gear are borked by these rules because so few games received 100+ votes. For the Atari systems beyond the original, none had any games with enough votes, so they are excluded as a whole. Also, for the PC list, games that are not yet to ""1.0"" status are not considered (so *I Wanna Be the Guy* and *Dwarf Fortress* are excluded).

Also, a three-out-of-five difficulty rating is considered ""Just Right"". As such, I've included the games from each system that meet or come closest to that designation, to give an idea of what the users consider the ""right"" amount of difficulty.

personalfinance,Credit Card instead of Debit Card,"Ok, so a little background: 26y/o graduating from university in May, job lined up pending federal budget (forest service), 3k credit card balance and of course student loans that I will worry about closer to graduation. I work part time in a bar and make $200-400 every other week. Credit score in the mid 600s. My question is would it be wise to start putting my full paycheck on my credit card and use that instead of my debit card while not spending my entire paycheck before the next one? It will take discipline (historically not my strongest attribute financially) but I want to graduate with less credit card debt and possibly a higher credit score. Also I should note that I could live pretty much off my tips, not pay rent and all that but buy groceries and gas and stuff like that. Eventually I want to start investing and saving and stuff like that but I don’t really know how to start all that and I feel like my financial situation would need to change before I can think about that. I am just looking for some tips on how to set myself up a little better after graduation and I have loans and look into buying a house, getting married etc.",finance

I have a rough plan.. I could do this and then get financial aid and maybe pay it off like that, Or I’ve been trying to save and with like 5 pay checks and $0 going toward really anything else I guess I could pay it off.. it really doesn’t sound too bad, but i don’t want to throw myself down a rabbit hole because I️ feel like I’m also trying to make this sound better than it is. Honestly Getting a loan from my bank sounds awful AND the interest rate is like 18% and goes up if you don’t pay a specific amount. Am i crazy for wanting to throw it on a credit card? 

EDIT: okay so within the hour the few people that have commented on this i think saved me already from making a large mistake. So i want to say thank you. I️ know to you reading it may seem silly but with all the money stuff that’s been thrown at me and things coming from people who apparently know more than i do about money made me feel small and inferior and start believing things i shouldn’t, so coming here and seeing what other people with an outside perspective and little info had to say just made me feel like i had options.

gaming,#STAYONTARGET: What our next moves should be.,"We know that EA is trying to save face and back peddle on the topic of loot crates. We all know that they made that statement nebulous so they can implement a new iteration of micro-transactions into the game. The issue here is we cannot let them take an inch.

Think of this like the problems we had at the beginning of the mobile gaming age. We have young kids, with no impulse control, buying shiny things with money, whether earned or bought with parents money, that could have been spent on another full game. Even if they bring it back and make it about Star Cards, Boosts, and Skins, the kids with no impulse control are still going to put money into it because they want it to look cool. 

This isn't ok. The game is a full $60 USD, why do I or anyone else, need to spend more money to unlock content that is already in the game? 

Understand, I come from the Elite: Dangerous Community. That game does have microtransactions, but for a reason. See the game is still in development and is made by a small team and they need to pay their staff in order to keep development going. Comparing Frontier to EA is like comparing Apples to Oranges. Frontier is a newer company, selling their games at low price points in order to make the barrier to entry easier for new people to get in. They kickstarted Elite: Dangerous and had to fight with both Star Citizen and No Mans Sky in order to get a player base. They built their community from the ground up. All of this while trying to keep their employees paid. The microtransactions for Livery is essential to keeping themselves alive since after you pay for the game, you won't need to pay again for any other content (except for Horizons, but even with both the base game and the Season 2 Expansion it is the same price as Battlefront 2). 

Compare that to EA and Battlefront 2. They were already established in the gaming scene, they have teams of hundreds making games with large licenses, with a large amount of cash in the bank. They are the ONLY PEOPLE ALLOWED TO MAKE STARWARS GAMES in other words they have no other competition. They have the backing of Disney who can give them tons of money in order to make anything happen, and does not need to pull start capital from the playerbase. 

As you can see, there is no reason for EA to ask us for more money in order to access the game. They are purely doing it for cash, and if we are already paying $60 for a game being made by a company who is already well established and also happens to have the only service for PC that could come close to competing with the powerhouse that is Steam. If this isn't predatory, I have no idea what is. 

So now they backtracked, what do we do? Here is the plan I am suggesting: Ratchet up the pressure on EA, and the dominoes will fall. If we can boycott this game until we are assured that we will never see microtransactions and Loot Crates in any EA Game again we can send a message to all other major publishers and Devs that we are fed up with this. 

We need to start here with EA, exposing to all uninformed parents and children this Christmas that this game is setting a dangerous precedent when it comes to how a major publisher views their customers. Share posts about this topic with the #STAYONTARGET and #DontLetEAWin. Uninstall all EA Games from both Origin (and while you are at it, dump that too) and Steam. Talk with your family about this directly especially the parents and grandparents and show them examples of this and show them while it is bad. 

Now if we do not get a complete reversal from EA about the microtransactions in BF2, we need to take it higher then EA. We need to bring the pressure on Disney. I know this sounds extreme, but if we can hurt their pocketbooks, they may bring the hammer down on EA and DICE. Start with this Deadline: December 15th. If by then we don't get the reversal, we boycott the movie. Don't see it. Don't get tickets. Don't go at a later date. Talk people out of going to the movie if you can. Don't buy the merch, even if you have family that wants it. That includes any licensed Star Wars merch. No Toys. Nothing. Send Emails to Disney and EA about this issue. 

If we can bring the pressure on EA, I think we will see the end of these practices. We are so close to doing it, and we cannot let up. We must stay angry and passionate about this. DONT LET THEM WIN!",technology

personalfinance,What should I do about this old (6 years) debt?,"Back in 2011, I was under-employed for several months and got behind on some credit card payments. One card ended up being charged off, with a balance of $2560. I never did pay it, haven't heard from the bank in 3-4 years now, and was under the impression that it would fall off my credit report next year. 

Yesterday I got a letter from the bank offering several options to settle the debt for less than the original amount. I don't know why they'd be contacting me now, after so many years of silence. I'm wondering if the clock was somehow reset on the statute of limitations (I've had no contact with them, but recently did log into the website for unrelated reasons). If I call them, will that reset the clock? What about if I take the settlement?

If this is going to fall off my credit soon anyway, I'd prefer to just let it go, as money is tight and it would be difficult to add another payment. But if not, I'll go ahead and take the settlement offer.

In case it matters, the bank is Navy Federal Credit Union, and the account never went to an outside collection agency. And I'm in NC.",finance

stocks,Is this a mistake in the book Money by Tony Roobins?,"It first says this: 
""How about stocks? They too perform well during
inflation. With inflation comes rising prices. Higher
prices mean that companies have the opportunity to
make more money. And rising revenues mean growth in
stock prices. This has proven true over time.

Bonds are a different animal. Take US Treasury
bonds, for example. If we have a season of deflation,
which is accompanied by falling interest rates, bond
prices will rise.""

Then it however shows us this:
https://i.imgur.com/i6RG7Gm.png

Is that not contradicting? First it says stocks rise in times of inflation, but then the chart shows us that stocks rise in times of falling inflation (deflation). 

And then the bonds: it says that bond prices rise in times of deflation, yet the chart shows us nothing about bonds when looking at ""Falling Inflation"".

personalfinance,Buying your first home with less than 20%,"Hi PF,

To start, I am a 24 year old male, fully employed making $36,000 per year before taxes. I am currently living at home and have been since I graduated. I made this decision for a number of reasons, but mainly to avoid paying rent costs that likely exceed a potential mortgage payment. A rough estimate would say that the average cost for a 1br/1ba apartment in my area is around $850 per month, not including utilities, and the average 3br/1ba home in my area rents for around $1,250 month, not including utilities.  

I have not done as good of a job saving for a mortgage as I should have, but my current assets/liabilities include: ~$15,000 in cash with the ability to aggressively save, $306/month car payment, $335/month Fed loan, $230/month Sallie Mae, and obviously insurance/food/gas/cell phone/leisure/etc. I am lucky enough to not have to pay for rent/utilities at this moment.  

I am not being forced, but kind of in a situation where I need to start looking at my options to get on my own. So my question(s) are: **If I put down less than 20% (say I put down 5% of my budget of $100,000), is it worth it to take the remaining cash I have and invest it in the market to try and make up for the difference, or should I use as much cash as possible for a down payment?** Do I have the wrong understanding of this process? Also, while I'm here, **is it even feasible to move out making $36,000 per year?** I have more questions, but let's start here and see where it goes.",finance

personalfinance,How can I drop PMI on my FHA loan?,"I bought my house using an FHA loan back in 2012. Next month marks 5 years of payments on the loan. I was under the impression that after 5 years of payments, I would be able to drop PMI. After calling my bank (Chase) about it, this is not the case.

The bank informed my that I must be below 80% loan to value ratio in order to cancel PMI. The value is based on the original loan value and not the current appraised value like I had hoped. The bank said that they cannot use a current appraisal because of a HUD rule (can someone confirm this?) At this rate I would need to continue PMI payments through 2021. 

What are the best options to get rid of PMI in my case? I have been cold called by a mortgage lender in the past asking me if I wanted to refinance into 2 separate loans, but I didn't go that route thinking that PMI would drop off at the end of this year.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin and altcoin prices: The importance of inflation,"I wonder if there is anyone who has been immersed in cryptocurrencies for any length of time who IS NOT UTTERLY SURPRISED that one Bitcoin is now selling for around $7900, at current prices around 6.16 times one ounce of gold. You show me someone who genuinely predicted Bitcoin's meteoric rise, and I'll show you a boaster or a liar. Sure lots of people, Roger Ver, et cetera, predicted a rise. But not the magnitude, and I'm not talking about all those out declaring to-the-moon quotes to get a soundbyte and their name in the newspaper.

Personally, I have been very surprised. But maybe if I was smarter, I would not have been. When Bitcoin first overtook gold in price, I was floored - whatttt? went my brain. But maybe again that was just me being dumb. 

Some people think there are about 150,000 tons of total gold in the world, which would mean there are about 4 billion, 374 million, 990 thousand ounces of gold in existence. But others think there are 2.5 million tons of gold in the world, which would mean there are about 72 billion, 915 million ounces of gold.
 
And so when I think of the supply of gold, which is universally considered a very rare and valuable item, should I have been surprised when Bitcoin, of which there will ever only be 21 million, surpassed gold in price? And that's without thinking of fiat currencies, like the US dollars which I understand are so plentiful or infinite in number that the Treasury and Federal Reserve tend to give them out for free to any and all polite bankers that come asking. 

What has dawned on me over time is that there is clearly demand for cryptographic currencies, and that the cryptocurrencies that have, and will continue to, rise fastest in price are those with the most limited supply. It has struck me that the free-money responses of all the central banks since the GFC of 2008 have fundamentally changed the way people view fiat money, and fundamentally broken their confidence in it. And not just this, but that the solution offered by one Satoshi Nakamoto of a distributedly verified digital currency with a limited and fixed total number of units is viewed by many as a better alternative, and one that given even modest demand from early adopters and technology enthusiasts has over time risen exponentially in price.

It led me to thinking, what is the real funny-money here? Is it Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, derided by the Jamie Dimon's, the Warren Buffet's, the heroes of the old financial order? Or is it in fact the case that it is the fiat currencies, the US Dollars, the Pounds Sterling, the Yen that are the real funny-money? My personal view is that all major floating fiat currencies are now fundamentally suspect, especially those issued by countries with small central bank gold reserves, but frankly given their sheer excess of supply all of them.

That is not to say all cryptocurrencies will succeed. But I fundamentally believe some certainly will, and in my view exponentially relative to fiat currency. And to do date, and I believe continuing into at least the medium term, the cryptocurrencies that will succeed in terms of rising most in price are the ones with the most limited supply. Bitcoin is the obvious example. 

The problem with Bitcoin is, it HAS ALREADY risen exponentially through multiple iterations. In my view, while anyone trading in the crypto space now would be wise to consider holding a portion of their float in Bitcoin, Bitcoin's capacity to continue to rise exponentially is limited by its relatively larger market capitalization. I'm quite confident it could double, or triple, I'd even grant a fourfold rise.

But what about the real rises, the rises of 20 fold, 50 fold, 100 fold and more that have turned many a 30-something year old man with a day job, an interest in technology, and too much time in front of the computer screen into millionaires?  I don't believe Bitcoin is capable of the exponential rise that smaller market cap coins are capable of, or put another way, I think there are certain small cap coins with limited supply that have a real chance to rise at a faster rate than Bitcoin. They can outperform.

The key of this for me in the short to medium term is that such a cryptocurrency must have a good development team, and must have a low supply. At present, 'low supply' basically means coins that copied Bitcoin's maximum 21 million total supply, of which a number have. This also means that I'm rather neutral on coins with very big total supplies like XRP, and why I'm not surprised that lately Ethereum has tracked sideways while many other coins with lower total supplies have risen. It is why Litecoin with its already over 53 million coins have has never excited me. Sure Litecoin today is fifth largest by market cap on coinmarket cap, but this is misleading. It's only worth $67 per coin, whereas Dash which sits just below it in total market cap is worth $418 per coin. Remember, they were once worth about the same per coin, and they're now worth roughly equal in market cap, but PER COIN price is what we have to consider. In this regard Dash has blown Litecoin out of the water.

Now of the coins I've considered with limited supply, one stands out to me as offering the best potential for exponential rise and outperformance. That is Zencash, a zkSNARKs coin that protects transactional privacy. There are three reasons why this coin has made such a mark on my radar. One, it's worth about $22 today, and it has really only risen about threefold from its lows. What if we could have all bought Dash at $22, we'd be pretty happy today, wouldn't we, with our 20 fold profit? The second reason  I like Zencash is, like Dash and Bitcoin, its total supply is limited to 21 million. The third and final reason I like Zencash is that like Dash it has a funded governance model where a portion of coins earned from mining are allocated to fund the coin's development, in other words to pay staff and contractors to develop the coin and ecosystem. It worked for Dash, and I believe it will work for Zencash.

If there's anything that has struck me about the whole cryptocurrency revolution, it has been the impact of scarcity and limited supply in catalyzing the exponential rise in value of an asset even in the face of only moderate and not yet mainstream demand.

personalfinance,Long term benefits of putting more money towards my mortgage principal payment each month.,"I am a homeowner. Purchased about 2.5 years ago. My mortgage each month comes to about $2100 (including interest, taxes, etc) and my interest rate is 4.25%. 

What is the benefit of adding an extra $100 to my principal payment in the long run? Meaning - If $2100/month will pay my house off in 30 years (according to the amortization schedule). How much of a dent will paying $2200/month make? Will it even shorten the duration of my loan by a significant amount? (Assuming I never sell and stay here for the next 27.5 years). 

Hope this makes sense. Any input is appreciated.

personalfinance,Balance transfer ideas/advice,"I have $8,000 on a balance transfer Bank America credit card - but the 0% interest rate period ends soon - it will become 15.59% going forward - so I want to transfer that $8,000 balance to a new card and start another 12 or 15 month 0% interest/ fee balance transfer period - so I can pay off my debt while avoiding interest charges. The best card I qualify for is a separate Bank America card from the one I have now - BUT Bank America does not allow transferring one balance to another. SO my idea, which I'm asking for advice on, is that I also have a Chase card that I could transfer my $8,000 to - pay the transfer fee - and then open the new Bank America card - and then transfer that same $8,000 back. AND YES - I realize this is a bad idea! So I'm really asking for alternatives. I've looked at other cards that are not Chase of Bank America via NerdWallet - but they don't have free balance transfer fees or long 0% interest periods. I'd love any and all advice/suggestions! And FYI: while I'm at $8,000 now - I started at $22,000 (medical bills are fun!) So I'm making progress on my debt, one day at a time - just like all of us are! Thanks! 
EDIT/UPDATE: one option is the Citi Simplicity Card - which has a great 0% Intro APR on Balance Transfers and Purchases for 21 months - BUT there is a balance transfer fee of either $5 or 3% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater - so 3% of 8,000 is $240 - which I guess when thinking or comparing it to the interest instead - is not so bad, right?

personalfinance,"Receiving $9,000 USD today, paying off $1,000 CC bill immediately, not sure what to do with remaining amount.","This money is *after taxes*, rounded to the nearest whole dollar; there may be extra in change. Credit card interest rate is 24.90% (Prime + 20.65%). Nothing in savings, credit card is supposed to be my emergency fund.          
       
**Option 1: Use $1,000 of $9K to pay credit card, put the rest towards my car.**     
I owe $10,000 on my car loan - monthly payment is $370 at 5.99% and the expected maturity date is April 2020. If I put the remaining $8,000 towards my car, I could have it paid off in 6 months. My car payment is the second highest monthly expense I have, behind rent. Having nearly $400 a month free every month would change my quality of life - it would mean I could have savings and a 401K, and I would save a lot of money in interest over the next two and a half years.             
         
**Option 2: Use $1,000 of $9K to pay off credit card, put the rest in a savings account.**     
This would obviously mean that I would have a savings account equal to 5 months of my living expenses, but it would also cost me the interest on my car loan over the next 2.5 years and I would still have a high car payment during that time. So I would have thousands of dollars in savings, but continue to stress over a high car payment.       
      
**Option 3: Combination A.**     
Save 3 months of living expenses, put the rest towards my car. This would mean I could pay off the car in 8 months instead of two and a half years and is beneficial for the reasons listed above. 
        
**Option 4: Combination B**      
Pay off a year of car payments up front, put the rest in savings. So $4,400 into the car, the rest in savings, which would be equal to 2 months of living expenses. This would cut my remaining car loan down to a year and a half of interest and payments.      
      
 **Option 5 would be something I haven't yet considered.**      
       
For context, I am 23 and have been working full-time for three years, I am financially independent, paying down student loan debt, and working to improve my credit; I currently have nothing in savings. As it stands now, because of the car payment and loan, I am not in a position to renew my lease in August, due to both monthly expenses and credit score - paying off or down the car would improve both of these things.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my credit card right away or wait until I have more cash?,"I'm a current college student, so for the most part, I make as much money as possible during the summer, and then try to spread it out over the school year. 

Last month, I got a little carried away and I spent way over my budget, which means, while I had just enough to get by until I graduate, I'm now short a good amount of cash. Add to that the initial moving expenses I forgot about when I was budgeting and I'm in need of at least an extra thousand. I'm graduating in December, and I already have a job lined up, so eventually, I'll have enough money, but the problem is I don't have it now.

To make up for the extra thousand, I've been debating between two options

1) I currently have a credit card that has 0% intro APR for 7 more months -  I could run a debt on it and pay it off once I have a job. The minimum payment is 25 dollars, which I could afford, and the bill would be over due by only 2-3 months. The problem is, I don't understand how it'll affect my credit score, which is really good right now. 

2) I could take out the rest of my federal unsubsidized student loans to cover the cost - which I'm guessing, won't affect my credit score as much. However, these loans DO accrue interest (4.45%) in addition to the disbursement fee of (~2%), so it's less money for the cost, but it's technically a safer option?

What's the best choice - or are there other options I haven't considered?

side note - in terms of personal loans (from friends and family), I'm not comfortable taking them and in most cases they aren't really an option.",finance
Bitcoin,Another reason I see Bitcoin is way undervalued.,"As the supply is constant, some would argue that monetary policy could no longer apply to simulate the economy if needed. Just like the particular country in Asia like to own most of a particular NA country's debt to leverage its ability on exchange rate manipulation and currency war, there would be regional ""government"" bodies to reserve a large amount of Bitcoins in case of quantitive easing. That means at some point a government will step in to hold a large of bitcoins in cold storage just like how they used to hold gold or have the ""Reserve"". The outcome of this measure would decrease the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation which leads to significant deflation until the desired reserve ratio is achieved. 

Banning a currency and mining is offense, and at the same time, reserving bitcoin would be defense. It's clear that one does not only attack but also defend.

personalfinance,How can a Chemical Engineer progress his career to be competitive with dentist/medical professional salaries by 30?,"Hello all! I'm sorry if this isn't the correct subreddit for this, but I like that this one has so many followers, which means larger pool of responses!


I am currently a recent chemical engineering graduate working at a company in the southeast as a process engineer. My current salary is about 71k a year but it is a federal contractor position so it has some solid benefits/401(k) match along with four 10 hour work days and rarely working more than 40 hours a week. For a few months I shadowed a shift engineer and am currently working towards obtaining all the qualifications to become one, but it can be a length process. While on shift my pay was increased by about 14% to 81k a year.


Up until recently I was fairly comfortable with this plan and was only looking to interview and get a job in another part of the country (I'm not a big fan of the southeast) that would be for a private company and hopefully pay more (in my mind ""more"" is 80-90k a year). However, I have a friend who is dental school that opened my eyes to the lucrative business dentistry is! On top of this, after learning a lot more about her workload and the things she is learning (she is currently a second year) I have come to realize that dentistry pays a lot for...not that much more work. Four years of school, no residency (you can do some though if you want or go into a specialization and make even more after residency), and you even have the ability to buy your own pratice to basically become a business owner. The starting salary averages around 110k to 150k right out of school depending on work hours and location. The classwork is basically a full time job, roughly 30-40 hours of class a week. But the classes aren't difficult. And half of it is actual practical lab work, not coursework, which is generally easier and more straightfoward.


My friend basically described dental school by saying ""the hardest part is just attending the mandatory classes."" Another interest quote is ""It's like my bio undergrad, but just specializing in the mouth and with more lab time."" I will be perfectly honest, my pride is hurt a little by this. As an chemical engineer, I worked very hard for my degree. I know that my starting job and pay is good because of the difficult concepts and workload I had in my undergrad. But to imagine just having to attend four more years of school that was much easier and then make literally double the income? I know that a PhD (the equivalent to what dentistry school is) for engineering of any discipline would require slightly less lecture hours but far more time in the lab/studying/working on thesis and dissertation. Many people take 5 years to get a PhD in engineering. The material you have to learn is far more complex and intricate than dentistry (my father is currently finishing up his PhD in industrial engineering). So what do PhD engineering salaries in the US typically look like starting out? Still much lower than dentistry, without all the other benefits that come with it.


So of course, I delved into some research on dentistry and other medical fields, wondering if I should switch. I came to the conclusion that overall, I love engineering because of how flexible and integrated it is in everything. Just because I'm chemical doesn't mean I can't learn electrical or civil engineering or work in positions to pertaining to those areas. Chemical itself is also just very flexible. And most engineers don't stay engineers their whole career, often moving into management or business. Dentistry and most medical fields are different though: you learn a ton in school, but then you either get specialized or stay in a general field. Either way a lot of the work you do strikes me as being redundant and repetitive (not to mention dentists have a high chance to become addicted to drugs and a very high suicide rate). And even then the options for potential career changes later on are fairly limited once you specialize. I also understand that dentists come out of school with a ton of debt. My friend is actually lucky to predict only around 150k to 180k debt. Most are much more, very few are less. So even if she is making far more than me in 2-3 years after graduating, the debt payments will make the overall income much lower. To me the only real benefit of these jobs is the ridiculously high pay.


So considering all this information I decided I wanted to stay in my field, but the competitive nature of me also wants to make the money that dentists do. Therefore my question to all of you is simply: how do I do this? As a dentist it isn't unreasonable to be making $150k a year at 30 years old. So how could I, with a BS in ChemE with 2 years work experience do the same? My current plan is to go to grad school and obtaining a MSc and an MBA in the near future. I think this definitely would benefit me in the long run (despite the 2 years costing me work income and accruing debt) but I don't know if it would would be enough. My goal at a minimum would be to have over six digits by 28. It's scary to think that is only four years away but a lot can happen in four years. 


Are there potential career changes I could make with my current background and interests that can get me there? Should I focus on a different aspect of engineering like consulting or sales? So far as I know, the ones in engineering who make the big bucks are the managers and the contractors/consultants. I am really open to all forms of input though. I am a flexible person and willing to work towards big changes to achieve my goal.

personalfinance,Help with credit card debt and student loans.,"I'll just give details on my overall current situation:

I have about $13k in credit card debt that I racked up when I could only find part-time employment in my field. Now, I work full-time and take home about $800/week, but still seem to struggle to get rid of this debt. The APR is at 21.24% and I feel like most of the monthly payment goes towards interest anyway. 

I also have quite a few student loans (not too concerned with the federal ones since the APR on them are pretty low...3-6.8% with $16.7k). However, I do have a few private student loans where the APR is 10% and the total amount there is $22k. 

My priority is definitely the credit card debt, but I also feel like I should re-finance the private student loans, too. Would it be better to take out a private loan from a credit union to pay off the credit card debt? Should I re-finance the private student loans, as well? Should I try to do a balance transfer with a different credit card, but lower APR? If I do a loan or balance transfer, will my credit score take a hard hit? It's currently 709. Would that hurt my chances of re-financing the student loans? 

I'm currently only able to make the minimum payments with all of my student loans and credit card debt.

personalfinance,You're covered by your employer - but its still possible for you to get Premium Tax Credits through the ACA,"This information is beneficial for families with employer provided health coverage and salaries over the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but less than $60,000 (Less with one child, more with 3+) and self-only coverage offered through work with premiums higher than these amounts:
	Number in household		Self-only coverage premiums
			1				$96.08
			2				129.38
			3				162.68
			4				195.98
			5				229.28
Unfortunately, health insurance premiums are going up quite a bit this year as there is uncertainty for insurance companies.  This is tough for most Americans with employer provided coverage as they will have to pay more to insure their families.  However, it’s opening a great loophole for low to moderate income families to receive ACA advanced premium tax credits to cover almost all your insurance costs.  You’ll need to act soon as open enrollment ends December 15 and it will take several weeks to complete the process.  Since healthcare premiums are rising for coverage, more employer coverage plans are ‘unaffordable’ according to the ACA.

I hope this is as helpful to others as it’s been for a client of mine.  About me, I’m a CPA in Virginia.  My client has two kids and a stay-at home wife.  His salary is $54,000 and it is his only income.  Through his job he can get covered but it was going to cost $1,200 a month for his family of four, $14,400 a year!!

Normally if you are offered insurance through your job you can’t get ACA subsidies because the premiums are ‘affordable’ and meet minimum value standards.  But this year, premiums are higher for self-only coverage which is what affordability is based on.   If your premiums through work are higher than the figures above, you can tax plan to save on insurance.  It’s a lot of work but will save your family a lot of money in insurance premiums and is a legal loophole.  Perfectly ethical as the law requires you to have insurance and provides this path to getting help with insurance.

The basic principle is that you must reduce your household income to a level that your premiums for self-only coverage are more than 9.56% of your income.  Household income for most employees is your salary, minus any 401k, HSA, or IRA contributions.  Graduate school tuition reduces it as well.  There are other reductions from your salary but these are the basics for most taxpayers.



My client’s household income:
			Income		  54,000
			401k cont.  	(14,400)
			Graduate Tuit.	  (2,000)
			Household Inc.    37,600
Note that you can apply what you would pay for insurance to your 401k, reducing your expenses but increasing your savings.
So the principle is, if he contributes what he would pay for premiums to his 401k, he reduces his income and his employer offered coverage is now considered unaffordable.  Self only coverage is $320 through his employer which is considered affordable at his gross income of $60,000.  But since he contributes what he would pay for insurance to his 401k, this reduces his household income (to 37,600) to qualify the premiums as unaffordable for him.

Now he’ll apply for coverage through healthcare.gov and qualifies for premium tax credits of about $1,900 per month in advanced premium tax credits.  The ACA coverage is much better than the cheapest plan offered through his employer.  He has the same take-home pay as the money going into his 401k is the same as what he would pay for insurance.  He’s keeping all that he makes which makes so much sense.  His insurance is about $5 per month for full family coverage comparable to what he would get from his employer.

When you apply to healthcare.gov you must be honest about your estimated income and estimated reductions to income (401k, IRA, HSA, graduate school, etc).  Even if you end up making more than you thought, there is a safe harbor for employees who miscalculate their household income and employer premiums.  Don’t be fraudulent, but use the law to your advantage.

One note: in quite a few states, household income lower than 200% FPL will prompt healthcare.gov to deny children coverage and send you to CHIP, a Medicare option for kids.  In Virginia, qualifying for CHIP is based on GROSS income ($54,000 for my client) which is more than the 200% so he doesn’t qualify.  He had to apply for CHIP, get denied, and reapply for healthcare.gov with the rejection letter.  Since he was denied CHIP, the savings towards his healthcare.gov plan were much more because the whole family was covered on one plan.

Don’t give up!  You’ll need to do some work to calculate affordability and apply to healthcare.gov, CHIP, then healthcare.gov again if you have kids.  If you know your state’s CHIP requirements you can skip the first application to healthcare.gov and apply to CHIP first.  Good luck!",finance

As a background, I'm 27 with no debt to speak of (other than my mortgage I suppose). I bought my house a little over 2 years ago for about $215,000. Since then, our property values have gone up quite a bit due to improvements in the neighborhood among other factors (more and more people coming into the area). My monthly payment is around $1,200 and my interest rate is 3.25%.  

I have been making pretty good money but recently just received a pretty substantial raise that bumped up my income in a noticeable way. So I have a surplus of cash. I now make around $145k before taxes, which will hit me pretty hard due to me filing as a single jerk. Having the mortgage interest deduction helps at least.

Anyway, I've been considering increasing my primary payment on my house in an effort to pay it off as fast as I can so I can stop paying interest. 

So I guess my question is: Is there a magic number or formula for the ideal amount I should pay extra each year? Someone once told me that if I made 3 extra payments a year, it would turn my 30 year mortgage into a 10 year mortgage. I've never done the math but if that's true, that seems pretty great. Or should I just keep paying my normal payment and invest the extra income elsewhere? I feel bad having cash just sitting in a savings account doing nothing.",finance
Bitcoin,Starting over after getting hacked in the dip,"I only started getting into Bitcoin seriously about 2 weeks ago, I was in a panic to get as much bitcoin as I could with the money that I had, I didn't do a enough research and created an account with blockchain.info.  Figured it was safe enough... had maximum security measures with my seed safely stored on paper, google 2FA and a secondary password for sending funds.


After signing up to multiple exchanges I realized it would be at least a few days before I could buy any coin, due to verification and what not.  So I resorted to the only other option that was open at the time, purchasing bitcoin at BTC atm's in my city.  


Over the next couple of days I withdrew thousands of dollars in cash and fed them into the bitcoin atm machines, (incurring hefty fee's and horrible exchange rates yes I know...) Eventually I had a nice balance of 0.27 BTC, I felt pretty happy knowing I had acquired this number, but I was still far from my goal of 1.0BTC.  


I felt quite uneasy though, I began researching about all the different security measures I could take and soon realized that I was in a vulnerable position holding my funds online, in a hot wallet.  I was on amazon looking at hard wallets, Trezor or ledger s is what it had come down to, but it was late in the night and I was exhausted from all the research and purchasing I had made.  I would start again next morning...


I awoke the next day, honestly couldn't even wait to make a coffee before signing into my account to check my balance.  logged on to see 0 BTC, looked at my transaction history and saw someone transferred my 0.27 BTC at 3 in the morning.... It was a horrific moment of realization that my hard earned cash and all the time I spent acquiring my bitcoin over the past days was all for nothing.  


How did this happen? I posted to this sub in search of answers and the most logical thing that could have happened is that my computer was infected with malware and my keys were logged, I don't really understand or know what actually happened, somehow someone got my seed...  I never showed a soul what it was.  Either that or a breach within blockchain.info occurred. 


Despite this significant loss I still fully believe in Bitcoins potential, and I still want to invest another significant amount of money.  I am asking for help as I have some difficulties in my current situation stopping me from safely buying bitcoin.

The plan so far...


I do not trust my computer (Mac) I do not know if it has malware but I'm not taking another chance buying BTC on this computer.  I plan to do a system reset, format it in the hopes it will delete any possible malware.


after the format I will create a new email for the sole purpose of bitcoin, I most likely can never use my old email that is related to my blockchain.info account right?  is there anyway I can change emails on my exchange accounts without deleting the account itself? 


I still need to get verified with a reputable exchange before anything can move forward, I am in Canada, so far Quadriga CX or GDAX seem like good options, is Coinbase an ok place to transfer my funds to a secure wallet?


Before I even move any money I want to have a hardware wallet ready to go so my BTC isn't on a hot wallet for more than a minute.


I have some elements working against me.


The first one is time.  I'm terrified I am missing out on something huge, and the longer I wait BTC becomes increasingly more expensive to obtain, it's insane how fast it is rising at the moment...


I am working in a remote location with no cellular service for the next week and a half, this is an issue because I don't know of any exchanges I can sign up to without getting an SMS verification message so I can continue with the sign up process...  This is why I am wondering if I can just change emails with the current account? is it possible it would still be insecure with a new email?


Is there a way to secure my compromised email address?  or should I just ditch it completely? If I sign onto a new device with my old email does it automatically compromise the device?  I am very novice when it comes to computers but I'm worried my email is now a virus that will compromise anything that it uses to sign onto. 


It's impossible to get my hands on a hard wallet until the end of my work period, by this time I'm afraid bitcoin could be at $10k  Is there a way I could buy bitcoin before this time but store it safely on a hot wallet in cold storage before getting access to a hard wallet to transfer to? 


Should I just wait 2 weeks until I have my Trezor to get my BTC?  I don't know what is the best way to move forward... I just know that my gut is telling me to get BTC right away.. I feel like opportunity is slipping from my hands as each day goes by... please help

EDIT #1: I forgot to mention that when this hack occurred I never received any kind of notification saying that my bitcoin was sent.  My account was set up to send me an instant SMS message, and email.. I got neither.  I check the trash box in my email and there was nothing.

However, I was heavily involved with animals and still am, and genuinely think I'd enjoy working with them, which means totally rerouting my education if I choose, which means: 3 more years of pre-med, and then 4 more years of veterinary school, BUT that comes with what I would estimate being ~$180k of debt. 

So, this brings up the question, how do people do it? How does someone knowlingly take on $180k of debt? I've always been worried about repaying my debt, but right now, I'm worried about hating the majority of my future, working in something I won't enjoy. Can anyone share similar stories, or give alternate advice?

btc,Theory about tether.,"So, for the past few years, I've been wondering how the establishment will attack bitcoin/crypto when they start to really view it as a threat. One thing I have always assumed is that they will want to heavily regulate it and control it in some way. If they can't control it, they may create an alternative and guarantee it's survival with regulatory capture.

I also starting thinking about the divide and conquer strategy often used to crush grass-roots movements, and how that could be some of what had been driving the contention in the scaling debate, or at least adding fuels to the fire and sponsoring the divide.

This is all just background stuff I have had floating around in my mind with a vague sense that something is up. I also started becoming suspicious of this past few months of bullish behavior in the market, especially with so much uncertainty with regard to the scaling debate and potential hard forks. The price didn't ""feel"" natural, but irrationality can be organic. Still.. I felt that there could potentially be a ""false flag incoming"" whereby institutional investors get burned for large stakes and demand regulation in the space.

I have recently learned about this ""tether"" phenomenon, and here is my theory:

Tether is a prosthetic tentacle that can be used to manipulate exchanges without a formal relationship with any bank, and thus used to prop up FEDcoin core in the manner of the fractional reserve banking tradition. This is a win/win for the banking establishment. If they succeed in pushing out adoption of their crippled blockstream FEDcoin, and wow people with second layer debt based systems, they win because they have prevented the real adoption of decentralized cash.

If they lose, because the fork of freedom is too obvious and the grassroots effect is too resilient to destroy, they pull the plug on tether and implode the entire market, ushering in a new era of regulation in the space.

TL;DR: theory: tether is an insurance policy by the central banksters to either take control of FEDcoin, or crash the whole crypto market.

personalfinance,"I hear all the time that low income earners don't pay taxes - why do I, then?","Ok, to start I am a full time student and have a full time job working overnights and make about $1300 a month after taxes. I file single and have no dependents. Now, I'm looking at the taxes taken out of my check and to date they are:

* Fwt: $1012 ( I guess this means federal witholding?)
*  Ssec $1151
* Mdcr $269
* State $668

I worked this job the whole year of 2016 and filed my taxes and actually, due to my healthcare plan through the marketplace, I OWED 148 bucks at tax time. I think this was because I supposedly estimated my income incorrectly for the tax credit, but I'll tell you, I couldn't have been very far off! So this was slightly annoying, but whatevs.

The only other influencing factor I can think of is I have some investments which sometimes pay a little dividends but I'm not sure how much that matters. It's not a huge amount, for sure. Looking at 2016, I had $145 in dividends and $276 capital gains.
 
I often read that people who are in the lowest tax brackets like me (15.5% or so) pay no federal income tax. I assume what they mean is these people get their taxes all back as a refund. I don't have a problem with the taxes I pay, but I've posted previously on reddit about this, and people say something is wrong. If I'm somehow screwed up here I'd like to know.

personalfinance,Debt ridden guy seeks advice,"The short and sweet version: I currently make $45k as a Marketing Analyst but have roughly 6 student loans of varying interest rates that add up to roughly $92K. My job is okay but I just dont get motivated to make a difference. I would love to go back for CS or Engineering of some sort. What should I do?

Long Story:
Ill start by saying that much of this is my own fault. However I'd like to vent as well. I always knew I wanted to do business in high school and had dreams of going to big schools around the country. However, my parents had other ideas. I ended up going to school I loathed because I was told that they would pay for everything. However tough times struck and ended up finishing with $60k in debt. I finished with a degree in marketing from a no name school. I spent much of my senior year and following summer applying to jobs in anything and everything. I got no responses back. In my infinite wisdom I decided to go back to school except this time in the UK, my logic  here was thinking that companies here would love that (they dont/didnt). I'm not even sure why I decided to pursue marketing for my masters, I guess it was just easy and figured that more education would make me more employable .The school I went to abroad was one of the best schools schools in the country outside of London. Also I was convinced by my parents that ONLY paying $30k for a Masters was a steal. While I still think that my masters was a good deal, it also raised my debt to $90k. I found my current job after searching for 8months after returning from the UK. As mentioned previously, I kind of hate my job and my current living situation. I live at home with a car that can barely function, I have to support my family because theyve fallen on tough times and still somehow workout loan payments. To top things off I had to use my week old credit cad to withdraw $3k and give up my 1k in savings because my parents almost had to declare bankruptcy. Furthermore, my job doesn't inspire me at all. Im bored most of the time honestly. I dream of building things and making things. I taught myself VBA to automate somethings, and even my boss remarked that I seemed the happiest since he hired me. Marketing in general just bores me and it seems all so fake. Click rates and sessions , its all just smoke and mirrors. I've been thinking alot about more technical disciplines namely software engineering (backend), Electrical Engineering, and Cyber Security. I'm also considering doing a bootcamp or part time classes in these areas. I'm just tired of being broke and feeling like I'll be this way forever.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans or save for a down payment on a house,"I realize this might be a familiar question, but it's one that now applies to me.  My total remaining student loans is $19000. My monthly payment is $97 but next year, it will increase to about $120. It will stay at the $120 for the remainder of the payments. The interest rate on the student loan is 2.25%.

My initial thoughts were to pay off the student loan so I would be debt free except my house. I have a house that I currently rent out. It cash flows for about $250 per month.

Now, I am definitely in a position where I should be able to buy a house around November or so next year (or maybe early 2019). Instead of paying off the student loan, I would instead save for a down payment on a house.  I'm not sure what I should do. The real estate market is very expensive, but that doesn't mean I'll be buying the most expensive house.

If it matters, the interest rate on my current home is 3.5% and my credit score is 800+ (but not by much). I definitely can't do both.  If I paid off my student loans, I would have to wait at least another year, if not longer, before I purchase another house. My ultimate goal is to invest in rental properties and live off the income it generates me in addition to my retirement benefits at work.  I'm close to 40, and you can assume that the fundamentals are in place that would allow me to afford to purchase another house.

So, should I pay off my student loans or save for a down payment on a house?  Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Estimated Federal and State tax payments on capital gains.,"Hey guys, so my situation is currently I'm employed full-time working in California, but I've also been investing in stocks on the side and have realized some profits (everything is short term). I recently found out about both Federal and State requiring estimated tax payments on these extra income.

&amp;nbsp;


Now I've only worked for about a month and half in the year of 2016, so I'm positive for this year I didn't need to make quarterly payments. With that said, if I wanted to prepay some off, I can just try to fill out 1040-ES and 540-ES myself to get an estimate of how much I need to pay right? I know I can pay the federal estimated tax online without submitting 1040-ES form, but what about 540-ES?

&amp;nbsp;


More importantly, assuming my salary stays the same, my understanding is that come next year if I (hopefully) make more from stocks than this year, then I'd have to start meeting quarterly payments correct? But then with stock investments, how would you satisfy paying ""X% First quarter, Y% Second quarter...""? If I didn't make enough in the first 3 quarters of 2018, would I be penalized retroactively if I exceeded 2017's total capital gain in Q4?

btc,Finally subbed though so-o fed-up with the name calling.,"I am a very conservative investor and late into the cryptocurrency world.

When I first decided to look Bitcoin was the only name I knew. And there is a big point to this. Bitcoin [currently] is a generic trademark; like Band-Aid and Xerox in the US (I understand) and Hoover and Sellotape in the UK. In the UK if you want to clean your carpets you grab the hoover - even though only 8% of vacuum cleaners sold in the UK are actually **H**oovers.

A newcomer to crypto's is likely to have only heard of Bitcoin until they enter the world and discover the plethora of tokens available to them.

When I [lamely] try to explain cryptocurrency to someone I start with blockchain and move on to Bitcoin. I do not mention Vertcoin, Monero or any others until the final paragraph - '...and there are hundreds to investigate and choose from'.

Bitcoin Cash is here to stay and I am investing in it. But Bitcoin will for the medium term remain the generic trademark of crypto currencies.

The infantile emotional to and fro from both sides will do nothing to change that. What it will do is to reinforce to newcomers to these discussion boards that crypto's are possibly not for the mature and level headed.

When noob Wall Street traders comes calling what do you want them to read?

They will come looking for Bitcoin; educate themselves on the wide variety of tokens available and [hopefully] choose to invest in those that show the most promise for growth.

I hope that they choose Bitcoin Cash because I am invested in it but, like I said in the other place, I also had a Philips Video 2000 because it was better then Betamax which was in turn better than VHS.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mid-atlantic USA. 25 yr old single software dev. Can I afford buying a townhouse or a condo? Or do I need to save more?,"I'm a single 25 year old who makes $78,500 a year in Maryland. I've been trying to stay at home to save up for a townhouse, but it's becoming increasingly difficult. I'm not sure why, everything is the same but my family just irritates me. I don't know why. A big point of contention has been getting a cat. I've always wanted a dog or a cat my entire life. I'm prone to bouts of depression and nothing helps more than the unconditional love a dog or a cat gives. I've been volunteering every day for the past year at an animal shelter. But it really irks me I'm not able to adopt.

My mom wants me to start looking for an apartment because she's about had it with me. I do not want an apartment, ideally I'd like to get a townhouse or a condo. How far away am I financially from getting a place? It would likely be between $200,000 and $250,000.

As of right now, I have $14000 in my account. My credit union (Tower Federal) [offers 100% financing options](https://www.towerfcu.org/borrow/mortgages/mortgage-options/#1476470224527-2ef2933d-9ec5) with the APR under 4.2%.

I have no student loans or other debts. My only expenses are for food, gas, cell service, and online streaming. 

Upcoming expenses are health insurance and car insurance. I'll have to get health insurance through work since I'll be turning 26 soon, but I checked the rates and it's ~$175 a month. I have an old car so I don't think car insurance should be too bad.",finance

I don't trust the banks, like so many of us crypt-enthusiasts, so I don't want to put it in a savings account. Plus they give you such terrible interest rates, it's not worth the risk if you ask me. 

However a year isn't a very long time, so I'm not sure if I should even bother... or if there would be a more advisable way to possibly grow my money while I am saving. 

I'd really like to invest in Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Monero, equally, and in that order. But once again, I do not know if it'd be worthwhile to do so because of transaction / miner fees? 

Is buying bitcoin then exchanging it for bitcoin cash, monero, etc still the easiest/cheapest way to buy alternative currencies? 

I know this isn't an investment subreddit, but basically that is what BTC is ;) 
So I appreciate any advice you have to offer. I live below the poverty line and am going to extreme lengths to save $600 a month, so I don't want to waste my money. I am aware that crypto currencies can be a gamble, but I feel pretty safe investing in any of those 3 mentioned currencies.

I pay for school by maxing out federal loans and paying the rest out of pocket. I recieve $0 in financial aid outside of federal loans. I do not qualify for private loans. I have no one in my life who could co-sign. I attend a public university in Pennsylvania, and they have the most expensive public universities in the country. My tuition is $18,500 a year. I've been telling myself that if I can make it to graduation, I can use my new career to fix my financial life. I keep finding ways to borrow money and the minimums of those various ways are killing me. I need to fix it now.

The company I work for pays $3,000 a year for tuition(starting next year, was $2500 this year). 

My take-home pay varies. I make $15.40 an hour, and my standard hours per week is 24. I can work as many as I like (provided I work someone else's shift or fill in a scheduling hole. Anything more than an extra day or so requires doing double shifts (16 hours) because most of the extra hours are up for grabs on the weekends) but I can only do so much before my grades suffer. I tend to pick up an extra day every week putting me at 32 hours. This gives me an average take home pay of $675 bi-weekly, so $1,350 monthly. 

Here's my financial situation:

No emergency fund. No retirement contributions (any more that is). I have a little retirement fund, but not much. My employer has a pension plan that I'm vested in, but it's only around $1,700 at the moment. I have around $1,500 in the 401(k).  It was bigger but I wiped out the 401(k) with a withdrawal and a loan. Only reason it's not as $0 is because I wasn't allowed to withdraw more of it.  

DEBTS:

- Credit Card #1
	$171.98, $25.00 minimum monthly, 23.90% APR

- Credit Card #2
	$736.21, $25.00 minimum monthly, 23.90% APR

- Credit Card #3
	$649.86, $27.00 minimum monthly, 23.90% APR

- Credit Card #4*
	$2,003.59, $27.00 minimum monthly, 27.99% APR

- 401(k) Loan:
	$961.35, $20.64 minimum monthly, 5.25% APR. This loan comes out of my paycheck so it's already paid and doesn't deduct from the $1350 salary above (I'd have $1,370 if this loan was gone)

- Salary Advance Loan through Credit Union:
	This one is a little in-depth and will take explaining. Original amount is $500. Every paycheck, they take $510 out of my account to pay it back (original plus $10 fee). I then re-issue the salary advance online. This places $475 back into my account, and $25 goes into a locked savings account. The idea is that you eventually save up enough to unlock the salary advance savings and then you stop using it. I currently have $125.08 (the account gains interest) of the $500 saved. So the ""minimum"" monthly payment for this is $70 ($25 + $10 fee twice a month)


*Credit Card #4 also has deferred financing. The original amount was for $2000, and I still need to pay down another $1,773.81 by 04/13/18 to avoid the interest, but I don't think I can pull it off. There's currently $596.45 in deferred interest, and it goes up by $42.66 every month. This card will financially murder me when April hits and the interest is almost double the minimum payment. I think by the time April hits, the total deferred interest will be around $800 and will cause the balance to start drawing around $60 a month in interest.

PRE-NETPAY EXPENSES (or why my paycheck is so low):

- $75 monthly charge for lease to park in garage at work (downtown employer)
- $180 health/vision/dental insurance (sucks being part time)
- the 401(k) loan above


MONTHLY EXPENSES:

- Rent: $200 for my part
- Cable TV/Internet: was $180, but dropped TV and got it down to $60. My half is $30 Comcast has a monopoly and I can not get this any lower.
- Electric/Gas for Apartment: Around $50-$75 for my share depending on the season
- Netflix: $5 for my share
- Groceries: $200 for just me 
- Apartment Upkeep (like cleaning supplies, etc): $10-25 depending on what we're out of
- Parking (my apartment charges for parking): $30
- Cell Phone (includes data plan plus installment payments for phone): $90, could maybe get this down to $75 if I can cut my data usage down to under 2GB. Can't really move to a new carrier since I'm locked in on an installment plan for phone.
- Fuel for car (commuter student): $120
- Tuition payment for school: $250

After calculating everything out, that leaves a little under $100 for anything else that comes up, such as school supplies, or medicine, or anything. 

CREDIT:
	According to Credit Karma, I'm at 580 on Trans Union, and 554 on Equifax. FICO score from one of my credit cards show 622. This is different because I had 2 collections on my account. I disputed them, and they were removed from Trans Union, but Equifax will not remove them. Also, one of them is reported twice on Equifax and I still can't get them to remove at least the duplicate. So it looks like 3 collections instead of two. One of these is for $141, the other is for $71. 

Credit utilization is around 95%. The simulator says I could expect a 90 point increase if I got the utilization below 10%. 

No missed or late payments. 

I checked to see if I was pre-qualified for a balance transfer card, but can not find one that would approve me. I looked into a loan through OneMain but the interest was bad (28%) and they want my car title, and I don't want to risk my car because I have a history of being bad with money. Credit union has fantastic interest rates but will not offer me anything with collections on my credit report. 

With this semester wrapping to a close, I have a few weeks between now and the end of December that I could work extra hours for to make some extra money. But I need to get a grip on my finances now. Especially because once CC #4 has $800 interest added, it'll be drawing around $60 interest a month with a new giant balance and that will wipe out the rest of my income. 

I don't really have anything of value to sell except for my laptop but I'm a computer science major and need it to do class projects. I have a 2008 car that I use to commute to school/work but it's paid off and mine. Going full time at work is not an option because they don't work with school schedules for full time employees and I fear my grades would suffer from working 40 hours every week. I've even been to the financial aid office at school and they just tell me to take fewer classes or apply for private loans. That's the only change I don't want to make: I do not want to delay graduation (Spring, 2019). 

I'm lost. I've slowly, and without realizing, destroyed my finances. My instinct tells me the biggest goal right now is finding a way to destroy the balance on Credit Card 4. But beyond that, I'm lost on how to do it and everything else. Short of working some extra time over the next few weeks, I'm not sure how to recover from this before it gets bad.

Rip me a new one, PF. 

Edit: Thanks for all of the help. I got a free year with YNAB since I'm a student, and I made myself a budget so that I can try to stop losing money in between the cracks.",finance

investing,Is there a book which carefully defines fundamental investing and finance concepts?,"I am a student and still consider myself an unexperienced person on finance and investing. I am continuing to learn from books about these topics, but all those that I opened talk - often in a very discursive a watered-down manner - about theories, lessons or analyses which assume prior knowledge of foundational topics. I never read an (English) book define what a stock, a bond, an ETF or a currency is and how they work, for example, and all of my knowledge of these elements comes from *very* disparate sources and personal syntheses.

Please do not assume that I want to be fed the knowledge without putting in any work. Rather, it's the opposite, and taking the trouble to write this confirms it in part. I believe that the most basic and foundational concepts - the first principles - should be defined clearly and precisely, and I'm looking for a non-fiction or even a textbook that can do it.

gaming,An Idea for the Future of the Splinter Cell Series,"So, I saw some rumors for a new Splinter Cell game and just recently looked back into the series and saw we haven't had a new one since Blacklist back in 2013. I've been a big fan of the series, though I'm awful at the games and have been playing them since the original Splinter Cell. While cleaning my home today, I had an idea for a new Splinter Cell game using current events as a backdrop. 

I call it Splinter Cell: Insurgency 

The game opens with a younger Sam Fisher, driving furiously down the road. He's not a green agent, nor the veteran go-to man for Third Echelon yet, more a well-heard of rising star. His daughter is in the backseat, now seven years old and suffering from a rare and fatal but treatable disease. 

When he arrives at the hospital to initiate treatments, he finds another woman in front of him, her child suffering from the same issues and being told that her health insurance won't cover the treatments and that the astronomical costs of the drugs, treatment and everything else would likely bankrupt her. The conversation continues, until the woman in a blind rage nearly assaults the doctor and is quickly escorted out of the hospital by security.

Sam, then guiltly turns over his NSA health insurance card which allows his health insurance to cover the disease and get his daughter treatment. Later that night, Sam is reading a newspaper, the players can see a close up of the front page listing off a small but growing death total for the disease and political unrest growing around it as the election season begins. Just as Sam is getting ready for bed and putting his now cured daughter to sleep, he receives a call from the Third Escalon, informing him that he has a mission.

Sam is quickly brought into the agency, debriefed on a domestic terrorist cell building itself out of a compound constructed beneath the streets of New Orleans, Louisana. The NSA has reason to believe that the group plans to perform some form of attack during Mardi Gras, which is only three weeks away. 

Sam is transported to New Orleans to gather intel on the organization and prevent the attack from happening. During his investigations, Sam discovers that the organization is hoping to use growing racial divisions and alt-right activity and I.S.I.S (All renamed for the sake of fictionality) dogma to misdirect people away from their attacks and throw the trail off. Already possessing firm evidence of their plans, but nothing in the way of their goals, Sam heads in deeper but ultimately comes up empty but finds a name, ""Antonio Guevara"".

After extraction increased police presence in Mardi Gras prevents the worst from happening; however, multiple reports of police brutality, drunkness, racial profiling and several assaults put further mistrust on the police. Third Escalon is suspicious about this, but several nay-sayers in the organization simply chalk it up to racists within the Southern states. A full investigation is called from another set of cells into each of the men that the reports called out, only to be hastened by Sam's information.

Following the events, Sam is tasked with tracking down and capturing Guevara and bringing him in alive for questioning. Sam arrives in Mexico City, finding the entire area in disarray do to its own political unrest and dissent from those in power. Sam does his best to avoid various people and protests taking place in the streets and finds himself traveling through a server farm hidden inside of the main portions of the city. During his stealthing, he over here's various people of multiple nationalities discussing the global political climate, the unrest that's brewing and the chance for a true 'people's' uprising to take place. There are also a few statements of remorse for having to plant these seeds.

Arriving at his attended location, Sam and Antonio enter into a Mexican stand-off 'pun intended' the moment he's in the room. Antonio had been expecting him. During their conversation, Antonio reveals he's the grandson of Che Guevara and is continuing the man's legacy not by trying to implement a Marxist ideology, but by opening the eyes of the people to the truth and giving them power once more. He even chastises Sam for using his advantages as a government agent to get what many can't and to save his daughter's life. 

The conversation can't be heard by the NSA or Third Escalon during the moment thanks to a multitude of communication jammers surrounding the building. Leaving Sam with the choice at the end of the mission to attempt to capture Antonio or to let him go.  Regardless of the outcome, Antonio tells Sam at the end.

""Join Us Fisher, It's time that we show the world that 'Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted'.""

Sam returns home from the mission, receiving either praise for capturing Antonio or being chastised for failing to bring him in. Returning home, he finds private emails on his computer from an 'Erudito' giving him an invitation to learn more about the revolution he just stumbled into and being a part of it.

The rest of the game follows Sam's choices to become either a part of the global insurgency creating political chaos and putting power back into the hands of the people with controlled information leaks, the creation of unrest that political and corporate agendas aren't prepared to handle and continued efforts to undermine those currently in power or does he stick to his loyalties with the Third Escalon and those who offer him a more comfortable life.

personalfinance,Completely overwhelmed and crushed by debt. Need emergency advice.,"So this is a throwaway because I'm ashamed of having gotten to this point. My finances are completely wrecked and I need advice on how to treat this emergency debt situation.

So I'm a full-time student that has idiotically built up a ton of credit card debt. I graduate at the end of this year, so I had planned on using this school year to pay down my cc debt, but that is proving to be nearly impossible.

Alright, so I owe $6,994.97 in credit card debt on a single credit card (Amazon Rewards Visa) with a 20% interest rate. I have tried to get another credit card, credit line increase, balance transfer, or personal loan, none of which I qualify for (presumably due to my student loans and/or cc debt).

My income for one month is around $600 as I can only work part-time as an intern on federal work study. I also picked up a job doing audio transcription from home (since school+internship makes working normal hours anywhere extremely difficult), but it is obviously not lucrative at all and probably brings in $40/month at the most.

The following are the bills I pay each month:

Rent - $766
Household bills - $40 (my share w/ 3 roommates)
Cell phone - $100
No car/transportation costs
No groceries/spending on food

Total: $906 in bills

So obviously my bills are much more than my income each month. I do also receive a financial aid disbursement each semester, but I was only refunded $1,500 for the entire semester (Aug - Dec) this time and I have finally run that fund dry. I am panicking now because although I haven't used my credit card since August, I still cannot get on top of this debt. I can't afford food, I'm certainly not going to be able to afford Christmas at all, and I cannot even pay my minimum amount due on my credit card.

It seems to me that it's pretty much hopeless at this point unless I can somehow get another part-time job very quickly (which I'm pretty much spending all my free time applying for), but if there is any other advice anyone can offer, I would really appreciate the help!",finance

personalfinance,22 year old budgeting advice,"Hello all!

Current situation:

Monthly Net: $3450

Rent: $1500 (HCOLA)

Car + Insurance: $420

Phone: $80

Department of Transportation: $88 (got into a car accident that only damaged some guard rails. Have to pay that off for the next year)

Food: $150

Internet: $40

Utilities: $100

Fun/Incidental: $200

Gas: $60


I am also contributing monthly to a 401k @6% with a 3.5% employer contribution.
I also have a starter emergency fund of $1k.

My student loan situation is...interesting. I have federal loans but am not required to start making payments until July of next year. I intend to pay towards them regardless beginning 1 January. 

Loan details: $24k @ 4.2%

At this point, my gut instinct is to put most of the additional ~$600 a month (about $400) into loans. Is this line of thinking correct?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on where/how to start with debt,"Long story short but still kind of long- I left my good job to focus more on finishing school and went to retail to have a flexible schedule. Retail pay started to affect my bills but I was trying to stick it out hoping to finish school before it got too bad. Maybe 8 classes shy of completion things were getting really bad and I was basically only paying my car note and rent (barely- my car note was behind about 3 payments) I made the decision to enlist in the military to save myself. While I was in boot about 5 credit cards defaulted and are in collections. I’m doing better now financially and I now have a steady paycheck with about $390 of disposable after I pay my bills. Also I caught up on my car note. I’m  going out for deployment in a few months and I know I’ll be making a lot of money that will benefit paying off my debt sooner than later. I’m not sure what I’d get for taxes this year since I usually got most back for being a student so I don’t know what to factor in for that. 

My question is where do I even start? I’m 23 and still immature as far as finances and clearly I didn’t know what I was doing hence I’m in a huge hole now. I want to call them all but I want to have a plan first so I know what to say and I won’t freak out and just throw money at them in a non beneficial way.
 Before I left my good job to fully pursue college I had never missed a payment and had a credit score of 720ish. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. I know about SCRA and I do plan on sending in the reduce previous interest rates to 6% but other than that I’m at a loss of where to begin.

personalfinance,"I had cancer at 22, now I have 7 debt collectors threatening me for money, while I'm still trying to finish college.","Ok, here we go. I'm a full time college student. I took out loans for all of it. I'm $30k in debt studying land surveying. It's a really physical job so I can't get an Internship until I'm healthy again. I'm 2 years from graduating. 

This last summer, I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin lymphoma. Luckily, 3 months before I got diagnosed I got a form a Obamacare. So my insurance covered like 95% of the hospital bills. I went to 3 different hospitals for treatment and was seen by atleast 30 doctors over the last 4 months. Each doctor billing me/my insurance company.

I had to leave my apartment complex and move out without 60 day notice and my cats ruined my carpet so my apartment complex billed me $1200 and sent me to a debt collector. 

My brother was nice enough to let me live with him debt free for a while to get back on my feet but there is no end in sight. 

 I just finished my last round of chemo, so now it's time to worry about the bills. Well, each bill, was sent to a debt collector because I didn't pay any of them while I was getting treatment. It was obviously the last thing on my mind. Well, since I've been in school for four years, federal aid told me they're going to start charging me monthly because I've reached my borrowing limit.

 So In total, my credit is ruined, I might not be able to finish school and get a job, I'm barley able to work part time as it is right now, and I'm bringing in no more than $500 a month. My car insurance, car payment, school repayment, credit card payments (isn't much), debt collectors, and left over hospital bills, I just don't know what to do. My family has no money as it is so they can't help and I've applied to atleast 10 different financial aid assistant programs through the hospitals but it just isn't helping. 

I added up all my credit card and debt collector debt and it's $4500. My hospital debt is $10k and counting. My school loans are $30k and I still owe $5k on my car. I'm just so afraid I'm going to lose everything and it's not even my fault. 

Any advice on where to start would be amazing. Thank you all for reading.

personalfinance,What type of loan is this?,"Picture: https://imgur.com/a/4uaff

A) Is this a federal loan, or a private loan? It is via AESSuccess.org. I am trying to help my girlfriend take on this loan as it was originally taken out by her father. Unfortunately, he is getting older and no longer employed and wants her to transfer the loan to her name. Supposedly it is a parent plus loan, but I don't see anything about a parent plus loan here, and I'm not familiar enough with the terminology to see if this is a federal loan, private loan, plus loan, or regular non-plus loan. Any ideas?

B) And in case anyone is extra knowledgeable about these types of things, is there a way to transfer the loan in AES from one person to another without refinancing?

C) However, that being said, since it is 8%, it would be a smart idea to refinance anyway, correct? In that case, what options are there aside from Sofi? I submitted an application to get a rate and they are ""reviewing"" it, so I am looking for alternatives in the meantime.

Our main goals are lower interest rate, drastically lower monthly payment (such as $50 or less), and the ability to officially transfer the loan from my gf's father's name to her name. Thank you for any advice you can provide. We greatly appreciate it.",finance

I went from making 50K to 150K, although about half of that is a bonus, which is taxed differently. This increase in pay involved a move to one of the most expensive places to live in the country and a dramatic increase in workload. 

Before I moved, I thought I ""did the math"", weighing the raise with the increase cost of living. I mean, even if it's twice as expensive to live here, I'm making triple, right?! 

Uh...I didn't actually do the math. That was the entirety of my reasoning. I didn't account for state income taxes being almost ten times what I paid in the last state I lived. Or that my rent would be more than triple for a shittier place in a shadier neighborhood. My dry cleaning five times more....gas...groceries...all of it. 

And I especially didn't calculate the increase in overall percentage that Uncle Sam wanted to keep from my pay. So I'm starting to calculate my taxes, anticipating a refund (because when you're making six figures but still eating peanut butter sandwiches several times a week, you need something to look forward to) and I discover that actually I'm going to owe the government.

personalfinance,Looking for a high interest APY to start emergency savings fund,"I'm 26 and doing well financially: $80,000 a year, matching 401k contributions with my employer at 6%, and maxing out my HSA contributions as well. However, I don't have 6 months worth of savings anywhere (that wouldn't involve pulling out of my 401k accounts). I have about $4,000 in my savings account at BoA at the moment. Creating an emergency savings is now a priority of mine. 

I'm looking for advise on a high interest rate account to store my money in that, if needed, I can get you it easily and relatively quickly. I'm not interested in investing it, because I in no way want the amount I have saved to decrease. I'm not interested in starting to save this large sum of money worth BoA at their current apy of .01%. 

While reading through several posts on this topic, I came across Consumers Credit Union. There are some hoops to jump through you get their 4.59%, but that shouldn't be a big issue for me. Does anyone know if you can deposit checks using their app? Are there any down sides compared to a standard checking account? I don't remember the last time I went to a physical BoA branch, so being online only isn't a deal breaker for me (I live on the east coast). I'm thinking about moving all of my account (checking and savings) over to this to take full advantage of the high rate. I've also read about the insight prepaid card at 5%, I'd probably open up 2 accounts here and keep close to $5,000 in each and to a monthly ACH push/pull out of it monthly to keep it active. The only downside I see with this is that I'm not exactly sure how I'd pull money out if I needed it. Probably worth a ACH, but all of that would be new to me.

This includes marking the date in my calendar with reminders, so I make sure to pay it off before the promotional period ends.

But I was thinking, will it be better?  I mean, the money I have to divert eventually to paying off the 0 card is money that can't go to the one with interest, so am I really better off?  I THINK the answer is yes, because the interest rate is higher than the balance transfer fee (12%vs 4%), and the only real drawback is that it decreases planning flexibility, since it basically requires me to pay off a certain amount of debt by a certain date.

Thing is I can only have a **debit card** with this bank (Chase), and I want to be able to get a credit card and start generating credit, since its the way to go albeit I'm responsible. 

Thing is I am **not** a US citizen so no social but I did used to live here when I was a kid with my family as a military so I have the **United States Uniform Services card** (the peach colored one) on my name, but it has expired since then, I give this info since I should be able to apply the Navy Federal Credit Union? or not?

Is there any credit union or bank that will allow me to apply for a credit card.

Other additional info: 

* the military card that I mentioned has an F SSN, I went to a social security agency, and they told me that number isn't a SSN but a Tax ID number, which starts with a 9. 

* I've been told by other people that BofA does give credit cards and generates credit even if you dont reside in the US or are a US citizen? But from what I read here, BofA is awful?.

personalfinance,Graduating from medical school in a few months. No clue how to budget or do anything,"I'm graduating from medical school in a few months. My parents were able to take out a loan for the vast majority of my education at a low interest rate, 2% or something IIRC.

I've never had a budget. I know I spend money frivolously, but I honestly have no idea what to do to curtail my spending. 

My goal is to pay back my federal loan ASAP and then immediately switch gears and start paying my parents back for the loan they withdrew for me.

personalfinance,(Old Post) - 22 years old - I am over 100k in debt. Any advice is much appreciated.,"About 3 years ago I posted the below story on this sub, but ended up deleting that reddit account, so the original post was lost. I am re-posting this because I want to reference it on the Weekend Discussion and Victory Thread. Here is the post I made on the Victory Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7dnzcn/weekend_discussion_and_victory_thread_for_the/dq26lzi/

Here is the original post from 2014 when I was over 100k in debt:

I apologize ahead of time for the long post. I want to provide as much information as possible in order to receive the most accurate advice.

First, please don’t give me a “you should’ve done this instead” speech. I have heard it and given it to myself enough. I have also accepted that I have gotten myself into this situation and it is no one’s fault but mine.

Here’s the background information:
I live in the United States and went to a well-known university. I come from a middle class family and did not have a college fund.

Unfortunately, I thought it would be a great idea to go to an expensive university regardless of no college fund and pay for everything with student loans. I went the full four years, and graduated with a degree in Human Biology. I got a Human Biology degree because I thought I wanted to become a doctor.

Realistically, I was interested in science, but I think I just told myself I wanted to be a doctor in order to justify taking out a shit ton of loans for college because, hey, all doctors are buried in debt, right?! Why not just start the debt off with undergrad too?! That way I can still get the away-from-home college experience and have tons of fun! Sigh, young ignorance.

Well, after four years of shadowing doctors and then graduating, I came to the conclusion I did not want to commit to medical school because I did not want to live the life of a doctor. I also needed to start making money. So, I decided I would combine my science degree and natural social skills in order to pursue a career in medical sales.

That’s when I found a sales opportunity in a startup company near me. The company is not in the medical industry, but I figured it would be a great way to gain experience in sales and the risk may be worth the reward. I’ve been there since August 2013. Management has shifted around and we’re now at a time where I think it will truly get big. I have moved from a sales position to an administrative position because the company really needed me there after an employee left. However, I have been promised that after we land this big account and get processes going underway for it in January, I will be given a role on that account and my pay will significantly increase (through the grape vine I’ve heard numbers like 65-70K, but I obviously can’t bank on office gossip). Therefore, I am giving the company until January or February 2015. If I don’t have a pay raise by then I’m out.

My job’s hours are a standard 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday. With my current starting salary, I take home $2,330.74 a month after taxes. This totals to $27,968.88 a year.

For my living situation, I am back in my parents’ house since graduating. I am fortunate enough to have loving parents who have told me countless times that I can stay with them as long as I need to in order to get myself financially straight. This means I don’t have to pay for food, rent, and other costs of living.

My debt consists of student loans and an auto loan.

All of my student loans are through Sallie Mae. The following is the current status of my PLUS loans, which are co-signed in my mother’s name:

Direct Parent PLUS at $19,502.18 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $19,245.76 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $18,860.66 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $2,696.21 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $18,564.63 with interest rate of 7.65%

TOTAL PLUS LOANS: $78,869.44

I have made consistent payments on these loans since December of 2013, when my grace period ended, and I am now making a monthly payment of $618.38 with about $118 going towards the principal and $500 towards interest. This is with a 25 year repayment plan. I switched to this from the 10 year repayment plan, because otherwise my payments were a little over $900 a month.

Here is the list of student loans solely in my name:

Direct Unsubsidized at $6,874.38 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $8,377.61 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $4,057.56 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $1,062.37 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $1,038.42 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Subsidized at $2,697.50 with interest rate of 3.15%

Direct Subsidized at $2,697.50 with interest rate of 3.15%

TOTAL DIRECT LOANS: $26,805.34

I have made consistent payments on these loans since December of 2013, when my grace period ended, and I am now making a monthly payment of $176.30 with about $44 going towards the principal and $132 going towards interest. This is with a 10 year repayment plan.

For both loans I have done the automatic withdrawal option in order to receive a slight reduction in my interest rates.

CURRENT TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT: $105,674.78 (ouch)

For my auto loan:

The principal balance is $14,686.22 with monthly payments of $258.85 at an interest rate of 2.84%

TOTAL OVERALL DEBT: $120,363 (even more ouch)

Other than my loans, my monthly expenses are as follows:

Auto Insurance: $105.7

Contribution towards family phone plan: $25

Haircut: $30

Gas: ~$60

Social: ~200-300 (This is the hardest one for me, as I’m sure it is with most people. This may seem high but it’s more like my ideal number than reality because I always end up surpassing it. My will power is awful when it comes to saying no to social activities; regardless of cost. I’m a very social person with a lot of friends and being with/going out with them is something I love and makes me happy. Unfortunately, I always end up breaking my budget over it).

TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES: ~$420 to $520

TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES INCLUDING LOANS: ~$1574.23

MONEY LEFT OVER PER MONTH AFTER EXPENSES: ~$756.51

Within the last month, I have just reached my goal of saving up an emergency fund of $5,000.

After reading this far, you may ask why I haven’t gotten a second job. Well, since January 2014 I went through a variety of health issues that did not permit me to do so. However, I’m much better now and I think this is an option at this point. I have about 4 years of experience serving tables and I may try to find a second job doing that during weeknights or on the weekends, or maybe try and become an Uber driver or something. I think another element of this is that it has also taken me a little over a year to break out of denial of my current situation and accept that I need a second source of income. Badly.

I know that I should live frugally, which means I seriously need to work on my will power. I know I should also attack the loans with the highest interest rates (PLUS Loans), but with my current position in a job where I’m not paid much and I’m simply waiting and hoping for things to pick up—it’s difficult to allocate extra money towards them. Should I consider an income based repayment plan? Or keep how I’m going, get a second job, live frugally, and hope my 9-5 job does actually increase in pay by January?

So, there is my story. If you’ve made it this far—thank you so much. If you have any advice—thank you even more. It would mean the world to me. I don’t really have anyone to go to and the reality of this situation throws me into extreme waves of depression and anxiety. I want so badly to be independent financially and out of my parents’ house. I also want to end this feeling of barely keeping afloat and that I'm stuck in a rut forever. It took me over a year to build up the courage to write this post and I’m ready to make some serious changes. If you have advice, please provide it.

EDIT (This Edit was made in 2014 when I originally made this post): Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back to this, but I just want to say thank you so much for all the advice and direction you guys have given me. After reading the comments, I have contacted my friend who works at a restaurant near me and he said he can get me a job serving tables a few nights a week. I figure I will be able to make an extra $150-300 a week doing this, and it will also cause me to cut down on my social budget. I am also going to start off with the Snowball method to tackle some of the smaller Direct loans with my remaining income from each month in order to get the ball rolling and get the positive emotional drive to keep motivated in getting myself out of this hole. After I knock a few of those out I am going to stay focused on the PLUS loans because it just makes more sense to work on them since they have the highest interest rate. I'm going to use tools like, www.unbury.us which were provided below. I didn't know about that website--it's awesome. I am also going to stay at my parent's place for at least a few more years until my debt is significantly cut. As for my 9-5 job, I know a lot of people are telling me to get a different job right now. I am going to stay at my current one until January/February 2015 because if this company does work out, I'm at the ground floor and in a great spot to rise with it. If things don't change for the better like I have been promised, then I'm out. Again, thanks a ton, guys. I needed the guidance and kick in the ass this gave me. For anyone else in my situation; just don't give up, you're not alone.",finance
btc,Tethers,"Tethers bank account was frozen. Withdrawls are frozen. Its non redeemable.

When it became non-redeemable then it could no longer implode from withdrawls.

Its used for leveraging up positions and making money will derivatives and market rigging without putting capital at risk.

I have not figured out how tether will implode. I think I know the guy doing this actually. They know what they are doing and are extremely efficient and organized.

He did a lot of things so he wont get arrested or anyone will even know he was involved when/if it implodes. The liability will be with tether, who had no liability. Right now is just making a lot of money.

The whole bitcoin market is being centrally rigged and its not even FED printing up money and doing it.

When the tethers collapse he does not care. He will have all the coins bought with it and massive trading profits.

The way tethers work is that you have a bank account with $800 million in it. Sitting there doing nothing. Then you create $800 million in tether.

Then you use the tether created out of nothing to buy bitcoin and real coins/assets. Then you use the bitcoin you bought to suppose the tether price so it does not implode from people dumping.

Then there is no obligation at all to redeem the tether for the money in the bank account. At all. There is no redemption.

After this implodes it will be used as pretense for regulating what exchange pairs can be listed on exchanges.",cryptocurrency

We've had a fair amount of posts talking about marketing this past week.  Unfortunately, we don't have a paid marketing arm of LTC right now.  In light of this, I decided to whip up a print and paste flyer so we can leverage what we do have: Man power.

I believe it's a perfect time to do get these out there with Thanksgiving right around the corner because there'll be a lot of foot traffic in shops, malls, restaurants, etc.

# The LTC Flyer

1. You'll see that there are rip off tabs at the bottom too so make sure to cut those up to be easy to rip.
2. There is a QR code that links back to the LSC so that they can learn more.
3. Here is the [colored version](https://imgur.com/ev7zq1I)
4. And [Black and White](https://imgur.com/Mg2ampi) cuz it's cheaper.
5. I welcome any suggestions to improve this flyer as I am not a graphic designer.  Or if you can make a better one let's talk. I plan on having more LTC flyer campaigns in the future.

# The Goal

My goal is to get these printed in 100 cities.  If you actually print and paste them, I'd love to see photos of them!  Upload them on imgur and paste them here.  Include your city if you feel comfortable enough.  

Though we don't have thousands of dollars to spend on marketing campaigns, that shouldn't stop us from moving forward because what we do have is each other. Remember, many hands make light work.

Lastly, if anyone can commit to volunteering for 6 months to help build a marketing campaign plz PM me.  I know it's a long shot.  But it's worth a try.

edit:

As a side note, it may be expensive to print off your own printers.  If you go to fedex, you can print these at a set price.  If the Black and White is too light, take the colored version and choose the BW option.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Am I spread to thin?,"Hello Personal Finance,

Im a recent follower of this subreddit, its become such an excellent resource in my quest for financial stability. However, I feel like I've hit a wall recently. 

In July I created a budget for myself, as well as opening accounts with Mint and CreditKarma to monitor to my spending. This was in response to finding out my housing situation was about to radically change and my rent would be raised by $200 a month. I would have virtually no wiggle financially. In the process of creating a budget i discovered my true financial health. I had no savings, my only credit card was maxed out (1,500 @ 6.90%) and my minimum payment was doing nothing to pay it off, the same was true for the minimum payments on my last student loan (8,000 @ 5.84%), and a credit score of 615.  With the help of CreditKarma and Mint I was alerted to being put into collections immediately and was able to pay it off the same day, I was also able spot several mistakes in my credit report. In the last few months I have brought my credit card down to 1000, my student loan to 7600, an emergency fund of about 200, and a credit score of 680. I also started to experiment with online microinvesting through 3 apps, Acorns, Stash, and Betterment with about 300 between them. 
This month my company (small but growing) offered a 401k plan with a matching contribution. I have 6% of my gross income (31,200 a year) going towards it. I also started a second job with the paycheck from that going straight to my debt (an additional 200-300 a month). 
My housing situation is now stable and I feel like I am in a safer place financially than I have been in the last 5-7 years. However, I feel like my priorities are shifting. Im trying to get into grad school to chase a career that I love (and pays more), but Im running into financial difficulties. I applied to FAFSA for a loan and was only awarded 6000; I'll need about 15K a year. I then went to my credit union to inquire about a loan through them. I qualified, but based on my credit score the interest rate would be 17.99%. If I managed to get my score above 705 then that rate would drop to a minimum of 7%.
So (thank you for sticking with me this far) what do I do? I feel that I'm trying to do too many things: paying off debt, investing, retirement fund, emergency fund, saving for school. As if there are too many pots that are getting filled with too little. What should my priorities be? My current thought is to just put all my money into paying off my debt, plus the money towards my 401K, and then whatever is leftover saving for my emergency fund. What do you all think?
I appreciate any help or insight. Thank you Personal Finance!",finance
personalfinance,Discover shows that my FICO credit score dropped 39 points since last month.

personalfinance,I accidentally overpaid a bill with Wells Fargo. Should I transfer money from another bank account to prevent overdraft or expect the payment to fail due to insufficient funds?,"I paid Chase amazon $1800 instead of $180 due to a typo Friday. I could transfer cash from my credit union to Wells Fargo tomorrow morning to prevent overdraft, but my income is irregular so theres a small possibility that might leave me a bit tight funds wise as far as my rent/car payment as Chase will not give the $1600 or so back to me until 7–10 business days or Early December. 

I guess I’m looking for a prediction of the  likelihood that Wells Fargo will not make the payment due to insufficient funds and advice on the best course of action.  I already opened a claim to request they don’t pay out the bill scheduled to process Monday night (which they say first business evening fed reserve is open to actually move the money).",finance
personalfinance,"What percentage of my income should go toward paying more than the minimum on my student loans, investing, and saving?","I graduated back in May and got a job in July. My job is base salary + commission and while I anticipate that it will increase steadily as I handle more accounts (average salary is ~$75,000), as of now I'm making on average just under $4,000 per month after taxes). I was pretty bad at saving these last few months, so right now I have $8,000. Not terrible considered I graduated with no money in my bank account, terrible in context of how much I've earned so far and the fact that I live with my parents for free.

I have a 401k with employer matching and have good health/vision/dental insurance through my employer. My expenses other than my loans are basically just food/alcohol and miscellaneous purchases, even my transportation is taken out of my income before taxes. So my other expenses come down to my willingness to be frugal since I don't have any other financial obligations.

Anyway, my minimum loan payments are $1,720.79. My Federal loans payments aren't due until 12/20, but my private ones are due starting this month. Figured it can't hurt to just start paying all of them. Ideally, I'd like to pay off my loans in 5 years. Currently, the total of all my loans are ~$162,000. Using unbury.me, I figured out I'd need to pay $3,000 per month for my 5-year goal to be realistic. I can see myself maybe being able to make that work in a year, but obviously, spending 75% of my income on loans isn't smart in the long run if I'm not saving anything. If I pay ~$2,640 per month, I'd be debt free in 6 years. I'm leaning toward the snowball method because I am incredibly unmotivated and seeing my accounts disappear will probably have a bigger impact on my sticking to this than saving $5,000 in interest. I have no credit card debt, just a few store cards I use for rewards that I pay off after each use. 

Here's the issue - I'd like to save for grad school. I'm trying to go to school abroad and the cost of the program is about $21,000 (my options are full time in one year or 2 years part time). I'm not entirely set on a program yet, but I'm not looking to spend more than $25k and will look at financial aid/scholarships. I opened up a high-yield Barclays account today and moved $1,000 from my checking account to this account to start saving for this.

I also opened up an Acorns account (I know very little about investing, but I thought it would be a good idea to have some secure savings and be able to grow my savings quicker by investing some money each month). Was initially going to use it instead of a high-yield savings account, but that's a little risky. I'm thinking recurring weekly or monthly investments at this point.

My spending was a bit out of control previously, but with meal prep, I've reduced it considerably. However, I plan on spending ~$700 on a ski trip next month and sometime next year, a trip to England, so I have some other short-term saving goals in mind as well.

Basically, my question is given this information, what is the optimal percentage of my income I should allocate toward paying my loans, saving, and investing? I was thinking of saving 20% of my income (~$800) per month. No idea where to begin with investing, maybe 5-10%? Advice would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if my logic makes sense, or if I'm missing anything (I realize I haven't thought much about a rainy-day fund, though my grad school savings could act as that if need be). Even an idea of how I should allocate the money I have right now would be incredibly helpful. Thanks for reading all of this! If there's anything that's already been written that I may have missed in the sidebar, just send me a link. Don't want to waste anyone's time. :)",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance an investment property that was previously my primary address?,"Greetings PF. I've been trying to soak up as much knowledge as I can before posting this, so let me know if I'm on the right (or wrong) track with my question.

I currently have a previous primary residence that's functioning as a rental property. It has about $35K equity if Zillow is to be trusted, and it's currently on a 30 year VA loan with a 5% interest rate. I normally rent it out for roughly 300~ more than my current mortgage payment. Credit score 800+.

My question is there any option where a refinance is remotely worth it since it's now classified as an investment property? Due to the previous VA loan, my current lender is the only bank that is able to process my refinance (if I were going to go with another VA loan), and I'm being quoted around 4.1% for a 15 year or 4.75% for a 30 year. I was planning on going with the 15 year rate, but comments from previous PF posts kind-of point in a direction of:

1) Sell house. Put money made from equity in funds in accordance with the PRIME DIRECTIVE.
2) Keep house. Put money that I would have paid extra on principal in accordance with the PRIME DIRECTIVE. (Does this apply/is it worth it to not pay extra on principal if my interest rate is 5%?)

If I take it now, it'll be the full amount, nothing withheld, and I'll get a 1099. I'll have to pay the taxes on it myself, which will apparently involve something called estimated tax? I don't *need* the money right now, but it'd be nice to have it sooner to invest or something. And also my regular income next year will be enough to put me in a higher tax bracket.

I've always used turbotax without issue, but in past years my income has a been single W2; with this it'd be a W2 from one state and a 1099 from another. Plus it looks like I'd have to calculate and pay federal &amp; state estimated tax by Jan 15.

The majority of my Bitcoin gains came from loans on BLC but what's left of those non-defaulted profits were cashed out years ago to pay for useless things like mortgages and groceries.

I dabbled in LBC trading but I found I needed to keep to close an eye on it to respond quickly to buyers but too much time wasted waiting 20 mins for a reply.  Plus I primarily relied on my Western Union app through my bank which didn't work 10% - 20% of the time. Too many horror stories with PayPal so I try to keep big money transactions away from there.

Add to it states/feds cracking down on LBC'ers for not having expensive money transmitter licenses. 

I've invested into Cloud Mining enough to make minimum profits and enough to learn it's a scam. I don't have to cojones to invest $1k - $2k into an antminer.

I have a stable full time 40+ hours /week dayjob. I have a life outside of work as well pretty much only giving me late evenings to work on the latest offerings from /r/beermoney but I want to step up and make more than a few measly bucks a night.

personalfinance,I am 24 y/o Computer Science student taking only 1 course because it's all I can afford. How do I pull myself out of this situation?,"Long story short: A few years ago, I was going to college and doing well academically. However, depression hit me hard and destroyed my life. I dropped out of college, and spent a large amount of time living at home with my abusive mother. My mother compounded my issue of depression. 

Then some new things happened this year: I am trying to get back on track with my life. I was able to get SSD which is 800/month. I had 16k in student loans forgiven as I became considered disabled. I was able to find a place to stay near my old college (Rutgers) for 500/month. I was able to pay for 1 course at Rutgers with my money my grand mother gave me (2k). So this semester I'm going part time to Rutgers (only 1 course). 

My problems:

I don't know how to pull myself out of the current situation I am in. I am barely surviving. 

I hate where I'm living. It's a special type of ""supervised"" apartment run by the government for people with mental health issues. There is suppose to be staff here to help me with living on my own, but they are understaffed here. They barely help me. The other day I begged them to drive me to the food bank, and only after calling their boss at a different location did they help me. That was the only time they did anything for me in weeks. I have 3 elderly room-mates with issues. There is not enough room for the 4 of us in this apartment and it's very difficult to concentrate or relax here because of the noisiness. As part of the agreement to live here, I have to give them 40% of my salary when I get a part-time job. That alone is enough reason why I have to leave I think.  I hate this place.

I can't pay for college without getting loans. I have no savings. I cant apply for fafsa and get federal loans without getting my 16k in federal loans unforgiven. So I don't know how I'm going to continue going to school.

I am barely getting by with the amount of money I live on. I have about 50 dollars week + food bank assistance to live on. It's extremely difficult.

I have no support system. My relationship with my mother is very poor. She is the only family I have. She has helped me very minimally while I been living on my own. The little money that she did give money she expects me to pay back. I don't have a license yet, I walked to the DMV and got my permit last month. I need someone to teach me how to drive. It seems like my mom wont.

Situational depression is starting to hurt me now too I think.

My goals: 

I need to upgrade my living standards largely by moving out of the hell-hole I'm living in right now. And I either want to find a job, or find a way to pay for school, or both. Ultimately I want a job as a programmer. I think I'm good at programming and I tried applying for entry level jobs without a degree, but had no luck.

btc,Tethers Are Artificially Inflating Alt Coins,"The approx value of tethers issued is approx 1 billion USD. This is less than 1% of the market cap of Bitcoin BTC, and less than 5% market cap of Bitcoin Cash.

There are very many Alt Coins that are traded, utilising Tether, to switch into, and out of trades.

In my view, there are some bad actors, trying to use Tethers to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), about Tether correlation to Bitcoin BTC price.

If Tethers collapsed, or were removed, the base currency for trading Alt Coins would once again be the dominant Bitcoin BTC chain.

Personally I think that we would see a flight towards Bitcoin BTC, not away from it, if something bad was to happen to Tethers.

btc,Tether's business model,"There are a lot of people calling Tether a scam, I am not saying they aren't and I am keeping my distance, but that said; it looks like a sound business model unless there is something I don't understand?


**Situation:**
Exchanges are not getting love from the banks, but they want to offer a USD based pair for their crypto for their customers to margin trade on.


**Solution:**
Create a Token and back it with real USD, now you can offer margin trading on it


**Where do they get the money to back the token?**
They offer interest earned from the margin traders,
Bitfinex daily interest rate is ~0.078% or 28%pa?

So if Tether offer millionaires a deal to sit their money in Tethers bank account (that can't be reclaimed with Tether anyway?) for anything over 5%pa then surely they are going to have a line around the block offering funding?

**Risks for the bubble:**
So the main risk I see at the moment are exchanges not liquidating customers quick enough on big price movements.

Bitcoin (BTC): I personally see BTC lasting forever as a bridge between the fiat and crypto world as an exchange coin. I decided to buy during the second great crash due to BCH as my view and support of it

Litecoin (LTC): I personally see this coin under value and makes up most of my investment in Crypto and see it rising higher in the future

Ripple (XRP): xrp is probably my fav investment yet. It makes up another chunk of my investment. With a coin to help cross border payments and work with the banks it’s just crazy not to invest in.

Cardano (ADA): I decided to choose ada because of the low value and from research it’s suppose to put perform ethereum and is backed by high educated people supporting this crypto

Reddcoin (RDD): I know the price of this coin is nothing, but establishing a market which in this case it’s Social Media, which if it works it could become hugh

Siacoin (SC): The idea of this company drove me to it. With using online storage by using other people’s computer storage that is out of a blockchain with it being encryption in parts across the chain. In which pays the people giving their computer space in siacoin. A remarkable idea that drive to this coin.

Potcoin (POT): Living in the United States, I just see this coin as a long term trade, but not too long since it would be a matter of time before federal law makes it legal across the states.

We keep getting these offers in the mail for loans or something (I don’t really understand) that I think will pay off the credit cards and then we pay that company back with lower interest? I’m not exactly sure how it goes.

Any advice is appreciated and I can answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. 



Edit:
Sorry first time posting here. 
Debt: 30,000 in credit cards and 30,000 in student loans. Student loans are very low interest rate, like 3%. Credit cards range from 0%(for now) to 27%. 
Income: 3,500 a month
Expenses: current budget is set at 3,300 a month but that’s if NOTHING extra happens, which it always does. (Need new clothes, car breaks, something else crazy etc)




Edit 2:

We live in San Diego so everything is very expensive. 

Rent:1200
Utilities: 400 (internet, phone, gas, electric, water, laundry)
Groceries and household: 350
Gas for car: 500
Car insurance: 150
Medical insurance and copays: 300
Payments on stuff: 500



Edit 3:

We are in that much debt (over the past 3 years it’s been stacking up) because (long story) a friend of mine asked us to adopt her baby because she was on drugs so we decided yes and my husband was still in school and I was working and so was he. I quit my job because the baby was potentially gonna have HIV and drug withdrawals and I wanted to be able to take care of her. So we were at a bit of a deficit because of lack of income but it was worth it. Then we paid about 20,000 in total for lawyer stuff (admittedly our lawyer was shit) and my friend ended up sobering up and taking the baby back after a year. I was heartbroken and went into a deep depression and did spend more money than I should have (so the other 10,000 is a combo of buying baby stuff, since we only had a month warning and no baby shower, and makeup and clothes and whatever else I splurged on while I was trying to feel better which I know was irresponsible and I’ve since gone to therapy and am much better now.). 

Ok I’ll just write debt stuff.

I looked into getting a balance transfer card or a debt consolidation loan to 
 help with my payments but I was not able to obtain them due to the fact that my score and/or my income is too low. Currently making $16.00/hour in FL. The credit card interest rates are what are killing me. Every time I make a payment, interest kicks in and basically negates it.  


The below is a list of my credit card interest rates: 

Card a: 23.90% - Opened 2013


Card B: 23.90% - Opened 2014


Card C: 22.90% - Opened 2015


I am looking to increase my income to help with this but I saw posts saying that I could ask the credit cards for a reduction in rate. How successful have you guys been with this? Are there any additional things I could do with the credit card companies to help me back a bigger dent in my debt? 


Update 1: Called Capital One and asked for them to take a look at my account in order to request for my APR to be lowered. After confirming that my account has been in good standing (no late payments still 2013) and going back and forth, they told me that they had no offers for me at this time and that 23.90% is the best they can offer. Asked for Hardship Programs to help me pay the debt back faster and they told me they don’t offer that. Capital One is extremely unhelpful...just was looking to lower my APR so I can make a bigger dent on the 11k.",finance
personalfinance,Best options using home equity to reduce debt,"I will try to include as much information as I can. Im looking for the best option in my particular situation.
The good:
Purchased my home in 2013 for $229k via FHA with 4.25 interest rate (im checking to verify this is the actual rate). We currently owe 205k. Appraisal value for the house would be between 295-300k currently. Mortgage payment is 1650/ month and approximately 300 is MI. 
The bad (debt)
Credit card 1 =12k
Credit card 2=8k
IRS = 7k
Medical (0% interest) 6,200
Car 7k
My student loans 2,500 (so close i can smell it)
Her student loans 50k (pay 350/month and that does nothing to the principal)
Mortgage 205k (as stated above)
A whopping total of $92,700 with out the mortgage and 297,700 including the mortgage.
The specifics:
Household income approx 180k/year. 
We have waited to refinance because i have a low yearly salary and get a monthly commission check. So I had to be a commission employee for two years before my commission would count as income. In September I hit my two years. 
My commission can vary dramatically (ive gotten $100 checks and Ive gotten 14k checks) although i have a pretty good idea as to what to expect each month. In the past we usually take my checks and will try to knock some of my debt out. My question is, should I just try to refi to knock the MI off my loan or should I use a cash out refi, HELOC, or home equity loan to consolidate some of the loans? I dont want to take all of the equity out, we were thinking of taking approx 35k to pay off everything except her student loans and car. Or should we continue doing what we are doing? We have a “relaxed” Dave Ramsey snowball approach where we are currently paying $800/month on my student loans. We have knocked out atleast 10-15k of debt this year.
We both have life insurance policies(500k each), a 1mil umbrella, college saving for our son, she has an IRA with about 40k(only currently adding $100/month), me a 401k with 7k (i was just eligible with my company at the beginning of the year and I’m contributing to get the max) 
As a note- most of this credit card debt occurred 2012-2015. The IRS debt is bc my wife was a 1099 employee and we owed approx 15k 2 years ago but have since created an S-corp with a low monthly salary and taking disbursements. The medical debt is from a surgery my wife recently had. Car debt, is my wifes car, mine is paid off and both will be kept for years.

ethereum,"How will Ethereum development, adoption, and price respond to Net Neutrality reversal in the U.S.?","Some background, as I know we're not all U.S. residents:

On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will outline new rules that will transfer power of regulating internet service providers from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - a move that will reverse regulations that ensured Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would serve websites without bias. 

The change is likely to pass as Trump appointed FCC chair, Ajit Pai, and two other Republicans control three of five votes on the new ruling. Amongst other things, the changes will allow ISPs to throttle access to some parts of the internet and provide 'fast lanes' for others.

- How will blockchain development in general respond?
- How will the changes impact Ethereum protocol adoption?

personalfinance,New job and not eligible for 401K for a while; how to handle retirement saving [x-post r/investing],"EDITED: updated loans to include APRs

**Age:** 27  
**Income:** $62,000/year (paid out twice a month)  
**Debt:** combined $60K in student loans ranging from 3.4 to 6.8 APR and car loan (car loan is $8K of the total) at 4.5 APR  
**Current investments:** $11K vested (out of $14K) in current 401K account and about 680 dollars in a Robinhood account  
**Savings:** 650 dollars in a savings account *(My first move on my new salary is to increase this to a decent emergency fund level and what follows below can take place afterwards.)*


Hello, all. I recently moved jobs, mostly because of the abysmal culture of my old company, but also because I was underpaid. I managed to move to a new place and get a 13.5K pay bump, which is nice. However, I am not eligible for their 401K plan for a year, plus they do profit sharing which is paid out at the end of the year. While the return has historically been good here, that means I won't get anything from them 401K-wise for a couple of years.
Obviously I would like to invest some of the increased pay I'm now getting. There are very few paycheck deductions since I'm on an HDHP. Less taxes, I get all of my paycheck minus $16.08 a month for dental. I also get $194 a month put into my HSA totally separate from my paycheck (not deducted).
I have about 11K vested in an existing 401K from my old company, and I don't have to roll it over. The provider is basically saying because of the amount in there, I essentially can just leave it and roll it over later. It won't be terminated and I don't have to withdraw anything.

To add to the mix, and this is important, I have about $60K of debt from student loans and a car loan. (At one point I wanted to be a historian and got my MA; also I didn't know much about money until a year or so ago, so I didn't buy a car cash like I should have done, plus I had no savings at that time.) I have no credit card debt or other debt of any kind.

The way I see it, I have several options here, but I'm not sure which is best.

Option 1: Pay off my loans as fast as possible. The obvious advantage here is I get out of debt faster. I'm also getting married next year and I'd like to saddle my fiance with as little debt as possible. She's very frugal, very smart with money, and has a pretty high income. I feel kind of bad piling debt onto her, even if she knew about it when she said yes. The downside is that my retirement account returns about twice what my highest loan interest rate is, so it might be smart to continue adding a little to a retirement account at least.

Option 2: Open an IRA and contribute to it while keeping my old 401K. Roll both into my company's 401K when I am eligible.

Option 3: Open an IRA and roll the 401K into it. Then roll that into the new 401K when I am eligible.

Options 2 and 3 allow me to keep saving, but I'm not sure what's involved in this or which is better. I'm also not clear on if I could just contribute on my own to my existing 401K account. My understanding is that contributions to 401Ks have to come from a paycheck, but I honestly don't know too much about it. Maybe there's even an option 4 I just haven't thought of. I'd like to know what people think. Thanks in advance!",finance
computers,IS THIS THE END OF THE DEMOCRATIC INTERNET?,"Trump’s FCC, Federal Communication Commission, is working to get rid of net neutrality. If they are successful, the Internet will no longer be a democracy. What does this mean, and why should you care? To answer this question, I interviewed Jeremy Gillula, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the leading nonprofit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital age also the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for the Internet. According to Gillula, net neutrality guarantees “no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization. So, no fast lanes, no blocking lawful content, and you can’t charge money to speed up or slow things down.” The end of net neutrality means the end of digital democracy: The end of the ability to access a free and open internet.  

THE BIRTH OF THE DEMOCRATIC INTERNET

Two years ago the FCC reclassified Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as common service providers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning that ISPs are regulated by the FCC. This means that ISPs are considered utilities, just like water, gas and electricity. Under Title II, ISPs are mandated by the government to give everyone the same service without discrimination. But now, the Trump administration wants to roll back net neutrality, thereby putting the freedom of the Internet in the hands of the ISPs. Ajit V. Pai, chairman of the FCC and former Verizon lawyer, is leading the charge to get rid of net neutrality. Pai is operating in favor of the ISPs who want net neutrality to end so that they can make more money.

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?

    Without net neutrality, ISPs can control what you see by restricting access to certain sites, or charging for access to others. For example, ISPs can drastically throttle or block your connection to Youtube or Netflix unless you pay a monthly premium. They can block access to news sites that they don’t like. Without net neutrality, ISPs are not required to provide complete access to everything on the Internet. According to Gillula, “If we rollback the rules it will stifle innovation in terms of what companies can do on the Internet… Without net neutrality it’s entirely possible that Internet providers could start treating…apps differently depending on their whim. They may start charging money… It will basically be that the Internet providers are the ones that get to decide what the Internet looks like instead of the free market.” For example, I like to browse Reddit, and the ISPs might be like, “someone on Reddit is saying something that we don’t agree with, so we’re going to block Reddit.” If the ISPs can control what people see and don’t see, they can stop some websites from forming entirely. For example in 2005 when Youtube was founded, if net neutrality didn’t exist, the creators of Youtube might’ve had to get their site approved by every ISP, a task that may have been too large to justify. However, in reality all they needed to do was buy a domain and publish their site. A world without net neutrality is a world where people may be afraid to express their ideas or products, and a world where the ISPs can censor the media. 

    NO NET NEUTRALITY EQUALS LESS COMPETITION 

    Without net neutrality, small startups and business will be impacted the hardest. If ISPs are not required to allow equal access to everything on the Internet, a small business that is attempting to draw customers will need to get their website whitelisted for each ISP.  ISPs may not allow users to access websites that are hosted by or will benefit their competitors. For example, if Comcast is making a lot of money from Google ad revenue, they may block access to Google’s competitors. According to Gillula, “The effect is really more pronounced on small businesses and innovators than it will be on users. From a user’s perspective you don’t really notice if some cool new service that you could have used never appears.”

I WANT YOU TO HELP PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY

    There is a small chance that the fight to save net neutrality could make its way to Congress, and net neutrality could make its way into being a federal law, meaning that Trump’s FCC would be forced to keep net neutrality. If you support a democratic Internet, then you need to contact your elected officials saying that you support net neutrality, and want it to be written into law. Freedom of information is key to a functional democracy, and if that freedom is taken away or restricted, we will not be able to make informed decisions and will therefore fail as a democracy.",technology

personalfinance,"24, Canadian looking to get finances on track. Need advice.","Hello Personal Finance!

I have been following this Subreddit for some time and have read some great advice so, I thought its time to ask some questions and look for guidance/advice on my own situation.

P.S. This is my first post so i will try my best to include all information. RIP formatting.

I am a 24 year old male living in the western side of Canada making *Gross* $40,000/year working full time. My take home pay is roughly $2600. 3 months ago i was making gross $27,000, take home was $1840 unless i earned commission which could be between $100-$600. Because of car, computer repairs and higher shared credit card expense (eating out, gas, recreation) money left over from my pay for the past 3 months was spent.

Please note that i have not graduated and going back to school isn't an option (as you will be able to tell).

I currently have 3 loans:

* $20,000 @5.7% (Student Loan 1)
* $5300 @3.7 (Student Loan 2)
* $3350 Loan from girlfriend to pay off my car loan which was @ 6.9%

Total Loans = $28,650

Living expenses per month are as followed:

* Rent $700 (Includes Rent/internet/utilities)
* Car insurance $130
* Phone $115 (Will most likely pay off remaining balance; $250, and get cheaper plan)
* $190 Loan 1 payment
* 70 Loan 2 payment
* $100 GF Loan payment
* $400 Personal credit card payment (Always paid off)
* $500 Shared credit card payment
Total cost/Month = $2205

Judging by the above information yes, i was living paycheck to paycheck which is not a good feeling. I have no savings, investments etc. Now that i am caught up i will share with you my plan. All advice is welcome, i really want to make a difference in my financial life and get on track.

My Plan:

* Continue making minimum payments on my loans and save up 3 months of emergency funds ($5000)
* Pay off $5300 loan for moral boost (i know paying of higher interest rate loan is better but i feel i can benefit from the smaller one first).
* Pay off $3350 loan
* Increase payments on $20,000 loan to $400/month
* With money left over save another 3 months or living expense.
* after 6 month living expense saved contribute as much as i can to remaining $20,000 loan amount.

That is pretty much it. A budget is most likely what i will have to create and strictly stick to it. I believe lowering my own CC costs, as well as the shared CC costs will be largely beneficial for me since my girlfriend has no loans. Please advise and help me get my financial life on track!

Thanks,",finance

Bitcoin,Support SafeDice Delayed or Not Working,"I invested some bitcoins to SafeDice.com .  And right after that I lost my LastPass auto-generaed password. It was a LastPass usage mistake.

On November 20 (2017),
I emailed to support@safedice.com to recover my coins or account. I provided the transaction details to prove the ownership of my bits.

So far no reply came from the support. Nothing.

I found other past discussions telling that they could get an answer but in more than one month.

Now I crossed my fingers and waiting. I will update if I ever get an answer or my coins could be considered lost.

Until they solve their support problems, it might be wise to stay away from them as you can make a mistake and your money becomes unaccessible for a while.

UPDATE: November 21. Support contacted me and solved the problem. That was much better than I had expected.

According to other reviewers and my experience, SafeDice is working honestly. However, it's unnerving not to know if they've got your support request even especially when money is involved.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Am I not taking advantage of better loan opportunities?,"Hello everyone, I'm currently in my second year of Pharmacy School. The savings I made for college tuition will be depleted after this next semester and I will start pulling out loans. This means I will need 2 full years of loans till I graduate in 2020. Tuition alone is 18k per semester, therefore I'll need 4 semesters of that at a rate of 5.3% for the direct Unsubsidized loan. My school does not offer subsidized loans for graduate programs. If my math is correct, my 72k in loans will have accumulated to about 90k by my graduation in 2020. Are there any alternate loan programs or methods I could seek out to perhaps lower that interest rate?

personalfinance,Wells Fargo increased my interest rate without telling me.,"I graduated from college in 2010. I had 3 personal student loans with interest rates of 3.25%, 3.0%, and 3.0% I have had it on automatic repayments and have been paying more than the minimum every month since graduating. In January Wells Fargo increased all my loan interest rates by .25%. The rates increased again in July and November resulting in 4.0%, 3.75%, and 3.75% rates respectively.  I have sent emails and called asking questions about the rate increase and why I was not warned about it.  I felt like I have gotten the run around every time. I am about at my wit's end trying to get a straight answer from them. With that, I am going to look to transfer all my loans away from Wells Fargo.
(Yes I know it can be seen that I am complaining while having a good interest rate, but it is the fact it was raised without warning that has me upset)

My question, is there a way I can report Wells Fargo for this act? I'm also looking for information to arm myself for next time I call them.

 I chose R/personalfinance over r/legaladvice because of banks and I'm sure this isn't the first time it has happened to someone in this thread.


EDIT: I found the contract and I do in fact have a variable rate loan. Womp Womp. I got spooled up over nothing, just expecting this to be another Wells Fargo Trick.

Andrzej Kwiatkowski is game designer who worked on Witcher 2 and 3 and is the author of Full Combat Rebalance for Witcher 2. Yesterday, he released a a gameplay and immersion mod for Witcher 3. Below is the mod's description.

##[Mod Nexus webpage and download location](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2788/?)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;#FCR3 - Immersion and Gameplay Tweaks by Andrzej Kwiatkowski
&amp;nbsp; 
&gt; #**INTRODUCTION**
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; Hey, I'm a senior gameplay designer and I worked on The Witcher3 and both expansion packs. This mod used to be a personal set of tweaks and fixes meant to spice up my first The Witcher 3 playthrough after releasing the game. Being in creation for more than half a year and enjoyed during &gt;300h playthrough I thought that I might share it with witcher community. Mod doesn't aim for any deep and intrusive changes, instead it is meant to maintain original feeling of the game, sometimes going closer to original intention behind the designs. It focuses mainly on fixing immersion breakers, buffing underperforming skills and items, cosmetic changes and bugfixing. It also fixes few instances of items and abilities that made Geralt (nearly) immortal and removed all the challenge from the game.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Installation**

&gt; Because mod affects character development, Geralt's abilities will be reset and skillpoints returned just as in case of free respec. It also comes with few compatibility fixes for other mods that I've been playing with.
&gt; 
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Compatibility fixes**

&gt; Full mod in version working with Nitpicker's Patch by CHC﻿ (full mod installation, don't use together with main file)
&gt; hotfix for Friendly HUD by wghost81﻿ (use together with full mod)
&gt; hotfix for Friendly HUD by wghost81﻿﻿ plus All Quest Objectives On Map by Wolfmark﻿ (use together with full mod)
&gt; 
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Uninstallation**

&gt; To return to vanilla character development after uninstalling the mod, please install ""uninstallation"" package, load and resave savegames affected by FCR3. This should revert all of the mod changes and provide you with another free respec. After resaving the savegame you need to remove uninstallation package or it will keep respecing Geralt each time you load the game.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Known issues**

&gt; Newly picked up crossbow bolts will have incorrectly calculated item level. Level will correct itself on each transition between maps, loading of saved game and Geralt’s level up. Maybe I’ll fix this issue at some point but the whole bolt damage scaling feature was a real pain to implement and I’m just tired of debugging it at the moment.
&gt; In character sheet padlocks visualizing locked rows of skills show incorrect level needed to unlock the row. Unfortunately these values are hardcoded in Flash and I cannot modify them in a mod. This is a cosmetic issue that doesn’t affect gameplay.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **List of modified strings for translation to other languages**

&gt; 1177865, 1071085, 1071086, 1177864, 1177863, 1135386, 1136195, 1135401,

&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; #CHANGELOG
&gt; 
&gt; **Immersion**

&gt; Bunch of features that added to ‘wow’ factor and changes for things that bothered me.

&gt; • Metamorphosis mutation effect ""Witcher Senses now increase visibility in dark places without the use of potions works"" works without the mutation. In combat it works automatically, while outside of combat it can be activated in focus mode. Witchers see in the dark. All of them, no potions needed. It’s in lore.

&gt; • Added reaction to stealing for commoners. There are two severities of reactions and two results for each of them depending on npc AI. Commoners will react depending on the priority of tasks they are undergoing at the moment. The effect is that some of the npcs will ignore you stealing stuff, others will call you out on it, some will just stare. There will be also rare cases when someone will be become intimidated, cover in fear or possibly run away. The effect is especially visible in Novigrad, less in Skellige and least in Toussaint, where even guards ignore player stealing.

&gt; • Increased minimal height from which fall damage starts to be applied.

&gt; • Made Ciri immune to damage while she's performing special 'teleport' charged attack. Could be considered as a bugfix.

&gt; • Allied NPCs (followers) deal full damage to enemies (used to deal minimal damage).

&gt; • Buffed sorceress and witcher followers damage. These are the most powerful characters in the setting, you should feel that now.

&gt; • Reduced level bonus of guards from player level plus random 11-13 to player level plus random 0-5. A random guard shouldn't pose a threat to legendary witcher.

&gt; • Sped up animations of flying monsters falling down after being shot from the sky.

&gt; • Added fall damage on ground contact for monsters that were shot from the sky. Damage depends on the height from which they fall.

&gt; • Allowed to bounce majority of the physical projectiles with Aard hit.

&gt; • Signs buffed by Flood of Anger skill cause enemy explosive dismemberment on kill.

&gt; • Sorceresses now dismember enemies on kill.

&gt; • Fixed majority of rare cases where Geralt jumped after hitting ground while playing death animation.

&gt; • Fixed some of the cases for sorceresses where spell visual effect remained on hand after combat. Still not sure if all instances were fixed but should be better.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Character development**

&gt; Multiple changes that aim at bringing back the original intended feeling to character development and alchemy builds. Initially skills were designed as a single point investments. The excess of skillpoints player was given was meant to encourage swapping skills depending on the enemies and situations. To bring back that feeling max levels of skills were reduced giving more bang for the buck instead of small percent increases. Additionally there are few changes bringing high toxicity Euphoria build down to be on par with other builds and buffs for mutations that didn’t feel strong or unique enough.

&gt; • Decreased skills max levels (most had 5, now 3) and adjusted stats to retain the same balance. Utility skills like slowdown on aiming now have only 1 level.

&gt; • Nerfed Acquired Tolerance skill to grant 0.5 Toxicity point per level to prevent safe activation of more than 3 decoctions at the same time in end game.

&gt; • Quen doesn't remove damage over time effects on cast, instead it protects player while DoTs consume the shield. Resistances on armors should matter more now.

&gt; • Reduced healing from damage on alternate Quen from 100% of received damage to 0.1 * damage * Spell Power. This mechanic was clearly overpowered and made player nearly immortal.

&gt; • Decreased toxicity overdose damage threshold from 75 to 50. That was the initial original idea for toxicity handling encouraging player to take risk and correctly time potion use.

&gt; • Equalized out of combat and combat toxicity drop rate (used to be twice as fast).

&gt; • Crippling Strikes skill: Deals regular bleeding effect damage that cannot go below the dmg value specified in skill description. Also effect duration was increased from 5 to 10 seconds to match the duration of regular bleeding. General idea is that effect originating from skill shouldn't be weaker than bleeding from item.

&gt; • Adrenaline Rush mutation: When at maximum Vitality, Adrenaline Points drop after 4s delay. Introduced new potential skill combos and play styles instead of another percentage damage buff.

&gt; • Deadly Counter mutation: A counterattack immediately triggers a finisher with a chance based on the number of Adrenaline Points. Opponents immune to counterattacks are not affected. 
Used to work only on opponents below 25% health. 

&gt; • Toxic Blood mutation: doubled the returned damage value (3% per toxicity point, was 1.5%) to compensate for reducing maximum achievable toxicity.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt;**NPCs**

&gt; Couple of bugfixes and removing arbitrary stat bonuses.

&gt; • Removed huge arbitrary stat buffs on enemies with skull icons. They are already higher level than player, that alone makes them more difficult.

&gt; • Allowed to parry and counterattack enemies with skull icons.

&gt; • Fixed leshen root damage being a fixed value throughout the whole game. It's taken from his melee attack damage so it scales with enemy level.

&gt; • Made bird swarm attacks ignore armor. Leshen bird attacks dealt zero damage starting from mid-game.

&gt; • Fixed sprigan's root ground attack dealing no damage.

&gt; • Restored monster essence (silver health bar) regeneration (mostly for werewolves). It was temporarily disabled at some point in implementation and never brought back.

&gt; • Fixed discrepancies between NG+ and base game xml files, like missing ability definitions, ability tags, etc. These potentially caused minor bugs in enemy stats in NG+.

&gt; • Rats are not affected by enemy upscaling option.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **General items**

&gt; Bunch of small changes that put more emphasis on some of the gameplay mechanics that didn’t work as originally intended due to balancing issues.

&gt; • Increased random range of item levels rolled for quest rewards. You might end up with an item you cannot use yet, but at least you'll get a guaranteed upgrade on level up.

&gt; • Increased stat debuff on damaged items. Value depends on game difficulty level with 50% debuff on highest difficulty. Repairing items matter now.

&gt; • Increased amount of gold given in quests where it made sense (Baron should be more generous, etc.). Didn't touch the mini-quests.

&gt; • Reduced the amount of healing per second from food but increased healing duration. Overall it's a slight buff for food without Gourmet perk and a significant nerf with it. Swallow and White Raffard potions are intended healing in combat, not chicken sandwiches.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Witcher sets**

&gt; Changes are focused on fixing near immortality issue coming from high rending (monster) damage reduction combined with Protective Coating skill. Also there are two sets partially focusing on buffing alchemy builds. Mod moves alchemy bonuses to Manticore set making it a dedicated alchemy set and introduces new bonuses and playstyle to Wolven set. I remember reading about the idea of Wolven set built around bleeding damage on Witcher Reddit, so cheers to the Reddit community. 

&gt; • Scaled down monster damage resistance on witcher armors where applicable. Upgraded witcher sets used in conjunction with Protective Coating oil used to reach 100% rending damage reduction (some damage still passed due to resistance cap). That shouldn't be the case now. For details on numbers check attached images.

&gt; • Enabled grandmaster set bonuses on all witcher sets items in New Game+.

&gt; • Moved 3 item Wolven set bonus (bombs are thrown without a delay) and merged it with 3 item Manticore set bonus (bombs are affected by critical hit chance and critical hit damage).

&gt; • Reduced Manticore set Toxicity bonus from 30 (and more on NG+) to 20, to prevent safe activation of more than 3 decoctions at the same time in end game.

&gt; • Moved 6 item Wolven set bonus (3 different oils can be applied to a sword) to Fixative alchemy skill. Should make Fixative skill a more interesting choice in character development.

&gt; • New Wolven set 3 item bonus: Each stack of Bleeding effect applied to enemies increases sword damage by 1% for each piece of the set.

&gt; • New Wolven set 6 item bonus: Each Adrenaline Point increases number of possible stacks of Bleeding effect that can be applied to single opponent. With new set bonuses Wolven set tries to fulfil the fantasy of specialized Damage over Time build working well in conjunction with buffed Crippling Strikes skill.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Item upgrades**

&gt; Buffed every runeword and glyphword about which I thought “I’d never use that when I have that other, better choice”. Beside buffing, Possession runeword had its effect changed because there used to be 2 glyphwords buffing Axii in different ways and 3rd being a sum of previous two, so it just wasn’t interesting enough.

&gt; • Rejuvenation runeword: Fatal blows restore 100% stamina (was 25%).

&gt; • Dumplings runeword: changed duration bonus to 5x increase in healing speed. With this buff food brought back to the same healing speed as in vanilla game while also having significantly increased effect duration.

&gt; • Elation runeword: Fatal blows give 1 Adrenaline point (was 0.1 to 0.25).

&gt; • Prolongation runeword: Unblocked blows increases potion duration by 1s (was 0.5s)

&gt; • Ignition glyphword: Enemies set alight with Igni have a 100% chance to ignite other enemies within a 2 yard radius. (was 25% chance)

&gt; • Rotation glyphword: Igni strikes in a 360 radius (removed ""but doesn't induce Burning"" tradeoff). When I read 360 radius I thought “cool!”, then I read “but doesn’t induce Burning” and I thought “aww, but that tradeoff makes it useless”.

&gt; • Possession glyphword, new effect: When effect of Axii ends, opponent receives damage dependent on effect duration and Sign intensity. Spent long time balancing the damage potential. It’s a nice bonus when you don’t invest in Sign intensity and a killer when you do. It’s very effective at the cost of waiting - you could finish off enemies faster by other means. As a bonus eye candy, enemies that die to Possession effect explode.

&gt; • Retribution glyphword: 100% chance for half damage returned (was 30% chance for ⅔ damage returned). A small damage nerf in exchange for consistency and reliability. When you allow yourself to be hit to deal damage, you want it to be reliable, not bet on random chance.

&gt; • Eruption glyphword: explosion deals the same damage as rotfiend's explosion added to original damage. Used to be only 50 dmg multiplied by Sign intensity.

&gt; • Depletion glyphword: casting Aard depletes enemy’s stamina (was 50% stamina damage). The idea behind the glyphword was to allow player to overcome enemy defence even if he didn’t manage to knock him down (stamina is used for offensive and defensive actions). With just 50% stamina damage enemies could still parry after casting Aard, so it didn’t feel like it made any difference.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Bombs**

&gt; Bombs deal a decent amount of damage up to the middle of main game and then they fall behind Signs and sword damage becoming useless as damage dealers in end game, both expansions and NG+. These changes aim to make bombs a perfectly viable build if player chooses to invest enough skill points in alchemy build.

&gt; • Beside increasing potion duration each active alchemy skill also increases damage of bombs by 5% per skill level.

&gt; • Added DoT value scaling with enemy max health on top of existing damage value to Devil's Puffball bomb. This is how majority of other DoTs work in the game.
 
&gt; • Heavy Artillery damage bonus acts as a final damage multiplier calculated after bonus from alchemy skills.

&gt; • Doubled damage values of bombs and Pyromancy skill in NG+.

&gt; • Moon Dust bombs block abilities of cursed monsters and shapeshifters. These monsters are especially vulnerable to silver.

&gt; • Northern Wind bombs block rotfiend enemy types explosive deaths.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Crossbow**

&gt; Beside the cosmetic improvements the main intention is to make crossbow damage useful but not competing with swords, Signs and bombs unless you invest in crossbow related skills and use high quality bolts.

&gt; • Crossbow bolt's damage scales with player level. Damage is dependent on bolt quality.

&gt; • Slowed down crossbow bolts when shot underwater.

&gt; • Increased crossbow bolts range from 25m to 50m when not underwater.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; **Potions**

&gt; Didn’t like the way Blizzard potion was triggered. It was useless in 1v1 monster hunts and boss fights. I wanted to remedy that.

&gt; • Blizzard potion now activates slow motion when Geralt is in danger, no need to kill an enemy anymore. To compensate, effect's strength and duration was slightly decreased. Blizzard should be more consistent and easy to use now but also not that overpowered.

&gt; • Cat potion grants 5% crit chance bonus. A little bonus that should make Cat potion a bit more useful.",technology
btc,Tethers: it's 1 of 2 things... [with detailed explanation ELIA5-style]. Bonus: similar scheme may be used for another suspected scam!!,"Option 1 (with a couple variants)

1- Print Tethers out of thin air  

2- Borrow money from a shady bank, with promise to never withdraw fiat  

3- Pay, let's say, 0.5% interest rate/day to said shady bank  

4- Move Tethers to margin account on Bitfinex (have you noticed how easy it's to trade on margin over there, hmmm, I wonder why)  
5a- scam #1: Charge margin traders say, 0,75% interest/day, with 3:1 leverage, by letting them deal other hodlers bitcoins/coins  
5b- outright steal coins from Bitfinex customers and resell for real $$  

6- scam #2: Wash trade Bitcoins (that means buying and selling to yourself) in order to a) be able to pretend that you are collecting solid trading fees thus, instill some kind of confidence in your operations, and b) make sure the BTC price keeps going up, otherwise, Bitfinex customers would start withdrawing coins and kill scam #1  

7- I sincerily hope there is a bank run on Bitfinnex. It will be a beautiful sight.

***
Option 2

1- Sell drugs, guns, war weapons, illegal diamonds, steal from retirees, have otherwise money or bribes to launder, or offer money laundering services (they are based in BVI, a fiscal paradise, what a coincidence). Bonus: or... be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin Connect, promising unilimited stream of interest income. Just laying out the possibility here, we never know, why not kill 2 birds with one stone...  

2- Go to step 1 of Option 1 above, but in this case, YOU are the bank (money to launder)!!

personalfinance,Relocation payback clause with job offer and complicated circumstances (theoretical parental leave),"I'm an American living in Europe with my husband. I interviewed for a job in the US a couple weeks ago and just received the offer letter. I was happy to find that they offer to pay for relocation expenses - both a moving service of their choosing and airfare. What I was not so thrilled about was that it says I need to pay it back 100% if I do not stay continuously employed there for 12 months.

I've been reading that this sort of clause is common, and I totally understand the reasoning for it. It specifically says ""In the event that you are terminated by the Company for cause or if you terminate your employment with the Company before the end of the first year of employment, you agree to repay the Company 100%"".  Am I correct in my interpretation that ""for cause"" means that it cannot be just a lay-off? I'm also a bit miffed that I have both no choice of choosing a more economical way to ship my stuff over, but HAVE to use a service that they arrange, yet may have to pay back the cost of whatever this service is if I choose to leave for any reason. I feel like the company just wants to heft all the risk onto me and none on themselves.

And OK, for most people it would be little trouble to just hash it out for a year even if it sucks somewhere, but I have another complication in that I'm inching toward 40 and have been trying unsuccessfully to have kids for years. I've been undergoing treatments (which have resulted in 2 miscarriages this year) and can't stop them at my age just because I'm moving. So if I happen to get and stay pregnant within the next 6 months or so, I will not be eligible for even the shittiness of Family Medical Leave. I'm trying to find out the parental leave policy of the company without directly asking for it (they are really giving me the runaround on benefits and I just want someone to show me what it all is already, not their useless brochure that doesn't even mention this). But it means there's a higher than likely chance that I will have to leave this job in the first year, thus needing to pay back the relocation. Meanwhile my husband needs to immigrate and will be unemployed at first (and no idea how big a struggle it'll be for him to find work), so I'm just envisioning the worst financial pit of hell ending to all of this.

So would you all recommend taking this job with this payback clause? I have cash in savings so it's not like it'd bankrupt me if I had to pay it, but it would still really really suck - this will easily be $10-20k with any moving service and not a cost I have any control over. Has anyone successfully renegotiated a payback clause or would that be too weird to even bring up along with everything else in my damn life? By the way I am completely non-desperate and absolutely do not need to take this job (I've applied to literally 2 in 6 months, but this was highly targeted), but I'm not sure how unique an opportunity it is given that my industry is very small and it's the first offer I've ever had at this senior level. My husband also cannot stand where we're living so I feel pressured to move to the US fairly soon, and I'm getting tired of this possibility of having kids dictating my life, as it may very well never happen at this point. I had been holding out a bit because we have 1 year paid maternity leave here but I've now passed the date by nearly 2 months of when I should have already been on it, and this is just getting depressing.

**tl;dr need to pay back transcontinental relocation expenses if volutarily or involuntarily ""at cause"" leave new job within the first year, also trying to get pregnant for years, won't have FML and might have to quit if I get pregnant in the next 6 months while undergoing treatments.

I got a car loan for 16000, but the interest is 18 percent and to be paid over 5 years (Edit: this started off as a 6 year plan but I'm almost 1 year through it). This was in February this year (I had no.very bad credit history, probably not the best decision). Following advice here, I got a secured Capitol One credit card to start building my credit. I learned the hard way to only use less than 33 percent of my limit to keep my score going up. In June, I tried to refinance the loan but was denied, so I decided to just keep building my credit. I just got hired at a new job making 78k (starting next month), but my credit score is 637 now (going up). 
 
I've paid off my other debts (except for about 5 more months of braces) and should have my emergency fund set in February, then all money will be directed at that auto loan, however, I don't like that so much is going to interest instead of the principle. What's the best plan of action here?
 
Also, like I said, I'm still new at this lol I just got my first [secured] credit card at 29. Got a new job and things seem to be going well, but this damn car loan.

Edit: Any other recommendations to help me get my shit together would be appreciated. Steps I'm taking now include, getting an apartment that's 200 dollars cheaper a month in February, cooking more, going out less, etc.

Income: the last year, my wife and I made about 62k combined income. This year I'm making about that much myself, but she is quitting her job soon to work part time and go back to school (She has her AA and will be completing her BA). Not sure what kind of financial assistance she will qualify for, but we'll probably end up taking out some loans to help pay for tuition/books.

Debts: we curently have about 8k in CC debt/personal loan (used to consolidate old CC debt at lower interest rate), and about 35k in student debt from my BA. We also have two car loans at about 8k and 16k.

Current wealth &amp; assets: two cars valued at 6k and 16k, and about 2k in the bank.

Other details: I'm married, age 28-32, working as a teacher. We are currently renting a 3 bed townhome for about 1.15k/mo. My sister-in-law lives with us and pays $200/mo for rent/expenses. We have 4 dogs, 2 of which are not on the lease. We are looking to move out of state within the next 3-7 years.

I think that just about covers the nitty-gritty of the situation. Our lease is up in 2 months, and we're not sure how much it's going to cost to continue to rent here if we renew (although a $200/mo or more increase would not be unheard of for this area). We would be looking to purchase a home with a lower mortgage payment than our rent, but we really don't have anything for a down payment. We know that would lock us into this area for at least 5 years, but we'd be willing to delay moving out of state for at least that length of time.

personalfinance,Anyone know what credit card companies (like capital one for instance) like to use for credit scores/checks? Vantagescore or FICO?,"I find it pretty complicated to even know my real ""credit score"" when there is a bizillion different models out there. Heck, just saying FICO says nothing when there's FICO 8, FICO 9, and a bunch of different FICO scores and models in and of itself. I mean I know you shouldn't really pay for your credit score and thus use things like Credit Karma etc. to get an idea of what's going on with my credit, but it uses Vantagescore 3.0 and who knows whose using that or how popular/""accurate"" that score actually is??? 

Why are all these so complicated? I understand the reasoning so to speak for different models, but my lord as someone trying to keep up with his credit and possibly apply for new credit makes you want to rip your hair out sometimes. I messed up in the past due to ignorance (mostly just federal student loans I got scared as I couldn't afford them for a little while, but had like 7 different loan accounts that all went in separately as late payments so at least 7 late payments reported per month. Could of used forbearance or something, but I was a young idiot that just panicked and ignored instead). I just want to fix all this. 

I applied for a secured card and won't be able to know why I got denied for 7-10 business days. This frustrates me as I don't know why if it's based off my vantage 3.0 score. I make decent money and have extremely low expenses. I have only one derragatory remark that I had for an apartment bill when I lost my job. Been paying that off. I can't help but wonder if they are just using a different model or something. I'm also not paying rent as I'm AD and staying in dorms. Relevant as many calculators divide by your rent total to come up with eligibility numbers (dividing by zero is undefined which can cause errors I'm sure). 

Sorry for being so long, but I want to improve my credit. I have other options and don't really need credit anytime soon for any big purchases  but why wait? I know of other options, but a credit card just seems the fastest and easiest way.

TL;DR Need help fixing credit. Not sure why I was denied for a secured card. Waiting 7-10 days for why I was denied is straight stupid as I will have a hard inquiry show up, but am afraid to apply for others until I know why I got denied. My credit is well within secured card limits according to vantage score. but who knows what model capital one uses??? What do I need to do to fix my credit?",finance
personalfinance,"Mortgage interest rate and 'truth in lending', Nebraska","Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit.

My wife and I bought a house two years ago (paid it off last month). The interest rate was somewhere around 4.5% (fixed for 7 years) with the local bank in town. The payment slips would arrive every month with the total payment listing the components: principle, interest, escrow, etc. I would take the slip to the bank and have the teller move the monies from my checking account to make the payment. I knew from various mortgages we've had the interest payment is the majority at the beginning of the loan. On one particularly cold morning, the teller told me I could make the payment with the online banking system instead of walking to the bank once a month.

A few months ago I looked at the online system. Here it showed the APY of 4.5% and a daily rate of 12%. I was not expecting that daily rate. Using various mortgage calculator tools online, I could not get the interest/principle amounts to match using a 4.5% rate. I could get the principle payment to match using the 12% rate. Looking at the previous year's mortgage statement, I determined they were using the daily rate to calculate the principle payment, then at the end of the year using the APY to calculate the interest on the remaining principle.

This was not told to us by the load officer, nor is it present in the 'truth in lending' document provided. Is this standard practice? It is hugely profitable for the lender. And how is this not a misrepresentation of the product?",finance

personalfinance,"Beware Navient's ""disaster assistance"" - it could lower the amount of payment to principal even if you make your regularly schedule payment.","So I live in Puerto Rico and was happy to see an email titled, ""contact us if you need payment help due to recent natural disasters."" So I called them and it turns out the offer was for ""disaster forbearance"", which allows you to not make a payment for up to 3 months, but the interest that accrues would not be capitalized (rolled back into the principal of the loan). I was on auto-payments, but signed up anyways just in case. I asked them not to cancel my auto-payment.

Well, I check a week later and see that my auto-payment was indeed  canceled. No worries, I thought, I'll just make a manual payment. My *hope* was that my entire payment would go towards principal since it was an extra payment I was not required to make. Well, I check the payment and it turns out that not only did it not go all towards principal, but LESS of my payment went towards principal than before the disaster forbearance. Huh???

Apparently what happened is that when the auto-payment was canceled (against my wishes), the .25% interest rate discount I was receiving for having auto-pay was also canceled. So my interest rate actually *increased* when I signed up for disaster forbearance. How big of a deal is this? Well, had I not signed up for disaster forbearance and instead just skipped my November payment, taken a late fee, and made a double payment in December, I would have been better off than I am having signed up for disaster assistance. 

I called Navient to explain to them how their ""disaster assistance"" has hurt me, instead of helping me. The call was escalated several times and eventually all I got is a ""we'll see what we can do"". To me, this is insanity. How Navient can possibly advertise ""disaster assistance"" only to increase someone's interest rate and punish them for having signed up just kind of blows my mind. [Here's my payment history to show the difference.](https://imgur.com/vrMUGJH)

personalfinance,"For a multitude of reasons, I haven't paid my taxes for 6-7 years now, and I'd like to try and get square with the IRS and make some money in the process. Any advice??","There are two priorities I'm focusing on that's making me want to get this taken care of, and I'm hoping some of y'all can help me. 
 
1. I know for at least one year (back in 2013 I think) I filled out my W-2 wrong and I ended up owing about $500 in state and $1500 in federal taxes. I don't think I ever paid that, and I've never had anything go to collections. Should I even worry about it? Is there any way to check what I owe online?

2. I've been making a little more money recently, and I know I filled out my W-2 the past 3-4 years to maximize my withholdings and end of the year refund; but I've never collected it!! I made about $25K-$35K for the first half of that time period and am now making closer to $50K at my current job. I've never had much debt, no student loans, no deductions really with maxed withholdings. 

Every time I think about this I get super anxious, but I don't want to keep being the chump that let's Uncle Sam keep all my money! Can I still get some refunds back? Think it's worth it? Where do I start? 

Any advice for this tax newbie is much appreciated.",finance

I net around 54,137.72 a year, my wife around 21231.60 so we have a net of about 75369.32

Firstly, Card 3,4,5,6 are being terminated immediately. 

That leaves me with Card 1 and 2. I am eligible every six months for bonuses of 5-10k and should get one from Christmas. This will allow me to eliminate card 2 and only leave me with the lowest interest rate card but the highest balance. If everything goes well by the end of this year I will have only the 18k card left, with 3k in savings as I move into the next year. After that it's a game of attrition until June/July when I'll get my next bonus (another 5-10k). and I hope by the end of next year will be able to pay off all the credit cards.

I have this more outlined in spreadsheets but I just want some advice on dealing with it. Is it worth looking into a deb consolidation loan? 

For any concern with my wife it's just money, we are happy, therapy is covered by her insurance and she will go see one. We are working on becoming a healthier team. I know it's an issue but nothing we can't work through.",finance
personalfinance,I'm 21 and fear the financial fallout of taking out student loans to pay for dental school.,"I'm about to graduate college debt-free, but I am planning on attending dental school for the next four years. From this point, I will be on my own financially, and will undoubtedly have to take out massive student loans. Total cost for dental school is anywhere from 250-400k total, with 6-7% interest on student loans (total cost will likely increase each year during the next four years, and I have been told to expect an interest rate on the higher side of 6-7%). Can I feasibly pay this off in the standard 10 years that federal student loans mandate? How would I even begin to approach financing so much debt? I really want to become a dentist, but I am very fearful of getting over my head in debt. Any and all advice is welcome.",finance

litecoin,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,That's it. I am fed up with this entire platform. I am done.,"I have tried giving bitcoins a chance. In fact, I probably got into bitcoins earlier than 75% of the people here. My first negative experience was when I tried to buy [some food](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1y60f5/was_excited_to_use_bitcoins_but_now_ive_stopped/) with bitcoin. TLDR: Didn't work and lost my coins. Secondly, I recently tried to buy some stuff off newegg, which I was elated to hear accepted bitcoin. Result: https://imgur.com/a/CMal8. At this point I am frustrated with this entire thing and want to liquidate my remaining assets for actual money that I CAN use to spend Christmas gifts on (I had kept like half a coin after I got goxxed). Sent it over localbitcoin, received money via paypal, and then got it reversed. WHAT THE FUCK. I'm not trying to spread FUD but you can understand how shady and frustrating using bitcoins is. Before you drop money 'investing' in bitcoin, I *beg* you to ask yourself, ""what can I use this for?"" If the answer is something else than ""HODL"" or similar, I urge you to re-evaluate your priorities. Bring on the downvotes, this community has forsaken me and I could not care less.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,I Quit. Story of a gambler,"Short story：
I quit trading and start HODLING with 10 bitcoins in my wallet. Don't want to suffer from FOMOs and Panicking anymore. It feels like I'm a gambling addict.

Long story:
My parents bought me a computer when I was 8 because I claimed that my primary school needed me to do online exercises. It was so expensive(~US$1000, can't even run Portal, one of my favourite video games). Internet service was not there yet when the computer was finished setting up by the retailer (paid service). But I think I completely mastered Windows XP by the time I was connected to the internet which is several days later. I was only 10 years old when bitcoin was invented. I knew things like programming and how to assemble a computer before I was 12 as I sat in front of the little 13' screen every single day after school. I was super good at maths and science.

One day, just several months after bitcoin's first halving and before its US$1,000 bubble bursted, I heard about bitcoin (I consider that as late already, but even if I had known bitcoin earlier, I wouldn't have any money to put on it anyway). I was obsessed with the logic and concept of this amazing coin since then. I kept convincing my mother to buy some when it was around $200, but she just didn't give a shit. When I finally got some fund to start with, it was already $400. I deposited my red-pocket money to BTCChina via alipay, and bought less than 1/2 a BTC, got a blockchain.info wallet but rarely stored any bitcoin there since I traded it like my mom trading stocks so I just use the exchange as wallet (bad bad habit). I remember 0 fee transaction was still possible at that time. I shared the story of bitcoin with my friends at school, but most of them just didn't GAF. One of my best friend got interested and put some money on it too. We started margin trading on BTCChina and huobi. Long, short, long, short. We were so thrilled when we make even just several hundred dollars profit. I soon starting putting money in it every month. Soon, I finally got 2BTC. But then I ran through the math, if I didn't do any trading but just hodl after buying, I would had had more. I decided to turn my Fiat-thinking into BTC-thinking, which means selling USD for BTC but not buying BTC with USD. In high school, I studied Economics as one of my electives. I learnt how economy works and with my computer knowledge, I have a faith that bitcoin will someday change the world. I chose bitcoin as my Economics project but my teacher didn't like it and said it was unreal. I think she is just too old to learn what digital age really means. Meanwhile, I was still convincing my mom to buy bitcoin and she finally decided to give me ~$250 to play around after seeing a big increase in BTC's price. After China banning margin funding, I moved on to post-hacked bitfinex.

I saved every penny as I can and started to have more pocket money from my mom. I put all of them in bitcoin. Almost all my worth was in BTC. And I earned some extra BTC by margin trading, with occasional losses of course. Just several weeks ago, I purchased BT1 with all my BTC on bitfinex because I sincerely believe in Bitcoin Core. BOOM, B2X fork was cancelled. I had nearly 20BTC at that time. But tragedy just started. Remember that shitty forked coin forked several months ago? It was pumped dramatically. When it reached 0.2SHIT/BTC, my friend (same friend as above) decided to buy it to make some profit. I'd been telling him how shitty that SHIT is and he said he just want to gamble. SHIT was rising every day. My friend was showing off to me with his profit. I FedOMO and started margin trading it. I kept BTC but long BCH with ~2x leverage. I kept my eyes on the market before I slept. I couldn't sleep with that BCH position opened since I can possibly lose all my BTC if BCH drops a lot suddenly so I closed it before I sleep every night, 3 days in a row. But everyday I woke up, SHIT's price was higher than yesterday. I couldn't really make any profit out of it, but lost the 5BTC, which was made from BT1. If I weren't being a pussy, I could have 50+BTC by now. When the BCH was nearly 0.5/BTC, I suggested to my friend that we should hedge our holdings. I told him to long BCH and I short BCH, when winner emerge, we'll split any profit/losses. But he didn't agree, so I'm too pussy again to short BCH at 0.5/BTC. Literally just several seconds later, that shit crashed. -50% within half a minute is real. It's worse than tulip. I realised I missed the chance. And my friend lost US$1,000 instead of winning US$10,000 closing the position just a second too late. But he still doubled his 4BTC to 8 since the beginning. I was so jealous of him even though I had more BTC than he had, because the money I put in was much much more than he did.

While BTC was recovering from the crash, I was grieving for my loss and didn't long BTC. It's when I missed my second chance. I jumped back in only when it reached ATH again. And a series of crash led me to a classical buy high and sell low. And hours ago, the second dip of the day caused by a 1000+BTC long position closing gave me a small heart attack and I decided to QUIT. I got only less than 11BTC left. I have decided to quit so many times. But this time, I'm serious.

Want to get more BTC through margin trading is really just gambling. You have to worry if BTC's price drop to a certain point and you'll get liquidated. I will not do it anymore. I can HODL without leverage trading. Maybe some years later when my mum decided to give me more money or I got a job, I'll buy more bitcoins and try to see if I can get into the 21BTC club. But right now, I'm walking away with 10BTC and take a nap. Looking at the bright side, all my loss were the profit I made as my girlfriend told me, so I'm just going to drop a few drops of tear and that's it. When I had less than 1BTC, I wanted to have 1 by purely buying more. When I had 2, I wanted 3 and 5 by margin trading. Then 10, then 15, then 21. It will never end. But I've decided to say goodbye to my limitless desire. So for now, if you excuse me, I still have a life to live.

I joined reddit weeks ago but I've been on read-only mode for years. Ask me anything. If you enjoy my real story, consider tipping me at 3MqQRy... ...wait, I'm not supposed to post my btc wallet address here, right? So plz just upvote if you enjoyed it or don't want more people turning into bitcoin gambling addicts.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to refinance or get rid of my overly expensive car?,"My situation is as follows:

I am a US citizen who has spent most of his working life outside the United States.

I had a credit score of roughly 680 as of last year, but following a series of unfortunate events ended up with some credit card debt that sent my credit score down to under 530.

Over the past year I have gotten my credit score back up to 605 (which is obviously not great).

I had to, for the first time in my life, buy a car when my credit score was at its very worst. I was unable to get any sort of loan for a used car (I wanted to get the cheapest car possible), and instead I ended up getting stuck with not only a new car (MSRP: $22,000), but at a whopping interest rate of 25%. My monthly payments are over $700.

I was told at the time I bought the car that it would be ""easy"" to refinance after 6 months or so of on-time payments, but I have had zero luck getting refinancing despite several attempts over the past month.

As it is the car, insurance, and gas cost me about as much as my rent payments do. I am actively paying off the remainder of my debt (which will be entirely paid off by February at the current rate). Apart from rent and the car, I am repaying around $500/month on debt at the current rate.

Is there any way that I can either get refinancing from a lender with the current terms, or should I sell the car and replace it with an older, used beater car?

Any advice is welcome as I am sick of having my car cost me as much as my rent every month and I can't seem to do anything to fix the situation.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for ways to set up money for young family members,"Between my wife and I, I currently have two nephews and one niece (1, 3, and 6 years old) and would like to start setting them up with money for their future. I am looking for ideas that I can do to accomplish this for them. My father set me up with dividend stocks in custodial accounts at a young age, and my late grandma would give me a treasury bond every birthday up to 18 years old. The stocks have been great and the bonds have been OK, though the interest rates later on are sub 2%. 

A few notes: Neither of these families are very financially well off, and I don't expect they probably ever really be, so I would ideally like it to be something that they really have little to no control/access to if possible. I also (selfishly) would not be opposed to any type of tax incentives if that was an option. Lastly, I am financially able to do this. I max out 401k, rIRA, have ~$20k emergency savings, and multiple brokerage accounts with varying levels of money. I also have no debt besides mortgage and a 0% card for the wife's ring.

personalfinance,Best Options To Refinance Student Loans,"Asking for a friend - they're worried that they might be paying too much on their student loans. They've looked at things like SoFi but could use some advice on some of the best options to explore for refinancing.

Currently they have several loans through three different companies, Nelnet (Federal), Navient (Private) and Sallie Mae (Private). I'll list rough amounts below.

**Nelnet:**
$16K @ 6.55%
$4.5K @ 3.15%
$5K @ 3.61%
$3.7K @ 4.41%
$20K @ 5.96%
$2K @ 3.61%

Actual remaining balance $52,197
Monthly Payment $624

**Navient:**
$8.5K @ 3%
$8.6K @ 7.75%
$31.4K @ 3%
$11.6K @ 3%

Actual remaining balance $60,408
Monthly Payment $841

**Sallie Mae:**
$6.5K @ 7.75%
$9.5K @ 7.25%

Actual remaining balance $15,990
Monthly Payment $219

Monthly paycheck is $3660 so almost 50% of monthly income goes straight to loans. So what makes the most sense here? Refi everything? Refi on 2 out of the 3? Does it help for the federal loans to switch to income based rather than standard repayment?",finance

Bitcoin,"Net neutrality, lets have bitcoin neutrality!","Comrades! Everyone is freaking out about the government deciding to not regulate the internet, so I thought it might be a good time to discuss bitcoin neutrality! To make sure that all parties play nice in the bitcoin ecosystem, I propose we add a software layer called 'government' that can enforce miners, exchanges, and users to play well with each other. Also, to prevent unfair bitcoin fees, the new government layer can determine bitcoin protocol fees so everyone pays the same amount! In fact, the committee currently thinks we should remove the block limit all together, so everyone can transact for free!

Don't listen to the naysayers at /r/NoNetNeutrality/ !

They don't understand that 'tragedy of the commons' is a myth! If we allow everyone to use bitcoin no matter the use case, the block chain will only end up on high end computers and servers! Just think how fast that could be! And to prevent theft, all bitcoin addresses will be held by the government! Just send us a KYC/AML compliant application form so we can protect you!  

Net neutrality is great! All data packets are created equal! Whether you are a doctor performing robotic remote surgery or a creepy uncle downloading questionable video content, be assured that everyone will be able to share equally in latency and congestion!

personalfinance,Ally Saving Account,"I've begun to do a bit of freelance work for a startup where I live. I get paid fairly well and I want to establish an emergency fund. I'm thinking of going with Ally for the savings account and I don't currently see any negatives of doing so. My question is, what are they? Are there any huge negatives I'm not seeing?

Cons:  No physical bank branch. Transfers take a bit longer than my current banking institution.

Edit 1: This account will serve not only as an emergency fund, but also where I will set aside money to pay taxes on the amount I've earned. I know it might not be the best thing to do, but currently I make more at my main job than I do free lancing, so I imagine I will just have a very small, if any, federal tax return and owe a bit of state taxes.

personalfinance,"Floating $50k expense with minimal opportunity cost, substantial resources","Context: over $800k net worth including over $100k in taxable brokerage account. Keep minimal cash but can draw over $150k tomorrow if needed between various accounts at low interest.

Buying $50k car. Can borrow from stock account at 2.66% without selling. Any conceivable margin call can be met same day from heloc at 4.8%, tax deductible.

Thinking of gaming auto loan:
If auto loan interest rate is less than 2.66, go ahead and take out loan. Then pay the loan from stock account, essentially shifting the lower rate balance to the higher rate balance over time.

Pros: stock holdings continue to yield market returns, up or down. Budgetary cash flow untouched, allowing for maxed 401k/ESPP/IRA to continue, getting the benefit of tax preferences and matches. Debt erodes naturally from dividends ($28k per year towards that account, VTI yields 1.8%, but dividends don't reinvest paying down margin first). Over all 5 year periods since 1972, other than dot com bust which took 5 years 8 months to recover, end up ahead. At end of life/sale/trade take the depreciation hit.

Cons: in my situation, not seeing one. Opportunity cost as I see it is the drag of the interest rate on margin loan, which accrues as payments accrue. Averaging about $56/mo over 5 years. Can meet any (unlikely) margin call. Take the depreciation hit when I sell the car or it get hit by someone else. I hold my cars until I get and insurance check.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan overpayments not applied as instructed,"Hi,
My student loans are financed by Mohela; I owe ~$9,700 on one and ~$20,000 on the other. Interest rate 2.25% for both.

Earlier in the year, I submitted written instructions via their online message system as follows:
""I am writing to provide you with instructions on how to apply payments when I send an amount greater than the minimum amount due. Please apply payments as follows: Please apply the additional amount to the loan with the lowest outstanding principal balance. If any additional amount above the minimum amount due ends up paying off an individual loan, please then apply any remaining part of my payment to the loan with the next lowest outstanding principal balance. It is possible that I may find an option to refinance my loans to a lower rate with another lender. If this lender or any third party makes payments to my account on my behalf, you should use the instructions outlined above. Retain these instructions. Please apply these instructions to all future overpayments. Please confirm that these payments will be processed as specified or please provide an explanation as to why you are unable to follow these instructions.""

Maddeningly, every extra payment I make is applied to both loans, not the lower loan as requested. I need to email/call every time to have them fix it. What am I doing wrong? How can I get Mohela to comply with these simple instructions?

I've already budgeted the amounts I'll need to pay so I know I won't have any issues, but in my research I found that with IBR (confirmed I am eligible and so are my loans), the gov't will pay my interest on those loans for 3 years if my IBR payment amount isn't enough to cover that portion. There is no increase to the interest rate overall.

By taking the IBR option, I would free up $500 from my monthly payments - I'd rather reallocate those funds towards my consumer debt (which has a much higher interest rate than my student loans). Once my consumer debt is paid off (considerably sooner than the 3 years that IBR provides), I'll just reallocate the $500 + the amount budgeted for my consumer debt back towards my student loans.

Bitcoin,Question regarding the tax implications of selling my home for bitcoin.,"I've been planning on listing my home for sell in the next few months and have been entertaining the idea of listing the sale price in BTC. I understand that I would need to pay capital gains tax on profits that are made when it comes to real estate, but how would this be different if I accepted BTC as payment for my house?

For example, if I were to sell my home for 50 BTC, would I need to calculate the CURRENT dollar valuation of that 50 BTC right away at that time and find out what my Capital Gain amount would be in dollars immediately? 

What if I accepted the 50 BTC as payment, I owed nothing on the house, so I kept the 50 BTC and come tax time I had still not exchanged my BTC for fiat, would I be held responsible for any capital gains tax?

I'm not looking for a ""loophole"" of any kind, I just am not super savvy with this sort of thing and I want to make sure I don't make a legal/federal mistake.


Also, United States, FL homeowner if that matters.

Ps, Do you guys think this would be a good thing to try? Do you think by offering real estate transactions in BTC it could appeal to a wider audience?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Auto Financing,"Hey fellas. I recently moved and I'm needing a car, so I'm looking to finance one. I've never been through the process and I'm a little anxious about whether or not I'll be approved.

The vehicle I'm looking at is a 2012 Dodge Avenger SXT. The asking price is $8,995 at the dealer.

I have an income of $1,500 a month with no expenses aside from my phone bill, which is always paid on time. I have a four year old card on my credit that has $400 owing - this is something I haven't payed because I've been told that if i were to pay it, it could potentially make my credit worse at his point (is that true?).  It has been put through to collections however for some reason it doesn't show up as a claim on my credit. My TransUnion score is 530 - pretty terrible, admittedly and probably because of the card that's owing. I know that if I were to be approved, the interest rate would probably be on the higher end but I'm okay with that. The vehicle I'm getting is one that I'm hoping will last me years. Minimum wage is being increased to $14 an hour here in January from $11.60 an hour, which is my current wage, so I can expect to earn more per month in a couple months from now, and I believe I have a promotion coming up soon as well. I know that won't help with the dealer more than likely, but it's reassuring that my income will be going up soon so I'll have an easier time paying then I will have now (which I know I can afford fine in my situation). By my calculations, a $8,995 vehicle with 13% interest (rough guess) would be $160 a month on a 7 year term. Easy enough to afford, but will the loaners agree? Would in house financing be a possibility? The dealership I'm looking at offers it. Main reason I haven't gone in yet is because I'd rather not have the credit check done to be denied. Would prefer some outside opinions first.

I have about $250 at the moment that I could put down on the down payment, if that would help at all.

CryptoCurrency,Can we have a civil discussion about btc vs bch?,"I really wish there was a way here on reddit to disable upvotes for comments. I'd like to see a robust discussion about this. 

I've been involved in Crypto for 5+ years. I've read a bunch of threads on both subreddits here and it seems like both sides are making mountains out of a molehill. 

Going back years, I remember when I first looked into bitcoin/crypto. The talk was how it would be very beneficial for micro transactions and how it could potentially change finance, business and all sorts of other industries using the blockchain network. 

Here we are today. Crypto went from selling us a dream about a decentralized, hedge against government control after the 2008 fiasco to basically being controlled by huge mining operators, powerful users that have accumulated a crap load of it and exchanges deciding for users how things will be in the future. 

Obviously, I am not happy with where crypto sits today, I am sure we can all agree that bitcoin needs to be what it was meant to be, cheap transactions and decentralized. When I look at any crypto, I don't see that and for the major players btc, eth and BCH it is almost the opposite. 

The appeal for bitcoin back in the early days was the theory that since it was a distributed decentralized network, that it couldn't be shut down. Maybe that's still true, but right now let's be frank, if a Government wanted to go after bitcoin, all it has to do is go after bitmain, bitfury and the mines in China/Iceland. That would cripple bitcoin and most alts. 

So, where do we go from here? How do we get the coin to act as intended/boasted about years ago? BCH isn't the answer as far as I can tell. I could be wrong and I am open to debate on this, but BCH is basically controlled by a small group of people. The chain has been manipulated and mined for profits. It has no use case that I can see. I mean I watch fork.lol daily and don't see any real disruption. Some people tell me that the BCH plan is to flip the price like with ETH/ETC, I don't see how that is a good idea. Sure bitcoin, like most cryptos has issues, but it's not worth shooting the horse right before huge institutional money flows in. Does someone really believe that if BCH and BTC flipped that those on wall street are going to be cool with that? Once they dig in, and they are digging in, they will see that crypto is almost worst that the FED. At least the FED answers to someone. Those pulling the strings lately have no masters but themselves and their motives. 

I tend to believe that possibly the two recent and from what I heard future pump/attack on btc by bch is just a pump and dump. That those pulling the strings know that a flip right now would devastate crypto for possibly a few years. 

They can't be that ignorant. They have just as much to risk if not more than most of us. Why would they risk throwing it all away. And how will governments respond to something like that right now? 

I just can't comprehend how that can be a thing. All the work that thousands of us have done through the years, spreading the word about this technology only to allow a handful of people to push an agenda that destroys it. 

Sure, we can agree that something needs to be done. But every time I surf either subreddit/twitter/facebook, I see a bunch of bogus information being pushed on both sides. 

I see the bch side screaming about higher fees, slow tx times and btc doing the same thing when BCH has those issues. They have both had those problems. 

I also see users chiming in that they spent more than $10 today to send a btc transaction and 8 hours later or so it's still pending. How can that be? Before this last pump, I was paying 6-8 cents and getting them in under an hour, when I wanted something quicker it would  less than a couple bucks. I sent multiple tx today and paid like 30 cents for all of them and they all went through in under and hour. 

I hate seeing these bogus attacks on both coins. I think bitcoin cash had a chance to work with core and be the coin used for transactions and bitcoin core could have been the settlement layer. Instead it looks like bch wants to replace btc and now it looks like ltc will be used for that. If they don't flip it. 

So while I am willing to admit that I am believer in core, how can those pushing BCH ignore how much the chain has been pushed out, manipulated and how the halving is going to happen sooner without really changing the plan in the white paper. And how without some serious volume, it's going to be manipulated more by the miners that are only in this for MONEY. 

So how do we fix this? I think we need a more decentralized mining situation. We need less pools with higher hash power and more people making ASICS and competing in that market. We need a solution that works for actually using bitcoin to buy things in real life. Sure it works online, but even when I buy stuff online I have to wait 20-30 minutes for my tx to process/confirm. 

tl,dr - We need solutions for faster/cheaper transactions, but shooting the horse right now only sets the entire project/crypto back and will make it harder to get back exactly where we are. Or am I missing something?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I need an advice regarding a car loan (JOR),"hey guys, I am planning to buy a car but I have very few options because of my situation and the rules applied in my country..

so, my situation is that I have a 700$/m job (important to note that it is 30hrs/wk too which is extremely rare where I come from), which is slightly more than 2x minimum wage, but I the company I work for is private and the salary is not recognized by banks. 

the banks here have interest rates of 3.75-4.5% but that requires a co-signature which is impossible to get in my case, so I am left with 2 options:

1- pay 25% of the car and get 7.75% interest rate for 5 years. (7933.73$ DP, 581$/m)

2- pay 10% of the car and get 8.90% interest rate for 5 years. (3173.49$ DP, 695.35$/m)

the reason I am considering such high rates is that I am getting the car as an investment to work for Careem (identical to Uber) which will get me an average of 1800$ revenue.
Now, the provider will get 20% cut of my revenue, and there's also gas which is I think the same as US prices, so it is roughly 1000$ profit before considering the monthly installments, repairs, etc. 

is the 300-400$ are worth the investment and the extra 35-40hrs/w I will be working? is the price fair? I am still looking for more options, as I can feel that this is a risky idea, but at the same time I do need a car regardless of using it as taxi..

personalfinance,"Not getting officially married to save $1,000 per month in student loan payments. Good idea or bad idea?","Fiance is a resident physician planning on fellowship afterwards. She will be making 55-70 per year for the next 4 years.

Her student loans are massive ~$450,000. 

We have signed her up for an income driven repayment plan (IDR) entitled REPAYE which essentially makes her pay a max of 10% of her discretionary income. Her monthly repayment is about $300 per month. We also have her signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. After 10 years of these income-drive repayments (120 months) while working for a ""non-profit"" entity (most hospitals), the remaining balance of her loans and interest are forgiven (tax-free). We are locked into this plan and have already made a years worth of repayments. Both political parties want to repeal this PSLF plan in some capacity, but current borrowers / individuals signed up for this forgiveness plan will be granted the forgiveness as stated. Further, most legal experts state that the federal government will have to honor the plan for those already enrolled, less a massive class-action lawsuit will be filed against the federal government.

Under the repayment plan, however; when she and I get married, regardless of filing status, my income is counted in the repayment calculation. We would then be repaying 1,300 a month instead of the $300. Could I tighten the purse strings and afford this, of course, but I'd rather not if all of the interest and remaining principal is going to be forgiven tax free at the end of these 10 years anyway. Not to mention that extra 1,000 a month is still a drop in the bucket compared to the principal. The extra 1,000 a month would be much much better served saving and investing than paying back to no end.

So, I'm proposing we simply don't get married on paper to avoid this. Thoughts?",finance
financialindependence,Reduced my commute from 90 minutes to 30 minutes.,"**TLDR:** Hated commute. Decided I was fed up and couldn’t be doing this anymore. I didn’t have time for any of this anymore. Applied like a mad man. Ended up finding work closer to home. Slight pay bump (I suck at negotiating first try) but also much better benefits with telework and in a position to learn a niche skill-set.

&amp;nbsp;

**How this applies to FIRE:** It was this sub-reddit that emphasized to me how reducing your commute impacts FIRE in the long run. Shortening my commute will save me a lot more money to invest for FIRE and I think it is important to highlight part of a career process especially from someone that isn’t making 100K+ with a bicycle commute. In FIRE, money is the tool but all most of us really want is TIME to do what we want. I will now have more TIME for independence, healthy, family, side-hustles, school, etc. I will also be putting a lot less miles on my Civic which is still going very strong btw and would recommend that car to anyone. It is an 04. 

&amp;nbsp;

By popular demand, I decided to put together one long post on the process I went through from deciding that a long commute was no longer a way to live and deciding to do something about it to change the situation. I was using the daily thread as my personal blog for a while (lol) and one thing turned into another and I kept making updates. The comments I received were so very helpful as well and I appreciated the feedback, PMs, and everything else that helped me along the way. This sub-Reddit I have been around for many years.

&amp;nbsp;

I had believed for a while that it was impossible to find work closer to home and that I was forever stuck in the commute to DC. I won’t detail my exact location but anyone that makes the trek knows that Route 66 sucks, NoVA sucks, Indian Head Highway sucks, 495 Capital Beltway can definitely suck it so pick your poison. Anyhow here is the long post. It is a copy/paste of all the updates. Bullet points include any lessons / thoughts learned in hindsight. 

&amp;nbsp;

AMA. Enjoy.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 1:**

&amp;nbsp;

My spouse is not fully on-board yet (maybe half-way there) but I'm pretty set on leaving my job (and mostly likely where we currently live) that I haven't even been employed at for a full year. I am fully willing to relocate to leave my area as well (Maryland/DC-metro) I actually really like my job but commuting 4 hours a day (2 to work, 2 back) is no way to live. I ran some numbers and I could even take a $5,614.08 per year pay-cut and make off better; and that doesn't even include my ""hourly-rate of pay"" (I personally leave this out because, it is after-all, a hypothetical).

I put my resume out there last Friday...I applied for 7 jobs already. I currently make $55k. I'll keep you all updated. #blog. @ /u/printerror ; I did in fact apply for 3 positions in Jacksonville; thanks for the list of potential companies I'm looking into them.

* I hated my commute so much I even contemplated moving out of the state. This was the apply for many positions stage. In hindsight, I should have been more strategic and only applied for work that had my skillset. I wasted a lot of time with interviews for jobs I had no business applying for. Jacksonville FL still seems nice btw but I have ties to MD and wasn’t going to give that up first. My spouse was worried that leaving a job after 7 months would look bad became excited after I got the job and realized I would be home more to help out with the kid as she is running a small business at home and can use all the help. She is a great support to me. I leaned on her a lot through this. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 2:** 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm still applying for work. I am in touch with one recruiter...I was hoping he would offer work closer to home but instead it is in almost the same location I work now. On a positive note, which I was not expecting, there is potential I could get 10k-12k more with this job (almost a 20% salary increase) with a potential (have not asked) chance to telework. They may take a few more weeks to look at my application.

Secondly, I have found some benefit in leaving home ridiculously early (5 am). I got to work in a record 70 minutes...This, however, does not mean I get to leave earlier.

* That job was out of my league. I did not stick to the early schedule. My toddler won’t allow that lol. Around this stage I did discover the benefits of using a podcast. Thanks Joe Rogan. Also listening to whole albums was another thing I discovered to keep my sanity. Developing coping strategies became important.

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 3:**

&amp;nbsp;

Happy Friday yall! Update #3 on my defeating the commute: I have a phone interview with a recruiter in the same town I live in. I thought it would be impossible to find a position in my town (my town is mostly insurance sales...pawn shops...etc.) but turns out there is something. The position is for a ""financial reporting accountant"" and I sort of applied even though it was shot in the dark...we shall see what happens and what they're offering.

* I commented on this post later: “Turns out the recruiter only got in touch with me to ask if I knew someone who would be interested that actually qualified. lol what a butthole.” I was insulted by this actually because I felt I qualified for that position. I sent her a nice email on recruiting practices. Not sure if I was a d*ck or not. Didn’t matter. I was getting tired of all the headhunters, recruiters, etc., at this point. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 4:**

&amp;nbsp;

For anyone that has been following on because I am so important like that; I have been applying for new work so I don't have to drive 3-4 hours a day. On average it takes me an hour and half to sometimes 2 hours each day to get to work. This obviously is not sustainable but I have been doing it for a year and thank god for Joe Rogan podcasts.

Anyway, I have interviewed for 6 positions up until this point. All of them phone interviews. As an introvert, this blows and makes me anxious. ON a positive note, all of the interviewing has helped me really improve my conversational skills and my last phone call I felt pretty comfortable even when I didn't have ""an answer"" per say to the interviewer.

Anyway I am pretty lucky with my current opportunity. I killed it in a phone interview and they're trying to get me a in-person interview next week. The interviewer is concerned by my lack of experience (only one year I have, they're looking for 3-4 years experience) but he decided to interview me anyway because he said and quote ""It seems to me you're very teachable and this could be a good thing because you haven't ingrained bad habits.""
This is an audit position which I have very limited experienced. Now this is the big kicker and I really hope this pans out - the office is located only 45 minutes from home and its mostly telework 3-4x a week and includes a pay bump to what I make now. I don't want to get overly excited but really hoping for the best next week or 2.

* This is the job I ended up getting. Something about this recruiter was different. He was very flexible and very transparent about what to expect. He even coached me along the way because I had a bunch of phone and in-person interviews coming up. At this point, all the failure was actually making me more confident because I started to open up and I was no longer getting the trembling anxious feeling during phone calls. I think all the exposure just got me used to it. He really changed my perspective on recruiters and from this point on I focused on this job and wasn’t looking at other offers. IN HINDSIGHT, this would not help me in the negotiating stage later on. I should have had 2 or 3 other offers in hand to counter; however, I still believed getting work this close to home was not possible and when this opportunity presented itself I put it on a pedestal for sure. Your focus for job searching should include many factors besides commute. This seems like duh but I started off with only this in mind. I should have focused on what value I can bring and what skillset I can bring and then found work close to home that was looking for that skillset. This wasn’t obvious to me at first. My head was “I have a degree and this amount of exp, I fit the barrier to entry, hire me cuz I’m good.” Luckily I had started to learn this lesson and I was having better luck with recruiters. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 5:** 

&amp;nbsp;

So I have another phone interview this week and an in-person interview this week. I bought a new suit over the weekend. I figured it is worth the cost. Picked up a good deal on ties/belts at goodwill but the suit is new from Macy's and luckily I had a coupon on top of the 50% off sale. Not too shabby.

* I couldn’t have picked a better suit. It fits my look. I ended up doing really well in both of these interviews. The feedback on the phone interview went well despite the fact that I couldn’t understand that guy’s accent at all lol. I’m not sure how I got through that. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 6:** 

&amp;nbsp;

So yesterday was my big interview and I nailed it! My gut feeling is telling me it went really well. The only way I don't get the job now just boils down to lack of experience but like I mentioned before I may just get the job because of that. Long story short - having in-experience is not a bad thing because the guy wants someone that is ""teachable.""

Anyhow, what really excited me was that when I drove home after the interview and I pulled into my driveway and I looked at my watch and realized I got home in 32 minutes. I was ecstatic about that. Some on these boards would even think that is too long but to me that is sooo much better than the 90 minutes to 2 hours it takes me to get to work now. Not to mention this job has telework half the week.

So I have one my phone call with this job today. Its been about 3-4 different phone interview and one in-person. Recruiter told me to hang tight for the next steps and my feeling is I'm done with these interviews and I should be hearing something soon.

* I get anxious before in-person interviews but all anxiety subsides after I introduce myself, make the handshake, and sit down. For whatever reason, I build up a big event in my head and then after the interviewer begins to introduce himself I feel at ease. It sounds stupid but in my head I like to think of how Trump sits with his legs out and the way he holds his hands. It has a very easy going but also confident look to it that I somewhat try to emulate. Good eye contact is important to. Being introverted, this is actually a strength – the ability to listen and not talk out of your own butt. Somehow working on your posture will translate into appearing more confident and when you appear confident you become confident. It is these little things (new suit, posture, relax) that add up. Also I’m very good at asking relevant questions during and after the interview process. I always make sure to have at least one casual convo. With this guy we talked about kids. With my next interview, me and the guy went off tangent about crypto for 10 minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 7:** 

&amp;nbsp;

In the spirit of using the daily thread as my blog, figured I would provide another update. The phone interview went well and I have now been invited to meet with the team this evening.
Gut feeling is obvious to me that I will be getting a job offer. I didn't negotiate my salary for my first job (huge mistake!) but for this one, despite the fact that I am very excited for the role and shorter commute, I will be negotiating.

* I’m glad I decided to negotiate. No way was I going to make the same mistake twice no matter how much anxiety is involved. I didn’t want to sit in a “what if” situation all over again for years. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 8:** 

&amp;nbsp;

Had my final interview with the team yesterday. It went well. They told me there is one other candidate that they're interviewing today and I'll hear something before Thanksgiving. Its in God's hands now. Or in the Spaghetti Monster's noodles now; whichever you subscribe too.

Anyhow, suppose if this fails it wont' be the end of the world. I gained so much valuable insight on my career with these 6 interviews I have done. I know what I have to do now if this job doesn't work out. I now, for the first time, have a career plan laid out and I know what skills are marketable to develop for my field. One of my biggest regrets was with my employer now; I didn't negotiate my salary when I took this job. BIG mistake. I'm in a field where I should be making between $65k-$80k but I make $55k...(govt. finc analyst) Well we can't live in the past can we? Can only move on.

* I’m still living in the past and kicking myself for not negotiation my first job out of the military. In my head, it was like 2009 and I thought hundreds of people apply for jobs. My skillset is in a bit more demand that I think. Even sill, at this stage everything is going great but self-doubt was creeping and I was trying to develop a coping strategy if I didn’t get the job. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 9:**

&amp;nbsp;

Okay so it happened. My recruiter emailed me the good news that I got the job and wanted to meet up for a phone call. I knew that a lowball was coming but I was actually pretty shocked how low they asked for...it literally was only $2,250 more than I make now ($55k). Anyhow, I countered and said that was far too low. Perhaps I should have used better language but I was literally shocked lol. I tried to use some quick logic and said I would like to talk about it later after I put in some thought but the Recruiter really wanted to talk now and said he was about to meet up with the account managers because they were drafting the offer letter.
At that point, I explained my reasoning that I'm leaving a bonus and a salary raise on the table and said only $66k was my minimum (Ouch I thought to myself...I really wanted $70,000 but my mind is dumb in negotiations). Recruiter said ""okay I can try but understand there is a limited budget on the contract, are you sure you want that or are you willing to meet in the middle? Understand, I don't have much wiggle room and we're investing greatly into some training courses for you when you start.""
So it happened later and I ended up talking with a few people. I was able to negotiate about $1,250 more which still wasn't my minimum and even the recruiter said he knew it wasn't anything to write home about but I'm glad I said something rather than nothing. The good news is, I got them to agree to an off-cycle increase of $10k after I finish a certification (that they're paying for) in 8 months. Hopefully they hold their word but I don't think this is guaranteed given the nature of the sub-contracting business. We shall see.

I signed the offer letter and took the job. I have a good feeling about this firm and my gut feeling tends to be right more often than not. Not to mention, there is a hidden salary bump as I just reduced my commute from 90 minutes one way to 30 minutes one way! This job also has telework 2-3x a week after I get situated. They were very transparent and reasonable with me during the negotiations and even explained in detail why they couldn't go higher (and they wanted to). Part of me thinks these were just words but we shall see.

Regardless, I can say I did it; I reduced my commute which I thought was impossible in my location for the longest time and I should see great enhancements in my work/life balance. This will give me time now to work-out and perhaps even start a side-gig. I'm really glad I negotiated even though it spun a few heads. This job also matches 401k contributions up to 6% of salary matching; my previous employer didn't match either. One last justification is I believe this work will position me well for the future as this is my entry into auditing, big data analytics, using computer coding/scripts, and blockchain technology. In my current job...well I just Reddit all day because all of my pre-built master Excel sheets get all the work done and I have felt stagnant for quite a while. In hindsight, I should've focused on building skills during all this time because I was sort of sitting neutral on a moving train. Lesson learned.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion** Got the job. I suck at negotiating but I managed to eek out a little bit more money and got useful career advice. I didn't negotiate my last job and that bit me in the ass in a way. Cut my commute from 90 to 30 minutes. Now have a job that matches contributions up to 6% of salary. Positioned well to build a niche skill set (auditing/data analytics/programming/etc.) Lessons learned during the whole interview/negotiating process.

financialindependence,"When calculating your required savings for FIRE, make sure you're consistent between net and gross.","I wanted to post this as both a warning and for consideration. I have noticed a disturbing trend where people seem to calculate their expenses using net expenditures and their future income using gross. 

Example: I spend $40k per year so I need to save $1 million.  

Your $40k in expenses is typically calculated after paying all of your taxes (federal, state, Medicare, social security, etc.).  If you include the tax that is subtracted from your income, your net expenses are probably closer to $50k. Likewise, that passive income from your $1 million will be taxed (albeit it, probably at a lower rate) and will likely only amount to $30k to $35k after tax

I don't care if people calculate their number using gross or net. I just want people to either be consistent or cognizant of the gap between the two because I hate the thought of people entering retirement and realizing that they have miscalculated their FIRE plans.

Bitcoin,A little humor...my trading strategy vs 'the dog',"I've been in this for three months, mining alts &amp; trading as its near impossible to buy BTC 'here in the colonies'.

I have 19 student loans that are divided between two different loan providers. One started 2 days ago (at least it looks like it, I'm not seeing it on my bank statement) and the other starts in January of 2018. Below you will find the interest rates and the balance as of today for the one that started 2 days ago. It appears as if the balance has gone up $681.3 in the last 2 months. .

Hopefully that shows up correctly. 

So I have it set up to pay one of the lowest costs, but it's graduated so it increases every 2 years. Currently my monthly payment on this one is $325.24 and my other loan set will be about $198/mo. I might have room in my budget to add on some to the $325 for now until the $198 bills start coming in, my question is how much should I add on to which ones to create the greatest impact? And for future reference, if I had a spare $100 a month, what should I put where?

Hopefully this one shows up too, but this is just so you can see the other one and hopefully understand some more. I know this is a bit vague, but it's really hard to put it all into one short post:

The eChecking account I've had at Bank of America for the past 4 year is being converted to Core Checking, and I do not fit any of their conditions to get fees waived, and I'm not interested in paying $12 a month as I have a primary account at Ally. However, I've found Ally's customer service has started to wane (as recently as today where I had a chat rep who was an absolute idiot), and I see there are other banks with higher interest for savings/checking combos. I like Ally for their 24 hour service, free checks, and their interest rates are, for what they are worth, pretty good, but I'm wondering if it's time for a change.

I have an existing free credit union checking account that I may start using as my brick and mortar bank to make cash deposits in place of Bank of America, but I don't know if I should switch from Ally to another online bank as my primary (Salem Five Direct seems interesting, as well as Alliant, but I'm on the west coast and don't want to make a donation to join a credit union that already requires a membership fee). I do qualify for a free account at US Bank as I have a credit card from them, but I'm kind of weary with the big banks when it comes to checking/savings accounts. 

I do have a Schwab Checking account which I use for international travel, but I'd rather have checking and saving at one bank and Schwab's checking rates are not that great. I use credit cards so I'm not interested in doing X number of debit card purchases every month to get rewards.

Thoughts and any suggestions appreciated?

TLDR: Closing my BofA checking as they want to charge me fees - acts only as a brick &amp; mortar account for depositing cash and I'm looking to either my credit union or US Bank, thinking of switching online banks for checking/savings as I'm starting to get irritated with Ally for both customer service &amp; fact I can get higher interest rates elsewhere.",finance

personalfinance,"Started a PhD. Need opinions on moving into more expensive, but closer, rental","Hi Personal Finance,

As per the title, I've recently started a PhD and wondering about my rental options. I'm in Australia, so if the numbers seem weird, that's because it's in AussieBux.

Some backround first: I'm 27. My PhD is 3 to 3.5 years long, and I get a stipend of $47k a year for doing the PhD, which is not taxed. I also get $12k a year in a travel and equipment fund. This is a stipend, not employment, so I get no benefits nor contribution to a retirement fund. I have no debt other than my university debt, which is indexed to inflation, but has a 0% interest rate. I've got $4000 in an emergency fund, but no other significant assets.

My current accommodation is tolerable, but pretty substandard. I only pay $80 a week for a room in a 3 bedroom share house, but it's got a number of issues - chief among is that it's about a 30 minute drive (60 min bus) from Uni, and 60 minutes drive (120min bus) from friends and family (this is considered excessive in my city). There's also other irritations with the house, due to it being built cheap and fast in a low socioeconomic area (doors don't fit frames, no insulation, dodgy wiring, high crime rate, etc.) as well as housemates doing the relationship drama thing. Housemate's dad owns the place, and made it clear he didn't have the money to fix the place up before I moved in, and that he's not going to kick his daughter out.

So, I'd like to move to a rental within walking distance from uni. I've looked at couple units, and they range from about $230 to 270 per week for a (fairly small) one bedroom unit. I guess my main worry is that this is (unnecessary) lifestyle creep? This is the first time I've made more than about 12k a year, it'll be a min $150 a week increase in expenses (150 a week is &gt;60% of what I was earning a year ago), that, while convenient, isn't necessary, and could be put towards appreciating assets like stocks or a house deposit, rather than pissed away on rent. On the other hand, not having to drive an hour per day saves me time that I could be using to do more interesting things.

I've hemmed and hawed over this for a quite a while now, but I've gone nowhere except in circles - so I thought I'd come to PF to get some more perspective.",finance

personalfinance,Is marriage financially beneficial for us? One of us has a job the other is going to graduate school.,"I was hoping I could get some information on the pros and cons of getting married, specifically for financial reasons, such as: various tax deductions and credits, eligibility for scholarhips, writing off loan interest, etc.  

Starting June 2018, my fiance will be starting her graduate degree as a Physician Assistant.  She will be attending school for 27 months and get out September 2020.  During this period, she will most likely be taking out loans for her education, unless she receives a scholarship.  Also, she won't have a job or any income for this time frame.  

I make $48,800 a year, and have 1 child.  I currently file as head of household.  I plan on maintaining this job and a similar salary for the next 3 years while she goes to school.  

So here's a few things I've considered so far:

When she is in school, I think I will have to put her on my medical insurance which will be an extra $170 a month.  Over the course of 3 years, this will cost an additional $6,120.  Whereas, if we remained unmarried, I believe she would qualify for insurance through Oregon Health Plan.  

If we marry, I believe I could file jointly on taxes with the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit and receive a $2,000 tax credit per year and deduct up to $2,500 in interest paid towards loans per year.

Filing taxes married with my salary would save approximately $1,000 a year because I would pay 10% less in federal taxes for the income earned beyond $37,950.  

We may or may not be eligible for a small earned income credit if married, although I think we will still earn too much.

If she doesn't get scholarships, education will cost around $95,000 and then living expenses probably another $45,000 (just a guess).  So she'll owe $140,000 at 6% interest rate.  Could this debt affect us purchasing a house once she's out of school?  

I'm sure there's a lot more information that i'm missing but I was hoping someone could look at this information and give me their thoughts on the best financial move based off of these circumstances and any other circumstances that I may be missing.

What is my next step? I know this debt is mine and i feel confident this law firm has the required documents if I were to try to dispute it, so I don't think I should dispute this. Should I just start with offering/asking to settle in writing? I don't believe I should call, right?

Please help, I feel time is very urgent right now and I am terrified because I can't pay 12,000 Or even 6,000 right now.

9 months later and a collection agency is calling me.  I'm trying to track down the bill and, as it turns out, I owe $500 for some lab work and about $300 for the doctor at the lab to evaluate.  I never received any bills in the mail.

I am a little miffed that a) the dermatologist didn't tell me there would be such a great expense for the biopsy b) I never received the bills for this c) I am having such a difficult time tracking down the bills

I've tried to reach out to the billing departments to pay the outstanding balance and have left numerous voicemails.  No one is calling me back.  Apparently there are 2 different billing departments - one for the lab and another for the doctor that looked at the results.

personalfinance,"Recent graduate, working full time, looking to start grad school.","This is my first time posting on this subreddit, and I'd like some help with this word problem aka my financial situation.

On October 30, I started a full time job at a biotech startup with an annual salary of $45,000 before taxes (effectively $35,259/yr in my county according to [this](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) tax calculator). Before then, I worked 2 months at a mortgage company making $25,000/yr before taxes. I currently have $2,000 in a [savings](https://www.ally.com/) account earning 1.25% in interest (transferred today; average daily balance method) and $2,300 in checking.

I graduated this past spring with a bs in biology and physics, and was accepted to a graduate program (ms in predictive analytics) at my university, which would start in January and cost around $32,370 ($2,490/class X 13 classes X 10 weeks each). I have $29,406.47 in government student loans in deferral from my undergraduate degree ($28,000 principal, $1,406.47 accrued interest; breakdown in chart below; $301.09 est monthly payment). My living expenses are $300-400/mo, since I live at home and commute to work, but may be closer to $1,000/mo soon (I'm looking to rent an apartment in the city). My job and school are ~15 min away from each other on public transit, and I can take classes in the evening or online. I am wondering what would be the best way to pay off my current student loans and minimize the amount I pay for my graduate degree in the long run, while also living a reasonably comfortable lifestyle.

* Should I pay for graduate school out of pocket and continue to defer my undergraduate loans, or should I take out new loans (higher interest rate ~6%) and pay off my current loans quickly? If I don't defer, my minimum payment starting in January will be $301.09.
* Which of my undergraduate loans should I prioritize paying off (unsubsidized first, but should I start with the oldest, biggest, newest, smallest)?
* Am I eligible for a [tax deduction](https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/are-student-loans-tax-deductible-6570/) while I pay off my student loans? How do I get it?
* How much should I be saving each month vs paying off loans? (I've heard of the 20/30/50 rule)
* What are the best ways to grow my savings? My company is currently overhauling its benefits program so I am unsure what to expect for 401K. (idk if they'll do a match, didn't before, but so far the health insurance is better + cheaper!)
* What are realistic financial goals I should set for the future?

Thanks!

personalfinance,"Shredded credit cards, switched to cash","I have posted before about using CC with 55 days interest free purchases and rewards points, and how I used them to pay for a bank package that reduced my home loan interest rate. I have always paid on time, and have never paid a cent to the banks in interest. But I have decided to pay off the balance of my CC, shred the cards, and close the accounts - this is because as financially literate as I am, I came to realise that I cannot compete with the psychological tricks that banks have invested many millions (billions?) of dollars into with the aim of making me spend my money. 
I realised that while I was (smugly) beating the bank at their game of interest-free I had let my guard down regarding how much I was spending. This, to me, seems the true intended effect of interest free periods, and I should have known better. I know exactly how much I have spare each week, but the time-shift effects of that 'feature' threw it all out the window.

So - I have cancelled the cards. This is only solving the time-shift problem; I also fall into the trap of forgetting how much of my splurge money I have already spent when using a debit card. To combat this I now withdrawl the full physical amount of cash that I have spare for that week, and when it runs out, thats too bad. 

I urge others, even those that are pretty well versed in the psychological tricks that the credit industry use, to examine their spending habits. Noone needs a credit card, and its a brave person that thinks they can outwit an industry that has every financial reason to fleece you.

an ordinary, financial bubble, like the same American dollar and in general the currency of any country entering (WTO)!
   This worries and worries ""bright minds"" throughout the world. And with this it is necessary to do something. Unfortunately, Japan has already ....
It is impossible to admit the recurrence of such a large-scale catastrophe as the USD, which will soon be born of its consequences.

   For reference: the external debt of the United States is almost 20 trillion USD. It is difficult to imagine that every US citizen,
and even a newborn baby, should be about 62 000 USD! But, in fact, the average American
there is not even 300-400 USD of ""free money"", if you suddenly need to pay something like this, you will have to borrow again
or even sell something from your property! So the Americans themselves answered in an interview on the streets of New York and Los Angeles.

worldpolitics,"Spend Spend Spend or, Austerity?","On the one hand we have Labour planning to fund an estimated £300bn spending frenzy, with promises of a range of ‘freebies’ the politically naive have embraced, and proclaimed Mr Corbyn as the saviour; on the other hand we have the Conservatives literally printing money to apparently ‘boost’ the economy and enforcing so-called austerity which in turn stifles private expenditure.

""complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong answers.""

Perhaps this is why Labour peddles the message that they can foster economic growth simply by ‘injecting’ money into the economy. Any government stimulus spending and / or quantative easing is not a magic wand that creates jobs and income. Repeated failed attempts in America and abroad have shown that governments cannot just spend their way out of recessions. Focusing on productivity growth builds a stronger economy over the long term

President Obama's $787 billion stimulus bill failed; economists predicted it would create 3.3 million jobs. It actually led to 3.5 million lost jobs, pushing unemployment above 10%. The fact that the US government failed to spend its way to prosperity is not an isolated incident

There is every reason to expect another stimulus round to fail as miserably as the past ones, and it would bury the nation deeper in debt. The idea that increased deficit spending can cure recessions has been tested repeatedly, and it has failed repeatedly
Moving forward, the important question is why government spending fails to end recessions. Spending-stimulus advocates claim that government can ""inject"" new money into the economy, increasing demand and therefore production. This raises the obvious question: From where does the government acquire the money it pumps into the economy? Government does not have a vault of money waiting to be distributed. Every pound government injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy. No new spending power is created. It is merely redistributed from one group of people to another.

Government cannot create new purchasing power out of thin air. If it funds new spending with taxes, it is simply redistributing existing purchasing power (while decreasing incentives to produce income and output). If Government instead borrows the money from domestic investors, those investors will have that much less to invest or to spend in the private economy. If they borrow the money from foreigners, the balance of payments will adjust by equally raising net imports, leaving total demand and output unchanged. Every pound Government spends must first come from somewhere else.
Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level. Similarly, taking pounds from one part of the economy and distributing it to another part of the economy will not expand the economy. Every pound of increased government spending must correspond to one less pound of private spending. Jobs created by stimulus spending are offset by jobs lost from the decline in private spending. We can build roads instead of factories, but fiscal stimulus can't help us to build more of both. 

In fact, large stimulus bills often reduce long-term productivity by transferring resources from the more productive private sector to the less productive government. The government rarely receives good value for the pounds it spends. By increasing the budget deficit, large stimulus bills eventually contribute to higher interest rates while dropping even more debt on future generations.

The counter argument is to reduce the tax burden on individuals and businesses which will put more money in the ‘coffers’ and therefore give both more to spend.


Certain tax cuts can add substantially to productivity. Economic growth requires that businesses produce increasing amounts of goods and services, and that requires consistent business investment and a growing, productive workforce. Yet high marginal tax rates-- defined as the tax on the next pound earned--create a disincentive to engage in those activities. Reducing marginal tax rates on businesses and workers will increase incentives to work, save, and invest. These incentives encourage more business investment, a more productive workforce by raising the after-tax returns to education, and more work effort, all of which add to the economy's long-term capacity for growth.

personalfinance,Credit score dropped 41 points,"Hello humans of PF,

Long time lurker, first time poster.  First, let me just start by thanking you all for helping me fine tune my financial habits even more than they already were.

I’m wondering if any of you credit score experts can help me figure out why my score dropped from 715 to 674.

A snapshot of my credit situation:

I don’t have a credit card, my lines of credit are federal student loans (two accounts, one for FFEL loans pre2010, the other standard direct loans, both with a couple loans per account), and my car loan.  As a result, my payments are 100% on time, but my utilization is 0.

My average credit age is okay, 5.8 years.
6 total accounts, with 3 open (2 student loan accounts, and car loan), and 3 closed.
No derogatory marks ever.

The one variable that did change recently is my credit inquiries.  Previously before the drop, I had about 5.  When I bought my car, they ran hard checks on my credit for different possible car loans, and now all but one has dropped off.  I would have expected that to be a positive change rather than a negative one.

Now there are two other changes that aren’t visible in a report that may or may not contribute.  One is I froze my credit after the Equifax breach, which I’m sure some of you did as well.  I don’t see why that would negatively affect things though.

The other is I have paid off two student loans since accelerating my debt payments.  But those accounts are still open.

Would any of these factors really cause my score to drop 41 points though?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",finance
gaming,Video-game development design faults,"First of all, I'm an adult that likes to play videogames, there are many I like and a lot more I dislike. 
But almost all have in common one thing, the exhaustive use of collectibles, towers, and small uninteresting ""go to map marker"" type of side missions to make up for the lack of content regarding real story of the game. This serves the purpose of filling up time, it's basically something for the player to sink time and gives the illusion that the game/story of the game is longer than it actual is.

This is aggravated by the the constant money schemes stuffed in AAA games (deluxe editions, micro-transactions, DLC's season-passes, DLC's outside SP, loot boxes), so in essence I find myself paying 69,99€ for a game with 20 main missions (most can be completed withing 20 minutes without rushing), the rest is boring filler, and on top of that there's the additional DLC's and other stuff that because of small stories, really incentives people to spend more money so that they can get more play time for the game.

One of the reasons why I loved the wither 3 (favorite game of all time) is because of how well the story was done, how long it was, and even the side-quest were like mini stories in itself, it is a proof that a AAA game can make profit without money grabbing schemes despite big publisher saying otherwise to justify them.

It used to be only a handful of game franchises that had his tower design and heavy focused on collectibles, but now you see them in every game. 
I also liked Horizons Zero Dawn so much because of how the progression of game was handled, from start to finish, you didn't had to grind anything, unlike other games (even the Witcher) you have to grind money, xp, etc, but not HZD, you just played the game/story and you would naturally get almost of all the things the game had to offer, it's a unique game in that regard that didn't have a necessity for ""how to"" you-tube videos.

personalfinance,American Express tried to charge the wrong bank account 3 times causing triple overdraft fees. They say this is their standard policy.,"This story got longer than I expected. See TLDR at the end for the short version. 

I wanted to let you all know so that you don't have to deal with this like me. So here is what happened:

3 years ago I got Amex card with cashback rewards an no annual fee. Used it for 2 years and then got other cards to keep building my credit that I started using. Put this one in a safe. A month ago I decided I should start using it again so that I they don't close the account for inactivity. Now I have autopay setup on all my credit cards so they are paid off in full at the end of each month. The problem is that this one was still setup with an old credit union that I no longer used (but didn't close. It is nearby and I like to have it in case of cash deposits but my direct deposits go to another credit union with much better interest rate).

So yes, the first time they tried to get $58 it was completely my fault that the funds were not there. I declined overdraft protection on my account from the beginning hoping that my card would simply be declined rather than incurring fees if I tried to go over my available funds. Unfortunately, ACH withdrawals from online payments and checks sort of supersede this and will still try to process and charge you an overdraft fee. I saw the fee thanks to mint/credit union email warnings. That same day I went to amex.com and asked them to charge my other account. They said they tried but since the other payment was processing they couldn't run the new payment but I could try back in 24-48 hours. That is all they told me and at the time I did not see any fees from the CC side. 

I called the credit union and explained the situation. I asked what I could do to and they said that they don't normally waive the fees but they do offer overdraft protection. I asked if I get the overdraft protection (a $500 line of credit) could I get the fee refunded? I was told yes and I decided that the credit pull would be worth the $22 and the chance to avoid this hassle in the future.

What American Express DIDN'T say is that they would keep trying to run the old payment 2 more times for a total of 3. So two days later after being too busy to check my email, I see two more overdraft fees. I immediately went to Amex and chatted with them again. I told them to look at the last chat and see that I asked for payment to be run on a different account. That is when they said their standard is to try the payment 3 times over 3 days. So now I had 3x $22 overdraft fees on my bank account and $27 fee with amex for the returned payment. I asked amex if they could credit my account for the overdraft fees but they said no, I had to work that out with my bank. Then I asked if they would at least be able to refund the $27 and she looked at my account history with very little activity and said that I did not qualify. She asked why I did not use my account very much so in a last ditch effort I tried the pity card and made up a sad excuse. I said that I had the card in the back of my wallet and was using another joint card until recently but said I would be experiencing a divorce this holiday season so I was going back to my separate accounts and closing the newer shared accounts. This was enough for her to say ""I am sorry to hear that. I went ahead and put in a one time exception to waive this fee""

Now back to my credit union. After my first call and agreeing to setup overdraft fee protection they called me back and left a voicemail saying they needed some more info to complete the setup. I called back the direct extension of the person who left me a message but either they were on the other line or out of the office so I left them a voicemail. 2 days later I now see 3 overdraft fees and I call back in to see what is going on. The new guy at the credit union tells me they don't typically reverse an overdraft fee even when you are enrolling in their overdraft line of credit. I told him that I specifically allowed a hard credit pull because I was told that my fee would be refunded. I asked him to look at the last call notes and try to talk to the two people that I spoke with the first time and ask them to verify what was said. 

Luckily the first guy had my back and because the phone tag person was out of office they said they would just go ahead and reverse the three overdraft fees. 30 minutes of phone calls and chats saved me $93 in total fees.

**How to avoid this in the future:**

First, try to set up small recurring payments like netflix on cards that you tuck away and set them to autopay. Then if you ever switch your main credit union/bank make sure to update ALL of your autopay settings on all of your cards. Finally, if this happens run to the bank and deposit enough to cover the charges+the first overdraft fee, otherwise it will probably cost you more than three times as much.

TLDR: I had my AmEx setup to the wrong bank. I gave them a new account to use but their system charged my old bank 2 more times. The bank charged me $22x3=$66 in overdraft charges and then the CC charged me $27 for the returned payment fee. I was VERY lucky to get these refunded but for most it would be better to fund the bank account right away if you are aware they will keep trying.",finance

During this time, we were on a low earnings trajectory such to not have the requirement to file federal quarterly estimated tax: we expected to owe less than $1,000 in tax for 2017. 

I actually attempted to (electronically, when filing) pay the April 15 first quarterly payment just to be on the safe side, but for some reason that was not my fault it didn't go through, and IRS sent me a note later saying so. I then did not pay any other quarterly payments, federal or state (was also under that state's threshold).

Then in mid August, my wife started a new job--and stopped her self-employed gig work. I continued mine. Her new job pays a good salary, starting near the end of September, so we will likely owe more than $1,000 in taxes for all of 2017, due now to her Sep-Dec earnings from this job. Therefore, it seems perhaps we *should* have paid estimated quarterly tax payments. I just didn't know at the time she was going to get this job.

What should we do now to avoid, if possible, any possible underpayment of taxes penalties?",finance

personalfinance,Will I qualify for a private student loan?,"I'm a 31 year old single parent just finishing up my first semester back at school. I started with 57 credits and took 12 this semester (plus 60 hours of classroom observations). My TAP award and Fed loans left me with a $950 balance this semester and again for next semester. I'm making it by, but just barely. I'm worried as my work load increases (I also work 30 hours a week and parent.) that I will not be able to afford life. I'm lucky enough that I had good credit- I bought a house last year and have a $366 mortgage. I live quite frugally, but things are getting very tight. Someone recommended a private loan. My federal loans just posted to my credit report and now my score is only 650, which surprised me greatly. I think it is a combination of the new loans plus I have been charging daycare to a credit card, which is carrying a 2500 balance of 3700 limit.
What determines an appropriate loan? Can I ask for money to help buy books and supplies? I have four semesters left, one of which will be a full internship, working full time for no pay. This is so intimidating. But I do truly believe finishing my degree will fundamentally change the course of our lives. I have an application filled out in Discover loans but haven't granted them access to do a credit run, because I don't want to take the hit if they are just going to deny me. I don't have anyone that can co-sign. My income is low, about 18,000, but like I said, our bills are incredibly low as well. Ideally I could get the loan to cover the difference for next semesters tuition, books, and maybe help pay for some daycare. Should I go ahead and hit ""Process"" on that discover loan site?

personalfinance,Need advice - managing debts and car purchase,"Hi there! Looking for some financial advice. Due to some medical related emergency circumstances, I’ve incurred more debt than I’ve ever had to deal with. Additionally, I will need to purchase a car in the very near future (my 12-year-old, paid in full standby is finally giving out on me). 

I’m 31, and have spent the majority of my adult life in a lengthy educational program, currently completing a fellowship. I hope to have a “real” job, with a salary increase and better benefits in the next year or so. 

Here’s a rundown of my finances:

Salary: 88k
Savings: $7k
Retirement: $35k (never had an employer match 401(k), but have maxed out IRA contributions as much as possible)

Monthly expenses (rent, bills, etc): $2250

Student loan debt: $5,700, currently on a 10 year payment plan at $80/month, 5.59% interest rate

Credit card debt: 
-$9800 on an interest free credit card until October, 2018 (then stupidly high rate after that)
-$9600 personal loan with 10.97% interest rate. The current repayment plan is at $314 a month for 36 months. There is no penalty for paying it off early. (I opened this to transfer money from a high interest credit card)

My credit is ok (736), but did take about a 50 point hit when I incurred this debt. 

My primary questions are:
-How should I go about paying off my debt? Which accounts should I pay first? How much should go to debt vs savings and retirement?

-What should my target car price be? How much should I put as a down payment? What can I reasonably expect to get as an interest rate given my current financial situation?

I am super embarrassed to have gotten myself into the situation, but really trying to get out of it and would be grateful for any and all advice!",finance

personalfinance,"About to purchase a house, please review our mortgage &amp; payment plan.","**Background:**  We (30 F &amp; 30 M) were both were financially independent before we met while living abroad.  We dated for two years and decided to tie the knot.  We have since moved back to the US and are now coming up on two years of marriage.  In our time together we have been able to grow our savings through smart choices and teamwork.

**Situation:**  We’ll be in our current location for at least the next 3 years with the possibility of staying for 8 years if the stars align. One of us works in a field where their headquarters is in the area we currently live, meaning we are likely to return to this area in the future (read: we plan to rent it out when we move).  We are fed up with renting (and with HOAs) and have decided to buy.  We are in a high cost area and have entered in a contract to build a house for $450,000. Since it is being built, we have until early April to figure out what how much we’ll take out in mortgage and if we want a 30 or 15 year loan.  One of us is Military and we are opting to utilize a VA loan (quoted at 3.25% for 30 year; 3.00% for 15 year).  Initially we thought we wouldn’t put anything down but that would make our monthly payment $1,900+ which is higher than we pay in rent.  The goal is to have as low a monthly payment as possible without setting ourselves up for failure. Since it is likely we’ll move in 3-8 years, we want to keep the payment low to allow us to incur another rent/mortgage payment in the future.

**Numbers:**  [Here is a picture of our current Financial Standings as well as a mortgage chart for reference.]( https://i.imgur.com/SBmagmZ.jpg)  All of the numbers in dark green are what we have in our accounts right now.  The numbers in light green are amounts we should have accessible by 1 April.  “TSP Loan General Purpose is if we are approved for a second, smaller TSP loan from the same account as mentioned in a later paragraph.  “Net Cash Savings by 1 Apr” is how much we should be able to have saved additionally by then and the “Loan to a friend” is just that, a loan which a friend is repaying as agreed and should be paid off by 1 April.  The numbers in gray are funds we have but don’t want to tap into.

**The Plan:** The goal is to have as low a monthly payment as possible and to pay it off quickly after that.  Currently a lot of our money is tied up in investments.  We’d have to take a loan out against our TSPs to make this happen, but they offer residential loans specifically for this.  (For those unfamiliar with the TSP, it’s a [government savings account that allows a no-penalty loan to yourself that you pay back over time.]( https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/LoansAndWithdrawals/loans/index.html)) We’d opt to pay these loans back in 4 years at roughly $1k per month each.

**Calculations:**  The calculations do not include the “light green” amounts, as those are not certain payouts by the time they are needed.  It looks like we’ll need at least a $226K loan, possibly slightly more to give some breathing room as this will exhaust nearly all our savings.  We replenish cash to the tune of about $3,000 a month, up to $5,000 if we cut back our lifestyle a bit. 
Currently, we’re thinking of getting a 30 year loan for about $226k which gives us a monthly payment of approximately $977, excluding taxes and insurance.  We plan on paying back this 30 year loan at the rate of a 15 year loan (approximately $1,561) and potentially throwing more cash at the loan at the end of each month after we replenish a cushy amount of cash savings for emergencies.

**Comments:** We’d love to hear from fellow redditors on our situation!",finance

personalfinance,Withdrawing principal from Roth IRA,"Hello,

Thanks for all who chimed in on my previous post regarding Roth IRA distributions. I'm currently on a leave of absence from graduate school and need to withdraw from the Roth IRA to make ends meet. I'm going to withdraw $2000. Overall I've contributed $4500 and the total value of the account is $9000. 

My understanding was that I could withdraw the principle/basis without any penalty or taxes whatsoever. However, when I went to do this on vanguard, this is the message I received:

Because our records show you're under age 59½, we have to report this to the IRS as an early distribution. Early distributions may be subject to a 10% federal penalty tax unless you qualify for an exception. Consult a tax professional to review your eligibility for an exception

It also asked me if I wanted to withhold 10% for federal taxes for this distribution. 

Is this simply a standard message for any Roth IRA withdrawal before 59 years old? Do I need to fill in any extra forms come tax time to prove this is simply a withdrawal from the principal?

Thanks so much for any advice - I need this $$ but don't want to get into tax trouble!!",finance

personalfinance,How can I make this amount of student debt even remotely manageable?,"This is a really complicated issue that has been festering for some time, so apologies in advance if at any point this becomes incoherent rambling! 

So to provide a bit of background, I'm currently enrolled as a junior at a university in the United States. I'm an International Affairs major, and my annual COA is roughly $70,000 per year. I'll withhold the name of the institution for privacy reasons, but if you're motivated and can use Google you can figure it out with relative ease. 

In terms of financing this, I have the following contributions that I am NOT obligated to repay: 

$20,000 Parent PLUS loan yearly 
$12,000 merit-based scholarship yearly 

Now on to the fun part, the loans! 
Roughly $7,000 yearly in Stafford loans (mix between subsidized and unsubsidized) 
Private loans- Roughly $30,000 yearly in loans from a private lender, currently at an interest rate of 9.31%, variable rate 

Parental household income is roughly $200,000. I have two younger siblings that are not enrolled in college, and my parents are either unable or unwilling to contribute more than the Parent PLUS Loans. Both of my parents have changed jobs recently, and I only have FAFSA data from their 2015 tax returns, though if there has been any change at all it is likely an increase. 

As you've probably figured out by some of these numbers, my parents have provided me no financial guidance whatsoever. I wasn't instructed how to shop around for loans, seeking any privately available grants, or how to actually apply for a loan in the first place. My father only told me to always apply for a variable rate loan. This was fine until I took an intermediate Economics class and found out about the effects of the Federal Reserve raising the rate at the discount window-oops! Barring another significant economic recession, my interest rates are going to continue to increase, which is especially problematic given that the majority of my debt is privately held. 

Further complicating things is the fact that earlier this semester, my father refused to cosign my private loans, and instructed me to use my mother as a cosigner instead. My father is around 80% of their household income, and I never stood a chance of approval with my mother cosigned to the loan. After the inevitable rejection my father agreed to cosign my private loans for my third year. I've been approved by the lender but not the University; the negative balance in my account has led to a financial hold preventing me from registering from classes. By the time this is sorted, I'll be registering at minimum 2-3 weeks after my registration deadline. I cannot guarantee I'll be able to find openings in classes which make progress towards my degree so it may be possible I may need a 9th semester in order to graduate. I'll be scouring the listed openings to try and get as many courses as possible that fulfill my degree requirements, but this issue will become more clear once my hold is lifted. 

All told, I'll have approximately $150,000 in undergraduate debt, the majority held at interest rates approaching 10%, all of this to finance a degree with very poor repayment potential. Going from the average salary of my university's graduates, it would be mathematically impossible to repay this debt actually! 

And to top it all off, I was contemplating law school. I will be taking the LSAT, but whether or not I apply would be wholly contingent upon my LSAT score. At top law schools with strong placements in BigLaw, even with taking on additional debt from law school I could reduce my debt-to-income ratio. However, that is a VERY big assumption and I would only entertain the law school path if I ended up with a competitive LSAT and stood a chance at admission at a school with promising employment statistics (increasingly hard to come by in 2017). 

Ignoring that tangent, should I be unsuccessful in this regard I'll be graduating with a bachelor's degree and a debt larger than some mortgages. What steps can I take to make this easier to swallow? I've been loathe to consider the idea of dropping out and cutting my losses given that I've already committed so many course hours, but would that be a reasonable option? 

There are quite a few loan forgiveness programs for public service jobs, but I'm unaware of any for which private debt would also be eligible. 

It's easy to minimize this situation by seeing a case of yet another financially illiterate millennial seeking a bullshit liberal arts degree. But the fact of the matter is I am in an utterly ruinous financial situation and cannot see ANY viable solution out of it. I don't think it's an exaggeration to state that I am firmly on a path towards eventual homelessness and bankruptcy (not that it would fix student debt anyway!). Any financial advice whatsoever would be immensely appreciated, and I would, much like with my student loans, be forever in your debt. 

Apologies if the formatting is incorrect, this is a throwaway. 

TL;DR- $150,000 undergraduate debt, mostly private loans, 9.31% interest, liberal arts degree",finance

Bitcoin,Headlines from the future: Jamie Dimon Arrested in Attempted Theft of Ver Satoshis,"9 January 20xx 

SAN JOSE (Reuters) --  Jamie Dimon, the last head of JPMorgan Chasegroup before its fall into receivership a decade ago, was arrested this hour in a brazen daytime robbery attempt at the #VerVault.

Authorities say that Dimon, in a clever though bizarre move, was able to walk as far the security gate without drone confrontation by wearing a Halloween mask of UN Ambassador Vinny Lingham.  The ruse collapsed when Dimon could not reproduce Lingham's seed gesture, and he was quickly apprehended.

Retweets of the arrest spread quickly across the Federated Counties of Silicon Valley, clearly the top-liked buzz amongst the nation's Genesis Day revelers.

Questions still linger, however, about the quality of the security being provided at #VerVault.  A spokesperson for Musk Global Securities portrayed Dimon's near-breach as a result of abundance of caution and denied any flaws in the AI at the weeks-old makeshift fortress.

#VerVault still faces an unknown future.  Once just one of many public warehouses for the unclaimed security deposit boxes of shuttered ""bank branches"", the San Jose facility attracted worldwide attention last month when Stanford University president Wences Casares announced that a team of blockchain-analysis graduate students had identified it as likely housing one of the missing wallets of reclusive trillionaire Roger Ver.  Instantly dubbed #VerVault by consensus, the warehouse was quickly engulfed by fire-fight between local police and cypherpunk militias before Musk forces took control.

The wallet, if found, could contain billions of satoshis, experts say.  

But proof of ownership -- the only thing that will allow the Musk Security AI to stand down --  remains in dispute.  

This is the first lost wallet found since Ver retreated from the world after selling BitCoffee and purchasing the outer islands of war-weary New Zealandstan.
  
While abandoned wallets ordinarily become the property of the International Monetary Crypto Fund, this wallet is thought to date from 2011, before Ver renounced his United States citizenship.  According to some interpretations of the Ljubljana Peace Accords, the Federated Counties of Silicon Valley could therefore claim ownership.

Attorneys for the Fund and the SV will be hashing their closing arguments this afternoon to the Ethereum World Tribunal.  In the event of an auto-remand to the appellate Corpus Court -- which many legal experts anticipate, given the complexity of the case and risk of another hard fork -- Chief Justice Vitalik Buterin has promised to recuse himself.
    
Should the FCSV prevail, President Brian Armstrong has asked Nobel Laureates Adam Back and Zooko Wilcox to oversee a Commission to handle the atomic swaps of the Ver satoshis. 

Armstrong has called for using the bulk of the proceeds to aide refugees fleeing the ongoing Aztlan-Texarkana conflict.  Some critics have dismissed this as election year pandering in the face of the rumored candidacy of media mega-mogul Barry Silbert.  Even some in Armstrong's own party have called it a distraction from the politically unpopular need for increased funding for public full nodes.

CryptoCurrency,"US market crash: a case for $50,000 Bitcoin","Let me start by saying that despite the title of this post, when I say $50,000 BTC, I'm also talking about $4,000 ETH, and prices for BCH, XMR, Iota, et all to go up 5x, 10x, maybe even 20x.

I'm a regular subscriber to several financial newsletters and one recent publication from Stansberry Research caught my eye.  Therein they are discussing the yield curve of the short term US T-bills and the US long bonds.  In the following graphic you can see what happens when the yield curve inverts (short term borrowing is more lucrative than long term borrowing):

https://image.ibb.co/bxhM8R/dig1_5a15e29aea076.png

Each time the yield of short term Bills goes higher than long term bonds, we get a significant correction (stock market crash) and a US recession.

**""The reason this signal is powerful is simple and intuitive...**

**""Suppose a friend asks to borrow some money. In general, the risk that you won't be paid back in full increases the further out in time you agree to lend. In other words, all things equal, your risk is much lower when lending to him for a week than for 20 years.**

**""The same idea is true in the bond and loan markets. As a result, the longer the maturity of a bond or loan, the higher the rate of interest the lender typically charges to compensate for these higher risks.**

**""This means that under normal circumstances, an inverted yield curve – where short-term bonds yield more than long-term bonds – should never occur. It's a sign that something isn't ""right"" in the economy.**

**Usually, it occurs when the Federal Reserve (which sets short-term rates) and the bond market (which controls long-term rates) disagree about the underlying strength of the economy. And history shows the bond market is usually right.""**

Now, imagine what a US stock market crash followed by a US recession will look like.  In our last recession, the US government debt was about ~ $6 trillion.  Today, it is over $20 trillion + more in student loans, car loans &amp; private debt.  Should the US economy turn, there will be a LOT of defaults.  When bills don't get paid, interest rates go up.  The cost for the US to float the $20 trillion in debt is about ~ 2%  If bond yields go up to 4%, 6%, or even 8% - the US won't be able to pay its bills.  

The only solution will be to print more money.  

More $ in circulation = inflation

Inflation = lower value of the currency

Lower value of the currency = higher perceived value of alternate currencies

We often think that the price of gold has gone up.  It went (just recently) from $300 per ounce to $1,900 per ounce before settling around $1,200 per ounce.  But in reality, the price of gold, today, is the same as it was 200 years ago, or 2,000 years ago.  What has changed is how many dollars it takes.  Gold didn't go up in value, dollars dropped in value.  I often see Baby Boomers posting pictures of gas prices when gas was at $.79 cents saying, ""Do you remember when gas was so cheap?""  Gas still is cheap, its just that the dollars to buy the same amount of gas have been inflated.

**""As Porter noted on Friday, an inverted yield curve is particularly bad for financial stocks...**

**""Remember, banks earn a profit by borrowing short-term and lending long-term. When yields are inverted, banks are less incentivized to lend. (After all, why would you willingly lend money at a loss?) Bank earnings will fall.**

**""But the consequences extend beyond financials alone.**

**""As part of the ""fractional reserve"" paper money system, banks are a critical ""cog"" in the modern, debt-fueled economy.**

**""We're already seeing signs of tightening financial conditions. If banks stop lending, credit growth will grind to a halt. And once credit growth stalls, it's only a matter of time before this gigantic financial bubble bursts.**

**""What should you be holding when it does?**

**""Regular readers know we believe a healthy allocation to gold and silver – along with some cash and a perhaps few short sales – is among the best ""hedges"" you can own today.""**

Stansberry has never been an advocate for crypto mainly (in my opinion) it is because they don't understand it.  

But try to imagine a scenario in 2, 5 or 10 years wherein the value of the US dollar drops 50% in a month.  Who is going to sit while their $10,000 savings account falls to $5,000?  And, if a gallon of milk goes from $3 to $6 or a $7 meal at McDonalds is now $14, your $10k is now worth $5k.  

We will see a massive rush to buy gold.  We will see a massive rush to buy alternate currencies.  We will see massive (Billions) rush to cryto currencies.

If crypto climbs 100% at the same time that the dollar falls 50% in buying power, the flow will be massive.

personalfinance,Opening my own checking/savings accounts for the first time and thinking about using two different banks. Thoughts?,"So I'm in college and up until this point I have used a checking account that my mother made for me at a bank back in my home town and since I have a job now and I'm making money, I want to open my own accounts.

The first issue I have is the bank my parents use have basically no interest for their checking/savings accounts (0.01% APY) and because I'm young and just starting out, I'd like to open my own accounts with reasonable interest rates and benefits that apply to me. 

After a fair amount of research, I am now thinking of opening a checking account with Alliant Credit Union and a savings account with ALLY bank. My thoughts are that this will:

1. Maximize interest

2. Diversify where my money is in case of fraud/unforeseen problems

3. Keep me from dipping into savings as often

I know that this will have some downsides as well, such as not having a local Alliant credit union around and that ALLY bank is an online only bank. 

Before I go and do this, I'd like to know what you guys think about this idea and maybe throw some things at me I probably haven't thought of. Is using two different banks a bad idea? Maybe one of the two banks/credit unions I chose is a bad choice? I'd love your opinions on this.",finance

financialindependence,A book I'm reading has an interesting take on home ownership and implicit rent,"The book makes many interesting arguments, including:

- Property never increases in value.  Property depreciates and needs to be maintained.  It is only the land under the house that appreciates. 

- Housing prices have increased roughly 200% since 2000.  Record low interest rates have accounted (by his math) for a 72.5% gain in those housing price. (The book is written in the context of Canada).

- Every homeowner is paying rent.  A homeowner pays rent on the money borrowed from a bank (mortgage), and after the mortgage is paid off, there is an implicit rent.  Implicit rent referring to the opportunity cost of having, for instance, $500,000 tied up in a house when it could earn you between $1,700 to $2,500 per month. 

I thought this last bullet was interesting and was curious to see if the FI community agrees or feels like he is misrepresenting homeownership. 

P.S. I don't have own a home so I am limited inn my ability to make an informed decision.  Also, the book is written with a heavy bias towards renting  (the book is called 'The Wealthy Renter')

Thanks all

EDIT: Lots of comments and discussions.  I like that!

EDIT 2: To clarify, because this keeps coming up.  If you sold your house and invested your $500,000 at a 4.8% RoR, you would make $2,000 per month in income, but you would then pay $2,000 per month in rent. In total, your net gain is $0 per month

If you owned your house outright, the author is arguing that you're forfeiting the potential income on your $500,000 of equity (i.e. $2,000), but you're not paying rent. In essence, you're paying yourself an implicit rent of $2,000 which also results in a net gain of $0 per month. 

In this case, the determinate on whether it is better to rent is based on whether there is a premium or discount on renting in your city vs home ownership. 

For additional consideration, implicit rent is taxed in Switzerland, so it has been recognized as a legitimate concept by a western government. For full disclosure, they also do have deductions for mortgage payments and other homeowner costs come tax time.",finance

We live in a very inexpensive college town and are having a very inexpensive wedding. Like $1000 budget. Our income is very low, but am a responsible budgeter (I use YNAB) and i also know our tax return will be huge come april. We have a bad millenial eating out habit we are working on, cost us like 250 last month lol.

I guess what I'm asking is for some advice to put ourselves in the best financial position during the next two years until we graduate, when those student loans kick in (scary!) Gladly by then i should have a job, my prof said accounting majors have 100% hiring rate at my school.

personalfinance,Best thing to do with $15k,"My husband and I have been saving for a year and so far we have $15k in our savings account.  We both have a 401k set up.  This savings account is meant to be a shorter term savings, mostly for a more expensive house in a better school district within the next 8-10 years.  (We don't have kids yet.)

Currently, our bank has a .1% annual interest rate on the savings account. We were considering transferring the savings to my husband's state employees account, which has a 1% interest rate. I was wondering though, is there anything else - low risk and relatively short term (5-7 years) we can do with our annual savings (our goal is to continue saving about $15k per year) to accumulate a higher return?",finance
personalfinance,"Take out more loans to continue school, or climb the ladder with experience?","I need some opinions on what my next step is for my career. I'm 20 years old, I have an associates degree in accounting, and I like what I do. My apologies if another sub would be better for this, but this is also a huge financial obligation with maybe not a lot of payoff.


I made $14.00 right out of school, my performance raise got me to $14.50 (was super disappointed with this as I should have been making 15/16), but our 3 person department went down to just two last month (me and my superior) and my pay was raised to $17.00. Based on some guessing, the lady who quit was making around 50k/year or 24/hr (she had her bachelor's degree). My job responsibilities haven't changed much since she left, I am just learning to do a few new things. My supervisor is on salary and works overtime almost every week, but she must love to work extra, because I usually only work 38 hour weeks and often spend a few hours helping out another office with non-accounting work. We receive yearly performance raises every January. I am eligible for full benefits, and will be eligible for 401k and a 3% match in July.


The job I have now has many different responsibilities in accounting and I will come out of it with many different job options as I could probably find a job specializing in any one of the tasks that I do. Those jobs specializing in specific tasks maybe pay around $18-20/hr but generally need 2-3 years of experience. I've been working with my company for 7 months.


My financial situation:
$1,000 emergency savings (goal is $4,800 for 4 months of expenses, then I will throw money at my loans)

CC never has a carrying balance on it, I use it minimally

$15,000 Federal loans, all are between 3.6-4.8% interest, repayment starts soon


A local university has a degree completion program for working adults. It has classes 1-2 nights/week and I will need to be a full-time student to be eligible for a scholarship. Accounting for the scholarship, I will need to take out $15,000 in federal loans for the two years it will take me to finish (assuming I can handle full time work with school) and possibly take out $2-4,000 in private student loans for books and extra fees. I have a lot of extra free time, have no friends, and I'm just not a very busy person. I did take one class this fall (paid out of pocket), had some trouble with motivation, and saved almost every assignment for the day it was due, although I still got an A and finished everything on time every week. It was not an accounting class but still business-related. It was not challenging at all, so that was a little frustrating. I have high standards for myself and always strive to be the best I can be academically. This is why I don't want to simply stop at an associate's degree. I feel like that's not good enough for me.


My question is - Do I take out another two years of loans to go back to school? I will start out at that 50k when I graduate, but I also might get there myself with the yearly raises or finding new jobs with my experience.",finance
personalfinance,Special mortgage for professionals AKA should I buy a house?,"*THE FINANCING* 
I know of a handful of banks that finance loans specifically for attorneys, doctors, CPAs, professionals of that nature, etc. The idea being that individuals who become doctors and attorneys have loads of student loan debt (making a down payment difficult) but high income earning potential. So the gist of this particular loan is the bank will 100% finance the mortgage (no down payment needed) and will NOT charge PMI. But, the interest rate will not be as favorable depending on my credit score. Suppose I can refinance later, though.

I fall into that vocational category, and after verifying my income with a local bank that has a professional mortgage program, I've been pre-approved for a $400,000 mortgage. Because it's just a pre-approval, I don't know the terms for the interest rate on a 30 year note yet, but discussions with my lender lead me to believe it would be around 4% - 4.5% interest rate.

*THE HOUSE*
I've found a house I like! YAY! It's listed at $320,000, but ideally my offer would bring the price down significantly. The property has been sitting on the market for awhile, and I know that their construction loan from flipping the house will mature in February. (I tracked down their mortgage filing. I can see the total for their construction loan/mortgage (rolled together) was only $235,000, and they need to sell the property soon.) Bit of a low ball offer on the house, I'd like to pay tops $285,000 given the price of surrounding houses. According to the seller, the house is completely renovated on the inside, has new HCAC, plumbing, and electric. Like all the houses in that neighborhood, it was built early 1900s. Obviously I need a home inspector to confirm the house is in good shape, but from what I know now, I shouldn't have to spend a ton of money on the house if I buy. It should be turn key, it's only 10 minutes from my office, and it is in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in my city 2 blocks from one of the best elementary schools/ 6 blocks from a nice daycare. (I don't have any kids yet. Just thinking of resale or my 5 year plan). One con, however, is that the house is on the outskirts of the desirable neighborhood, next to a more lively night scene. That means there could be an issue with non-violent crimes on this particular street, because while that area is getting nicer, it's not done growing up. 

*MY CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION*
I just graduated and make $100,000/ year.  Take home each month is $5,600. I have $40,000 in student loan debt at about 5.5% interest rate. I've only been working 3 months now, and I only have $3,000 in savings because I've been throwing money at my student loans and making sure my credit card debt is paid off every month. I currently pay a family member $400/month for a room in their house, but I NEVER stay there. While I love my family, that relationship is healthier if we have a little space. So I've been staying with my significant other in his apartment for a few months now, not paying him any rent. My SO and I have a great relationship, but he is not ready to truly live together, which is fine. All that to say, I should really either find my own apartment or buy a house for myself. If I rent an apartment, it would be about $1,100/month in bills/rent, which I feel I would just be throwing away. As of right now, I'm paying my family member $400/month for basically letting me keep my bed and some extra clothes at their place, which also seems like a waste of money. Because I just landed this new job, I don't plan on moving anywhere in the foreseeable future. So, I might live in this house for several years, but it's not my forever home.

Besides that, I don't carry credit card debt over from month to month. However, I probably eat out too much and do enjoy traveling when I have time, which can get expensive. Buying a house might mean I need to reign in my eating out, and take less trips. Also, I will need a new car within the next year or 2, but I will buy used and ideally spend less than $10,000 on that future expense. 

SHOULD I BUY THIS HOUSE? I'm nervous because it's a big decision and my first time owning. Does anyone else have experience with this type of loan?

TLDR: salary $100k; student loan debt $40k @ ~5.5% interest; potential house $320-280k @ ~4.5% interest (no down payment or PMI required on the house); savings only $3000; if I rent it's ~$1,100/ month",finance
personalfinance,"About to sign a mortgage, but I just bumped my credit score by 50 points. Possible to recalculate my mortgage interest rate before signing?","We're a few weeks away from closing on a house, and I just had a delinquency from years ago fall off my credit report. We're ""locked in"" on our mortgage interest rate at ~5% right now. If we were to start the process over today, we could probably get 4.5 or 4% — a pretty gigantic difference when compounded over years. At this point, though, I'm not sure we could start this process over with a new bank without a significant push-back of the closing date — something the seller might not be willing to do. So I'd like to just have our current bank re-calculate our interest rate now. Has anyone ever negotiated with a bank just prior to signing on a loan to adjust the interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Create an annual bill fund,"Open a savings account with a decent interest rate (e.g., Ally), and setup a recurring deposit from your main checking the same days as your paycheck. The recurring amount should be the sum of your total bills that happen annually divided by the number of paychecks you receive in a year.

The reason is twofold: a savings account when annual bills surprise you (like they do me), and an easy way to pay for things annually that you get a price break for.

Some examples from my annual bill fund:

- Car registration
- Pet registration
- Pest control (cheaper annually than monthly)
- Family pictures
- Angies list, Amazon prime etc
- Various races (running)
- Society memberships
- Grass reseeding (Arizona)
- COSTCO Membership

Whenever these pop up, transfer the amount owed from your annual bill fund. It takes a full year to stabilize, so when you get an expense that's greater than the amount, just transfer everything  and it will at least reduce the pain. Keep a spreadsheet with the bills and amount and add to it if you forgot stuff in your initial list, and adjust the amount you contribute accordingly.",finance

personalfinance,"High student debt, what are my best options?","Hello reddit, this is my first post so go easy on me.

I’m 31 and my wife is 30, I️ make 130k and my wife makes 120k.  I️ did not have any debt prior to getting married but assumed about 200k in student loans after marriage, which we have reduced to ~150k through aggressive spending cuts.  I️ have approximately enough cash saved to pay the debt outright but don’t want to do that because we’d like to buy a house after we get out from under this debt.  

We recently refinanced for an interest rate 2.5% variable.  We are making monthly payments of 6-7k, and still saving about 2k.  We should be debt free by q4 2019 at this rate.  

My questions: 
1) Would it be better to just make minimum payments and put the rest of my savings into a higher yielding asset?  Nasdaq is up roughly 25% ytd.  I️ know this is very risky, but I’m young and have a greater appetite for more aggressive strategies.  

2) Don’t save anything, put 100% to loan payment to get out of debt 6 months sooner.  

3) Has anyone had success with debt forgiveness?  If my wife went back to work in the non profit world her loans would be eligible to be forgiven in 5.5 years.",finance
personalfinance,How best to maximize index fund returns in a Roth IRA in the face of huge student loan debt,"About me: 37 yrs. old making $67,000/yr before taxes. I opened a Fidelity Roth IRA when I was around 34 and have been contributing $100/month since that time. I only just recently - maybe about a year-and-a-half - started applying those funds towards a series of Vanguard index funds. I can’t remember exactly why I waited to start applying my Roth IRA funds towards actual investment instruments, but I think it had something to do with needing a minimum amount to invest. 

I’m wondering how best to maximize my ROI as it pertains to these index funds. I’ve seen good returns overall (7-8%), but obviously as these index funds increase in price, my purchase power is going to continue to wane over time. Is this typically how investing in index/mutual funds works? I’m hoping at some point to be able to get to the point where I am maxing out my annual contributions ($5500) but my read is that I still end up at the same conclusion: as these index fund price points increase over time, I will see a diminishing ROI. I think this is a pretty clear cut example of the “buy low/sell high” mantra, but just wanted to make sure I am not missing something or if there is something else I should be doing.

Regarding student loan debt, I have a ~$170K from graduate school that I am on what they call an “income-based repayment” plan, which lowers the monthly payment, but does not cover the total amount of interest accruing every month, so the total amount of the loans actually increases over time. I have been making monthly payments since I graduated in 2011, but the overall amount that I owe has actually increased due to being on the income-based repayment plan. After 25 years of making on-time payments, the loan amount is forgiven, but I will have to pay taxes on whatever the remaining amount is. I’d like to be able to be making the full monthly payment every month so at least interest isn’t accruing, but I’m not financially able to do that without making life a living hell for my wife and daughter - e.g., if I was making the full payment amount each month, I wouldn’t have any additional funds to put towards our mortgage payment/saving for vacation &amp; other quality of life expenditures...the amount that I owe is so staggering that it doesn’t really bother me since I know I have fairly limited options available to me to really make a dent in paying them off. Refinancing options that are available put me in the same boat - I could get lower interest rates but they wouldn’t lower my monthly payment enough to where I think it makes sense to pursue refinancing. 
I’m not really sure how these “income-based repayment” plans are even legal, but it is what it is. 

So I guess with that background info in place, I’m wondering what the best course forward is for me. I also started my own firm this year with the hope that at some point I’ll be able to make a lot more in my chosen industry than working for someone else.  I know it’s a gamble but I don’t really see another viable option to get ahead of my student loan debt. 

Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer. 

Cheers!",finance

personalfinance,Question about medical bills (AL/CO),"I had a very bad car accident while living in AL.  I was in the hospital for a month.  AL didn’t take the Medicaid expansion money, and as I was waiting on my disability being approved, I didn’t have a job.

I did go to the Jefferson County charity “hospital” (it’s been defunded, so there’s no actual hospital anymore), and the local state hospital (UAB) had an arrangement with them.

Apparently, they knocked off $60K because of the charity hospital.  But I just got a bill (from almost a year to date of service) for ~180,000, due 11/11/17.  I can’t pay that.  My disability has been approved, I moved to CO for better social services, and I absolutely cannot work.

I also know that only 2 agencies can garnish SSDI.  The IRS and federal student loan agency.

Do I look towards a cash ISA, a long term savings account, a ""bonus"" savings account or just a standard easy-flex savings account with very low interest rates.

personalfinance,Is it really a good idea to pay off loans as soon as possible?,"I have always thought that if you get a loan, you should always pay it off ASAP. If you can do double payments, great. Even better if you can just buy the thing you want with cash (tho with houses thats usually impractical, for example)

But last week on ELI5 someone asked why large companies with lots of money don't pay their debts off, and someone brought up that companies keep investing money to expand, so just expanding the company is worth more than the interest rates on their loans.

Well, I thought, does this also apply to people, in a way? For example, if you get a 30 year mortgage, that's like 4.125% interest payments. Well, the inflation rate currently is approximately 3.5%. That's almost free money! That's an effective interest rate of 0.6125%! If instead of paying off the loan faster, you put your spare cash into your retirement fund or into some safe stock investments, that would probably beat your mortgage rate. So, then, wouldn't it be worth, even, to get the biggest mortgage you have, for a rate less than 5%, and just invest all of it?",finance

I did a reddit search to see if this information was already available here, but I wasn't able to find it, so please forgive me if this is already answered somewhere else.


Heres the story: (I am an Alberta resident and 26 years old with a small student debt if that helps at all)


After filing my tax return this year, my refund didn't get deposited into my account for several months. Today, I got fed up with waiting and decided sign into my CRA account and see what the hold up was. I then found out that I did not have direct deposit set up and that my cheque had been mailed to me.  However, the address that they had on file was of a residence that I had moved out of in 2015. Because of this, my past tax return cheques for both 2015 and 2016 and any GST cheques  may have recieved for mailed to the wrong address.  


I feel like a total bonehead for not realizing sooner that I did not recive my 2015 refund and GST refunds. I was reciving student loans and I totally forgot about them. 


So basically my question this: Am I in danger of losing any of this money from bot claiming it since November 2015?

*Mortgage: $865

*Utilities (water/electric/trash): $225

*Cable/internet: $120; considering dropping cable (would reduce $70)

*Cell phone: $80

*$400 to my older son at college to help with rent/groceries/gas

**Debts/loans**

*Furniture/Best Buy/Medical payment plans - $248/month; combined because they have no interest and will be paid by next summer

*Chase Credit balance of $14,000 @ 16.99% interest

*Lowe's Credit balance of $3600; deferred interest until April 2019; $200/month paid to wipe balance before then

*Credit balance of $7,500; no interest for 21 months; opened it up to pay down Chase balance

*Personal Consolidation Loan - $564/month for 5 years to help pay down high interest credit lines

*Stafford Student loan from youngest child - $5500; $50/month starting next month   

**Income**

*Working straight-time as an RN nets me $4,700/month; with overtime shift(s), I can take home an additional $2,000/month

**Assets**

*Savings - after I move some money to pay down Chase credit card, I will have $1,000

*Checking - $3,000

*I own my older son's mid-2000s Toyota Camry

*I have absolutely ZERO retirement (and I kick myself every day for not starting sooner); my employer matches half of my contributions up to 6% but I cannot currently contribute anything


**Questions for r/personalfinance**

*I've heard from a friend of someone who works with a repossession company that the bank my car loan is through doesn't usually come after the car owner for lost money when the car is turned in and put up for auction. I'm so upside down due to previous trade-ins that my monthly payment is astronomical for the car (a new Hyundai). Would turning in my car and getting a bucket with wheels be an option? How would this affect my credit and would it actually help my financial situation to have that extra $700 per months to pay down debts? 

*I've been offered a new credit line with a local bank ($2,000) with a 9.9% interest rate on balance transfers. Would it be a good idea to open that credit line and use the balance transfer to pay down some of my higher interest debt? 

Thank you in advance for any suggestions. I'm just lost at the moment and looking for a concrete plan to get myself out of my hole and start saving for retirement as soon as possible.",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] [Budgeting] Funds are drying up. Credit cards are close to max. About to be unemployed.,"I am a 21-year-old independent student and have no ties to family, therefore I do not have the will, nor ability, to ask family for funds.  I need help, advice, etc. budgeting and tackling some bills before I graduate. 

I will be done with school in May 2018. As of right now, I have an internship that will officially start on January 5th. However, I have come in on my days off to help out and learn a few things here and there. Since I have been doing that, the firm said they would hire me on when I graduate as a paralegal. 

I had a huge hiccup in finances a couple months ago. My truck ended up being totaled, not at fault, and I had to get a rental during this time. The “reimbursement” for my truck pretty much paid for the rental unfortunately. 

I finally had enough and put $3500 on a credit card as down payment for a used car with low mileage and decent fuel economy (Truck got 8 city/15 highway and this car gets 18 city/30 highway). 20/20 hindsight should have never bought the car and should’ve bought another beater.  

Following that, my area had a “historic flood” which flooded my new to me car. I had to pay a deductible of a $1000.00 from my savings (I haven’t had an accident since I was 15 so I didn’t lower my comprehensive deductible, again 20/20 hind sight). Insurance went up by $9 dollars the following month because of this, they didn’t total the car, but they replaced carpet and what not and now it’s a flood car instead of a no accident car. 

Attached to all of that are the hours I had to take off work, and the rental I had while my car was being fixed which came out to a lovely $697.39. Unfortunately, I did not opt for the rental coverage, again 20/20 hindsight. The deductible and rental wiped my savings dry. 

Another problem I have at the moment is that the internship, which is required per university requirements, is 9-5 Mon-Thurs and 9-12 on Fridays and is unpaid. I usually work a part time job that brings in around $300 (plus or minus $50) dollars every 2 weeks. 

When the internship officially starts I will have to pay bills and other expenses. The employment hunt still continues, but I am focusing on budgeting and making it till January when I will get a refund check for my loans. 

Here is my current break down of student loan return, checking, savings, and debt:

School Loan Return (will receive the second/third week in January)- $5,475

Checking: $220

Savings: $0

Credit Card 1: 
Outstanding Balance - $2605/3100
Minimum Due Dec 7th - $0
Interest – 19.15%
Cash Advance – 24.99%

Credit Card 2:
Outstanding Balance - $5175/6000
Minimum Due Dec 17th - $133.00
Interest – 20.24%
Cash Advance – 25.99%
Balance Transfer – 20.24%

Credit Card 3: 
Outstanding Balance - $1171/3900
Minimum Due Dec 7th - $75
Interest – 0% if paid off in 13 months

Credit Card 4:
Outstanding Balance - $0/5900 (Paid Off)
Balance Transfer Offer – 14.99% with one time 3% Charge


Here is a breakdown of my monthly expenses:

Rent + Utilities - $685 (Due Dec 1st and can use a credit card to pay)
Spotify bundled with Hulu – $5.33 (Due Dec 1st)
Cellphone - $48.40 (Due 15th)
Insurance - $104.42 (Due Dec 15th)
Car Payment - $262.04 (Due Dec 22nd)
Renters Insurance – 12.06 (Due Dec 22nd)
Gas - $50
Food - $250
Miscellaneous - $50

TOTAL – Approximately $1470.00

Other notes:

I have to buy more professional clothes for the internship so this is another expense I will have to make soon. I’ve been trying Goodwill and thrift stores but I am 6’5 with a 40 waist and 32-34-inch inseam. I’ve got a huge chest (about 60 inches), Large neck at 18 inches and long arms so all the button downs don’t fit right unfortunately. I have only been able to find 2 shirts and 1 pair of pants so far in the past 3 months. I also need a pair of dress shoes as well.

I will luckily be pulling a full 40-hour work week for one week before my place of work closes for the holiday (20th-31st). I currently make $7.85 an hour. 

I am looking for a higher paying job, I have one lined up that is 10 dollars an hour for Friday and Saturday 10pm till 7am. However, the search continues. 

I know I have been irresponsible with the purchasing of the car and I wish I had not made so many poor purchase decisions in the past. However, I have never missed a payment and all three credit cards (from 3 different banks) have given me a FICO score between 666- 683 (Although 666 popped up twice, lucky me).

My lease is up in July, however, I found someone to rent from me May 15th –July 31st. I will be finding a cheaper place then. I have spoken to the people who my car loan is through and it can be lowered interest wise from 9.6% (Remaining balance of 13,435.01) to a lower rate in a month. 

My health insurance is $1240.00 (Due a week after I get my loans), however, I can get a “refund” for that through the school that will be returned to me about a month and half later. 

I am selling all of my fishing poles, some tools that I can part with, speakers, stereo, pictures, etc. to get some extra cash. I have everything I own in my apartment, and it kind of hurts to see some things go knowing this is all I have. The only thing that I’m still highly contemplating is my box of Lego. I haven’t used/played with them in about 7 years, but they brought me joy growing up and I would want my kid (currently single as no funds to date) to have them. I priced some of the sets, and the weight of the bulk and I could bring in around $1000 to $1800 for them. This doesn’t include shipping, eBay and PayPal Fees. I would sell them as a means to keep me off the street only. Other than that, I don’t have to many other assets. Mainly TV, Xbox, Laptop, Phone, Headphones, books, and some things I picked up from trips that mean a lot to me but are worthless.  

School loans total currently around $35,000 and will be around the $40,000 mark when I graduate. All loans are through the government.

These Numbers will Change:
Sub – $16,250 
UnSub – $16,734 
Current unpaid interest - $1204.65 (Interest rates vary depending on which loan)

Again, I am looking for advice, guidance, help, and so forth.  My parents were horrible with money and I swore I wouldn’t end up like them. I know I have made poor financial decisions in the past, I am looking for the path to financial security till I get a more permanent job and I can really start tackling debts and planning for the future.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Debt consolidation for a couple planning to buy a car and get married someday,"So I’m coming here to get some advice on debt consolidation. My SO and I started renting a house together in the summer and within 3 weeks had accumulated brand new and maxed out credit cards at two different stores for almost $4000.00. This doesn’t take into consideration what he and I already both had.

I had a previous credit card setup of about $3300 which is about 80% used and he has his own $2500 which is maxed out for the most part.

I was reviewing my credit karma and it suggested a personal loan so I really began to dig into the prospect of debt consolidation. I used a local servicer once for a car repair and had a pretty good experience with a 22% interest rate.

We pay out almost $300 a month in credit card usage so I am considering that if we could find a personal loan with a repayment plan of 3-5 years, we would save money on interest fees and have it paid off within reason versus a drawn out credit card balance roller coaster. 

We could probably based on the terms increase to $15000 just to pay off some other debts and start a goose egg for our car and wedding.

But my questions and concerns are if this is a viable way to approach debt consolidation, how does a loan balance like this work with your credit score (he also has astronomical student loan balances), and will we still be eligible to receive a car loan in the spring?",finance

personalfinance,"I am a 22-year-old college graduate of this May. My parents put me in $7,000 of credit card debt, took out private student loans for me because they filed for FAFSA incorrectly, and are 60 days delinquent in paying the loans. Credit score has dropped 200+ points.","I'm 22 years old and graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences in May. My parents have been having financial struggles since the financial crisis in 2008, but they have gotten progressively worse.

Last fall (2016), my mom told me she had signed up for a credit card that I had been pre-approved for. (It had gotten mailed to the house.) By this point, they had already racked up charges on my other card and nearly maxed it out. I know it was foolish to extend my help again, but I felt so badly knowing they were struggling. I knew my mom signed up for the card in hopes I would help her.

So I did. I told her if she needs to use it for bills, she can. At first, that's what they used it for. Then groceries -- from Whole Foods, no less. Then business costs (they have their own company that is quickly dying and is essentially just manned by the two of them now), then wine. Then gas. Everything.

I am now in $7,000 of credit card debt across 3 credit cards, struggling to keep up with the interest.

I also recently discovered my parents had done something shady with their tax returns and thus were unable to file for FAFSA correctly my last two years of college. They took out high-interest private loans in my name and have been paying them (I'm grateful for this). However, I woke up on Thanksgiving to alert me my credit score had dropped to 480 because of delinquent payments on all 6 loans.

I plan to take over the payments so I can be sure they're paid on time, but I will struggle to do so. In total, my loans for my Bachelor's degree are about $100,000 -- $80,000 in private loans with Sallie Mae and about $20,000 in federal loans.

Currently, I make $20 an hour. I moved out to California, but seeing as I will be unable to afford an apartment or even get approved for one (I'm staying with family), I've decided to move back home with my parents. It's TBD if I will be able to transfer to a company location near my home on the east coast, so I may have to try to find another, comparable-paying job.

My expenses each month are as follows:
1. Car lease ($280) + auto insurance in California ($220)
2. Credit card minimums ($300)
3. Federal student loans ($200
4. Private student loans ($500)
5. Food (~$120-140)
6. Gas ($40-50) -- I drive a hybrid
7. Misc. expenses ($100)

Ideally, I would like to be able to save at least a small amount of money each month and pay off my cards more aggressively to save money on interest. I calculated that if I pay a total of $700 per month across all cards, I can pay off the debt by this time next year (2018). I would save $3,000+ in interest in doing so.

Any advice on how to pay down my debts efficiently while finding a way to save a little bit of money each month would be very much appreciated.",finance

I may also use that fund to fill my Roth.

personalfinance,"Saving for a car, when to actually purchase?","Hi!

I have been really wanting a car. I currently don’t have one, and after research, I am interested in purchasing a new car that costs around $22,000 USD. 

I have decided that I do not want to get an old car that only costs a few thousand, as I would likely have to put in money for repairs ( I have had two cars in the past, each over 20 years old, one completely broke down after a year and the other gave me trouble until I sold it when I first went to college). Additionally, many used cars for sale in my area are not as good in the snow or on dirt roads which is a must.  If I am going to invest in a car I would like one that will last many years. When doing my research I found some used cars that I would like for around $18,000, but I feel it would be worth the extra money to get the exact car that I want. 

I am a college student and do not have a stable job, and have to get a new job for summers and often for new semesters. I am looking to find internships for summer or higher paying stable jobs throughout the school year. However, as I lack transportation, I am limited to only look for jobs on my schools campus, which usually pay around $9/hr, where other easy to get jobs (fast food, etc. that are always hiring) off of campus pay around $12/hr.  Additionally having my own transportation will likely improve my summer options.

My parents are helping to pay my student loans, and will help pay for a car instead if I decide to go that route.

Additionally, I have about $5,000 in savings that I could put towards the car.

Getting a car is a goal for the future and I understand I cannot go out and get it today, however, I am interested in any advice on how to make my goal a reality.

My question is how much should I be making per month before getting this car is a viable option? Should I put more into savings to have a larger down payment? What is the best way to budget for this purchase, and all the insurance and gas and other payments that come along with it? Is getting a car a bad financial option? Any advice?



Thanks!

EDIT: Clarification 

EDIT: I have seen quite a few people comment explaining that I am not in a position to afford this car right now. Thank you guys for trying to make sure I don’t get in over my head with a giant loan I can’t afford!
However, I am hoping for advice on how to save up for this car and how to get myself into a financial position where I could afford the car. 

Additional helpful information: I will be graduating in 2 years after which I will have a stable income of around $65-75k.
My parents are willing to co-sign the loan and help with the car and insurance payments if I decide to get the car. We should not have a problem getting a car loan, I am more worried about the payments of said loan. Also, if they do help with the car, they will stop helping with school loans. None of my school loans require payments until after I graduate, and they have an interest rate of about 4%. I am not knowledgeable enough in loans to know what the best option is.

personalfinance,Wondering if I should close one brokerage at Credit Union for a Vanguard one (Financial Snap shot inside),"Hello PF! I apologize upfront about the length of this post. However, because I am bringing up many different subtopics under the umbrella of finance, I appreciate any feedback on even just individual topics.

First, an over-view snapshot of my finances. 

* Summary
* My monthly income - $3,330 (This is based off a 50k a year salary but within 7 years will automatically go up to 85k through step increases with unlimited overtime opportunities at 1.5 pay many peers make $100k a year with a little OT)
* VA disability - $1850
* Spouse - $3,000 (this will last in the foreseeable future and will graduate in 3 years and begin working herself)
* emergency fund of $14,000 
* Managed Mutual Fund - $95,000
* Spouse Foreign Bank - $70,000


* Expenses
* Rent - $1635
* Utilities - $225
* Internet - $60
* Cell phone $ 140
* Car Insurance on our vehicles - $170
* Monthly payment for her car - $220 with 7.5k remaining at 4 percent (was thinking about just throwing about an extra 1 a month on this to get rid of it
* 2 dogs - $200 a month
* My health insurance is 100 percent covered by my employer and hers is auto deducted from my monthly income at about 80$ a month
* Groceries - $450

I am a 28 year-old male married with no kids. As of August, I currently bring in 50k a year but net per month is 3300. This deduction covers about $100 per month to a deferred compensation account (I believe this is a called a 457b?) pushed by my local government employer but they do not match anything since they 100 percent pay into a pension that I can use starting in 20 years for 70 percent of high 3 or in 30 years for 100 percent. I elected to only do 100 a month since I am unaware of the performance of this option and I am used to always taking my money first and then investing it (learned recently this is not the best option).

In addition to this, I recently was awarded a 90 percent disability rating through the VA which is $1890 after 9 years in the military.  My wife and I as of the last two years are decently frugal and saving oriented, and I have been able to get my USAA Managed Mutual Fund account to $95,000. I have it set to a moderate risk level, but after further research see that all my investments are within USAA owned funds. I believe this will not be good for the growth of the account because of fees and overall performance.  One of my major questions is, although I earned about 9 percent last year with this account, would I be better off transferring this large amount into a Vanguard Managed Mutual fund account and if so, what is the best time of the year to do this? I believe the end of the year is when a lot of investments pay dividends, and I would absolutely hate for my timing of this to be unbeneficial in the short term. 

My wife is a student who intends to graduate in the medical field within 3 years with a decently high starting salary of $90k a year. She is a foreigner who receives monthly gifts equivalent to around $3,000 dollars a month which has helped me to save so much money in the last 2 years. However, this is also the foreign account we have been paying her tuition from. 
Our expenses are pretty low as we do not live in an extremely high COL area. Within 10 months, we would like to utilize my VA home loan to purchase a home in our city and we are looking within the 250k to 300k range utilizing my VA Home loan. 

We have no credit card debt or student loans. Other than paying off my wife’s car within the next few months we have no debt other than our monthly expenses and rent. In addition to all of this, my wife has about 70k USD equivalent in foreign money that we were planning on having her convert into USD this February when she is traveling home. It will take a conversion hit, but we think it may be worth it because navigating her home countries investment market is difficult for both of us and we can lump sum it here with our other investments.

My main goals are to get retirement accounts going for both of us with IRA’s in whichever form might be most beneficial to us (Roth or Traditional). I have recently started my self-education on basic financial planning and investing and would like PF’s input on switch between my credit union’s portfolio to one with Vanguard (since I believe I will be opening my IRA there). If I made a huge mistake the last two years dumping money into my brokerage account let me know. I think if I do transfer investment providers, I will funnel 5.5k this next week into an IRA and then another 5.5k at the start of the new year. I feel as if I missed out compounding interest by not having my IRA opened already. 

Thanks again for the input and sorry once again for the disorganized information.",finance
personalfinance,Can we afford this house?,"Hi PF, time for an age old question. My husband and I found the perfect home in a location we would like to settle down in. It is 349k. Before taxes we make roughly 120-130k a year. With taxes it would be about $2100 I think. The only debt we have right now is a personal loan, which we pay $600 a month and the interest rate is less than 1%. We will probably rent this home out until we are ready to move into it. My husband is in the Army so our housing is covered until then. If we can't afford this home, how do I know how much we can afford?",finance

She is also saying that she confirmed it with the person she talks to for health insurance. (she doesnt speak english, so she calls the company itself, not sure if its her currrent health insurance provider, or someone working for the governemtn health insurance services, and uses a bilingual person or translator there)


quick data sheet.

1. I am 25. i used to be dependent on her for tax purposes and we both had free health insurance. i got a job 4 weeks ago, and I will be using my employers health insurance come 2018.
2. my mom needs to apply for health insurance again, but this time, she will be listed as single with no independents since I will be filing my own taxes. because of this, she is telling me that she will have to pay some amount since she is over the income limit for free health insurance having no dependents (she makes anywhere between 20-25k a year)

Bitcoin,IMPORTANT FOR BITCOIN USERS: How to verify PGP signatures of bitcoin software,"# If you want to store a nontrivial amount of bitcoin, I strongly encourage you to learn how to use GPG.

If you are new to open-source software projects such as Bitcoin, then you have probably never heard of [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) (note: ""PGP"" is the original proprietary software, ""GPG"" is the open-source reimplementation of PGP ; I'll use the two terms interchangeably). GPG is software used to create [openPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP) digital signatures that Bitcoin developers use to sign software they publish. GPG fits with the ethos of Bitcoin since it also does not require any trusted third parties to function (such as [certificate authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)). However, Windows and macOS do not come equipped to verify PGP signatures; you must download GPG software and perform the validation yourself. 

Below is a guide I wrote for verifying PGP signatures using the Electrum bitcoin wallet (https://electrum.org/#download) as an example. The guide shows you how you can be sure that the file you download was genuinely published from the Electrum software developer, Thomas Voegtlin. It requires 3 assumptions:

1. The PGP key fingerprint is correct in [a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSRoEeqYtJA&amp;t=24s) showing a presentation by a bitcoin developer (Gregory Maxwell), who is a member of the [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

2. A website for analyzing large numbers of interconnected PGP signatures (https://pgp.cs.uu.nl) is honest.

3. The GPG software package you use correctly verifies signatures you feed it.

The guide consists of 3 steps:

1. Import the public key used to sign the Electrum downloads.

2. Verify authenticity of the public key.

3. Use GPG to verify the downloaded files.

# Step 1. Import the public key used to sign the Electrum downloads

**I want to acquire the PGP key used to sign the Electrum downloads.**

I imported the PGP key linked from the [electrum.org downloage page](https://electrum.org/#download) into GnuPG (a.k.a. ""GPG"", version 2.2.1 installed as part of [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/) for macOS; Windows users use [gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/)).

I get a summary of information of this key by running the `gpg --fingerprint 0x7F9470E6` command prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS).

    pub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [SC]
          6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
    uid           [ unknown] Thomas Voegtlin (https://electrum.org) &lt;thomasv@electrum.org&gt;
    uid           [ unknown] ThomasV &lt;thomasv1@gmx.de&gt;
    uid           [ unknown] Thomas Voegtlin &lt;thomasv1@gmx.de&gt;
    sub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [E]

- From this summary I see that the key fingerprint is `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`, a 40-digit hexadecimal number.

I want to determine this key's relationship to the key of a person I trust.

**I decide to do this by determining this key's relationship to Gregory Maxwell's key.**

# Step 2. Verify authenticity of the public key

I know Gregory Maxwell's key is `DE47 BC9E 6D2D A6B0 2DC6 10B1 AC85 9362 B041 3BFA` because the fingerprint is included in [a video presentation which I am assuming is not spoofed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSRoEeqYtJA&amp;t=24s). I trust him to only sign keys of people whose identity he has checked very carefully and that those people do likewise (see [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust))

I enter both fingerprints into a ""[PGP pathfinder &amp; key statistics](https://pgp.cs.uu.nl/paths/ac859362b0413bfa/to/2bd5824b7f9470e6.html)"" website to find if they are part of the [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). I get these results:

I can see that at least 8 trust paths exist between the two PGP keys. A trust path is a chain of PGP key signatures where A certifies that B's identity is true, B certifies C'd identity is true, C certifies D's identity is true, etcetera. According to these results, 8 such paths exist between Gregory Maxwell's PGP key and a PGP key controlled by a person named `Thomas Voegtlin` who associates himself with the `electrum.org` website. Therefore, I conclude that the PGP key downloaded from the https://www.electrum.org/ website is controlled by the real Thomas Voegtlin (who recently had [a talk at the Breaking Bitcoin conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCE2OzKIab8&amp;t=5h9m48s)).

Important note: ideally you should import Gregory Maxwell's PGP key into your GPG software and then manually download all the keys whose signatures and fingerprints are attached to Maxwell's public key. If you tell your software to trust Maxwell's key (such as by using your own PGP key to sign his) then your software will provide the same information as above. The https://pgp.cs.uu.nl website simply does this data gathering busywork for you. If you want to store more than just play amounts of bitcoin, you shouldn't use https://pgp.cs.uu.nl by itself!

**You have now verified the authenticity of Thomas Voegtlin's PGP key.**

# Step 3. Use GPG to verify the downloaded files

Now that we have determined that the PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6` is Thomas Voegtlin's key, **we can verify that the files available for download at https://electrum.org/#download have been signed by Thomas**.

Download the installer of your choice and the associated `.asc` signature file into the same folder. For windows, choose the `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe` and `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe.asc` files. For macOS, choose `electrum-3.0.0.dmg` and `electrum-3.0.0.dmg.asc`.

Use GPG to verify the `.asc` file. In gpg4win (Windows users), this means right-clicking the `.asc` file and selecting `More GpgEX options` &gt; `Verify`. In GPGTools (macOS users) this means rightclicking the `.asc` file and selecting `Services` &gt; `OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File`.

In Windows, the Kleopatra app should open a dialogue stating:

    Signature created on 2017-11-01 23:36:08
    With certificate:
    6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
    The used key is not certified by you or any trusted person.

What matters here is that Kleopatra identified that the file was signed by a PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`, the same fingerprint as the one we verified was owned by the real Thomas Voegtlin. I didn't use my own PGP key to sign Thomas' key which I think Kleopatra requires to change this dialogue to say the key is certified. This fingerprint is extremely difficult to fake.

In macOS, a window should appear stating:

    electrum-3.0.0.dmg        Signed by: Thomas Voegtlin (https://electrum.org) &lt;thomasv@electrum.org&gt; (7F9470E6) - undefined trust

What matters is that GPG identified that the key was associated with the one I imported earlier (`Thomas Voegtlin`) and that had the correct fingerprint (full fingerprint visible in GPG Keychain, not in this popup, unfortunately). Again, I haven't signed Thomas' key (fingerprint ending in `7F9470E6`) with my own PGP key so the GPG software refuses to explicitly declare that the key is trusted. 

Note: if you have problems verifying a signature because your GPG software says that the signature was generated using a fingerprint completely different from what you were expecting, then it may be that a subkey was used to sign instead of the primary key. A PGP key can have a ""[subkey](https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys)"" dedicated for signing files instead of the primary key. Look for subkey fingerprints in the details of the key you imported (in Kleopatra (Windows), or GPG Keychain (macOS)). Both primary key and subkey fingerprints are 40-digit hexadecimal numbers.

**You have now verified the files downloaded from https://electrum.org have been signed by Thomas Voegtlin, the Electrum developer.** The assumptions made were:

1. The PGP key fingerprint in that Gregory Maxwell video is correct. 

2. The https://pgp.cs.uu.nl website yielded correct trust path information. 

3. Your GPG software correctly verified the signature.

# 4. Afterthoughts

In a perfect world I would attend a [key-signing party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrciSbHhpBo) attended by several developers in the bitcoin community (including Gregory Maxwell, Luke Dashjr, Thomas Voegtlin, Wladimir J. van der Laan, Peter Todd, etcetera). Then I could have high confidence in the authenticity of bitcoin software I download. For now, though, the simplest best-effort verification method I can imagine requires the primary assumption that the PGP key fingerprint in the Gregory Maxwell video I linked is the real Gregory Maxwell's real key.

This same procedure is generally applicable for verifying the signatures for other software projects such as the [Bitcoin Core wallet](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/).

Bitcoin,Bitcoin: How deflationary monetary policy is one of the keys to stop global warming,"Recently, we've been seeing a lot of news articles making claims that Bitcoin is contributing to global warming as a result of large-scale mining operations. While, yes, it is true that mining does require large amounts of electrical power, these claims are nothing but short-sightedness and premature. Instead, I think Bitcoin is probably one of the most important tools or inventions we have against global warming.

I agree that Bitcoin's current price is driven primarily by speculation. But, lets for a moment assume that Bitcoin has indeed taken stronghold of the global financial system and becomes the universal or reserve currency. Let's assume that Bitcoin is the currency of choice in all economies and for all peoples. Let's assume that Bitcoin has overtaken all fiat currencies and its purchasing power is now measured against all goods and services. Let's assume that the purchasing power of Bitcoin gradually rises year after year, near or at the rate of percentage as the USD inflates. 

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency according to its governing laws, e.g. max coin supply and rate of issuement. This means that the purchasing power of Bitcoin will gradually rise when measured against goods and services, or that the prices of goods and services will naturally continue to fall over time. In comparison, our current fiat-based systems are inflationary due to the issuing of new money; this means that the purchasing power of our money decreases while the cost of goods and services increases. Based on this knowledge, we can deduce that Bitcoin or deflationary monetary policies reward savers while inflationary monetary policies reward consumers. 

Saving money is punished in our fiat systems, it is important that we spend or invest; money must *always* be put to work otherwise it loses its value, we must be quick and swift to get rid of our money; in some ways, it is a game of hot potato. We must always work, produce and consume, *even when we don't need the product*; the GDP must *always* grow. 

On the other hand, we reward those who save in Bitcoin. Do we really *need* that new bedroom furniture set? Do we really need to own 10 pairs of shoes? Do we really *need* to have the latest cell phone? I don't think for one minute that people won't stop spending their money, instead I believe that people will be more cautious when spending money. People will continue to seek their basic necessities, their pleasures and luxuries as they normally have in the past; we will just be more calculating when we do. 

Bitcoin may be one of the greatest discoveries that helps stop global warming by putting an end to our modern culture of rampant-to-no-end consumerism, a re-wiring of our brains and psyches to think twice before mindless consumption. It is not enough to simply seek cleaner energy, I'm afraid that this is just a remedy; we must, as a people change our habits. And what better way to change our habits than through economic/market forces?

I am not an economist by trade, and my thoughts may be an oversimplification. I know it's always more complex than what I described. But I'd like to learn more, if there are any publications, please share.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"SO and I combined debt, and our future","So, basically, my girlfriend and I are both college graduates, me with a business degree in marketing, her with a bachelors in sociology, and our accumulated debt totals around 90k, which is reasonable for two people. We do look to get married at some point in the future, which obviously attaches us to each other’s debts as well as everything else, which is ok. My question is, should I be worried? She wants to go back to get a nursing degree (her passion), which I want to support entirely, but financially concerns me, as it will set back our desires to own a home, start a family, and all that good stuff, and put our combined debt well over 100k, which is disheartening. 

I have zero debt outside the 30k student loans, all of which are federal (sub and unsub), and one parent PLUS loan for $5000 that my mother has, and I will help with as much as I can. Currently, I’m making around 20k a year, but it is a dead end and shitty job that I do not plan on staying at once I find a better job within my degree. Needless to say, I am in good shape compared to many college grads my age. I am a very frugal person and have a good saving habit, because of my upbringing, so I am not concerned for myself. I am concerned for my girlfriend, who is already nearly double my debt in school, and wants to go back, albeit for a very good degree. My concern is, should I talk to her about this? Are we looking at an insurmountable amount of debt moving forward together if she does this? Am I over thinking?

Utilities add up to about $150 for my half.  Minimums on the other two cards are about $200 each.  We’ve gotten most of our excess spending reduced or eliminated, including budgeting food, gas, dog stuff etc.  I’m also able to basically take another fireman’s shift roughly once a week for $225 cash.  Also every tour so once a week its $20 for shift food, or $10 for every full day, including when i take shifts.  As of now were looking like i can pay $700 a month to the first credit card every month, not including the extra shifts that will go towards that.  

Is there anything else i can consider doing?  Sorry if i’m missing any other crucial information.  Thank you!

Edit:  BOA is $4330 with a variable rate of 20.9% (yikes). Capital one is $3570 at 23.9% variable.  Ff credit union $4466, and the rate is hard for me to find apparently because there app is sub par, but i know it is significantly lower.",finance

XRP,Bitcoin vs. Ripple and why I believe in Ripple (5 min. reading time),"My English grammar is not that good, so please forgive me for my mistakes. 

In advance I want to say that the blockchaintechnology behind the digital currencies is revolutionary. This technology will definitely leave his marks in the financial world. Compare the blockchaintechnology to the first car ever made. The first car was also revolutionary and have changed our perception on mobility since then. But also the first car had some shortcomings. It wasn’t very safe to drive, not quite comfortable and not functioning optimal. Thanks to further development cars are now indispensable in our daily living. Blockchaintechnology still has to go through this development in the nearby future.

Nowadays almost everybody refers to Bitcoin if you start talking about digital currencies. Bitcoin is very popular and well known among a lot of people. But still I don’t think the Bitcoin will have any role of importance in the future because the coin has some shortcomings. 

First of all, money needs to serve as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions between different parties. Due to high volatility of the Bitcoin this is not possible. The coin has increased strongly in value since his introduction. In a real economy this would cause a wave of postponing payments for goods and services. Simply because they are able to buy more things tomorrow for the same amount of money. This grinds the economy to a halt. 

In the second place money has to be a store of value. Allowing people to hold on what they have for later. Due to the low interest rates on your saving accounts nowadays I understand that people think that the Euro for example doesn’t meet with this main function. But look at the Bitcoin. The value of the Bitcoin is uncertain, because it’s fluctuating strongly. The Bitcoin could be worth more today than tomorrow and vice versa. This means that the Bitcoin is unreliable for storage. Now you might think: “But the value of the coin has increased enormously since 2009, so it should be a great store of value.” In my opinion it’s not. I believe the Bitcoin is a bubble. I refer to this paper https://media.algebris.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-09-21-interplanetary-bubbles-1.pdf. On page 3 you find 10 typical characteristics of a bubble. At least 7 of them I can link to the Bitcoin. Characteristic such as: ‘this time it’s different’, ‘the fear of missing out’ and ‘the sky is the limit’. Just look at the comments on this forum such as ‘to the moon’ and ‘lambomooning’. These are perfect examples that match to the characteristics written in the referred paper. Digital currencies are a hype right now. Hypes come and go, also the Bitcoinhype. 

In the third place money needs to be a unit of account. Serving as a common measure of the value of goods and services being exchanged. Again because of the high volatility this is a shortcoming of the Bitcoin. Imagine going to a bakery buying a bread for 1 BTC this week and suddenly you have to pay 5 BTC the other week. Like WTF?!

Besides these 3 shortcomings the Bitcoin has a deflationary character just like gold. One of the main reasons why there is no more Gold Standard. The only difference is that you need to mine Bitcoin’s and the gold needs to be delved. If the financial system collapsed you’re glad to have some Bitcoins or Gold, but I prefer gold since it’s tangible and is more functional as a medium of exchange. The Bitcoin is limited to a maximal amount of coins circulating. The quantity of the coin is not elastic, so the Bitcoin is not able to adapt to any form of economic growth. 

In this current state I estimate the viability of the Bitcoin very low. Perhaps in the future this might change due to further development but for now I see the Bitcoin as wronged money. This is my opinion about Bitcoin. Maybe I’m wrong on some points but this is just what I think. People are free to believe in whatever they want, so are the people that believe in Bitcoin. The future is uncertain, so time will tell what happens to the Bitcoin.  

Then there is Ripple. A company that I know since the beginning of this year. At my university we have a lectureship specialized in the optimization of business processes where I worked for a little while. As a student business economics I didn’t know that much about IT, but blockchain got my attention since then. From that moment I believed in blockchaintechnology. Take for example a look at good economic innovations. Thanks to cars and planes we’re able to travel much faster from A to B. Thanks to invention of household appliances women were able to participate on labour market in the 1950’s. 

I think Ripple is also a true innovation. A company that offers a solution for global payments between financial institutions and lies more closer to the traditional payment system compared to the Bitcoin. I believe in Ripple. Thanks to the blockchaintechnology it lowers the transaction costs, reduces inefficiencies and executes several risks. Ripple is also deflationary but has a maximal supply of 100,000,000,000 XRP. A huge difference compared to the maximal supply of the Bitcoin. Besides that there is a lot market transparency with their escrow account. I know there are more technical benefits with Ripple like stability and scalability but most of us know already know them.

Thinking about blockchain in the future I see potential for Ripple. The Ripple network functioning as a ‘bridgecurrency’ to transfer regular money from one place to another with the blockchaintechnology they created. The company is trying to solve a real problem in the world and is focusing on this problem only. This is why I believe in Ripple. The viability of Ripple is in my opinion much higher. But remember, the future is uncertain. We don’t know what will happen.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Evaluate My PI &amp; Let Me Know How I'm Doing,"I am a 27/M/single/no kids in a HCOL area. I make $82,500.00 annually on salary which will increase to ~$90k by the end of the year for a promotion I received. I save 7 percent of my salary to a Roth 401k that has no company match. I currently have $10k in it all invested in a low-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund. I have $3k in a Roth IRA which is also diversified in low-fee ETFs. 

After deductions, my net pay is ~$3800 a month. 

I have a $19k car loan. I call it the best, worst investment I'll ever make. As I need a reliable car for work, but am aware that it is a depreciating liability. It cost $485 a month with 4-percent interest. I have 3 years left on my loan. I spend $211 a month for insurance (includes renters insurance) and $100 a month on gas. It is a Honda Accord and I plan to keep it until it becomes unusable which they generally last 20+ years. It has 40k miles.

I have $21k in student loan debt. The largest chunk ($18k) is a mix of subsidized federal loans which average 4-percent interest and require $240 a month, but I just pay $250. I plan to just pay the slightly higher monthly payment and pay off higher interest debt/invest other funds rather than make additional payments. The smaller portion ($3k) is a private student loan with 8.88-percent interest. It requires $301 a month. I have one year left on it. 

I have $3k in credit from a trip I took to London and Prague with family. It is on a 18-month, zero interest credit card with a $10k limit. I have been told I am getting a bonus this year which will be ~$2k. Between that and my tax return, I should have the credit debt paid off by Feb. 2018. I plan to do a zero-fee balance transfer to my zero-interest credit card for the remaining $3k private student loan at that time and just continue the $300 monthly payment on that. obviously that'll pay off that balance with ~6 months of wiggle room before interest.

I have nine other credit cards with zero balance on them. I use them for monthly bills for liability protection and their cash rewards. I always pay them off in full each month. My credit score is 750-800. I take out two new cards a year for their perks as well as zero-interest intro periods as an option for emergencies. 

I require a phone with data for my job. I negotiated with my employer to pay a $30 stipend a month to let me just use my personal phone for work. This saved them from buying a phone and plan and obviously gives me a break on my phone bill. I pay ~$100 a month for my plan and phone payment. So ~$70 after the stipend. 

I opted to rent a room in a house with roommates which saves me a ton compared to the market I'm in and my rent is $1,100.00 a month with all utilities, internet, etc. included. 

I use public transportation to commute to work as much as possible and it comes out to ~$200 a month (round trip train daily and garage parking for my car).

I save $100 bi-weekly for an EF which is currently at $700. 

I have read through these threads and see many doing much better and many doing much worse than I am. My plan has been to get out of all my debt by 30 and invest what I currently spend on debt.

* the basic service they offer, of easily, cheaply and safely holding and transferring currency, is a service that **any human, company or institution needs and uses on a daily basis**.

* anybody on the planet who has internet can invest in it, this is not an asset that is available in a single country, you don't need a broker to buy it, as a newbie you can just go to your computer and do a google search and within 15 minutes you can become a holder of cryptocurrency. **Billions of people will participate in this market**.

personalfinance,May have been overcharged $3000 by dealer on new car. What can I do a year later?,"I bought a brand-new straight off the truck vehicle just over a year ago from a local dealer. The sticker price was around $34k. It's the first car I've ever purchased on my own, and I definitely got suckered into a lot of extraneous things (extended warranty, ""security fees"", etc.) in addition to making a pretty stupid financial decision in the first place. My payment is fairly high ($450+/month) considering I put $10k down plus I got about $1200 in rebates, and I have a long payment length (78 months). My interest rate is about 3.2%.

My SO has been saying for a while now that my payment seems abnormally high, so we sat down over the weekend and looked at my invoice. The total price for my car, including the down payment, is somewhere around $41k. Now the reason that I say that it's somewhere around there is that I have a cost breakdown and an invoice that show different prices. If that's not already shady enough, the sticker price isn't listed on either and both appear to be off by about $3000-3500. The difference is unexplained, unless you consider the interest, which I assumed I'd be paying the bank.

I'm not sure if this is just continued ignorance on my part, or if there is something shady actually going on here. Since it's been a year, is there anything that I can do? Can I ask the dealer for an audit on their invoice since the prices on their paperwork doesn't appear to match up?",finance

financialindependence,Should I lever a taxable account with a HELOC?,"I have a 4% HELOC for $100k (undrawn) and a $500k taxable account at wealthfront. 

I use the HELOC for cash flow but was wondering about using it for leverage. Since the interest rate is 4% but tax deductible (HELOC interest is tax deductible if (1) less thank $100k drawn (2) mortgage + HELOC is less than value of home). 

Therefore my after tax cost of capital is ~2% and my after tax real expected returns are ~5.8%. In the long term seems like I could net a ~3% delta (albeit with increased risk). 

I think regardless that I would limit leverage to 10% of the taxable account, so $50k. Which would mean about $1.5k in additional annual return. Not nothing, but not that great given the risk perhaps (HELOC rate is floating). I would not consider this if the interest rate on the HELOC was over 6.5%. 

A follow up question would be at what interest rate would it make sense? If it does make sense at 4% it might make sense at 2%. If it were fixed versus floating that would also make the HELOC more attractive. 

Regardless a HELOC seems a better tool for leverage (if you're gonna do it) than a securities based line of credit (SBLOC). I could access an SBLOC for around 4% interest but that would not be tax deductible and would be subject to margin calls.

personalfinance,Should I chose a student loan payment plan that requires lower payments upfront and higher payments later on so I can more easily overpay now and target my high interest loans?,"Hi.

This is my first post here. I haven't seen anywhere on the internet suggest to do this, but I was wondering if this theory makes sense.

Obviously there is a standard student loan payment plan where you pay x amount of dollars, say 300, every month over a ten year period. There are alternative plans where you pay lower amounts of money in the beginning, say 200, then it gradually escalates to 400 by the end. I believe this is called a Graduated Plan

Obviously this plan exists to help people struggling financially early on in their careers, but I was wondering if it makes sense to elect this plan, then consistently overpay every month. When you spend extra beyond your required monthly amount, you are allowed to target specific loans. I have 8 different loans, ranging in interest rates from 3.2% to 6.8%. 

If it was easier for me to pay extra on my loans every month now, I would have more money every month to allocate towards those 6.8% loans.

Does this make sense or should I just take the standard payment plan?",finance

I earn SSI at $2,400.00 p/mo. (Net) credit score 680

Current mortgage is at 5.4%, $950.00 p/mo (inc. tax/ins) 30 year fixed and we have 15 years left on the loan.  We owe $95,000.00 and the home is worth $180,000.00.

We have $20,000.00 in high interest credit card debt and $9,000.00 left on a car loan that is at 6.5%.  We'd also like to take out $10,000.00 to do much needed repairs to the 26 year old home.  (HVAC/Deck refurb/kitchen work.)  so, basically, we need $40,000.00.  

Our credit union has home loans at 3.8% available to us.  We could also do the second mortgage thing?  Call our current lender and re-fi?  Just pay the credit cards down over time and leave the loans as they are and wait to do the work on the house? (This is difficult as the payments add up to way more than a new loan payment at the lower rate would)

Interest rates seem good and it feels like the right thing to do, but I'd sure like your opinions.  I am 53, wife is 47, in great health and have retirement covered through her last job 401 k and my ssi.

personalfinance,What are my best options and the procedure to enroll in a health insurance plan,"Thank you for reading.  First off, I read [the wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) about health insurance, and I am familiar with all the terms and how health insurance is used, but the wiki doesn't help answer my questions.

I'm 26, and lost my job a couple weeks ago where I was given a PPO through my employer.  The PPO is valid through the end of the month, but I will be uninsured in December.  

I've never shopped for health insurance before, as I was previously always covered through either my parent or my employer.  What would be the cheapest option and how would I go about obtaining health insurance?  My biggest concern is having the uninsured penalty ($695) deducted from my next year's tax return.  I also heard something about the ""enrollment window"" for Obamacare ending sometime in December, but I'll admit, I'm completely ignorant about the entire process and how to go about enrolling.  

I heard that you have to be uninsured for more than two months out of the year to be penalized.  If that's true, I would neglect December and just sign up for health insurance so that I will be covered for 2018 starting January.  My adjusted gross income last time I filed taxes was around $17k, which falls between the range of 1x-4x the federal poverty line, which I heard qualifies me for some sort of Obamabucks, but again I have no idea what kind of benefits I could get or how to get them.  I live in Texas which did not expand Medicaid for the ACA.  I am a single male with no dependents or life-threatening conditions.

So to summarize my questions are:

Will I be penalized in 2018 for not having health insurance in December of 2017?

Based on my reported income, what are the cheapest options to receive health insurance for 2018 that would qualify under the ACA so I will not be hit with the $695 penalty in 2019?

How do I go about enrolling and getting Obamabucks (marketplace coupons or vouchers or whatever they're called)?

From my understanding because of my wage my income was getting taxed the appropriate amount, but each of these jobs did not last the entire year and I did not financially earn enough, I should recieve the money I was witheld from taxes back.  I have found past past and filled out the IRS withholding calculator and other such forms, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to physically file past tax returns.  I have a lot of great information for the 2017 tax year because of this sub and am confident about filing this upcoming tax returns. The others, 15 and 16....not so much. Do I need to wait until mid January to file 15 and 16 with 17? 

I hope I give all the relevant information and if I am missing any please let me know:

personalfinance,Fed up with living at home but not interested in staying in this city long-term.,"I'm 25M and I still live at home.

Although I’ve saved up enough money for about three year’s worth of expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc.), I haven’t moved out after college due to being in a Catch 22 situation: I want to move out (but I’m not planning on staying in this city…and if I’m not planning on staying, why rent an apartment?). I want to live in a bigger city (i.e. San Francisco or Los Angeles, both of which I’ve visited and loved) with more variety of industries to work in and people to meet/network with. There are other places I’m considering to move to as well but I do want to make clear that I am aware of the cost of living in those kinds of cities.

I’ve considered buying a home here, living in it until I move, and renting it/selling it upon moving (within the next year or two).

What would you recommend that I do? (Or what are some things that I should consider that wasn’t already mentioned above?) 

Other note:
In the past 12 months, I’ve been let go from two jobs. For a little over 3 months now, I’ve been at an employer that is treating me well…much better than any other employer I’ve ever had. I’m happy with just about everything except the pay. Upon hiring, they told me that they are hiring me with the expectation that I stay a minimum of five years due to the amount of training and time that it takes to develop new staff (with them being a small local company, even one person leaving dramatically impacts their planning/workload).

Of course, I told them that my intention was to stay five years (this was true at the time) but that’s no longer the case. I don’t have any jobs or interviews lined up for jobs in other cities and I would feel extremely guilty about leaving. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",finance
personalfinance,I instantly went from college budget to wealthy budget. Now what? What should I know NOW and not later?,"I went from $20k/year poor indie developer to ... a lot. It's quite the transition, and it's very overwhelming (but in a positive way, of course).

Here's what I've done so far:

1. Upgrade my bank account to the premium version for better services. I also gave them a heads up there may be money coming/going more often than usual.

2. Set my financial questionnaires to the correct amount so credit card offers will be way better (my credit is 'average', this could be a chance to grow it. I'd like to raise my limits and keep it sitting at 15%).

3. Hinted above, I'm paying off all my credit cards to 15%, then paying minimum per month to keep it there (minimum is best @ 15%? Still need to read more about this). I'm told to apply for a limit on each card every 6 months. I have 3 credit cards with embarrassingly low limits.

4. **Welp, now what?** I want to ensure this money lasts forever, so what do you recommend? Saving within a bank at like 0.1% interest rate looks awful - surely there are better ways? Should I start taking some classes about stocks? I heard for realty I should wait until the market is low, and now isn't a good time, people say. What else?

investing,Very aggressive portfolio,"Hi all, 

I have been thinking about a potential portfolio allocation for a few days, perhaps you all can poke holes in it.  

This portfolio would be very aggressive, but also would respect modern portfolio theory.  Basically I am thinking of something that would either be 25% TQQQ 25% SSO 25% SWPPX 25% cash.  Or, 20 20 20 40.


In other words, I would have .25 x 3 = .75 plus .25 x 2 = .50 plus .25 x 1 = .25 for a total of 150% exposure having used 75% of my funds.  Of course, this is oversimplified, but you get my idea of being exposed while retaining cash.

As I see it, the current low volatility environment is a great opportunity for these leveraged ETFs.  May as well take advantage of low interest rates while we have them, right?  Of course, I understand that they bring great risk.  This is why I would certainly allocate a significant portion of cash in order to rebalance should a correction or worse happen.   

The goal of this portfolio would be to retire early, and I am young, so if it does not go as planned and I lose a fair bit of my portfolio it wouldn't be the end of the world.  Because of my youth, it seems that the reward is greater than the risk.

I at first considered 70-80% TQQQ,  30-20% LEAP puts with 2 year time frame, reallocating money after every 1 or 2 years.  After thinking about this more, I do not like the put idea, basically because of the scenarios where the market runs up, putting my puts far out of the money, then sinks quickly, sinking my leveraged ETFs, while still not doing much for my OTM puts.  I've thought about rolling shorter term puts, but I haven't dived into the math of allocating 30-20-etc percent of a portfolio to rolling puts. 

Clearly, I want to expose myself heavily to the upside while protecting myself from a significant downturn.  If that happened, I'd like to be able to reallocate, as mentioned earlier.  

I'm interested to discuss flaws in this strategy, as well as the best ways to pursue it.  Have you all thought about this? What iterations of this strategy have interested the investing public of r/investing?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Why ""asic resistance"" is a stupid idea","Im seeing a small army of redditors pumping asic resistant coins lately, claiming that makes it more decentralised. Time to dispel that myth.

First of all, being asic resistent is pretty much impossible. Whatever algorithm can be executed on a GPU, can be executed more efficiently on a chip designed for that specific purpose.  An easy way to demonstrate that, is just imagining that AMD or nVidia would produce a crypto version of their gaming cards, remove everything we dont need, like geometry engines, texture units, HDMI etc and optimize the parts that we do need. Presto, you have an ""asic"" that will mine any coin, and be more efficient than any gaming GPU. 

Another approach can be to design one or several asics that specialize in parts of the hashing algorithm and work in tandem with GPU's. But when the development cost are warranted by the value of the token and its mining revenue, someone will eventually do a dedicated chip that does it all. Yes, it would be expensive, but if you think your favorite asic resistent coin is ever going to compete with Bitcoin, we're talking of a market thats worth ten of billions of dollars. Someone will do it. And that someone is likely to become a monopolistic supplier or miner.

But lets assume you can prevent asics from ever being developed. Then you have even bigger problems. The first one is botnets. If ordinary PC and common GPU's can profitably mine an algorithm, then a botnet operator can outcompete everyone else, because he doesnt have to pay a cent for electricity or hardware. Bitcoin actually had this problem before FPGAs and Asics arrived, a very significant portion of the hashrate was controlled by botnets that controlled 10s of 1000s of PCs. So instead of having a few large mining operations that dedicate their business to crypto, you get a few large criminal operators controlling your hashrate. Not helpful.

A second problem is even worse: the 51% attack. If your coin relies on an algorithm that can be mined by any CPU/GPU, and your coin has a less than dominant position in the market, that means out there are mining pools that can easily mount a 51% attack on your coin. Again, we've seen this before. When bitcoin was still mined on GPU's, alt coins have been attacked by (rogue) bitcoin pools who had a hashrate that completely dwarfed the hashrate of the new altcoins. Some did it for fun, some did it for profit, but these alt coins where never secure.

Lastly; the higher the hashrate, the more secure your blockchain. If ASICs provide a higher efficiency or a higher hashrate, you should embrace it, not avoid it.  

TL;DR Asic resistance is self defeating, makes your blockchain less secure, less decentralised, and far more prone to attacks by botnets, rogue mining pools and even secret asic monopolies. Its a STUPID idea.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Public Education and PSLF,"Hello,

I’m looking for some insight on my current situation with student loans. I am currently a public school teacher in Illinois. I graduated in May with around 41k in federal loans (serviced by GreatLakes). I was currently in grace up until this month, and my first actual payment is due on the 1st of December.

During my grace period I was in the standard repayment plan, 10 years and around $430 per month. I recently changed this plan to the Graduated Plan and my payment goes up every two years (it is currently $280/month).

My annual income is right at 37k per year, but the post tax/pension/insurance income is actually around 23k. I noticed that to be eligible for the PSLF program you have to be in an income driven repayment plan. I had a few questions about this.

Since I just switched to the graduated plan, I cannot change my repayment plan for another six months. Is my best option to switch to an income driven plan immediately once it becomes an option? What would my payments look like?

Once I am enrolled in the PSLF program, do I just continue to make the monthly minimum for 120 months? After ten years the entirety of the debt is forgiven?

Illinois has a assistance program for teachers who teach in low income schools (currently I am in one). The assistance is 5k off the loan after five consecutive years in a low income school. Would I be eligible for this under PSLF?

Thanks in advance for the responses. I want to make sure I utilize the most efficient means of paying back these loans.

ethereum,Single point of failure: Vitalik,"I’d like to start a conversation about how dependent is Ethereum on Vitalik (u/vbuterin). Those who’ve been around for a while know that Ethereum is much more than him. The EF is staffed with great developers, and VB doesn’t actually do any production development. He works on research, mainly re hybrid Casper and scalability. Also Ethereum ecosystem is very rich and expanding everyday, with individuals, new projects &amp; companies.

Yet, there is an ideological &amp; agenda-setting dependency on Vitalik, and public perception focuses extremely on his person, increased by the fact that he’s really active with many projects, lots of traveling and projects (a good thing overall!). If for whatever reason Vitalik would suddenly stop or reduce his involvement in Ethereum, I think it’s safe to expect a temporary stalling in progress (due to confusion and lack of direction) and a sharp fall in value of the network - in market terms (ETH price), effective use and public perception.

This is for me the single point of failure of Ethereum. Decentralization means that points of failure are reduced by reducing centers of authority/influence and its distribution through the network + reduction of barriers to access. BTC solved this problem long time ago: disappearance of Satoshi. We cannot and we don’t desire the same for Vitalik, therefore we’d need actions to reduce his influence and for redistribution of his power, without affecting the extremely high value he provides to Ethereum.

Now my question. Should I pay down all the personal loans or should I pay down all the credit card debt and one personal loan?

Which would look better for the purposes of buying a house?

EDIT UPDATE!!

This was the answer I got from the /r/RealEstate subreddit by /u/Downvotes-all-memes

Installment loans are generally viewed more positively than carrying consumer debt. Think of it like this: making on time payments to an installment loan means you are using debt, making money for the bank, and following the rules. Carrying consumer, revolving debt with a credit card is also making money for the bank, but it shows that you may not be able to afford to pay it off (because who in their right mind would pay interest if they can afford not to?). And because they don't know what your payment may or may not be next month, you're kind of a wild card on their books.
TL;DR: Pay off the credit card for sure, and then see if your DTI is low enough. If it's not, pay off the smaller personal loan, if it is low enough, keep the extra cash on hand or put it all towards whatever loan has the higher interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,"Paying everything into student loans and consumer debt, won't be clear until I'm in my late 40s. How the hell do I save for a family/house/retirement?","I'm 31, just finished 4 straight years of schooling (BS+MS in business/tech) with 162k in debt (15k consumer debt, the rest in student loans). Living in high-COL area (Seattle), living with a roommate, living as cheaply as if I was an undergrad, and making 75k gross.

I'm putting a $600 monthly into my 401k, $1600 into my debt, saving a few hundred a month to start an emergency fund, and the rest goes into monthly expenses. Accounting for minimum payments and prioritizing by interest rates, consumer debt will be paid off in 4 years, and...I have no idea about student loans, but at least 10 (haven't done the calculations to account for the extra payments after consumer debt is paid off).

I have no idea how the hell I'm supposed to get married/start a family/buy a house/catch up on retirement during my 30s. Additionally, my original plan/dream goal was to start a job in federal government by 35 (age cutoff), but it doesn't seem like I'll be able to do so as I can't afford the paycut.

I know this isn't even one of the worse situations to be in, but I feel pretty isolated, crappy, and like a big failure as I see my college friends, who are about a decade my junior, start their careers and party it up without the same 162k of debt I have. I'm already making beyond what I should be in my position, and my net will remain roughly the same next year (5% annual bump but mostly negated by my employer's reduction in coverage for medical).

personalfinance,Refinance and rent out or sell on contract for deed or list the property with a realtor in a saturated market? (North Dakota),"Somewhat cross posted in r/realestate 

A bit of backstory...we moved about 15 months ago into a rental which we pay next to nothing for as my parents own it. My husband owns the home we used to live in and it has been on the market FSBO for about 3 months. He bought the home using a first time homebuyers loan from NDHFA. There hasn’t been much interest from anyone wanting to buy outright other than someone who wouldn’t be able to buy until early next summer. We have been paying for two houses for over a year now and our savings is depleted. We can’t keep this up much longer. 

The market here is pretty saturated right now with homes for sale but when we offered contract for deed or even to rent it out we got a lot of people interested and ready to buy. I just found out that when my husband bought the house he may have signed an affidavit saying that home would be his primary residence and it would not be rented out or sold contract for deed. So now our options are to either refinance (most likely at a lower interest rate) and rent it out or sell it on contract or list it with a realtor. 

I know contract for deed can be very risky. My parents have sold multiple homes that way and my mother is an ex realtor so the contract would be very thorough. If we refinance it we could possibly take out a bit more than we owe and pay off some of our high interest credit card debt as well as decrease the interest rate. We have somewhere around $7k in credit card debt at ~24% interest a lot of which as been racked up in the last year. We have done work on the house so we should have enough equity to get well over $7k if we refinance. Our current interest rate on the mortgage is 4.65% and from what I have seen interest rates are lower now. We would only have the home at an absolute max of 7-8 more years so would an ARM be better in this situation? 

We would have to pay closing costs to refinance though? unless there is another way to do this that we aren’t thinking of. Could we get a business loan or something and use the home as an investment? 

If we list it with a realtor we end up paying commission with no guarantee it is going to sell. I don’t think we can keep paying for the mortgage and utilities of the old house as well as rent and utilities in the current house for much longer. Like I said the market is pretty saturated right now and I’m worried that in the end we are going to have to end up refinancing and renting it out or something anyway. 

What is my best solution here?? I am stressed to the max and don’t know what to do. Rent or the contract for deed would rid us of the utility payments and mortgage plus some. Contract for deed would also mean we wouldn’t be paying for any possible repairs, homeowners insurance, or property taxes.",finance

personalfinance,Best way to handle new car payment?,"Good morning. :)
(I am 20 years old, decent credit, stable job, live with my parents.)

I recently aided my girlfriend in her purchase of a more reliable car. She budgeted in the monthly payments and insurance, but she didn't have the credit score or a down payment to help her get a reliable car from a reputable business. I signed the loan, allowing her to co-sign, and fronted the down-payment for her. I know she's good for paying me back, I'm not worried about that.

The loan is for a 2011 Ford Focus SEL, 84k miles, good condition. $8000 - $850 down payment gives me: $7150 at 12.5% interest rate, $160/mo at 60mo.

I already confirmed that if I pay early it goes to the principal first and not pre-calculated interest, so I can save a fair amount of money by paying it off early. I have the cash to pay it off now, but only barely with roughly $5500 in savings and $1500 in checkings. I'm currently earning about ~$2800 after tax with an average of ~$500 in expenses (food/gas) and another ~$500 in miscellaneous bullshit I buy that I don't really need.. I have ~$1800 automatically sent to my savings account each month ($900 each paycheck) that I try not to touch. I also recently maxed my Roth IRA but I REALLY don't want to touch that.

I was told I should keep the loan for at least 12 months in order to show auto-loan history. I still need money for Christmas and my personal vehicle may not last too much longer, so I don't want to completely wipe out my savings on paying this off early. Ultimately it is my girlfriend's car and not mine, so while I want to help her out as much as I can I know it's not my responsibility to pay off this car. (I mean it is because I signed it.. but still.)

Is it best to just let her pay it off every month, for me to pay it off in full if possible and let her pay me, or maybe make a larger initial payment in order to lessen how much interest I will be charged? Thinking about it now it may have been better to put a larger down-payment down at first, but it was a last-minute deal and this way I can potentially have low payments for 60 months if needed. Reflecting on all this, with such a high interest rate it would be in my best interest to pay it off as quickly as possible while maintaining an emergency fund. I'm just concerned that if I don't have a monthly payment I won't collect the money from my girlfriend due to my own incessant need to please and help others.

Honestly typing this out and organizing my thoughts was probably just as helpful as anything, but I still would like to hear what others think.

Please ask any questions if needed, I get very scatter-brained at times. I'm just looking for outside opinions on what is the best option for me right now. Thanks :)",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Forgiveness Tax while Working Abroad?,"Wondering if anyone has some insight on how working/living abroad when loans are forgiven after income-driven repayment plans affects the looming tax bill?

I graduated this past May. My plan was to utilize PSLF while working at a non-profit in the states. However, I have received a generous scholarship to get my Master's and PhD abroad, with stipend. The stipend is meager but I would be able to work part time on the side with the student visa. All tuition would be waived. I will take this opportunity because A) free education in my field, B) my personal research will be funded, and C) the chance to live abroad while I am young. I want to be smart about this financially with the student loan debt I have accrued.

I have 40k in federal student loan debt with an undergrad degree in a very competitive Humanities field. 

Now, the timeline for this scholarship could stretch up to eight years if I decide to pursue a PhD. It may look like this:

1.5-2 years as researcher
2 years Masters
3-4 years PhD

Eight years from now, I could be working abroad or return/have returned to the US to work in my field. International Education career opportunities would open up as well.

I understand that I would need ten years of qualifying payments for PSLF (if it is still around, fingers crossed).

IF I were to develop a career abroad from this and be working abroad once I am done an income-based repayment plan, would the only taxable income for my year of loan forgiveness be the remaining loan balance?

I work for a law firm and get not so great pay, but soon I will be getting hopefully around $2,500 per month in bonus pay based on deals I'll be working, but I haven't included that above as I haven't started getting them yet and some months will be lower and some will be higher. I am also a student with around 20k in debt so far and am about halfway through my Bachelor's, so it'll be another 2-3 years before I have to start paying on those.

I am very financially illiterate I'm finding. I have this narrow view of money where I see money coming in and going out and we have X dollars to get us to payday. I budget in a note on my phone where I have all of our expenses and basically take a calculator to our bank balance every couple of days to keep track of money coming and going. 

I feel so silly even typing this. I have a 3 year old son and I can't figure out how to work my own money.

personalfinance,Questions on how to be more intelligent and proactive with my money.,"Hello,

I'm a 28 year-old male who recently secured his first post-college full-time job. I've always been pretty financially responsible as I don't like owing people/companies money, but I feel like I need to be better educated on how to be smarter with the money I'm making now to help secure a more stable future. 

I'm almost completely oblivious to the world of stocks and investments because I don't have affiliations with anyone who participates in this realm. I've seen posts here and there about getting started on sites like Robinhood and Stash Invest, but I'd really like some more personalized advice from experienced investors or wealth management veterans as far as what steps I should take given my current financial situation. Investments, Roth/Traditional IRA's, etc? It's all outside my world of familiarity, but I'm ready and willing to learn as much as I can. 

Here's a summary of my current financial status:

Status:
28, Male, Single, Claim 0 on W4 Withholding 

Pre-Tax Salary: 
- $40k annually, but rounds out to about $52k when adjusted for overtime hours worked

Current Income:
- Checking: $5k+
- Savings: $4.9k (10% added from each bi-weekly check, post-tax)
- 401k: $875 balance (5% from each check + 2.5% employer match)

AVG Monthly Income vs expenses:
- Estimated Income: $3,195
- Estimated Expenses: $1,662
- Money Remaining/month: $1,533

Debt:
- Credit Cards: $0
- Student Loans: $19.8k (spread out across 5 loans with an average interest rate of 3.94%. Hi=4.41% / Lo=3.61%)

I believe that's all of the essentials. Like I said, I'm really just wanting to know what someone more experienced than myself would be doing given my current situation. Pay off the student loans? Begin to dip into the stock market? Set more $ aside in IRAs or savings? It's all just been very overwhelming and I'm not sure exactly how to proceed. My current plan has just been a combination of saving/attacking student loans as that $19.8k balance was $30.5k as recently as March of this year. Any help from you fine folks would be greatly appreciated.",finance
Bitcoin,Why I Sold My Bitcoin,"**Disclaimers:**

I think it's important to share a contrarian view here, given the hype and euphoria over the last few days. I think I also have a some-what unique perspective on cryptos. Educated as an economist, I've spent a career in the technology departments of large banks. I've also taken the licensing exams to open my own investment manager, though I haven't launched one yet. I held some bitcoin as a speculation, but have exited on this rally because the mania is getting out of hand - even for a believer in the technology with high risk tolerances.

I'm not trying to be a downer or spread FUD - just provide a sobering reality check based on my understanding of investing and market structure. After all, it is extremely easy to lose sight of reality when you're sitting on fat paper profits. That type of complacency is an integral part of market cycles and one of the core weaknesses that professional traders exploit.

I do believe bitcoin is both something of tremendous value, and a bubble. History shows that bubbles form as society digests new forms of value - it happened as humans minted their first coins, their first paper currency, their first stocks and bonds, etc. Every new innovation in financial instruments is typically accompanied by some sort of bubble - the 2008 innovations in mortgage securities should be fresh and memorable for most.

The size and scale of the bitcoin bubble's inflation speaks about the underlying technology. It will, no doubt, be transformative across society - in many ways we cannot foresee now. However, that doesn't mean it has unlimited value, and ""it'll go to the moon!"" Or that it's even an investment. In fact, the hallmark of a bubble when people buy for fear of missing out on a price, without connecting that price to underlying economic activity. That's exactly what's happening here.

**Why Bitcoin is NOT an Investment, and that's Okay**

First, let's talk about what an investment is. By definition, an investment is an asset that yields a return above its purchase price.

If you invest in bonds or equities, you're usually looking at some kind of discounted cash-flow to decide whether to invest or not. Either your bond will pay a coupon of $X per year, or your company will generate $X amount of cash annually - and you project these values over time. Then you compare that to the return on less risky assets, like the US 10 year Treasury, and decide if the return is worth the risk.

But bitcoin doesn't yield anything. No matter what industries it disrupts or entrenched powers it destroys, it will never yield anything. If you own 1 BTC today, it's still 1 BTC in the future without any dividends, coupons, or splits. By definition, it cannot be an investment - there's no return. Non-yielding assets can never be an investment.

This is why bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Crypto for the source of authority (proof-of-work or proof-of-stake), but currency for the asset's behavior. You don't invest in a currency, you can only speculate in it. You can buy a currency in order to buy investments denominated in that currency (eg. trading dollars for yen to buy Japanese Government Bonds), but the currency itself is never an investment.

Now, it's perfectly okay to buy another currency in expectation that it's price (against your 'native' currency) will rise. But that's just a trade, and one fueled by speculation. And some speculation is okay, it helps grease financial markets and discover 'real' prices. It's just important not to fool yourself, and to realize what you are doing. This also means no HODLing - every transaction has a lifecycle that ends in liquidation.

Some professionals make a living doing this, but typically they're not just speculating - they're helping institutions and companies intermediate between their 'native' currency and wherever they do business.

Are you Toyota selling a car in the US, trying to bring your dollars home as yen? A currency trader can help you. It's probably also probably worth noting here the recent settlements between the world's biggest banks and their regulators for openly fixing currency markets. The professionals tend to stay in business with a healthy dose of fraud and trading against their clients.

This is not behavior to emulate, and should give pause to anyone speculating in cryptocurrency. Who do you think you're trading against when you buy bitcoin from an exchange? There's a concept that everyone trading needs to know - the 'greater fool trade.' Are you buying because you have reasonable ideas about what the asset will return, or because there's a greater fool who will pay you more for it?

From what I've seen, and the yield on bitcoin, it seems like most people are betting there are greater fools out there.

**'Hard Money' and Metcalfe's Law**

These are common arguments I've seen posted here. A lot of people don't trust the Federal Reserve, or think of bitcoin as some technology that can be priced according to a model that describes the adoption of ethernet. Neither make a ton of sense in the light of day.

The bitcoin mining curve is modeled after gold, the original 'hard money'. By design, it's supposed to be deflationary. I'll admit I've never gotten along well with gold bugs and usually don't persuade them, but I'm happy to trade against them.

There's hundreds of year of economic history demonstrating that deflationary currencies are bad for economic growth. Where deflationary currencies have existed, they've been out-competed by mildly inflationary currencies. This is why they don't exist anymore, except for brief periods of severe economic stress. The idea that real economic activity can occur with a deflationary bitcoin is contrary to both experience and theory, which shows that 'real' economic activity slows as people anticipate further gains in currency value. The incentive is to hoard instead of spending or lending, so they don't, and economic activity falls.

Likewise, gold has been a bad inflation hedge, and there's no reason to expect bitcoin to do better. The last hundred years of data shows that even in inflationary periods, stocks have performed better than gold (inflation adjusted, anyone who bought gold at it's local maxima in 1980 at $650/oz would still be underwater at 2011's global maxima at $1,900/oz). And needless to say, stocks have yielded many-fold the return over gold in that time period by dividends alone.

If you're holding bitcoin because you don't trust the dollar or are worried about inflation, you should ask yourself why you don't also hold gold. It's the same logic. Then you should ask yourself why you would hold either.

As for Metcalfe's Law, this is a bit of a red herring. The idea is simple - networking effects produce exponentially more value as more people join the network. Champions of this idea point to fax machines, the internet, and Facebook - and publish interesting graphs showing the price of bitcoin neatly following Metcalfe's curve.

But we need to remember what we're examining - users of the network. If I register a Coinbase account to speculate on bitcoin, am I really using the bitcoin network? Is bitcoin's value proposition becoming more valuable intrinsically? Or is the price just increasing, because of the money flowing into it?

Twitter provides a good example. It's dominated by bots who are 'on the network', but provide marginal value and don't conform to Metcalfe's Law. It's taken a few years, but the price (what you pay) has caught up to the value (what it's worth), as the market has digested that many nodes in the network don't really count.

If the value proposition of bitcoin is in trustless transactions, how many of it's exponentially growing users are actually using bitcoin to perform trustless transactions? Transaction volumes are relatively flat year-on-year, while the number of new wallets have skyrocketed -  so let's not fool ourselves about Metcalfe's Law. Correlation does not mean causation, and the network is not becoming more intrinsically valuable because more people are trying to speculate on bitcoin's price.

There IS some real growth here from adoption in jurisdictions where cryptos have been recognized as legal tender, but we can't fool ourselves  about the impact there. Again, bitcoin is deflationary, and the incentives are hold instead of spend. If recognition and accessibility were really driving adoption, transaction volumes shouldn't be flat year-on-year.

**But What About the MASSIVE DISRUPTION?**

This is where bitcoin shines - it has tremendous disruptive potential. It allows counterparties to interact without trust or central authority, which removes the role for banks, money transfer agents, and other folks who would usually clip some part of a transaction. Open, distributed blockchains will revolutionize many industries and social institutions.

However, this doesn't go too far in helping bitcoin's value. An asset's value depends on the rights it bestows to the owner - just like above, where we could value a stock or bond by the rights to the cashflow it grants. But what does bitcoin grant the owner?

We come up short. Bitcoin is a token representing a proof-of-work for authenticating transactions on the network. All it grants to the owner is a high mathematical likelihood that the token is not fraudulent or double-spent. So what's that worth?

Depends on who you're transacting with. When we pay in dollars, there are systems in the background looking for fraud. These costs get spread across society in the fees we pay for credit cards (both in our interest charges, and the fees charged to merchants for accepting cards). If we don't need a card issuer and bank to back the transaction and guarantee that it's legitimate, there is substantial value that can be recaptured.

Likewise, bitcoin's portability can be a source of value. If you can send bitcoin across borders, there's no need for money transfer agents to send remittances. There's no need to be scammed by a cabal of currency traders. This is all value that can be recaptured as old, expensive institutions become irrelevant.

However - is that value recaptured by the owner of the bitcoin? Or is it captured by the nodes on the network authenticating the transaction?

Bitcoin would substantially reduce the fee for sending money, but the actual fee would go to the miners - not the holder of bitcoin tokens. Holders of bitcoin would see no direct benefit.

Now - it's reasonable to think, ""if bitcoin replaces those institutions, that's trillions of dollars that will have to flow into bitcoin, and the price will skyrocket!"". And there's some truth to that. Based on money flow and bitcoin's illiquidity, it will have to rise. But it's not realistic that things will happen that way, as it embeds some bad assumptions:

* Bitcoin will soon replace banks and money transfer agents

* No other technology will compete with bitcoin (whether another open blockchain, or a closed one operated by the existing banks)

* The face-value of all the money handled by banks will flow into bitcoin

The first two points are fairly straightforward. Even if bitcoin replaces existing institutions, it's important to consider how and when - and whether the market price for bitcoin today is being too optimistic and forward-looking. Likewise, bitcoin is not the only game in town, and other cryptos already have value propositions that can out-compete in certain niches. All the big banks are already working on their own blockchains, which aren't as revolutionary as bitcoin, but will likely be easier for mass consumer adoption.

The last bullet point is the real rub. Bitcoin is deflationary, and a main purpose of banks is to create leverage throughout the monetary system. $1 deposited in a bank can become $5 throughout the whole system, and extended further with clever credit structures and derivatives. Because bitcoin is deflationary, that kind of leverage (and face amount of fiat) cannot be lifted-and-shifted into bitcoin. No one would lend, except at interest rates high enough to contract the money supply. Several trillion dollars in the banking system today would shrink by orders of magnitude in a bitcoin economy. The initial inflows would create a spike in the dollar value of bitcoin, but economic activity would grind to a halt shortly after.

This is why the really smart folks like Andreas Antonopolous comment far more on what the technology can do than what the token is worth. It's why he's testified to the Canadian Senate that we will see many different 'monetary recipes' across different cryptos, and the future is wide open for any mix of them to dominate. It's why he talks about the bitcoin protocol as a base layer, which may be abstracted from any future end-use and doesn't speculate on the price.

If you're sitting on a big profit, maybe it's time to re-examine exactly why you think there's substantial value ahead. And if you're buying in at these levels, you should be asking yourself why it's worth paying ~$10k. As prices go up, the risks get bigger - not smaller. The rate of advance means there are a lot of people who have bought in the last three months, and could quickly leave if they see a big profit turn to a loss. Anytime a market moves like this is a time for greater caution, not greater greed.

** TL/DR  ** 
There's a lot of enthusiasm, backed by naive and childish arguments, saying that bitcoin should keep advancing at a rapid clip. But there are still serious impediments, and even success of bitcoin (the technology) doesn't mean the tokens are worth anywhere near where they trade today. Everyone should be taking this rally as an opportunity to reality check their assumptions, and figure out if they're long because they're bullish - or if they're bullish because they're long. You can still love bitcoin without the hype.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Waiting to pay student loans - there are other, smart options","I know the headline to this post may be inflammatory to many of you, but I had posted on here before (under a different screen name that was too easily doxed) and was downvoted to oblivion.  So I want to share my experience just from the last year.

I have ~$165k in student loan debt, and took advantage of an IBR payment schedule, making the minimum payment amounts, and investing the remainder to both an emergency fund and investments.  I know - THE HORROR!  As I'm sure most of you will be interested to hear if you've read this far, in the aggregate my interest rate on the 5 loans is ~6-6.5%.

So the downvotes came when I advised others that this was a viable option instead of paying off your student loans immediately.  I came across ~$116k through the passing of a relative (very sad, very fortunate, and I would trade it all away for more time with the loved one).  Instead of making a large dent in the student loans (which were at $165k then as well - I've essentially been paying interest), I created a Vanguard managed account.

Over the last YTD, ending 10/31/2017, my student loans have remained at $165k, and I've paid slightly over $10k in interest.  In that same time, my investments have grown by 21% (yes, I know that is not sustainable).  I have investment returns of $27.7k, with additional contributions of $24k.

What does this mean?  If I would have paid the entire $120k toward my student loans, plus the $24k I put in investments, I would still have $21k left in student loans.  

Instead, I have a solid emergency fund, the ability to pay off my student loans completely, am not stressed out about if something unfortunate were to happen (accident, medical emergency, job loss), and still have the protections available under the student loan program (forbearance, lowered payments upon hardship, forgiveness if the loans remain for another 15 years - I doubt they will as eventually I hope to earn out of the IBR programs).

So here's a real life example of where paying off my student loans would have been a loss of $27.7k, loss of financial freedom with remaining debt and no security blanket, and a loss in the ability to use program protections in the event of a financial emergency.

YMMV, but carrying student loan debt is not always a bad thing.  For me, I made more than $20k from NOT paying off my loans.

Edit: And go figure, this post demonstrating a sound financial strategy (not right for everyone) is being 50% downvoted, despite results over at least a year and other benefits I have realized as a result.  Apparently, most people in this subreddit only believe in one strategy, which would have exposed me to no emergency funds in the event of a personal catastrophe.  Here? I have sufficient emergency funds in case of a disaster and the protections of a federal program as well.

Edit: We're at 43% upvote, because this subreddit only supports paying off debts immediately, regardless of benefits otherwise.",finance

personalfinance,"Recently came into some money, need some advice on college savings plans","Hey all, using a throwaway here for (fairly?) obvious reasons.

I recently came into a fair chunk of money due to the company I work for being acquired and thus my equity vesting. The total after taxes was a little over $120,000. My wife and I have two kids (aged 4 and 2), and we’re doing fairly well financially — no real debt aside our mortgage, emergency savings account is six months total expenses, she’s got a pension for when she retires and I’ve got a 401k I’ve been adding to fairly aggressively. 

One regard where we haven’t done a great job is our kids’ college savings. Setting up a 529 has been on the to-do list for a very long time, and I was planning to use this relative windfall to shore things up for them. Once I did the research, though, I started feeling a little apprehensive. 

I wanted to fund the accounts with enough seed money to make good for lost time — let’s call it about $10,000 for the four-year-old and $8,000 for the two-year-old. After the accounts are created, we can afford to deposit an additional $200 per pay period into the both accounts, totaling $400. 

But, long and the short of it, $18,000 is a lot of money. And while I know there are a bunch of state/federal tax benefits for creating 529s (I can use deductions on our state income taxes, and the earnings from the account are not subject to federal taxes), there are steep penalties for withdrawing funds for anything other than higher education. My kids are still super young, and I just feel this is a lot of money to have to be penalized a 10 percent federal tax on withdrawing if they decide not to go to college. 

Am I not better off just investing the money in some kind of robo-advisor account like Vanguard, so that the funds are more flexible? Or am I not thinking about this properly? 

Thanks for any advice in advance.",finance

Bitcoin,The Great Bitcoin Bull Market Of 2017 by Trace Mayer,"By: [Trace Mayer](https://twitter.com/TraceMayer), host of [The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast](http://www.bitcoin.kn/).

Originally posted [here](http://www.runtogold.com/the-great-bitcoin-bull-market-of-2017/) with images and Youtube videos.

I just got back from a two week vacation without Internet as I was scouring some archeological ruins. I hardly thought about Bitcoin at all because there were so many other interesting things and it would be there when I got back.

[Jimmy Song suggested I do an article](https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/934806513335635975) on the current state of Bitcoin. A great suggestion but he is really smart (he worked on [Armory](https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/) after all!) so I better be thorough and accurate!

Therefore, this article will be pretty lengthy and meticulous.

**BACKGROUND**

As I completely expected, the 2X movement from the [New York Agreement](https://bravenewcoin.com/news/segwit2x-the-new-york-agreement/) that was supposed to happen during the middle of my vacation flopped on its face because Jeff Garzik was driving the clown car with passengers willfully inside like Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitgo and Xapo and there were [here](https://www.bitcoinmarketinsider.com/segwit2x-hard-fork-failed-to-activate/) massive bug**S** and [in the code](https://bitcointechtalk.com/segwit2x-bugs-explained-8e0c286124bc) and miners like Bitmain did not want to allocate $150-350m to get it over the difficulty adjustments.

I am very disappointed in their lack of integrity with putting their money where their mouths are; myself and many others wanted to sell a lot of B2X for BTC!

On 7 December 2015, with Bitcoin trading at US$388.40, I wrote [The Rise of the Fourth Great Bitcoin Bubble](http://www.runtogold.com/the-rise-of-the-fourth-great-bitcoin-bubble/).  On 4 December 2016, with Bitcoin trading at US$762.97, I did this interview:

&lt;iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRN1ih48JEg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

As of 26 November 2017, Bitcoin is trading around US$9,250.00. That is an increase of about 2,400% since I wrote the article prognosticating this fourth great Bitcoin bull market. I sure like being right, like usual ([19 Dec 2011](http://www.runtogold.com/solid-bitcoin-consolidation-finally-bears-a-bitcoin-breakout/), [1 Jul 2013](http://www.runtogold.com/bitcoinlandia-where-mythical-investment-grand-slams-are-reality/)), especially when there are financial and economic consequences.

With such massive gains in such a short period of time the speculative question becomes: Buy, Hold or Sell?

**FUNDAMENTALS**

Bitcoin is *the* decentralized censorship-resistant Internet Protocol for transferring value over a communications channel.

The Bitcoin network can use traditional Internet infrastructure. However, it is **even more resilient** because it has custom infrastructure including, thanks to [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) developer [Matt Corrallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), the [FIBRE network](http://bitcoinfibre.org/) and, thanks to Blockstream, [satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/) which reduce the cost of running a full-node anywhere in the world to essentially nothing in terms of money or privacy. Transactions can be [cheaply broadcast via SMS messages](http://gk2.sk/how-to-push-bitcoin-transactions-via-sms/).

**SECURITY**

The Bitcoin network has a difficulty of 1,347,001,430,559 which suggests about 9,642,211 TH/s of custom ASIC hardware deployed.

At a retail price of approximately US$105/THs that implies about $650m of custom ASIC hardware deployed (35% discount applied).

This custom hardware consumes [approximately 30 TWh per year](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption). That could power about 2.8m US households or the entire country of Morocco which has a population of 33.85m.

This Bitcoin mining generates approximately 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes or approximately 1,800 per day worth approximately US$16,650,000.

Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization greater than $150B which puts it solidly in the [top-30 of M1 money stock countries](https://twitter.com/TraceMayer/status/934670131019636736) and a 200 day moving average of about $65B which is increasing about $500m per day.

Average daily volumes for Bitcoin is around US$5B. That means multi-million dollar positions can be moved into and out of very easily with minimal slippage.

When my friend [Andreas Antonopolous](https://twitter.com/aantonop) was unable to give his talk at a CRYPSA event I was invited to fill in and delivered this presentation, impromptu, on the [Seven Network Effects of Bitcoin](https://www.weusecoins.com/the-seven-network-effects-of-bitcoin/).

These seven network effects of Bitcoin are (1) Speculation, (2) Merchants, (3) Consumers, (4) Security [miners], (5) Developers, (6) Financialization and (7) Settlement Currency are all taking root at the same time and in an incredibly intertwined way.

With only the first network effect starting to take significant root; Bitcoin is no longer a little experiment of magic Internet money anymore. Bitcoin is monster growing at a tremendous rate!!

&lt;iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6nAasAkFpM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

**SPECULATION**

For the Bitcoin price to remain at $9,250 it requires approximately US$16,650,000 per day of capital inflow from new hodlers.

Bitcoin is both a [Giffen good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giffen_good) and a [Veblen good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good).

A Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa — seemingly in violation of basic laws of demand in microeconomics such as with substitute goods and the income effect.

Veblen goods are types of luxury goods for which the quantity demanded increases as the price increases in an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.

There are approximately 16.5m bitcoins of which ~4m are lost, ~4-6m are in deep cold storage, ~4m are in cold storage and ~2-4m are salable.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/lost-bitcoins-1.jpg)

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/lost-bitcoins-2.jpg)

And forks like BCash (BCH) should not be scary but instead be looked upon as an opportunity to take more territory on the Bitcoin blockchain by trading the forks for real bitcoins which dries up more salable supply by moving it, likely, into deep cold storage.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire), there are approximately 15.4m millionaires in the United States and about 12m HNWIs ($30m+ net worth) in the world. In other words, if every HNWI in the world wanted to own an entire bitcoin as a 'risk-free asset' that cannot be confiscated, seized or have the balance other wise altered then they could not.

For wise portfolio management, these HNWIs should have at least about 2-5% in gold and 0.5-1% in bitcoin.

Why? Perhaps some of the [60+ Saudis with 1,700 frozen bank accounts and about $800B of assets](http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/11/08/arrests-made-saudi-anti-corruption-crackdown-800-billion-assets-stake/) being targetted might be able to explain it to you.

In other words, everyone loves to chase the rabbit and once they catch it then know that it will not get away.

**RETAIL**

There are approximately 150+ significant Bitcoin exchanges worldwide. [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com), according to the CEO, was adding about [6,000 new funded accounts per day](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2017/07/kraken-ceo-jesse-powell-on-scalability/) in July 2017.

Supposedly, Coinbase is currently adding about [75,000 new accounts per day](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1NgvD2kFT69mSXuJPzPDu-Qv9SS1ck2iPt6Kw9a55z0k/edit?usp=sharing). Based on some trade secret analytics I have access to; I would estimate Coinbase is adding approximately 17,500 new accounts per day that purchase at least US$100 of Bitcoin.

If we assume Coinbase accounts for 8% of new global Bitcoin users who purchase at least $100 of bitcoins (just pulled out of thin error and likely very conservative as the actual number is perhaps around 2%) then that is approximately $21,875,000 of new capital coming into Bitcoin every single day just from retail demand from 218,750 total new accounts.

What I have found is that most new users start off buying US$100-500 and then after 3-4 months months they ramp up their capital allocation to $5,000+ if they have the funds available.

After all, it takes some time and practical experience to learn how to safely secure one's private keys.

To do so, I **highly recommend** [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) (network consensus and full validation of the blockchain), [Armory](https://btcarmory.com/) (private key management), [Glacier Protocol](https://glacierprotocol.org/) (operational procedures) and a [Puri.sm laptop](https://puri.sm/) (secure non-specialized hardware).

**WALL STREET**

There has been no solution for large financial fiduciaries to invest in Bitcoin. This changed November 2017.

[LedgerX](https://ledgerx.com/), whose [CEO I interviewed 23 March 2013](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2015/03/btck-145-2015-03-23/), [began trading](http://data.ledgerx.com/) as a [CFTC regulated Swap Execution Facility and Derivatives Clearing Organization](https://ledgerx.com/about-ledgerx/).

The CME Group announced they will begin [trading in Q4 2017 Bitcoin futures](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-futures.html).

The CBOE [announced](http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures) they will begin trading Bitcoin futures soon.

By analogy, these institutional products are like connecting a major metropolis's water system ([US$90.4T](http://www.runtogold.com/images/worlds-money-supply.png) and US$2 quadrillion) via a nanoscopic shunt to a tiny blueberry ($150B) that is infinitely expandable.

This price discovery could be the most wild thing anyone has **ever experienced** in financial markets.

**THE GREAT CREDIT CONTRACTION**

The same week Bitcoin was released I published my book [The Great Credit Contraction](http://www.creditcontraction.com/book/TGCC.pdf) and asserted it had now begun and capital would burrow down the liquidity pyramid into *safer* and more *liquid* assets.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/Great-Credit-Contraction-Liquidity-Pyramid.jpg)

**Thus, the critical question becomes**: Is Bitcoin a possible solution to the Great Credit Contraction by becoming the safest and most liquid asset?

**BITCOIN'S RISK PROFILE**

At all times and in all circumstances gold remains money but, of course, there is always **exchange rate risk** due to price ratios constantly fluctuating. If the metal is held with a third-party in allocated-allocated storage (safest possible) then there is **performance risk** ([Morgan Stanley gold storage lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1228014520070612)).

But, if properly held then, there should be no **counter-party risk** which requires the financial ability of a third-party to perform like with a bank account deposit. And, since gold exists at a single point in space and time therefore it is subject to **confiscation or seizure risk**.

Bitcoin is a completely new asset type. As such, the storage container is nearly empty with only $150B.

And every Bitcoin transaction effectively melts down every BTC and recasts it; thus ensuring with 100% accuracy the *quantity* and *quality* of the bitcoins. If the transaction is not on the blockchain then it **did not happen**. This is the *strictest regulation* possible; by math and cryptography!

This new immutable asset, if properly secured, is subject **only** to **exchange rate risk**. There does exist the possibility that a software bug may exist that could shut down the network, like what has [happened](https://www.coindesk.com/dao-attacked-code-issue-leads-60-million-ether-theft/) with [Ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-client-bug-freezes-user-funds-fallout-remains-uncertain/), but the probability is almost nil and getting lower everyday it does not happen.

Thus, Bitcoin arguably has a lower risk profile than even gold and is the only blockchain to achieve security, scalability and liquidity.

To remain decentralized, censorship-resistant and immutable requires scalability so as many users as possible *can* run full-nodes.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/ethereum-bitcoin-scability-nov-2017.png)

**TRANSACTIONS**

Some people, probably mostly those shilling alt-coins, think Bitcoin has a scalability problem that is so serious it requires a crude hard fork to solve.

On the other side of the debate, the Internet protocol and blockchain geniuses assert the scalability issues can, like other Internet Protocols have done, be [solved in different layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PcR4HWJnkY) which are now possible because of [Segregated Witness](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) which was activated in August 2017.

Whose code do you want to run: the JV benchwarmers or the championship Chicago Bulls?

As transaction fees rise, certain use cases of the Bitcoin blockchain are priced out of the market. And as the fees fall then they are economical again.

Additionally, as transaction fees rise, certain UTXOs are no longer economically usable thus destroying part of the money supply until fees decline and UTXOs become economical to move.

There are approximately 275,000-350,000 transactions per day with transaction fees currently about $2m/day and the 200 DMA is around $1.08m/day.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/bitcoin-transaction-fees-nov-2017.png)

What I like about transaction fees is that they somewhat reveal the financial health of the network.

The security of the Bitcoin network results from the miners creating solutions to proof of work problems in the Bitcoin protocol and being rewarded from the (1) coinbase reward which is a form of inflation and (2) transaction fees which is a form of usage fee.

The higher the transaction fees then the greater implied value the Bitcoin network provides because users are willing to pay more for it.

I am highly skeptical of blockchains which have very low transaction fees. By Internet bubble analogy, Pets.com may have millions of page views but I am more interested in EBITDA.

**DEVELOPERS**

Bitcoin and blockchain programming is not an easy skill to acquire and master. Most developers who have the skill are also financially independent now and can work on whatever they want.

The best of the best work through the Bitcoin Core process. After all, if you are a world class mountain climber then you do not hang out in the MacDonalds play pen but instead climb Mount Everest because that is where the challenge is.

However, there are many talented developers who work in other areas besides the protocol. Wallet maintainers, exchange operators, payment processors, etc. all need competent developers to help build their businesses.

Consequently, there is a huge shortage of competent developers. This is probably the largest single scalability constraint for the ecosystem.

Nevertheless, the Bitcoin ecosystem is healthier than ever before.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/bitcoin-ecosystem.jpg)(/images/bitcoin-ecosystem-small.jpg)

**SETTLEMENT CURRENCY**

There are no significant global reserve settlement currency use cases for Bitcoin yet.

Perhaps the closest is [Blockstream's Strong Federations](https://blockstream.com/strong-federations.pdf) via [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/).

**PRICE**

There is a tremendous amount of disagreement in the marketplace about the value proposition of Bitcoin. Price discovery for this asset will be intense and likely take many cycles of which this is the fourth.

Since the supply is known the exchange rate of Bitcoins is composed of (1) transactional demand and (2) speculative demand.

Interestingly, the price elasticity of demand for the transactional demand component is irrelevant to the price. This makes for very interesting dynamics!

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/bitcoin-speculation.jpg)

On 4 May 2017, Lightspeed Venture Partners partner Jeremy Liew who was among the early Facebook investors and the first Snapchat investor [laid out their case for bitcoin exploding to $500,000 by 2030](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-could-be-500000-by-2030-first-snapchat-investor-says-2017-3).

On 2 November 2017, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/blankfein-says-don-t-dismiss-bitcoin-while-still-pondering-value)said&lt;/a&gt;, ""Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat...Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.""

On 12 Sep 2017, JP Morgan CEO called Bitcoin a 'fraud' but conceded that ""(http://fortune.com/2017/09/12/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-fraud-buy/)Bitcoin could reach $100,000&lt;/a&gt;"".

Thus, it is no surprise that the Bitcoin chart looks like a ferret on meth when there are such widely varying opinions on its value proposition.

I have been around this space for a long time. In my opinion, those who scoffed at the thought of $1 BTC, $10 BTC ([Professor Bitcorn!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_T._Williams)), $100 BTC, $1,000 BTC are scoffing at $10,000 BTC and will scoff at $100,000 BTC, $1,000,000 BTC and even [$10,000,000 BTC](https://youtu.be/tYQe7JHJZPM?t=14m30s).

Interestingly, the people who understand it the best seem to think its financial dominance is destiny.

Meanwhile, those who understand it the least make emotionally charged, intellectually incoherent bearish arguments. A tremendous example of worldwide [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) with regards to sound money, technology and the role or power of the State.

Consequently, I like looking at the 200 day moving average to filter out the daily noise and see the long-term trend.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/bitcoin-price-200dma-nov-2017.png)

Well, that chart of the long-term trend is pretty obvious and hard to dispute. Bitcoin is in a massive secular bull market.

The 200 day moving average is around $4,001 and rising about $30 per day.

So, what do some proforma situations look like where Bitcoin may be undervalued, average valued and overvalued? No, these are not prognostications.

(http://www.runtogold.com/images/bitcoin-price-pro-forma.png)

Maybe Jamie Dimon is not so off his rocker after all with a $100,000 price prediction.

We are in a very unique period of human history where the collective globe is rethinking what money is and Bitcoin is in the ring battling for complete domination. Is or will it be fit for purpose?

As I have said many times before, if Bitcoin is fit for this purpose then this is the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world.

**CONCLUSION**

Well, this has been a brief analysis of where I think Bitcoin is at the end of November 2017.

The seven network effects are taking root extremely fast and exponentially reinforcing each other. The technological dominance of Bitcoin is unrivaled.

The world is rethinking what money is. Even CEOs of the largest banks and partners of the largest VC funds are honing in on Bitcoin's beacon.

While no one has a crystal ball; when I look in mine I see Bitcoin's future being very bright.

Currently, almost everyone who has bought Bitcoin and hodled is sitting on unrealized gains as measured in fiat currency. That is, after all, what uncharted territory with daily all-time highs do!

But perhaps there is a larger lesson to be learned here.

Riches are getting increasingly slippery because no one has a reliable defined tool to measure them with. Times like these require incredible amounts of humility and intelligence guided by macro instincts.

Perhaps everyone should start keeping books in three [numéraires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire): USD, gold and Bitcoin.

Both gold and Bitcoin have never been worth nothing. But USD is a fiat currency and there are thousands of those in the fiat currency graveyard. How low can the world reserve currency go?

After all, **what is the risk-free asset**? And, whatever it is, in [The Great Credit Contraction](http://www.creditcontraction.com/book/TGCC.pdf) you want it!

What's that the best course of action to settle these? I get a lot of mail saying they will ""settle"" for a lower price. should the best deal to consolidate these through a bank?  I have trouble getting loans so I don't think that's easy to do. I just finally got a decent job making $45k a year. WOrking on saving now but want to address the loans asap.

Three months ago, the mortgage company applied our entire check towards the principle of the loan, and did not credit us with making that month's mortgage payment.  I only found out because I signed on to the mortgage company's website and found the transaction.  I called them, and they fixed the transaction.  The following month, they took my check and tried to apply it to 3 separate month's mortgage payments, then reversed the transaction and applied the check as intended.  This last month, they applied the additional principle I sent, but left the mortgage payment portion sitting in my account as ""unapplied.""  They reversed that action only after I called them.

side note, it's baffling that this coin stays around $0.20-25 consistently with all the partnerships and adoption they're getting. is it possible that ripple acts like the federal reserve, implementing a monetary policy by trading their reserve to keep the USD price stable? probably a big selling point for all the institutional partners they're working with.",cryptocurrency

So now today in the mail i just received ANOTHER check for the exact same amount. Different check number, different dates all that stuff.

So the question is, do I cash it? Am i breaking some kind if law if I do? Will the school (or whoever) have the legal right to come after me expecting the money back? I mean if i hand you money i can't just come back months/years later and say oh it was an accident give it back. Can i?

**The reason Obama's 2015 Net Neutrality is bad** isn't because it includes the Open Internet Rules (created in 2005), but because it includes the Title II Utility Classification of the internet. AND- get this- the Open Internet Rules are only included *provisionally*, UNDER Title II. This basically says ""hey all ur free speech is only allowed if big gov't gets to turn the internet into its utility"". Umm what? 2015 Net Neutrality was advertised as being equal to the Open Internet Rules, but Open Internet had already been an FCC policy since 2005. Obama pressured the FCC to repackage the 2010 Open Internet Order under a Title II Utility Classification of the internet. This is what we oppose.

&gt; 142.  Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding **not to block or throttle legal content**.^507 These **commitments can be enforced** by the FTC  under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.^508


# b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers while they watch **intergalactic bdsm porn** SORRY HUNNY U GETTN REGULATED (FCC release p.82):

&gt;  The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.^502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”^503

# Conspiracy theorists put down your pitch-forks, ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)

&gt; 144. Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal.  If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.^518

#TLDR

- Regulatory ~~rollback~~ throwback to 90's.

- FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government ""extravagant statutory power over the national economy"". * ***laughs in Kenyan*** *

- Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.

- FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).

- If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.

- FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.

- FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy. 

- America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.

- Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.


# **How this will negatively affect you:** 

The major loophole lies here:

&gt;Many of the largest ISPs have **committed** to not to block or throttle legal content.^507 These commitments **can** be enforced by the FTC...

FTC can only prevent throtting/blocking/etc because that's what ISPs are advertising. If multiple ISPs each individually stop advertising it, it's not immediately clear that the FTC can hold them all accountable to it. However, if the ISPs collude to collectively enact abusive policies, then the FTC can fuck them up. But if an ISP paywalls websites, they must explicitly notify consumers. **If customers have no alternative ISP and are forced to obey their one ISP's abusive policies, then the FTC can declare them a monopoly.** That would whip up a shitstorm for the ISP, but it could still happen.

Later in the report the FCC admits that they are eliminating the Bright-Line Rules, which is bad for us.

# [FCC Bright-Line / Open Internet Rules](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf)

- No Blocking

- No Throttling

- No Paid-Prioritization 

The FCC Bright Line Rules are replaced with FTC regulations:

- No monopolies. (lookin at you comcast)

- No collusion. (still lookin at you)

- No consumer abuse 

- No unfair business practice. (holy fuck comcast)


**The report clarifies that the repeal of FCC Bright Line does not inhibit the FTC from enforcing an open internet, and regulation enforcement is delegated to the FTC heretofore. (FTC has a good record protecting consumers).**

&gt; In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that **harms Internet openness**, despite the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct.  Other legal regimes—particularly antitrust law and the FTC’s authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices—provide protection for consumers.

The FCC admits that this has the potential to become a problem. They claim it is highly unlikely because the FTC can come in and penetrate ISPs who act as monopolies. Plus, content providers (Google, Amazon, etc.) have an obscenely higher market capitalization than ISP's (Google alone has higher market cap than all ISP's combined), and that they can easily pressure ISPs to obey. 

For example:

- Comcast tries to throttle Netflix. 

- Netflix says fuck you we won't serve any of your Comcast kind here. 

- Comcast customers can't watch Stranger Things.

- Comcast customers screech autistically.

-  Everyone (who can) leaves Comcast.

- If nobody can leave Comcast, the FTC can declare Comcast a monopoly and bust their nuts. 

Thus the FCC concludes it is unlikely that ISPs will paywall their content providers because content-providers will easily prevent them from doing it. FCC asserts that monopolies like Comcast will be combated with FTC anti-monopoly regulation, increased competition, and more ISP choices for customers that will drive price down and quality up. FCC will address individual ISP violations case by case if/when they arise. 

&gt;141. Consumer Protection.  The FTC has broad authority to protect consumers from “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”^495

**I can't imagine anything more unfair than Comcast monopolizing your internet and restricting it.**

*The FCC could have done more, to be honest, since the nonzero possibility still exists that paid-prioritization of content may emerge in the future if the FTC fails to bust monopolies like Comcast, and/or if the markets fail to produce enough ISP competitors. Keep your eyes open and stay vigilant.*

**Timeline Review**

gaming,"Game Industry impact a lot of people on grassroot level. Devs, take a stand and opt-out from maximized profits (Pay to Win etc).","Long post and likely controversial and downvoted to hell, but maybe it’s a chance for at least me to learn and discuss more on the topic.

—-

Capitalism is the fastest known economic method for growth. It served well during the time fiat currency (money) or other physical goods (gold/oil) were linked directly to the currency. Eg. a dollar was worth a known amount of said valuable resource.

Past decades, this hasn’t been the reality at all due to banks ”creating” currency in form of bits out of nothing, in roughly 10 virtual units for every 1 actual, tanglible resource. This turned inflation upside now and these days inflation is caused by this ”surplus generation” of money.

Now the growth is needed to counter the interests on loans that are the driving force for the positive GDP. If the growth isn’t happening, insolvencies start to crumble the house of cards underneath. That CANNOT happen (too big to fall), thus we see the Federal Banking Reserve (totally private and unaudited in US btw) and European Central Bank have been flooding global markets with tens of billions of dollars every month for years, to make sure the interest rates would be low and the companies would keep raising loans.

Inequality keeps growing and the richest gets richer, since the wealth generates wealth.

Now we are reaching the point where interests are even negative, which means that companies are ”forced” to invest that money out to expand and thus keep the cycle of growth going on.

The problem is that never ending growth is unsustainable. You cannot keep adding a % on a number, year after year. The math turns exponentially increasing and with planet that has limited resources, we just need to hit the breaks here.

[Expectancy of growth leads to inequality, debt and depression.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/2y4sgm/expectancy_of_growth_is_causing_world_of/) Positive GDP shouldn’t be on the UNs ”Millenium Goals” with eradicating extreme poverty, access to fresh water etc, but it is.

It means we’ll need to start looking alternatives to the min-max mode capitalism, ”which is always” looking more and more ways to keep sucking out the maximized profit, which leads to the maximized growth when applied everywhere.

I’m not suggesting that we need to turn the boat completely around. I’m suggesting that we should look for other paths and slow the pace.

That’s exactly what’s happening eg. in the US, with the goal to shoot down the attempts to mutilate net neutrality and with everything eg. Sanders is doing, trying to kill the republican tax cuts for the ultra-rich.

Average gamer is under 40 and the world isn’t looking too good for a lot of young adults. This is where game industry enters the game.

Game devs/publishers could (or even should) opt-out from the maximized profits. They’ll have an impact on how the world  tomorrow and how potentially millions of players see your company and the industry as a whole. EA is a great example from the ...well, from the dark side. The business is huge, many times larger than all the movie/TV and music combined, AFAIK.

personalfinance,"27, salaried job (for now), student loans, and hoping for some help to get a jump on my financial education","Hi guys, as I stated in the topic I'm a young-ish 27 y.o. male who is currently employed and looking to undo some years of financial apathy. I'm based in L.A. and I'm an aspiring screenwriter, but I kind of fell into an education career that's become at least somewhat lucrative as a safety/backup job. I apologize if this is waaaaaay TMI but here is a bunch of background on my situation (with a TL;DR of the bare numbers at the end)

I work in private education as both an independent contractor and as of a few months ago, a salaried employee, resulting in a blended income. Right now, my salary is $46,000 before taxes and health insurance/IRA. This is also distributed through September to June (school year) so it's a bit of a higher monthly income but then I am without the salary paycheck for July/August. My company provides/matches health insurance, which is $226.57/mo on my end, and also a Simple IRA with a 3% match, which is $69.99 on my end and then matched by them. My 1099 income also covers September-June, which nets me roughly $2000-3000 per month in additional, untaxed income. However, I pay estimated quarterly taxes on this income -- and I hope that it's offset a bit by claiming 0 allowances on my salaried job.

As far as expenses go, my rent/utilities come out to roughly $830/mo, car payment is $200/mo, car insurance is $130/mo, gas is about $120/mo, with private loan payments at ~$93/mo and fed. loans at $0/mo. I have some subscriptions as well (apple music/NYT) which amount to ~$15/mo. Food/groceries come out to ~$250/mo - SO and I are trying to scale back on eating out, but craft beer/dining are definitely luxuries for us. I just moved in with my SO as well so we splurged a bit on major apartment purchases which should be scaled back quite a bit now, so let's say another ~$150 on random expenses.

My biggest concern is that with the fickle nature of my career at the moment (not very likely, but you can lose clients with no warning), I won't really know if I will have another year of my salaried client until roughly June. This makes me hesitate in jumping full force into financial investments (maximizing IRA benefits, etc.) until I know I will have another year of a similar and likely higher income. If I do continue with the same client in a salaried position, my salary will continue to increase each consecutive year. The second I hear about my renewed contract, I have a plan to pay off my private student loan that is @ ~$10,700 as that is my highest interest rate loan. I am open to any suggestions about this plan though! My auto loan is at 0% APR which sounds like it's less of a priority in my mind. Then, I want to attack my student loans, sitting at $42,000, while simultaneously dumping into a 401k/IRA. That's the year at a glance, but I really would like to know what else I can do in the meantime for the best balance of saving/investing.

I'm also curious about the best use of a credit card. I currently have a Chase Freedom card which I've been using to make just about all my purchases in order to continue using my card in a healthy manner (it's on auto-pay, so everything is completely paid off at the end of the month). However, I'm hoping to get another card to really maximize rewards and benefits but I'm unsure of what to get. I make a decent amount of amazon purchases with my GF so the Chase Amazon card looks attractive, but I wouldn't be opposed to something with miles either. Again, this is to complement purchases I already make and not to rack up any unnecessary purchases. I'm also interested in accumulating rewards/benefits by paying bills with something like Plastiq or Venmo; I know there's a fee, but from what I've heard the fees may sometimes be outweighed by the rewards/cashback, so I'd love to hear any insight on that!

Additionally, I don't truly understand my Simple IRA. Is this a Roth equivalent? Is it worthwhile to open an additional 401(k)? I want to take advantage of both benefits but not necessarily max them out. And on top of that, I have ~$21,000 sitting in my checking account and I'm not sure what the smartest place is to keep it.

**TL;DR:**

**INCOME** (*~$5,000-$5,500 after taxes except for June/August)*

* SALARY: ($3,000/mo)
* 1099 INCOME: ~$2000-3000 additional

**ASSETS/INVESTMENTS**: *(~$21,570)*

* ~$570 in a Simple IRA (accumulating each month with a 3% employer match)
* ~$21,000 in a checking account
* 2012 Honda Civic with ~$6,700 left in payments over 2 years

**LOANS:** *(~$59,000)*

* $10,400 Private Loans with Chase @ 6.75% interest
* $42,000 Federal Loans with 6.55% interest (I won't list them all, but this is comprised of 10 different loans, mostly between $2000-$4000 -- $7,000 of this is in accumulated interest)
* $6,000 left on Car Loan on fixed 5 year plan with 0% interest

**EXPENSES**: *(~$1600/mo)*

* Rent/Electric/Gas: ~$830/mo
* Car Payment: $200/mo
* Car Insurance: $130/mo
* Private Loans: $93/mo
* Food/Groceries: ~$250/mo
* Random: ~$165/mo


Big question is: What is the best way to move/use/save/invest my money until I get the guarantee that I have this job for at least another year in June? And given my situation, should I get another credit card to maximize rewards/saving? And if so, what will accumulate the most and can I tack rent/bills onto it (a la Plastiq or Venmo)? It's worth mentioning that I have an excellent credit score (a bit north of 750). Thanks for reading this novel!",finance
investing,"What's this ""Fixed Return Fund"" my wife is eligible for? Too good to be true?","My wife is a teacher in New York state.  I'm getting her 403(b) set up and am going over the investment options for it.  

There are a handful of funds to choose from, basically what you would expect - one focused on bonds, a couple of different ones focused on equities, etc...  

We're in our early 30's, so I was planning on just putting about 80-90% in equities, and the rest in bonds, and calling it a day.  But then I noticed one of the option is a ""Fixed Return Fund"".  The relevant page is [here](https://imgur.com/Zm6ni08).

personalfinance,[Planning] Tackling debt while versus growing savings and planning for the future,"EDIT: Please excuse my butcher job of a title.

So, I closed out my college loans May 28th 2012. Increased my income significantly since graduating college in 2010 and got married in 2015. 

Since getting married I've inherited 55k in student loans from my wife (teacher), another 4k in recent Sallie Mae college loans to finish grad school (that will be the last of it finally!), $1,600.00 in a roofing loan that is interest free if we pay it off by August 2018, and a 7k 8.5% loan we have been paying the minimum on. As I understand it, we're typical Jane and Joe Mellenial.

My understanding/goal is that I have a few options but this is the way we should go.

1. Make sure we can pay off the roofing loan by August 2018 (been paying $200.00/month)

2. We've paid in about $500.00 into the 4k loan since she took it for her final year in September. That's my next goal. Pay 200 a month into it until it's gone.

3. Then comes the 7k, 8.5% loan. I'm prioritizing this third because the 4k loan is just smaller and I want to forget it exists. Mathematically, should I just pay the minimum on the 4k and work on this one instead as the interest rate is 2% higher?

4. The big 55k loan we pay in $304 a month based on her repayment plan. That will go up now that she's teaching with a salary. My understanding is that loan will be forgiven in 10 years. So, I should just be paying the minimum on that and ride it out?

5. Our emergency fund is 3k. I'm pumping $500.00 into it a month right now. Would like to see it around 5-7k before diverting funds into the previous loans. 

6. After all other typical monthly expenses including a mortgage, utilities, blah blah blah we have roughly $750.00 left over. We've used a bit of that for some furniture in the fall, but as that $750.00 turns into $1,400.00 and $2,100.00. Where should I throw it?

7. I currently commit 8% into my 401k which ensures I get my companies maximum match.

8. Our current checking balance after Nov is $4,000.00. 


Is my logic sound? Any suggestions for prioritizing? Also. My wife is in need of a new car within 2 years (hers is 11 and she's been a trooper for keeping it maintained this well that long).",finance
CryptoCurrency,With all this talk about bubbles...,"The bubble cries are getting louder as btc inches to $10k. But 90% of the posts I read fundamentally misunderstand what a bubble is. I'm not here to tell you if bitcoin is in a bubble, but to explain what a bubble is. 

A bubble is not about fast growth. There are many assets in history that have grown absurdly fast, but which ended up not being a bubble. For instance, Apple. A bubble is also not about how the market is doing compared to other markets. It is possible for an asset class to have a market class half the size of another, but still be in a bubble. And a bubble is not about where the price is compared to its start. 

Frankly, it is impossible to know a bubble because there are so many hidden factors that we are not privy to. There are indicators of bubbles, but it is ultimately a judgement call (if it weren't, then fancy investment bankers wouldn't have been caught so off guard during the dot.com bubble and housing bubble). 

So what is a bubble? A bubble DEPENDS ENTIRELY on investor motivation and behavior. You need to ask yourself if people are buying bitcoins because they believe the technology has value for society, or if they are buying it as greedy speculators who want to ride on a gravy train. If the latter, you have a bubble. How fast bitcoin rises is irrelevant; if its rise to $10k was caused by investors who believe in the tech, then there is no bubble. And the intrinsic value is also irrelevant: EVEN IF bitcoin's value to society is inherently worth $10k, if it reached that $10k by speculation, then there is a bubble. And not all bubbles crash. If the price rise was propelled by speculation, but then most of the speculators eventually come to believe in the concept of crypto (like what happened to me), then the bubble deflates and the value pricing rises. 

An even simpler definition for a bubble is based on fickleness. For instance, do you believe enough people believe in cryptocurrencies such that they will continue holding it if the US government makes it illegal. If a US ban would drive the price down by hundreds of percents, then there is a bubble. After all, crypto's use doesn't rely on government acceptance, so while the price should fall in a rational market, it shouldn't be decimated if most investors actually want to use the currency as a tech. One day, bitcoins will stop rising, and when that day comes, will everyone start using it as a currency or will they transfer their wealth to other speculative assets? That's the question. The ""true price"" of bitcoins is what the price will become after all the speculators leave and the sincere people remain. 

Ask yourself: are the majority of people buying into crypto believers in a anarcho-libertarian monetarist order where decentralized currencies rule? Consider that most people don't even know what ""the Fed"" is short for.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"26, First Job Post-Grad, Feeling Pretty Stuck Financially, Seeking Encouragement","Hi guys, long time lurker, first time poster. Here's the situation. I just finished my Master's degree (in a not particularly lucrative field) and obtained my first professional job 3 months ago. 

Gross Salary - $45,000

Side job - $3200

Total Gross - $48,200

Combined Take Home Pay (after healthcare premium, parking pass for work, etc) - $2679/month

Total Debts

Federal Student Loans - $51,062


Expenses

Fixed Expenses (Rent, food for dog and I, renter/car insurance, all bills) - $1650

Student loan payment - $545 (in grace period till Feb)

Remaining monthly income for variable expenses (auto repair, Christmas, etc) and saving - $484

While I am not in a particularly horrible position, I do feel like I don't really have enough shovel to dig out of my hole very quickly at all. I am not in a position to increase my income very substantially, nor reduce my expenses substantially. My side job is personal training and while it pays fairly well on the hour, I can't take very many clients because of my day job. I have lots of weekend availability, but no-one wants to train 1 day/week, especially not only on weekends. I am attempting to get 1-2 more clients, but this will only add around 100/month to my income. 

My career is unlikely to produce substantially higher income in the near future. In 10-20 years, I'll be doing quite well, but right now...not so much.

Regarding reducing expenses, I am at the point of diminishing returns. Short of feeding myself and my puppy poorly (cheap corn based dog food for him, and cheap corn based processed foods for me) my food budget cannot be substantially reduced further. I've shopped around and obtained good deals on subscription services (phone, internet, etc) but going much further would be minimal gain for substantial sacrifice (going to super slow internet package, or eating a crappier diet). I am not in a position to move, and doing so would not net a substantial rent reduction. I might save 50/month but that would require me to move someplace worse AND take on a roommate. This would be tempting if the savings were higher.

The only thing that I could potentially do to grow the income side in the short term ( a PhD is needed to boost my career income), is to take on a weekend job. The only things around here I'm aware of that would allow someone to work weekends-only are essentially minimum wage jobs(outside of pizza delivery which ends up at minimum wage when your vehicle gets 15mpg and you factor in repair costs and such). If you do that math on that, if I picked up an 8 hour shift on Saturday (leaving Sunday for family, grocery shopping, cleaning, etc. which have to be done sometime) at 8 dollars an hour, that adds under $200/month to my income after taxes, minus commute costs. Hardly seems worth the hassle factor...

I guess I am just looking for some encouragement. It sort of feels a bit claustrophobic to be this far in the hole with such a small amount that can be paid onto reducing the student loan balance. It feels like other financial goals such as saving for a home, retirement, nicer car, kids, etc are becoming not years away...but decades away, and I don't feel like I have a ton of power to change that.",finance

So $1000 or so in returns for the 401k.

My issue is I got out when vffvx was ~ 38.00 and it has gone up to ~39.00

T rowe price I got out at ~95.70. It is now at ~98.00

I am undecided as to whether or not I should get back into the market or wait for some sort of drop/correction and then get back in.

These accounts are for long term investing. 

Option 1 : I could get back in and just accept that I missed the gains, and if the stock market corrects itself just brush it off as a lesson learned as to why you dont time the market. 

Option 2: I can wait until the market corrects and lose out on possible gains now(Like I have already) and buy back in when prices come back down(thus -possibly- coming out ahead of option 1.

The risk with option two is that if it doesn't come back down, then I am only falling further behind. As I understand it, we are due for a correction.

Option 3: hold a short term bond fund until the market corrects then go back into stocks?I  Haven't looked into this much, but as I understand it short term bonds are better than long term bonds when fed is expected to raise rates. Is short term bonds a safe way to get minimal gains with minimal loss while I wait for the market to correct? From the graphs I have looked at it would appear when the market tanks/corrects that bonds do not drop nearly as much percent as stocks do.

I have thought about all my options (except #3 too much) and I simply can not decide. 

Does anyone know what the statistical/smartest route to take is in this situation?

Obviously next time I have learned not to pull out at all since I am long term investing.

Perhaps I should get back into market over time? $300/week as to minimize my risk getting back in?

personalfinance,First time home buyer needing mortgage loan advice,"Hey All,

First time home buyer, and just need some help deciding what the best steps are to attaining a good mortgage loan.

Currently I am in talks with one bank about a loan, and because of the time sensitivity (seller is pushing to get sold by end of year) of my offer this bank can get me a loan quick. The real estate agent reccommended me this bank. So it may be in my best interest to go with this bank (Flagstar)

The current interest rate on a 30 year fixed I am getting quoted is 3.875%, and a 4.09% APR. It was also mentioned there was a underwriting/application fee of $995. Also my loan officer mentioned that if I wanted to lock in my rate now I can do so if I pay .5-1 point (not sure why he wasn't clear on how much, is this typical?).

Is there anything fishy about this loan? Given the interest rate it looks like a decent loan and i'd like to go with this bank to get the deal done, but i'd also like to get the best deal possible for myself.

Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,"Hospital fighting me every step of the way for financial assistance. Student w/child, barely making ends meet. I'm at my wits end.","I'm kind of at my wits end here. I'm a 22 year old full time nursing student with a child.

I have a total of about $3000 in medical bills stemming from 2 separate (unwanted) ER visits. I make $9/hr and am barely able to keep a roof over my family's head, even with low-income housing and subsisting on ramen noodles.

I have no insurance because the insurance provided by my work would eat up $250 every month, which I can't afford. I applied for private insurance, but the cheapest I could get was $485/month for just myself. I was denied Medicaid, but my son has it.

I applied for my hospital's financial assistance program, but they're fighting me every step of the way. It took me 2 months just to get an application from the financial office. I've been in there over 12 separate times and have not been able to meet with them once. The secretary always gives me a speal about how they aren't in atm, but I can leave a message (to which I haven't got one reply).

I got fed up and called the corporate office and got them to send me an application. I filled it out and they said it would take 60 days to process. They promised me my account wouldn't be sent to a debt collector since my assistance status was pending approval.

However, it was. I got a legitimate letter saying that the hospital sent the debt to the collector because my account was 90 days with no payment.

I tried calling the collector to get some answers. After the standard questions, all they kept asking was ""sir, are you refusing to pay?"" they wouldn't even acknowledge my questions. I didn't want to set up a payment plan (that I can't make) because it has backfired where before I was told that my debt can't retroactively be lowered because I already agreed to a payment plan.

I feel like I'll never make it out of financial hell. I'm trying everything in my power to provide my son with a better life than I had and it feels as though the universe is conspiring against me, I'm a good student and loving father.

I just need to make it another 1.5years till I get my RN and will be making $25+/hr.

personalfinance,18yo first home?,"hey all, long term lurker and first time poster! 

i am an eighteen year old in australia and i am looking for advice/warnings about buying my first property sometime in the upcoming year.

i have finished my schooling last year and continued working the same retail job i was during high school. 

i have plans to commit to a higher education sometime in the next five years. 

i currently have no debts, my monthly expenses are $440 averaged. 
this includes 
- $280 in transport costs (i take public transport as often as i can, but for some early starts i need to uber) 
- $30 in entertainment (netflix and spotify) 
- $30 in phone plan 
- $100 in food 

i also have no credit cards and i don’t have a car. i additionally live at home and pay no rent. 

 i am earning around $2400-$3000 AUD a month after tax. i have been with the same company for just over two years now and i am getting promoted to a full time supervisor position in the next three months. this will mean that will earn an additional $600+ a month. 

work is fairly flexible at the moment, i work for a larger chain which is often short-staffed and i am able to work at other stores which is why my income can fluctuate. 

a close friend of mine offered me a job which i am able to work on top of my existing hours, which will pay on average an additional $1500 a month (before tax) 
i’m fairly sure that i get taxed far more heavily on a second job so i will probably get $800-$1000 weekly from that. 

i’m looking to cut down on my unneeded expenses, banks in australia need the previous three months of purchases and expenses, so i’m looking to clean up my more frivolous purchases before i even approach a bank. this would involve getting rid of my spotify and netflix, pushing my food budget down and pushing for extra hours at work. 

i have started saving up quite recently and currently have $4,000 in an account that i have had open for over two years. i’m putting the majority of my income into this every week. 

as i am eighteen i don’t need a guarantor, however they may be able to help me avoid LMI (lenders mortgage insurance) 
this can also be avoided by having a 20% down payment on a property - something which i would be looking to do anyways. 

as this would be my first property i am buying, i would also qualify for the first home loan grant by the government, which is an additional $10,000 which is used as part of a down payment on the property. however, this would mean that i would have to live in the property for twelve months. i can offset a portion of the repayments by having someone stay with me, or advertise a room through gumtree or something similar to that. 

i am looking for a property in the market of around $250,000-$350,000. this would mean that i would be looking at saving up in excess of $40,000 for a 20% down payment (including the first home loan). i would be looking to have an additional $5,000 safety net on top of that. 

i have done research into the subject and was just wondering if what i have planned is doable and if people who have been in similar positions to me have any advice to offer. this is obviously a daunting task, so any advice is helpful.",finance
personalfinance,"(US) Mountain of student loans, $83,000K and growing. I don't know where to start.","Hello everyone, 

I made this a throw away account because I am ashamed and embarrassed of my situation, but please, I need guidance. I graduated from a 4 year private university in the spring of 2014. I haven't paid any federal loans off. Since then, I  paid off 10k in credit card debt. I'd like to start on this mountain now. 

I have $33k of federal student loans, all growing with interest. 
In detail, I have subsidized stafford loans totaling $19,000.
I have unsubsidized stafford loans totaling $14,000.
The total is divided between 9 loans. 
6 of them have an interest rate of 3.8%.
3 of them (about 10k) have an interest rate of 6.8%.

Now, the scary part. I also have $50k of parent plus loans. The parent plus loans range from $8k - $16k each, with a fixed rate of 7.9% interest. The interest is growing fast on these. 

Everything has been in deferment - forbearance since 2014. 

My major was Intercultural Studies with a certificate in TESOL. Right now I am living and teaching in South Korea. I make about $35,000 a year USD. I don't own a car, I don't have to pay any rent. My monthly bills are usually $150-$200 and the rest I can pocket. I think I can start with a monthly payment of $1,000 towards the loans. 

I am hating myself every day because I know I could have paid off so much already if I had tried. I know I spend too much, I am not disciplined in terms of money and spending. But, I want to change, because I cannot live with this feeling anymore. 

My questions:
1. I don't know if or what I should consolidate? 
2. If I make monthly payments, will it even touch the loans? (There is so much outstanding interest, where will my payments go?)
3. How aggressively should I pay them off vs. saving money? I have some emergency savings, but that's pretty much it. I don't know if I should pay off as much as possible, and have nothing saved... Or pay off some, and save some money for my future. 
4. Should I pay off the sub/unsub loans first? or the parent plus loans? 

I feel like an utter idiot because my younger self was convinced that going to a small private college for the 'experience' was worth it. By no means could I afford it, but just like magic we were able to borrow 15-20k per year. 

I've listened to a lot of Dave Ramsey, I read a bit on Student Loan Hero. I'm thinking of starting the debt snowball, it's just hard to believe that I will ever pay it ALL off. Let me know if you need more information, and thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Debating taking out a personal loan to pay off some things. Need help deciding.,"Hi /r/personalfinace, back again with another question for some of your brilliant minds. Here we go.

I currently owe about $2,900 on my credit cards. I'm getting slaughtered with interest rates on them. One of the is around 29% interest and the other is 0% for now - but will turn into 18% after another 10 months or so. 

I'm also looking to possibly ask for more on the loan just to set up an emergency fund in my bank account just for situations that I can't predict. Also highly considering asking for enough to pay off my phone as well so I can lower my bill every month. 

Now - my question is this. What sort of interest rate should I be willing to accept? My credit score is reasonable for my age(Sitting around a 680-710 score, depending on the agency you use). Most offers that I have seen so far for myself have been around 20-23% interest. I feel like that's quite high and don't know if I should look into these ones. 

tl;dr - considering taking out a loan for about $5000 or so to pay some stuff off and get my life back on track",finance
personalfinance,Cash out or let it ride?,"I was an early employee at a startup whose valuation has skyrocketed, but the company is still private and share transfers are heavily restricted. Recently it was announced that there would be a tender offer, but at a 30% discount to the price of preferred shares in the company. The CEO and board have announced intentions to IPO by 2019, and I would have a 6 month lockup period.

I have had to be clever with finances for the last few years as I leveraged 0% promotional balance transfer checks and 401k loans to pay off the IRS for AMT on a share exercise in a previous year while maximize my 401k contributions (contributing money I can’t afford to, then taking out what I need as a loan).

Our current assets/liabilities look like this:
  - $7k/month take-home
  - $5k/month expenses
  - $8k cash
  - $17k credit cards ($15k @ 0% until July)
  - $8K 401k loan
  - $48K 401k
  - $510K stock (at tender price)
  
Exercising my remaining stock options would cost $30K and trigger ~$140K in state AMT (if federal AMT goes away next year; if it stays... I don’t want to think about how much I’d owe the IRS if I quit and was forced to exercise).

My thinking is I should sell enough to be able to pay off the credit cards and 401k loan, have 6 months of expenses in savings, and be able to afford to exercise my remaining options and taxes. I’m hesitant to sell more because of the discounted price, and because I plan to leave California before the IPO and could save ~10% in state income taxes on the total gain because my shares are from an ISO plan and qualified dispositions are not taxed for CA non-residents. I’m also bullish on the company, and believe the stock will go up between now and the IPO.

Is it worth taking the 30% discount and CA tax hit in exchange for liquidity now instead of in 2-3 years? Does it make sense to sell as little as necessary, or should I use this opportunity to cash out all out my stock and diversify? Should I sell enough to cover the state AMT on exercising my remaining options, or get on a repayment plan when the tax comes due in 2019 and pay it off after the IPO?

Ripple,Ripple haters 101: Food for thoughts,"Long time lurker here. Created this account because I was tired of all the lies and FUD about Ripple and wanted to bring back some truth to counter balance the lies. I’m invested in other coins too, but all this hate towards Ripple is just annoying. Instead of doing nothing and letting them do their things I decided I had enough and wanted to help clear some noise. Just doing my part for the community to fight these toxic trolls. I’m not a damn shill, I’m not paid to write this stuff and said it already: you can call me whatever you want if it makes you feel good.

This post first started out as a reply to a comment from someone about the « get me rich quick » impatient kids complaining on every social media platform of the ripple price not going up fast enough. It was wayyyyy too long (and still is! Haha!), so I deleted it. Instead I decided to create my own post and add a few things here and there to take the time to explain some things more clearly. It’s not perfect but hey, if it helps at least one person to understand where all this hate is coming from and how much pointless it is, my job is done.

Here it goes, I hope you enjoy it (haters gonna hate I know, it’s ok, let’s have a conversation below or just downvote me, I don’t care):

Are those people complaining about the current price really “get me rich quick” impatient kids, or are they only fudsters and trolls? There is an army of ripple haters out there, I’ll try to explain where they are coming from.

Did you watch the “banking on bitcoin” documentary? I heard of it before but never really took the time to watch. I just did when someone mentionned Benjamin Lawsky was in it and it’s very eye opening, it helps to put things in perspective.

There is a whole community of people who believe Bitcoin is the solution to the banking system flaws. Wether it is true or not is questionnable, the evolution of Bitcoin has it’s own flaws too, but there are a lot of cypher punks, crypto anarchist or whatever you want to call them who believe hard as a rock the original narrative that Bitcoin is a kind a messiah coming to save us from the evil banks. At least that’s the narrative they want us to believe. They’ve been here for a while now. They hate the banks, they just want to destroy and replace them. 

Some of those cypher punks were working on cryptography before the 2008 financial crisis, but it’s the crisis that revived the idea of using cryptography to create a decentralized system of exchange to eliminate the middle man (the banks) and replace the actual banking system from which this whole crisis emerged. This is where Bitcoin is coming from.

Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever he really is) was a part of this community and he got inspired by other projects to create the Bitcoin white paper. He got help from the cypher punks community to put it together and code it. And we all know what’s next: Bitcoin was born. The idea of bypassing or just destroying the banks is deeply encrusted in the Bitcoin community from it’s very beginning.

Later matured other projects inspired by this blockchain technology. Here comes Ripple and XRP, which is based on the same blockchain technology, but to actually help the banks get more efficient. 

It‘s all really hard to accept for this community of cypher punks and crypto anarchists who want to destroy banks in first place.

You see, Ripple is considered from it’s beginning as the enemy by this community because they are working with the banks they want to destroy. They think we are in some kind of war between the good people and the evil banks (as if everything is just black or white) and that Ripple must therefore disappear with the banks they are helping.

They will do whatever they can to discredit Ripple. That includes spreading false rumours, lies, misconceptions or all kinds of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and even acting as discouraged “get me rich quick” kids on every social media platform to convince other people it’s not worth investing in it. There are probably even a few people who made some nice money on bitcoin who are now paying fake social media accounts to spread this FUD or are literally trying to manipulate the price down on the markets (and why not later accuse Ripple of keeping the price down if it serves the cause!).

The war must go on you know! 

Some new people coming into crypto see this and understand it’s “cool” to hate ripple and fight the banks. Everybody is doing it, so they join the bandwagon to perpetuate those lies and misconceptions further. Fortunately there are also other people who actually do their own research    and can use their own judgement to see the actual potential of this technology beyond all the FUD.

Unfortunately, some crypto anarchists don’t seem to realize Bitcoin is not exactly becoming what it was intended. Things are not always what they seem. The original idea expressed in Satoshi’s white paper is slowly fading away. It’s not as decentralized as what they want us to believe. There are a few people making a lot of money with Bitcoin and they are controlling the fate of the protocol. It was all clear with all the latest forks and the so called “new york agreement” meeting behind closed doors.

How is it any different from the banks? It’s just different people in different positions of power.

Personal interests and greed always come into play. Some influential people want to push the evolution of the Bitcoin protocol in a particular direction while others disagree because their interest is aligned otherwise, for the good reasons or not. It’s just human nature (often only greed). 

Mining is getting more and more centralized in a few big mining facilities, it is consuming an awful amount of energy and will only get worse. The original idea behind bitcoin as a decentralized means of exchange between people, with low fees, is sinking deeper and deeper, being replaced by the idea it is a good store of value (and a very speculative one for sure). But some people following them are so blinded by the original utopian promises and idea behind Bitcoin that they don’t see it’s flaws. Sometimes you have to let go and accept reality is changing around you and take the blinders off.

There are also speculators and manipulators in the crypto markets, who simply want to profit from the volatility of any coin and don’t really care about the ideology behind it all. So they join the bandwagon too, they do their part to spread lies and FUD in other crypto’s communities to convince people to invest somewhere else (of course in the project they are already invested in). 

Creating false anticipation to pump the price, then doing the opposite once they sold to scare other people and create another dump to buy back lower is also all part of their « techniques ».

Some people are repeating those lies and FUD over and over, maybe without even knowing they are being manipulated by big players. It gets harder to see through all the lies for newcomers.

Sometimes you have to take a few steps back to put things in perspective. Isn’t it evil to spread lies and FUD, manipulating other people’s perception to mislead them? Is it really any better than the evil banks these crypto anarchists are supposedly fighting against? Is it the better world they are trying to build, by fighting each other by any means including lies, just to gain control? Does the end really justify the means? Do they even care?

These people are getting so much toxic for cryptos in general, I sometimes silently wish Bitcoin (or the other projects these trolls are coming from) could die so we could all move along peacefully with other projects. Because it’s not only Ripple that is under these attacks. But will it ever change? Is it any different in the stock market?

You have to understand all this background when you read all the FUD comments. Sometimes it’s laughable to read all the same stupid arguments being destroyed again and again, but yet they keep coming back, hoping to influence some more uninformed people. 

Let’s be real: the banks are not going away anytime soon, the Bitcoin protocol is not perfect and it’s not the only use case for blockchain technology. Other use cases will come to fruition in the future and some of them will work with the banks, yes. Why fight this? There is room for everyone in this whole new market. But I knoooow, they just want to destroy the banks. Good luck with that. You know just like me the banks control everything in this world right now. And it’s not all black or white. Banks have a purpose in the real world.

Why not trying to reform the existing banking system and correct what you don’t like one step at a time instead of trying so hard to destroy it all and replace it with the first “solution” proposed that is not necessarily much better? The banks don’t have to die, Bitcoin and the banks can co-exist, so does all the other major crypto projects out there with a real world use case. Why don’t they simply let people decide what they want to use or invest in without manipulation?

If they believe in something, why not just work for it to make it prosper in a positive manner and stop manipulating other people’s perception against other projects to rise above them.

They don’t like the facts it is premined or working with the banks? They think the banks won’t use XRP once the Ripple software network will be implemented? I don’t. But that’s fine, I can understand all their fears and they are free to believe whatever they want in this free world. I also thought about it all before investing, but after all, nothing stops me to also invest in bitcoin if I want to, just for the cause or because I do believe in it’s future. But as long as banks exist why not invest in something they will probably use until Bitcoin changes everything as promised. I know, it’s all about principles. I’m such a whore!! If everybody could stick to their principles what a wonderful world we would be living in, right?

I try not to let too much emotions get in the way of my investments. I think Ripple and XRP hold an immense potential. I guess we all are in the crypto market for different reasons. I respect their dedication to the original Bitcoin idea, but it’s not given to everyone to blindly believe a changing narrative or approve something that’s openly intended to destroy a big part of the society without any global plan to save us from all the chaos it would create. But I guess they have a plan, right? This community can’t even get along together, what kind of a mess would it drive us all in if they actually do destroy banks.

Sometimes a little centralization and leadership helps get things done, you know.

All projects have their own strengths and flaws, but why not invest in more than one? Why all the hate?

Let’s put that in perspective, it’s a little like yelling at people in a burger king enjoying their burgers just because you decided to become vegan. Just because you believe in the virtues of vegetables and that you may be just right (or not), it doesn’t give you legitimacy to go out judging other people, even less in their own « community » if we relate this to social medias hate comments. If you like veggies that’s fine, I like ‘em too. Just stop the hate and FUD and pure lies. Preach for your solution if you really think it is better, other people can probably understand that too.

After all, if the Bitcoin concept is really the best solution to everything, why the need to spread lies and FUD to discredit others? Isn’t their own project strong enough, why the cheap shots at others? Won’t it take over the financial system all by itself if it’s so much better for humanity? Or is it just utopia being sold to the masses and they must perpetuate those lies to blind the few people they want to profit from, when they are ready to cash out? Just like any other Ponzi?

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not necessarily a big fan of banks, fractional reserve system, the FED, the creation of money out of thin air by private entities and the need to pay interest on it, the 1% and all the other inequities around the world. But I am realist and I sure understand the banks control just about everything and even if they are not perfect, they serve a purpose in this world. If you can’t beat them, join them. We all could just make some profits by playing their own games and do whatever we want with this money to actually make a real change around us (if what you REALLY want is to build a better world). 

I can’t wait for all the bitcoin millionaires to actually use their mountains of money to help humanity. Are they? Or are they just slowly becoming the new 1% they are so critical about? Aren’t the big miners, exchange owners, whales or day traders just the equivalent of the old system under a different name? Why can’t they see it too? What are they really fighting about?

I’m afraid the rabbit hole goes way deeper than some people think.

I’m not a big fan of Bitcoin, not because I don’t like the idea at it’s core. I do. I really, really, really like the idea of decentralization but I don’t even believe this is really what we are getting. I think it’s more like a mirage being sold to us. So this whole war they are waging is pointless. Like I mentioned above, it’s just different people in different positions of power who control the protocol and by extension the people investing in it. 

And I don’t want to be associated with a toxic anarchists community spreading lies and FUD around to discredit other projects or promote the destruction of the established order. I know it’s kind of romantic all this David vs Goliath thing, but be real... There exist institutions, laws and regulations for a reason in the real world. Corruption is the problem we should be fighting. Banks do serve a purpose in the grand scheme of things. If you want to buy a house, at least for now a bank can be really useful... I guess we will have a decentralized blockchain based lending system in the future but will you approve it if it’s a new kind of banking system profiting only a few people? Who will be able to lend money if not people already rich enough? Will it be fair enough for your principles if only people with money can make more money? So much questions I know... 

I just prefer putting my money behind a project that can navigate between the existing rules and regulations, collaborate with existing institutions instead of fighting the whole system.

It’s not a zero-sum game. There can be many projects coexisting and the Ripple’s interledger protocol is building bridges between each other’s cryptos and the real world banks. They also have a solid team with influential people, doing the PR job in the real world to help get the blockchain technology more mainstream or adopted. We should all be thankful for that. Stop the hate.

I don’t think Bitcoin is the solution to everything in it’s actual form. I think it is stuck in perpetual conflict within it’s own community to keep it evolving and this toxicity is spreading to other communities like cancer. Why don’t they just clear their own problems before going in other project’s communities to spread FUD? Their time and energy could actually serve a better purpose and the whole community would be thankful.

So... enough said. Sorry for the long post, but a few things had to be explained to put things back in perspective for some people. 

Wether it’s cypher punks, crypto anarchists (conscious of the big picture or not), or just speculators and market manipulators, a lot of people will continue to spread FUD on ripple’s back. Mostly because « ‘muh they work with the baaaanks!! ». To all the ripple supporters: Get used to it. While they are busy fighting reality and how this world works, we can just be part of the future internet of value. It’s fine, to each their own! When you understand the games being played, all this hypocrisy and shortsightedness becomes laughable.

What’s great is that one day, if all goes according to plan for Ripple and XRP, all of this won’t matter much. Their FUD attempts won’t have any effect on XRP when it will be used as intended at it’s full potential once the Ripple network is implemented everywhere. That’s the high risk gamble I am invested in: Real world widespread adoption. And yes, I believe it’s coming. The future is already here.

Trying to figure out the best strategy for my situation. Currently own a rental property in LA ($400 positive cash flow between mortgage and rent) but dealing with some high interest debt that is starting to accumulate more and more. The majority of the debt is split between a few accounts, totaling about $25k with an average interest rate of about 20%. Barely at break even overall cash flow each month making minimum payments, so taking out another personal loan (which would probably have over a 15% interest rate)  to pay this down would result in be definitely being in the red. My mortgage rate is 3.99%, so refinancing is out as I wouldn't be able to go any lower. Two options being thrown my way:

1. Sell the house (value has gone up about $60k since I purchased. Overall, after fees and capital gains tax, would probably pocket around $140k or so). Use the cash to rid my high interest debt, save/invest the rest. 

2. Cash out the equity. My cousin (who's a very very successful businessman with a ton of properties) is adamant that I shouldn't sell the home and instead cash out as much equity as I can on the house, pay down the high debt, then invest 100% of the rest in the market. He swears up and down housing prices, especially in LA, will never drop again and both home prices along with interest rates will only go up. Because it's a rental property and my equity loan options are limited (most banks only offer 75% of the home's value, which would basically give me nothing), my cousin is offering to take the 2nd mortgage with him. This might sound shady, but we're a close family, and he'd do this with a very fair rate. Again though, he's confident in the housing market and stock market and would want me to invest 100% of the equity left over after I pay down the 25k in debt. 

So......suggestions on the best approach? Keep the house and cash out equity vs sell?

I can borrow up to 400€ per month, and i can borrow for the previous months of the year. The interest rate for the loan is 4%, and with no other fees. I will have to start paying it back in four years time. 

Would you advise me to do so, or is it generally a stupid idea to invest with borrowed money? Even though its a long term investment?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"23, Single, looking to possibly use a personal loan to consolidate high interest credit cards and truck loan","Good morning to the world of reddit!

TL;DR: Should I consolidate my $8100 at 12% loan and my $3500 at 18 percent credit cards using a personal loan? If so what companies offer the best terms and customer service? 

Before I start I just want to say that I've already been told my debt isn't that bad but I'm tired of paying so much interest.

I currently have a 3 high interest accounts that I'm considering a loan to bring together and lower the rate

I have a truck loan with $8,100 left on it that is sitting at 12% interest

I also have two credit cards which have a total of $3500 and they both have an interest rate of 18%

Right now my credit fluctuates between 700 and 750 month to month according to credit karma.

Does it make sense to pull out a personal loan for the $12k and consolidate it all into one. Or should I just keep paying on each individual since the amounts are not very high?

Also what companies should I be looking into? A lot of them look shady and there are so many.

Any other information I need to provide I'm happy to do so, thank you for your guys help in advance

Bit of background I’m a 25 y.o married student in the suburbs of Chicago.  working part time online making about 12k a year. I have some substantial student loans (by time if graduation probably around 270k). My wife is also planning on entering school soon so the loan situation will likely get worse. 

Our monthly rent is about $1300 but we were planning on putting a down payment on a condo in the city (with some gift money from my wife’s parents) to avoid paying rent, we figure paying a monthly mortgage is cheaper and makes more sense. 

We have no CC debt, and only a $190 car lease/month with a year and a half left on it. 

That being said I’m set to receive a substantial inheritance over the next year  totaling between $200-$300k. What options do I have to avoid squandering this money? How Can I limit the tax I can pay on this?

Are their any options to invest this directly into a condo/house without considering it as “income”? Am I better off using this money for my student loans (with varying interest rates between 6-8%) Which I haven’t paid any off of yet since I’m still in school?  Or should I pay those with the money I make when I’m using my degree? 

Alternatively if my in laws were to give us a cash gift to use as a down payment can we pay this directly to the bank without registering it as income and being taxed on it?

personalfinance,My Rich Uncle Student Loan Balanced Increased During Reduced Payment Period. Advice?,"Hello PF, long-time lurker, first Reddit post ever. In 2008 I applied for a private student loan  with My Rich Uncle (MRU Holdings). After graduation the economy tanked, couldn’t find a job for a year, and filed for Ch. 7 bankruptcy in 2010 (life happened). My bankruptcy was discharged in 2011 (school loans not included) and finally found a job, but couldn’t afford the loan payment after a few months. In 2012 I applied for a reduced payment plan, which required a renewal every six months. For 5 years I made the reduced payment, but never paid attention to the fine print. Since then, MRU Holdings filed for bankruptcy and the loan is now owned by Younomics, but serviced by University Accounting Service (UAS).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I have a good career, making good money, and can afford the regular student loan payment ($800/m). When I didn’t renew the reduced payment, I finally noticed the balance increased by $25k. Reading the fine print, the payments made over the past 5 years did not apply to the balance of the loan at all. The reduced payments simply kept the loan status as “paying as agreed” and Younomics would not report it as defaulted. I don’t know if payments went to interest or principal and should of paid closer to attention to this loan. I haven’t contacted Younomics yet as I want to be well-informed on how I can approach this.
Hello, enter text here to see what your reddit post will look like.


&amp;nbsp;


Below you’ll find my loan information, an email from 2014 that states reduced payments will not go towards loan, payment language from the MPN.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lending Institution**: Younomics (formally My Rich Uncle)
&amp;nbsp;

**Loan Disbursement**: 8/15/2008
&amp;nbsp;

**Current Balance**: $80,212,55
&amp;nbsp;

**Original Loan Balance**: $44,000
&amp;nbsp;

####Breakdown####

**Current Principal**: $40,700
&amp;nbsp;

**Current Fees (Interest Bearing)**: $25,257.80
&amp;nbsp;

**Current Interest**: $14,254,75
&amp;nbsp;

**Current Interest Rate**: 11%

&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly Reduced Payment Email (2014)**
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This email confirms your request to temporarily reduce your monthly loan payments to $304.25 effective 02/04/2014 through to 08/04/2014. Your lowered payment amount will go into effect once your loan status has been changed. Please note that until your loan status is changed, you are still responsible for your normal monthly payment amount, and no payments you make will be applied towards your payment agreement.

**Payment Plan Language from MPN**
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Repayment Plan III: Following the Deferral Period, you must make monthly payments of Principal and Interest each month, with a minimum payment each month of at least $50.00, beginning on the due date determined by us, which shall continue for a period of twenty (20) years, or until you have paid all that you owe, whichever comes first. The beginning due date shall be not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days following the end of the Deferral Period. If you qualified for and obtained a loan under our medical school or dental school loan program, your period of repayment of Principal and Interest shall continue for a period of twenty-five (25) years, or until you have paid all that you owe, whichever comes first.


&amp;nbsp;


**So, my questions are as follows**:  
- Since MRU filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and assuming Younomics bought the loan for pennies on the dollar, would they consider discharging it at a reduced balance?  
- Is this legal loan practice? Reading the Master Promissory Note from MRU, I don’t see any language on reduced payments not applying to loan.  
- Should I request debt verification or MPN to see if Younomics still has it?  
- If they don’t help me out - what’s the process of defaulting on the loan? Would they come after me or garnish wages if I stop paying?  
&amp;nbsp;

Any advice will be greatly appreciated, so I can formulate a plan of attack.

Former Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice
Lecturer, Cybercrime and Financial Technologies, Stanford University
Current Member of the Board of Directors, Coinbase Global, Inc.1

BEFORE THE
United States Senate
Committee on the Judiciary
“Modernizing AML Laws To Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing”
PRESENTED at Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 226
November 28, 2017
10:00 am

1 The views expressed herein reflect my own personal views and not necessarily those of the
institutions with which I am affiliated.
2
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee, thank
you for inviting me to testify on the important topic of modernizing our laws to combat money
laundering and terrorist finance.
Until several months ago, I was a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ), a position I held for over a decade. Most of my time at DOJ was as an Assistant U.S.
Attorney in San Francisco, where I also served as the first Digital Currency Coordinator.
Previously I held senior roles at DOJ headquarters in the National Security Division and the
Attorney General’s office and was a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. I teach a
course on financial technologies and cryptocurrency at Stanford University, and recently joined
the Board of Directors of Coinbase Global, Inc., where I chair its Audit and Risk Committee. I
also advise technology companies and investment funds.
During my time as a DOJ prosecutor, I worked cases ranging from national security to
violent crimes to corporate and cybercrimes. I prosecuted RICO murders, organized crime,
outlaw motorcycle gangs, armed robbery crews, and prison gangs. But I also prosecuted
corrupt government officials, identity thieves, bank executives, and international
cybercriminals. Although these perpetrators were very different people, they all had one thing
in common: Money.
Money lay at the heart of every one of the criminal enterprises I just mentioned. And
really, most criminal activity is motivated by money. Money laundering, of course, is the
process of disguising criminal proceeds and integrating them into the legitimate financial
system. It simultaneously conceals criminals’ ongoing affairs and taints the integrity of the
financial system.
The World Bank and IMF estimate that every year between $2.17 and $3.61 trillion U.S.
dollars are laundered. Criminals are willing to test out new methods of laundering and are early
adopters of new technologies. Because of this our AML laws must also evolve, especially given
the increased use of the global financial system by money launderers, terrorist financers, drug
traffickers, transnational organized criminals, and cybercriminals to place their financial
transactions out of reach.

This morning I would like to address two sections in the proposed bill that I believe
would have the greatest effect in the largest number of cases: (1) the ability of U.S. law
enforcement to obtain foreign bank records under Section 15; and (2) Section 18’s
criminalization of the concealment or provision of false information to a financial institution
concerning account and asset ownership. Although time constraints prevent me from
addressing all twenty sections, I have encountered issues that other sections of the bill address
and of course welcome your questions. 
3
SECTION 15
The banking system has become significantly more globalized over the past few
decades. And today’s criminals make extensive use of this global financial system to channel
funds across borders for cybercrime, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking, public
corruption, white collar, tax evasion, and many other crimes. But law enforcement’s powers
have not kept pace with this globalization, and its ability to investigate the transnational
movement of money in furtherance of illicit activities is hampered as more and more records
reside with foreign banks.
Section 15 makes clear U.S. law enforcement can obtain foreign banking records when
they are investigating a U.S. crime and where the subject bank has a presence in the U.S. Law
enforcement’s ability to timely gain access to records in such circumstances is critical because
following the money is a key piece of evidence in solving nearly any crime and because money
can quickly be moved. These bank records contain transactions, of course, but they are much
more than that: they show relationships between co-conspirators and they show what legal
entities are being used as the vehicles of criminal activity.
In theory, under existing law the government can issue grand jury subpoenas to obtain
foreign bank records where the bank has (1) a U.S. branch; or (2) a correspondent account with
a U.S. bank. See, e.g. 18 U.S.C. Section 5318; In re Grand Jury Proceedings Bank of Nova Scotia,
740 F.2d 817 (11th Cir. 1984). In practice, however, this does not happen. Because such
subpoenas may in a handful of cases adversely affect relationships with other countries, current
DOJ policy has curbed its own authority and prohibits prosecutors from using so-called Bank of
Nova Scotia subpoenas unless DOJ’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) has approved their use.
And OIA rarely, if ever, approves their use, viewing them as a “last-resort” option where
cooperation with a foreign government is not feasible, a conclusion that can take years to reach
-- while the records often become obsolete in the meantime.
Under DOJ policy, to access such records law enforcement must instead rely on Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) with foreign countries. The terms of such agreements vary,
but generally allow U.S. law enforcement to request assistance from the foreign jurisdiction to
obtain evidence. OIA oversees the MLAT request process for the U.S.
In practice, the antiquated MLAT process takes months and even years of bureaucratic
maneuvering, even in the best-case scenario with cooperative partners on the other side eager
to help each other. When we are dealing with an uncooperative country or one that has data
protection or secrecy laws, we may not get any evidence at all. In less than two minutes, a
money launderer with a smartphone can move illicit proceeds halfway across the world. But
for the government, it might take months or even years to obtain evidence of the money flows,
if ever. And by then it may be too late. Criminal proceeds are liquidated or moved to new
accounts in other jurisdictions, and evidence of associations between individuals and
companies become stale. 
4
Although these delays get chalked up to working with foreign governments, part of the
problem is a self-inflicted wound: it lies in the way DOJ processes MLATs, a process designed
long before so much evidence had gone both digital and global. This is illustrated by examples
in cases I prosecuted. In one high-profile public corruption investigation, a foreign entity was
ready to hand over evidence that included financial records to our investigative team. We
needed those records to proceed further in the investigation. The FBI had a local attaché and a
friendly relationship with local law enforcement, and we had a third-party custodian willing to
voluntarily disclose records. But a highly bureaucratic process nonetheless ensued.
I drafted a memo and MLAT request to OIA. It was assigned to the OIA representative in
Washington responsible for that country for review and some time later I received stylistic
comments. After incorporating those, I had to send it back to Washington for several more
layers of OIA supervisory review. This led to more comments requiring incorporation. This
back and forth alone took weeks if not months. We assumed after this our MLAT was physically
with our foreign counterparts who were eager to share records that were material to our
investigation. Instead some time later OIA sent us a form to complete concerning which DOJ
component was going to pay for the MLAT translation, meaning that it had not even left DOJ.
Being a government contract, not just any translator can perform this task and if “expedited”
translation of 30 days or less is desired, one must write an additional justification memo
requiring its own layers of bureaucratic approval. The bottom line is that by the time we got
our evidence it was approximately six months later, and this was in a case where there was no
dispute with the foreign government over the provision of records.2
 With a subpoena, records
like that could be obtained within weeks instead of months or years.
In another case against a major cybercrime ring, many months elapsed from the time
we drafted MLATs seeking international bank records to the time the MLATs were actually sent
to several receptive jurisdictions. Yet the time it took to get the records back from those
jurisdictions was much shorter. Had we not experienced months of needless delay, we may
have been able to put the case together sooner, apprehending these individuals before they
committed further crimes and depleted some of the subject bank accounts. And in a highprofile
money laundering case to a friendly European jurisdiction, a fellow prosecutor’s MLAT
request seeking records sat within DOJ for over a year.
Unfortunately, these examples are not outliers. These are actually the good news
stories where records were eventually obtained and we were able to bring charges. And these
were in cases DOJ considered high profile. Imagine a case involving more routine transnational
criminal conduct, where there is no attaché to help shepherd the MLAT through, or worse still,
the host country is not receptive or has no MLAT treaty. In such cases, records may never be
obtained at all. In one well known international organized crime case prosecutors lost the
ability to bring certain charges because the MLAT took too long. In other cases, bank accounts

2 Although this statistic is anecdotal, a senior DOJ official told me that there was a backlog of
approximately 13,000 MLAT requests at the time this particular MLAT request was pending. 
5
were emptied before records requested via MLAT were produced. Prosecutors are conditioned
to expect a basic MLAT in a friendly jurisdiction to take many months, and years in a nonfriendly
jurisdiction, a fact that deters some from investigating cases that will require them in
the first place.
What causes the delays? First, there were too many layers of bureaucratic review in
every case.3
 Second, those responsible for making decisions about the collection of overseas
evidence are not part of the team responsible for the case, yet they are making decisions
essential to the case. Add to this that OIA is responsible not only for outgoing MLATs from U.S.
law enforcement, but also for incoming MLATs from foreign law enforcement.4
 Third, there is
no tracking system to show where or with whom the MLAT resides at any given point. DOJ has
acknowledged it lacks any means of monitoring MLATs, including transparency for monitoring
“the progress of each request at each iterative step,” and there is no system for MLAT partners
to monitor the status of requests. See DOJ, Criminal Division FY 2016, President’s Budget at 22-
25. Although addressing these factors would certainly not mean evidence would be obtained
from foreign authorities overnight, it would go a long way toward expediting the process and in
fast-moving investigations every day can count. I need to stress here that the problem is with
the OIA process and not the personnel.
And the problem is not confined to cybercrime investigations; it impacts cases involving
trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and people; fraud; terrorist finance; public corruption; and
really any crime that involves the movement of money. It arose in the investigation into the
Russian election probe: it was widely reported that Mueller’s team subpoenaed foreign bank
records in the case against Paul Manafort. If Mueller’s team had gone through the process
described above instead of subpoenaed the banks directly, would the evidence have been
timely obtained? By not using Bank of Nova Scotia to full effect and requiring its own internal
bureaucracy, U.S. law enforcement is tying one hand behind its back in the fight against global
money laundering.

Reaffirming law enforcement’s authority to obtain records directly from a foreign bank’s
U.S. branch or correspondent bank could bring about a much-needed change in investigations,
because it would allow U.S. law enforcement to more quickly and effectively track movement
of funds without going through the cumbersome process described above. The question arises

3
It may be that some complicated requests merit more review, particularly where the vagaries
of foreign law require it, but the routine requests appear to needlessly go through much the
same bureaucratic and time-consuming review process.
4 Many foreign law enforcement partners prioritize U.S. MLAT requests given that our foreign
counterparts rely heavily on evidence stored in the U.S. for their own cases (from Google,
Facebook, Twitter, Apple, etc.) and hope that prioritizing U.S. requests will expedite their own
requests. However, the flip side of this is when our own bureaucracy delays the processing of
incoming MLAT requests from other countries, those jurisdictions may “penalize” the U.S. by
holding back evidence our MLATs seek.
6
as to where a foreign bank operates in jurisdictions with strict data privacy or bank secrecy
laws. Such scenarios pose complex conflict of laws questions. But federal courts have
reasoned where commercial transactions are international, conflicts are inevitable and U.S.
criminal investigations cannot be thwarted whenever there is a potential conflict. See, e.g.
Nova Scotia, supra. Other courts have reasoned that banks electing to do business in numerous
foreign host countries have accepted the risk of inconsistent government actions, and that if a
bank cannot “serve two masters and comply with the lawful requirements of [both countries],
perhaps it should surrender to one sovereign or the other the privileges received therefrom.”
See, e.g., First National City Bank of New York v. IRS, 271 F.2d 616, 620 (2d Cir. 1959).
Passing Section 15 provides DOJ an opportunity to revisit its existing policy, and makes
clear to the Executive and Judicial branches that Congress has considered the potential for
conflicts and has resolved that in favor of law enforcement’s ability to timely gather critical
evidence. DOJ could extend its existing policy such that OIA approval would still be required for
foreign bank subpoenas, thereby rendering Section 15 toothless.5
 To account for that
possibility, the Committee may wish to include language requiring an annual report from DOJ
concerning (1) the number of requests from law enforcement for foreign bank subpoenas; (2)
the number granted; (3) the timeframe in which requests were resolved from the date first
received; and (4) whether any categories exist for which OIA could grant ex ante blanket
approval for foreign bank subpoenas, e.g., if law enforcement certified they believed absent the
records funds were in danger of moving before an MLAT could be completed, whether certain
banks or countries could be whitelisted, etc.
And regardless of Section 15 and its implementation, the MLAT process must be
modernized and streamlined if law enforcement is to keep up with the those committing illegal
acts. The Committee may therefore wish to request DOJ report on ways to modernize the
MLAT process. Such a report may include the feasibility of an MLAT tracking system, in the
same way that several other criminal matters are tracked within DOJ and in the same way that
the Treasury Department tracks similar requests for international assistance; measuring what
priority is being given to outgoing MLATs versus incoming MLATs; and providing statistics on
the number of MLAT requests received, the time until fulfillment, etc.
A word on authentication. The provision requires foreign banks to produce certified
records in response to the subpoena. At the investigative stage, financial records in any form
are critical. Certified copies may become important if a case goes to trial, but given that over
90% of federal cases settle and most defendants waive Speedy Trial Act requirements, I view
this provision as helpful though far less important than getting the records in some form in the
first place.

5 Unfortunately the process for requesting OIA approval to subpoena foreign banks is similar to
the MLAT process, and is subject to its own set of delays. Many prosecutors believe that
requesting approval for a foreign bank subpoena is as long and cumbersome as a formal MLAT
request.

SECTION 18
Although to many, global money laundering conjures up images of offshore Cayman
Islands accounts or secret Swiss bank vaults, the fact is that the U.S. is one of the easiest places
in the world to launder money. According to our Treasury Department, a staggering $300
billion is laundered in the U.S. every year. Our laws regarding shell and shelf companies and
beneficial ownership of accounts are one reason why.
Although there is nothing illegal about setting up shell companies – many do so to
appropriately protect privacy and limit liability – plenty of others do so to conceal criminal
activity and hide money. Fraudsters, cartels, terrorists, and corrupt officials do not want to
keep stolen assets in their own names. They therefore create a company, or series of
companies (including nested shell companies, or shells within shells), which can do all of the
things they otherwise could have with their criminally-gotten proceeds: buy property, open
bank accounts, and transfer money. In the U.S. and elsewhere it is easy and legal to create
what are essentially anonymous companies. Lawyers, accountants, and other professionals
derive substantial income from providing these services. And while shells are easy to set up,
they make it difficult for investigators to link money with perpetrators.
The 2016 Panama Papers brought mainstream attention to the problem of concealing
true beneficial owners of accounts. That leak revealed that a Panamanian law firm set up or
managed offshore companies and hard-to-trace corporate structures for world leaders, drug
kingpins, American fraudsters, and others. And 60 Minutes shed light on the role that U.S.
lawyers play in helping criminals devise structures to launder money: An undercover
investigator purporting to be an advisor to a West African minister met with lawyers from over
a dozen New York law firms. He told them a story intentionally devised to raise red flags and
lead them to believe he wanted to move tens of millions of dollars in payments from foreign
companies (obtained using his official position in exchange for mineral rights) into U.S. real
estate, a jet, and a yacht. Only 1 of 16 said no; most offered guidance on how it could be
accomplished legally.
Parking money in accounts whose ownership is concealed has collateral consequences.
It has been cited as fueling increased housing prices in cities like London, Miami, New York,
Paris, Vancouver, and San Francisco, as western real estate holdings are a desired investment
for dirty money. In fact, it was reported that in 2015 90% of new construction sales in Miami
were in cash, a red flag for money laundering.
6
 And according to the U.K.’s National Crime
Agency, laundered money has skewed the London property market with overseas criminals

Boom,” April 3, 2016 at http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estatenews/article69248462.html.

sequestering funds there and driving real estate prices up 50% in less than a decade.

To help combat the problem, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network last year announced the “Customer Due Diligence” beneficial ownership rule (CDD)
which requires financial institutions to gather details about the individual(s) who actually owns
or controls, directly or indirectly, an account held in the name of a legal entity like an LLC. The
CDD will come into effect next May and is an important first step in the fight against
international money laundering. But nothing in the CDD rule prevents individuals from simply
lying about ownership to financial institutions, and financial institutions can rely upon customer
representations. Section 18 would give the CDD teeth by making it a crime to provide false
information to financial institutions concerning ownership or control of an account.
Many laypeople assume that is already a crime, but that is not always the case. For
example, in 2012 we were investigating a group committing large scale mortgage fraud in
California, a scheme that caused tens of millions of dollars in losses. The ringleader had bank
accounts established in an acquaintance’s name and paid the acquaintance, but the two agreed
it was the defendant who would actually own the accounts. The defendant used this nominee
account to facilitate his scheme, depositing mortgage fraud proceeds into it. We wanted to
charge the defendant (or acquaintance) with lying to the bank about the account’s true owner
but realized this on its own was not a crime.8 Prosecutors frequently see shell companies and
corresponding financial accounts created to park foreign funds from overseas criminal activity,
including from Russia and China. A group of Russian cybercriminals I prosecuted made
extensive use of nominee accounts in the U.S. and Europe, yet we lacked charges to prosecute
those who established the accounts. And a pair of corrupt federal agents on the Silk Road task
force I prosecuted made use of shell companies and nominee accounts to conceal proceeds
from their illegal activity. One of my former colleagues had a defendant whose sole occupation
was to create shell companies, provide false identification documents as account holders, and
move tens of millions of dollars across borders in furtherance of criminal activity.

Confronted with facts like these some prosecutors have gotten creative and charged
such conduct as a violation of the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1344. However, an
element of that offense is that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution – in other
words the financial institution was the victim. But in many cases where someone falsifies
information concerning financial account ownership for criminal activity, the financial
institution is not the intended victim of the fraud; it may not lose any money and in some
instances, may even benefit from the additional business.

See Financial Times, “How Laundered Money Shapes London’s Property Market,” April 6, 2016
at https://www.ft.com/content/f454e3ec-fc02-11e5-b5f5-070dca6d0a0d.

8 Because many of the mortgage lenders had gone out of business in the mortgage crisis, the
records to charge mortgage fraud were not available to us for all transactions. 
9
Thus, federal courts have split on whether it is permissible to charge a case of bank
fraud where the financial institution was not the intended victim. Some courts of appeals have
held that the financial institution itself must be the targeted victim for a bank fraud violation.
See, e.g. United States v. Thomas, 315 F.3d 190, 197 (3rd Cir. 2002) (“the sine qua non of a bank
fraud violation…is the intent to defraud the bank.”) (emphasis added); United States v.
Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900, 905-06 (2nd Cir. 1998); United States v. Rodriguez, 140 F.3d 163, 167
(2nd Cir. 1988) (schemes merely involving bank not crimes unless specific intent to victimize
bank itself causing it to release property). Other courts have read the bank fraud statute more
broadly, holding that deceiving a bank alone is sufficient and no intent to victimize the bank is
required. See, e.g., United States v. McNeil, 320 F.3d 1034, 1037 (9th Cir. 2003) (requiring only
that bank is in some way involved in the defendant’s scheme); United States v. Kenrick, 221
F.3d 19, 26-29 (1st Cir. 2000). This split of authority means that whether such conduct is a
crime under the bank fraud statute depends on what area of the country one is in.
I am aware of investigations where prosecutors struggle to find a statute to charge
instances involving concealed beneficial ownership. They may be able to deploy other statutes
to fit the conduct, they may not. But there is currently no clean, straightforward statute to
charge this conduct. Section 18 would provide that. Criminal penalties could deter individuals,
and importantly their agents, from lying about the ultimate owners of accounts. At the same
time, it would ease the burden on financial institutions by putting part of the “know your
customer” onus on the customer, who could be liable if they concealed, falsified, or
misrepresented. Given how useful it is for criminals to have financial accounts that are
seemingly unconnected to them, I view this feature of the legislation as an important next step
in the fight against global money laundering.
Thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts on these important issues.

dogecoin,Dogecoin will be the new Tether in 2018,"Tether, as we all know, is super sketchy as a peg to USD. You can view how many new ""Tethers"" are minted here (http://omnichest.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL) but you can't actually verify how many are held by the company. 45M new tether minted in the last 6 hours?
 I'm taking that on blind faith? What a bunch of BS of a monetary policy. Plus, what about the costs of operating the company. Anyway, tether is super sketchy and one day there will be a bank run.

Here comes Dogecoin. With incredible reach to all the major exchanges, super fast confirmation times, a protected network with good mining, and incredible potential for liquidity Dogecoin will become the new de-facto trading pair when Tether implodes. 

This has a couple of implications:

1) Dogecoin is undervalued presently

2) Dogecoin liquidity is going to increase dramatically

3) Dogecoin is based on trusted code, with trusted owners, and no pre-mine shenanigans.

4) Dogecoin is the original non-segwit bitcoin. In a way, it is the true bitcoin. (Okay, obligatory mention, this is not entirely serious but if b-cash can say that why can't we).

5) 1doge=1doge. This stability is what makes a coin a good base pair for others.

6) There is even more potential for Dogecoin to grow in adoption in the US. Right now it is somewhat difficult for people to collect Dogecoin. However, when Coinbase adds Dogecoin in the future (here is how they evaluate new coins to add: https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf) Dogecoin will be finally easy for people in the US to purchase (yes I know, bittrex has it... but bittrex is not Coinbase).

Should I:

A.) Try to refinance the higher interest rate loans through sofi or someone else, while gradually making bigger payments on those?

B.) Consolidate all of her federal loans to an interest rate of about 5.9% and try to get her to qualify for PSLF? She seems content that she will continue to work as a nurse for the next 10 years for at least 30 hours a week.

C.)Refinance all of her loans except for the Chase loan through Sofi and just gradually make lump sum payments. (I.E. $2,000+ a month)

In addition to this, I am thinking about filing for my taxes ""married but filing separately"". I make about 135k a year and her about 60k a year, I know that by filing jointly she may not be eligible for PSLF.

I am a 24yr old guy, I've spent 3 years with the same company. Today, Corporate came to celebrate the closing of a project I've been working on since January. I've been the project lead since the beginning doing everything including invoicing, (We've profited over 3 mil from it). Well, after congratulating the team on the close, I was laid off from my Archival and Information Management Specialist Position. I've been working on salary at over 60 to 70 hours a week, but only getting paid for 40, I've also had a second part time job to help with the bills as my partner does not work.


On the plus side, all my software and work equipment is owned by me so I have around 8k in computers and software which I've spent all morning packing up and clearing out. The downside, all my subscription fees are due at the end of December. The city I live in has several other companies that do similar work; however, technically I have a letter saying that I can be sued if I use my ""trade secrets"" at a different company. 


**INCOME / DEBT:**

I made $32K a year salaried.

My current Income is around 1200 a month from my second job, but this can vary as I am on call and sometimes only make around 600 a month. (Which with November is the latter amount), I also do not get any benefits from this job.

I haven't filed for unemployment yet, as I have never had to before and I'm still working on how to get it.

I also have almost $60K in student loan debt, about $3K owed on my truck, and $1K in credit card debt. (I only have 2 credit cards tho, both of which only have a $1k limit each.)


**SAVINGS:**

I have $3K in a 401k with the company and another $4k in my HSA Account.

My checking account currently has $1300 ish in it, but all my bills are due on December 1st. 


**ASSETS:**

I have a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid I bought in October of last year for $5800, with 43000 miles on it, but now it has almost 97000 miles.

I also own several firearms that have been passed down by family over the years. All but 3 are kept at my parents house 500 miles away.

**MONTHLY EXPENSES: (~$2,889)**

* Rent: $811

* Renters Insurance: $58

* Power: ~$180

* Gas: ~$20

* Cell Phone: $130 - (Two of us on Plan)

* City utilities (trash, sewage, water): ~$50

* Internet: ~$60

* Truck Payment: $358

* Medication: ~$25 - (I take antidepressants for my Major Depressive Disorder)

* Food: ~$150 - (Feeding two of us, we do pretty well)

* Student Loans: $867 - (I have 12 different loans I pay on, 5 of which are federal)

* Gas: ~$100 - (My truck uses around $30 a month since I run electric most of the time)

* Misc: $80 *(We have a dog so this depends on how his food is doing).




This doesn't include medical coverage. I do not think on my own I could afford to pay for insurance since most plans I've checked in the past where over $400 for two of us.

personalfinance,"Unable to Save Any Money, Working 60 Hour Weeks","Hey Reddit, I’m tired of stressing over money and it doesn’t always bother me but I have spurts of wanting to get out of it quickly. 

Currently I’m bringing in about ~$2400 a month. I’ve been tracking my spending for a couple months and this past month I’ve tried really hard to cut down on things I don’t need. (ex. October I spent $655 on Groceries ($400) and Take out ($255) and November I spent only $320 combined (G $272, T/O $48). 

Rent is $685, between insurance and car payments that’s $400. Between paying above min. Payments on CC’s and Loans it’s around $300 and gas $150. 

Overall my spending is around $2500. I’ve been putting $50 into a savings account for the past couple months but to avoid a hit of $500 interest I had to pay $2000 (which drained it all, so I started all over) on a CC. 

Are there anything’s I can do to spend less? Or more efficiently pay off bills? Or lower them?

Rent can’t change as I’m unable to move (mostly just don’t want to, couple reasons why)

Currently making $12.50/hr for ~50-65 hours a week (excluding winter months, drops to 40, then layoff making $750 per 2 weeks)

Starting January 2018 I’ll be up to at least $14/hr with the minimum wage increase, hoping for $15 or so. 

Should I be looking for a new job? Can I lower payments? Should I pay off the highest interest rates which would take longer? Or would the self accomplishment of paying lower loans help more.

personalfinance,(CAN) Pay off mortgage or invest?,"Nearly 2 years ago my girlfriend and I bought a house together. We've been paying down the mortgage very aggressively. Various 'bank people' have mentioned that this is a bad idea and that we should be investing that money instead. I understand their reasoning, but I'm not really convinced.

&amp;nbsp;

As a personal matter, I hate having the debt. 

While growth numbers of investment accounts look good, I'm sure they're only showing me the portfolios that have been successful. 

It doesn't make sense to me that they'd loan me money at 2.45% if it could be safely invested for a better return elsewhere. I realise *safe* is the key word there, but if they think the 2.45% they make off their investment in me is a good investment, with all of their resources, why would I gamble I could make a better one?

&amp;nbsp;

Investments seems like a substantial risk with very little likelihood I'll do significantly better than the 2.45% I'm effectively borrowing the money for them at. Am I wrong? Am I leaving money on the table? 

&amp;nbsp;

**Details:**

I'm 29, we have no other debts, no kids, and no intention of having any

We put 80k down, borrowed 200k.

We took a 10 year mortgage, interest rate is fixed at 2.45% for 5 years

We put a 30k lump sum payment on at the end of the first year, can do the same this year, and intend on doing the same until it is paid off completely (this can be done yearly with no penalty).

My current company is fairly volatile (3 name changes in 2 years, among other things). It's not likely, but it is possible, that they could go under/I could be laid off. I would continue to collect 60% of my salary through employment insurance for a year. This would cover bills comfortably but would force me to cut luxuries and the lump sum mortgage payment.

personalfinance,"BF with student loans wants to move into new apartment, not sure if fiscally responsible","So my boyfriend graduated from college this past May and is in a relatively HCOL* area. Previously, he found a room in a house, all-inclusive of utilities, etc. for $750/month. However, after his 6 month lease is up, he wants to move into his own 1 bedroom apartment for $1037/month


His roommates/landlord in his current location are admittedly pretty awful- playing loud music/having guests over at all hours and maintaining stringent rules. Its obvious that they are not a good fit, so moving out is non-negotiable at this point. He planned on moving in with a friend, but the friend ducked out at the last minute. He has his heart set on finally living alone, after spending the past 5 years living with roomies. The only stickler is that he has a ton of student loans (around $70,000), so he is not sure if he can afford to. He is fiscally responsible, and is paying the minimums on all except towards highest interest rate. 



Here are his cost breakdowns:


Income post-tax and post-401k: $1700 (bi-weekly) [~3400 (month)]

Student Loan Payments: $1500 (per month)

New Rent: $1037/month

Electricity: $50/month (estimated)

Internet: $50/month (estimated)

Water: $14/month (locked-in rate)

Car Insurance: $110/month 

Savings: $120/paycheck (~240 month)

Gas (Car): $50/month



Luckily, he does not have a car payment and his family supports his phone payment on a family-plan. He has a savings account with about $4k in it and is contributing 8% of his income (up to match) for retirement in a 401k. 


This leaves him $349/month leftover for everything else: like his food, entertainment, traveling to see me (I live a few hours away, darn-it!), etc.

I am just finishing up my Master's and I still have a bit above my savings/emergency fund ($8500, more than I need with some parental support if I lose my job). Hoping PF would be able to help with this decision upcoming. Long story short I left my program early to start working (salary-40k in nonprofits) and am still finishing the Masters, and starting paying down some of my student loans which total about $27,000 and 1,300 in interest. My expenses are pretty minimal other than $680 rent and utilities, and probably my biggest expense is $150-250 or so with the girlfriend (varies). I budget about $650 per month to pay towards the loans. 

I'm willing to spend $1300 towards interest and/or principal as an Xmas present to myself but unsure where to place it. 

My question: Is it better to pay off the interest on my loans so it does not capitalize while I'm in deferment? Or pay the lowest principal remaining, which I knocked down to about 738.00 (6.8% unsubsidized). The remaining interest breaks down like so: 

(All 8 are federal). 
$499.95 on 6.8 unsub on $2411.72 loan///// 
$32.76 on 6.8 unsub on 2472.73 loan/////
2.88 on 6.8 unsub loan of 738.00 loan////


$124.63 on 6.8 direct sub loan of 3439.95///
$150.57 on 3.4 direct loan of 5500////

153.17 on 3.4 direct sub loan of $5,594.24////
244.52 on 3.86 direct sub loan of $2,078.67///
$174.29 on 3.86 direct sub loan of $5,606.99

Note: I tried to enter repayment a few months ago, so my loans have capitalized in the past three months (my bad decision, and also my loan company being jerks), so I'd like to avoid at least some of that capitalization (my grad school essentially sent enrollment notice back to my loan company, sending me back to deferment :(. I'm just unsure what is best in the long term. I'm sorry I have been having trouble with the unbury calculators and whatnot. The next capitalization won't occur until my Graduation (Dec.18 2017 or so).

400k mortgage at 3.75%, monthly payment with taxes and insurance: $2282

As far as investments, I have 80k in 401k/IRA and 20k in taxable investments (standard index funds with Vanguard). He has closer to 135k, in a mix of retirement funds and taxable investments. We just got  our house reappraised to get rid of PMI after completely remodeling it ourselves and it has 250k of equity in it. (!!) We love where we live, and have no intention of moving from the house if possible.

Our monthly expenses outside of the mortgage are $1600, bringing our monthly spending to right around $4k all in. 

So here's my question: would it make sense, after maxxing out our tax advantaged accounts for the year, to put all of my earnings in an investment account with the intention of paying down our mortgage in a lump sum once we decide to have kids? Then we would recast the loan ($100 fee), keep our low interest rate, and reduce our monthly expenses. Ideally in that time we would get used to living off of his income (after maxing out tax advantaged accounts). Does this make sense? Say I'm able to save up 300k before we have kids, if I pay down our mortgage to roughly 85k then our monthly expenses are drastically reduced.

Otherwise I'd have 300k of which I could pull say 12k out every year, effectively reducing our expenses to 3k a month.

What would you guys recommend? Any other ideas?

One other note is if I take the time out of my field, it would be difficult to make the same income with a 3-5 year gap in work.

Oh also our number to fully be FI is $2mil, we have quite a ways to go. :/

personalfinance,Understanding Rental Income?,"Hey there Personal Finance folks. Long time reader but a rare poster! I'm a huge fan of the subreddit and have used it to make a number of financial decisions in the past.

I have a bit of a complicated situation and was wondering if anyone could help me sort out the nuts and bolts. 

For a number of reasons it has become necessary for me the purchase the home my father is living in and rent it back to her. I'm going to pay 550,000 for the home, and then rent it to her at 3400 USD a month. I'm going to borrow 475,000 (not because I have to, but because I can). I've calculated my mortgage at 2268 per month. I've calculated property tax to be around 500 USD a month.

What I don't understand is how to calculate what my break even is on this property.
1) This is the only property I will own. Can I still deduct the interest rate from my income taxes even though it's actually a rental?
2) At what rate is rental come taxed at?
3) After all deductions and paid taxes... How do I calculate my monthly outflow?

Does anyone know if there is a spreadsheet that can help me figure all of this out?

Thanks in advance for your help!",finance

A quick copypasta from the article itself since I'm sure most of you will see ""&gt;200+ pages"" and refuse to read it because being informed on things you think are important is less important than screeching along with a bandwagon that isn't entirely true.

What The Declaratory Ruling Will Do:
&gt;Restore the classification of broadband Internet access service as an “information service” —the classification affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Brand X case. 


&gt;Reinstate the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband Internet access service.


&gt;Clarify the effects of the return to an information service classification on other regulatory frameworks, including the need for a uniform federal regulatory approach to apply to interstate information services like broadband Internet access service

What The Report And Order Will Do:
&gt;Adopt transparency requirements that ISPs disclose information about their practices to consumers, entrepreneurs, and the Commission. 


&gt;Restore the Federal Trade Commission’s ability to protect consumers online from any unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices without burdensome regulations, achieving comparable benefits at lower cost.


&gt;Eliminate the vague and expansive Internet Conduct Standard under which the FCC micromanaged innovative business models, along with the bright-line rules.

What The Order Will Do:
&gt;Find that the public interest is not served by adding to the already-voluminous record in this proceeding additional materials, including confidential materials submitted in other proceedings.

So TL;DR of the TL;DR:
**ORDER IS CHANGING CONTROL OF INTERNET FROM FCC TO FTC. MEANING COMCAST AND OTHER TELECOM COMPANIES ARE NOW GOING TO BE UNDER A MORE WATCHFUL EYE AND LESS ABLE TO DICK PEOPLE OVER WITHOUT GETTING BITCH SLAPPED WITH A BIG ASS FINE. LITERALLY JUST GOING BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE 2015. CALM THE FUCK DOWN.**

personalfinance,26 years old. Student loans vs retirement strategizing/planning help!,"Hello everyone! I’m looking for advice on how to use my expendable income after all my bills are paid (student loans vs 401k vs short-term savings). My major short-term savings goals (&lt; 3 years) are saving for a wedding and a house.

I am 26 years old making $105,000 USD (salary). I also have a per diem job. My take home after taxes approximately $7,000 a month. 

My company does NOT do a 401k match until I've been with them for 6 years.

MONTHLY EXPENSES
0 rent (live with fiance’s family)
2000 student loans ($1850 minimum on 160k in loans for a 10-year payment plan. Average interest rate 6.5%)
1600 wedding payment plan
100 cell phone
100 groceries
380 car (lease+insurance)
75 gas
This equals 4,255 per month

Any of my extra money has been sitting in my checkings/savings or contributing towards my loans.

I have no credit card debt. I have already saved an emergency fund of approx. 10k.

My fiance (90k salary) also has approximately $140,000 of student loans with a similar interest rate as I do.

I hope to have saved 20% to avoid paying PMI down the road whenever it is I buy a house (maybe 3 years?) I live in a high COL area and will likely need approximately $100k to put down 20% on a somewhat decent home. I'm looking for advice on what to do with me and my fiance's income. 

While I feel fortunate to have the income I do, my student loans take up approximately 30% of my monthly income depending on the month. The above expenses do not include any “fun” money, such as vacations or gifts or dinners, etc.

Would it be wiser to attempt to max out my 401k now or tackle my student loans and try to get them paid as quickly as possible? Or do a bit of both and do some sort of hybrid game plan? I’m having trouble figuring out the best strategy in being able to save for the short-term all while paying my bills and planning for my future.

personalfinance,I am 23 with $36.5k in Student Loans and just started my first job. I need some help figuring how much I can afford to put down on those loans in addition to high interest credit card debt.,"Hey guys, what's up! Let's get right down to it.

I just started my first job out of college in October making $60,000 a year. Today, I took a look at the loans I would have to pay off and found that student loans really *are* insane. I need some help figuring out how to budget with this new payment every month and how to knock them out as quick as possible given my current monthly payments (utilities, car payment, groceries, etc.). I am going to provide a table detailing my student loans and a look at my current budget to figure out how I could fit in these student loans and pay as much as possible, as well as targeting certain loans. I'm not sure if some are better to target first over others.

Bitcoin,Another question from a beginner,"Forgive me if this question doesn't make complete sense. I am new to this subreddit, and just trying to learn as much as possible about all the risks of bitcoin before I make my first purchase.

I keep reading about how bitcoin will turn the banking and finance industry on its head by eliminating the need for big banks and federal governments controlling our money.  I definitely see the potential for that to happen, which is why I am here, but I assume that government and the banks would want to keep this power, as it is one of the most influential elements to society. So what is stopping the US government, or any other developed government, from saying they will no longer exchange bitcoin for the USD(EUR,etc.)?  Much of wall street is intertwined in US Gov't, and vice versa, so do you think it is possible that this could happen? The shift of power from these institutions to bitcoin holders seems like it may be so great, that I feel like those currently in power would go to great lengths to hang on to that power.  If this event was to happen, how do you think it would effect the future of bitcoin?

personalfinance,Tax bill slapped me upside the head. Looking for realistic options.,"Hi everyone,

Freaking out a little bit, but I will try to be brief.  In short, I ran a business that was basically my life for the last 9 years.  I sold it in Dec of 2016 (tried to push it to Jan but no luck).  Between the last years income, and the sale of the business, I was hit with my personal tax bill today.  469,000 Fed.  181,000-CA.  I already paid 24,000 in corp tax.

Now of course you are thinking....well.....that means you must have quite  a bit of money right?   Well no.  I did zero tax planning, and relied on my controller and tax professionals, who really let me down (didn't even make quarterly payments this year for the first time in a decade).

I take responsibility for this, and need to take control.  But this is a massive number.  I am not currently employed, and have maybe 50K in cash.  We do own an investment property outright, and some other private investments that are fairly high risk, but should pan out in a few years or more (including a 7 year RE mutual fund).  

So I suppose what I am asking is for any advise on how to try to mitigate some of this tax burden after the fact.  We have always played 100% by the rules, paid more than our fair share, and this number is just daunting.   I don't know if i should be starting to think about moving things out of my name and declaring bankruptcy, or  moving assets out of my name, living on a shoestring and trying to make a settlement offer in a couple years......or what.

Any advise, help, or reading and research suggestions are welcome.

token,Lendconnect ICO best lending platform,"New ICO is here 
You can register now on https://dashboard.lendconnect.io/ref/ravxvx

The LendConnect ICO is set to start 27/11/2017 with early investors getting the chance to purchase for just $0.6

What is LendConnect?
They're launching a new decentralized cryptocurrency that can be used to pay for goods and services or to transfer funds. The main aspect of the platform that will interest investors however is their lending platform which promises to pay investors high rates of interest in return for lending them capital.

The rise of cryptocurrency and ICOs

Cryptocurrncy has risen quickly during 2017, the total market cap combined is now $250 billion. Bitcoin still leads the way with just over half the market and a coin price of over $8,000. However this year has also seen other cryptocurrencies grow quickly.
We've also seen the popularity of ICOs (initial coin offerings) increase massively, an initial coin offering offers start ups or businesses the chance to raise capital in return for distributing their tokens to investors. These token sales have seen many investors make huge returns and given the company a great chance to raise initial funds. Many now believe this form of funding to be better than more traditional methods.

LendConnect lending platform

The new platform offers investors the option of 4 different lending packages depending on how much they wish to invest. The lowest amount possible is just $100 and goes up to $50,000.
You receive extra interest rates for bigger loans with your capital being released earlier too. Once you've chosen a lending option you'll receive interest paid directly into your wallet every day.

Additional ways to earn

They also state in their whitepaper that they'll be offering the option of staking the coins, this will earn you 10% interest per month by simply holding the coins for a set amount of time in your wallet.

Referral program

As with many businesses the platform hopes to bring new investors to the business by offering a referral program. They offer a huge 8% commission rate on tier 1 sign ups with additional commission on lower levels too.

Conclusion

All token sales are risky so please don't invest more than you can afford to lose. However lending platforms have recently shown some of the best profits for investors, I personally made huge amounts of money in Regalcoin and Hextracoin so I'm now buying into all these sorts of ICOs.
This one seems to have benefits over their competitors too, with a more professional sounding whitepaper and benefits such as a website hosted on dedicated server that should mean that we won't have to experience downtime which has been such a problem for their competitors.

I have a lot of doubts (as you probably are used to) but the main one is how can I invest living in a country that has few BC banks and they are not at all secure. I could use a BC bank from out of my country, but them I probably would have to pay even more in federal taxes from financial movement outside Brazil (usually 6.38% per transaction). 

Another think I worry about is how to store the BC. My home network is not as secure as it should and I'm honestly not gonna put up the time to learn about it (I also share it with ppl who download all types of cracked games and pirate software...). Import a hardware wallet would be very difficult due to Brazil's law that tax over 60% of everything bought out of the country... I would spend more on the wallet than I would initially invest. 

I basically few stucked by the infrastructure and the laws of my country (one of the reasons I want to buy BC in the first place) and I don't know how to pass this in order to safely invest...

Does anyone here faced similar problems? If so, any advice would be greatly helpful.

Unfortunately (or fortunately in some aspects) btc is not owned by a single company which is promoting and pushing for these types of things, so its up to us, the investors to push the envelope on these things for the sake of our own investments.


Every time the media gets any attention on bitcoin and people start making accounts on exchanges and buying in the price skyrockets, but we havent even began the full expansion. Thats all accidental unavoidable media attention because they are starting to catch on to the fact that bitcoin is raising so quickly, but once it becomes a spendable currency for everyday purchases online from the major retail sites for real goods and services, thats one small step for man, and one giant leap for bitcoin.

personalfinance,Is it to late to go to college?,"To start off here is a little backstory on me and my situation... I am a 24 year old male of Caucasian descent living in the northeastern region of the United States. Originally, when I graduated from High School I had no intentions of going to college and intended on pursuing a career in the military that ended up not going as well as planned so as the years went on I essentially had to have a change of heart. I originally attempted to fill out the FAFSA  and go to college somewhere between the ages of 22 and 23, but at the time was discouraged by outside information that included people that I was close to advising me that if I were to to fill it out then at that age that my parent's income would be taken into account whenever I was being measured up for what kind of assistance I would be able to get even though I will not be receiving any help from either of my parents. At that time I was also told that once I reached the age of 25 I would then be able to fill out the FAFSA with only my personal information, my personal income, and be applying for Federal Assistance based solely on my merits and financial status so at that point I made the conscious decision to wait until I was 25 to get my education and work on getting myself a semi-sturdy foundation in life first.

As of next Friday, December the 8th of 2017, I will be 25 years old and I wish to enroll in college to take as many online classes as possible to pursue a career in either Education as a History Teacher or as a Guidance Counselor. Either way, I will initially be required to take my General Education classes (my Maths, Literature, Sciences etc.or whatever they happen to include).I am assuming. and would then continue on to get my degree in either field. So far my understanding is that in order to become a History Teacher, given my current employer is a school, I would be able to have a job in my career field by the time I have my Bachelor's Degree at an almost 100% guaranteed placement, although since it is not a public school I most likely would not be able to make the kind of money that most teachers do.On the other hand, I work for this school as a Behavioral Specialist and I work hands on with students that range anywhere from mental illnesses that include being on the autism spectrum to having ODD and other behaviorally based issues that aren't considered technical disabilities. Due to the hands on nature of my job where I am required to sit alongside the students in their classes, sometimes I am required to scribe for them, or to read allowed for those with reading issues, or with some I am only required to make sure that that have someone close by who is able to keep them on task and redirect them whenever necessary depending on what psychological and educational professionals have outlined for them in their IEPs and BIPs. I have heard from a few sources and granted this may just be a rumor, I'm well aware, but might as well get clarification while I am here that most teaching jobs for public schools require a minimum of 4 years experience in working with children in an educational setting or in  a daycare setting before a candidate is presumed able to fill a teaching position/ Furthermore, I have also been told that my current position does count as one that would be considered the prerequisite needed to become a teacher granted I continue in my position for the 4 years that it takes me to get my Bachelor's Degree. I don't know if the Guidance Counselor positions have any prerequisites  like that but either way I will be getting the same experience through my job either way and no matter which end game I decide on.

Another side note is that as long as I continue working for the school that I am currently working for, I will qualify for reimbursement of a portion of the cost for approved college courses as long as they coincide with my career with the company (both of  my options fall into that category) that does not include any federal assistance that I manage to get.

So, as someone who has a desire to start the process of getting my higher education done as soon as possible I am coming to Reddit with a few questions to help me get off of my feet seeing as since I have taken sole responsibility of raising myself and taking care of myself  100% as of 2 years prior of my graduation from High School and unfortunately because of those circumstances have been left to feel almost lost when it comes to trying to figure out how to move forward with any of my dreams. I have stumbled around for years barely scraping by working from job to job and living from paycheck to paycheck because I never allowed myself to take any sort of of guidance on the next steps to take. Well, after getting my most recent job and seeing as it is the first I have ever held to not be in a restaurant or in a warehouse I have been humbled by it and have been given a great opportunity to grow and move foward in my life that I am by no means too ignorant to pass up. I am aware that this is my chance, this my personal cliff, this is going to be the “jump” I have to make that I have read about in so many self help books and articles that will allow my wings to take air and send me soaring into the successful and happy life I have always dreamed of. Now it is just a matter of packing up all of my gear, making sure my parachute is ready to deploy, and walking up onto the plane and prepare to land in feet first in my adulthood with a steady career ahead of me, a beautiful wife beside me, and my beautiful daughters following close behind.

•	So Reddit I ask of you, what do you think my first step should be? Should I go ahead and fill out the FAFSA first and then try and find a college that suits my needs? Or would it make more sense for me to find the school that I am most interested in enrolling in and then contacting them and seeing if they have anyone there that would be able to help me along my way? I kind of feel like I would prefer to have as many of my ducks in a row as possible before I try and contact the school I’m interested in so I can give the best impression possible.

•	I graduated from High School way back in the the beginning of 2011. I did not take my SAT’s while I was in school, nor do I ever remember hearing anything about having the chance to take them since getting my diploma. I wouldn’t be opposed to taking the SATs now if they are a requirement to go begin college, but I would like a chance to maybe study for them or maybe even take review classes before the test seeing as it’s been almost 7 years now since I wore my cap and gown in high school. If I remember correctly I scored a 97 out of a possible 99 on the ASVAB my junior year of High School whenever I enlisted so I do feel like I atleast have some kind of smarts but I would be afraid to actually be tested on anything I leanred that long ago without atleast going over all over it and at the least doing one of each style of problem.

•	Also, whenever I start my college classes I plan on taking as many online classes as possible without ever having to actually go to the campus itself,  seeing as I currently work a full time job, live with my girlfriend and our 3 young daughters, and will be continuing to do so throughout the time of me furthering my education, so what changes would that entail when it comes to looking for a school that I may want to attend? I know that there is Shippensburg University which is a local University for me that offers both of the Degrees that I want to pick between, and that they usually are very flexible with doing online schooling, but I feel like I have heard of some degrees requiring that you take so many hours of in class lectures or lab work etc. is this true? How would I go about finding out if the programs I am interested in would require those things?

•	Should I have completed the FAFSA before I start trying to get a hold of potential colleges or will they willing to talk with me and maybe even help me with this planning process? After filling out my FAFSA are there other grants or scholarships that are well known to help Single White Males around the age of 25 with children that anyone that reads this post has heard of or maybe even that they have taken advantage of themselves. that you could maybe point me in the direction of? Unfortunately, I made the decision to fill up my family with children and stretching all of my potential incomes out to the point that any amount of cash I am able to save up still barely accumulates to the extent that I no longer need a microscope to count it, before pursuing my education. so money is rather tight for me and my family even so much that I don’t know if I would even be able to afford another $20 in gas per week to drive me to whatever classes I may be required to attend on campus without redoing my whole budget. So any extra assistance I will be able to get will be great, if not completely necessary.

•	To be completely honest I am currently probably living fairly close to the poverty line despite how happy I am with my life and the happiness of those who share a home with me. My girlfriend and I live together in our 3 bedroom apartment with our 3 year old daughter, her 2 year old daughter to another man, and every other week we have my 2 year old daughter to another woman (we had our oldest together, split up and each had a kid with someone else before we each left them and ended up back together in our little Brady Bunch of a family dynamic). We currently pay approximately $650 for our rent which is about the average for our location, approximately $500 per month in child care (2 full time children which my girlfriend gets CCIS benefits for and only is required to  pay around $150 out of pocket for her two, but we have to pay the full $260 dollars for my daughter who goes there part time. Also, we share a car payment of $240 a month that will be getting paid off in full come income tax time 2018 and lastly is our car insurance at a total of $120 per month/.The more fluctuating monthly expenditures include groceries, electricity, and cable/internet etc. since in my whole life of paying paying I have never once paid the same amount for any of those things twice in a row. We both are currently bringing in right around $27k gross annually which brings our total household income to approximately $54k. We work for the same employer and are eligible for our raises next March that could net us a potential $3.2k more gross annual income per person if we were to both get the highest raise amount possible, which at the current time does not seem like something that is unreasonable to expect to happen by any means.

•	I don't know how the FAFSA and the Federal Assistance systems work and when throughout the course of my education I will be expected to pay for my classes, whether that be before they begin, after I get my degree, or maybe even some weird time right in the middle of it all, I do not know, either way, due to my current financial situation and with having on average around $45-$50 extra cash left over per paycheck in our household I can't really imagine that going to college would be in our budget at all. Nonetheless, all of our peers, the leadership team above us at work, and most importantly to me even my siblings and even MORE importantly to me my parents, insist that everything will fall into place and that the for year there have been government officials voted into place in order to specifically make sure that situations like mine would be able to be rectified with a little bit of sweat and elbow grease and a whole lot of dedication. So according to all of them I have nothing to worry about and that I should be able to do this like a walk down the boardwalk of the beach with every board being gently slid into place at precisely the right moment before my foot has to come crashing down onto it. That being said I have been alive for way to long to expect this all to go that easy, even if it was someones job to make sure that it happened that way. I’m ready and willing for whatever may come my way.

•	So where do I go from here? Where do I fill out the FAFSA? What kind of information will I need in order to fill it out? Will I be required to have and specific forms of Identification? Will I have to have some sort of proof of my income whether that be pay stubs or whatever or will they take my word for it when I fill out the papers?
Where do I look to apply for different Grants? Is there somewhere online I can go and fill out a survey about me and my desired degree and have a bunch of possible grants that I could apply for me narrowed out and presented to me? Whenever I contact college's I'm interested in should I ask them if they know of any grants? Should I start having my employer do whatever it is they do to have me reimbursed for my classes or is that I should wait for until I have already paid for them with my loans etc.? Will my student loans be able to be used to get me materials that I will need for school such as a laptop, textbooks, and other school supplies, or can they only be used towards tuition?

•	A few more personal questions about applying for the federal assistance for getting an education; I have a very low credit score as of now, this is mostly due to medical bills and maybe one or two other issues on my credit report that are not medically related, but will that have any gravity on how much assistance I will be be able to get? The money that I get from the FAFSA to pay for my education I am sure I will have to pay back to some entity at some point, whenever I do make those payments is that something that will be considered ""green"" towards me building a better credit score or do they not count towards that?
Finally, my girlfriend is currently going through the process of getting a divorce from her ex (or soon to be ex however that works)and father of her youngest child and he currently pays her child support although there is no legal custody agreement made between the two of them. I have heard over the years that there are sooooo many grants in place, non profit organizations, and other charities that are willing to help women in her position to get the education she needs to provide a better life for her and our children, and I am wondering if any of the Redditors that read this will know of anything specific and could maybe point us in the direction of any of that sort of assistance.

personalfinance,Refinance a student loan I consolidated,"Hi personalfinance!

Last year I consolidated 90k of private studenet loans through citizens. (Just to get past passing judgement, I’m a white dude from PA and finished high school with 4.0, only had an 1870 on my SATs, and had parents that were making combined $200k so I qualified for no grants or scholarships I applied for, and they didn’t give me any $ at all for school, but did co-sign my loans. Went to the cheapest school I could where there was a defined path to a high paying job, and don’t regret the debt I took on to get to the point I’m at. Just to clear the air :)

my private loans as I said were about 100k, I paid on them for a year and got down to 90k and refinanced thru Citizens after working 18 months. my initial rate was 10.5% (sallie mae) with a 15 year payback period. 

Last year I refinanced to citizens with a bit over a 6% rate and 10 year payback period. The loan is now just under 80k

Since refinancing , my income has gone up about $13k and my credit score up about 90 (just broke 800 woo). I entered my info at credible bc I woke up from a weird nightmare at 3am and was awake, and of course my student loans are on my mind late at night. I saw that one of my options was a 4.6% fixed rate with a 7 year payback period. my loan payment per month would go up about $140/ month, but I’d shorten the payback period by TWO years

Now, my question: since I already consolidated previous loans to this one, would I be able to refinance with a new lendor? I do have some very small federal loans I could bring into the mix if I needed to for the purpose of making it a consolidation. Just wanted some input on what options I might have :)",finance

Bitcoin,I know everyone is excited the jump in price due to news exposure but..,"I have some questions about the longevity of bitcoin.... 

So bitcoin is priced in the amount of real world value it has... More users and vendors...  More value...  

So knowing that what if and when the government makes their own blockchain like many have scepulated in the past? Current national bankers have already decided to work with Ripple to develop their blockchain technology into their banks..  This could mean a widespread of a new blockchain with certain ledgers being able to discretely change the award value for mining (much like paper money aka centralized)

My question is, when the government/corporations (what's the difference anyways) combat bitcoin with their own cryptocurrency and blockchain they can control (governments sole interest is to control the population and manage it easier with a splash of lobbying and corruption), what happens to bitcoin? It seems people would seem to be forced to accept bitcoin as the government could easily make it very difficult and costly for businesses to adopt bitcoin and make it very easy (or in fact help pay for) businesses to adopt their new FedCoin. 

It's hard to imagine any good long term future for bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Basically which is gonna happen first, big corporations start adopting and accepting bitcoin and forcing the government's hand or the government releasing their own cryptocurrency first that is better suited for companies and easier accessible and more heavily marketed to the public with the inexpensable amount of resources the government has.

personalfinance,How are taxes calculated for the other things?,"So I think I understand the basics and gist of taxable income and ""taxes"" in general when people are saying taxes. (like federal withholdings are there to help people pay taxes without the individuals setting money aside themselves right?)

but I am confused on the fact that I also get some wages deducted on my paycheck for medicare and social security. I always assumed they were all things included in this ""tax"" term everyone loosely uses. but i guess there are ""taxes tax"" and SS tax, and medicare tax?

how are these calculated? with income tax, you dont ""pay"" taxes if you are under a certain amount (like if for a single individual, gross income - standard deductions - personal exemptions is negative, you dont owe taxes). but how about for the other tax stuff? do you have to pay those no matter what?

reason for this question is because I got my first ever ""career"" job 4 weeks ago. and got my first paycheck 2 weeks ago. I put my W4 allowances as 10 because i calculated that I will make much less than the $10300 for the year, and I wont owe any taxes. however, I still got medicare and SS taxes taken.",finance

Ripple,Imagine three snowballs rolling down the hill,"There were three snowballs rolling down a hill. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple. 

The first snowball (Bitcoin) is already quite big; snow sticks to it fast; it gets bigger quickly but the snow isn't very sticky so sometimes chucks fall off and it gets smaller.

The second snowball (Litecoin) is made of really compact snow, so it's super quick. Snow does stick to it, but it just isn't big enough to get a lot of snow and get really big.

Now the third snowball (Ripple) is a little different: it has roots sticking out like arms; this made it a little slow at the start. 

So, what happened to the snowballs? 

The Second snowball flew down the hill, turned icey, and never managed to collect enough mass to get big.

The first snowball got really big, too big. It hit a bump and broke apart. First a section fell off; then it quickly broke in half, grinding to a holt.

The third snowball, as different and slow as it was at the beginning, began to collect more and more snow around its roots. More snow collected in the cracks which helped collect more snow, and it became big, bigger, a beast. It hit a bump but the roots kept all the parts together. It's size got big enough to collect all the snow it rolled upon. Finally, it rolled over where the first snowball fell apart and engulfed the lot, collecting all the snow on hill.

personalfinance,Need advise on a student loan - I am NOT a recent graduate,"Hi,

I have a series of student loans from around 10-12yrs ago that I am looking deeper into in the hopes of finding a better way of paying off in the future.  I am hoping the wonderful hive-mind of this sub can assist.

Some quick background:  These loans were started between 2005-2007.  Shortly after graduating we had kids and were living on 1 income, so we had to put these loans in forebearance for a few years while we tried to make ends meet, driving up the total loan amount in the process.

Here is how the loan shakes out:

* 8/2007 - Federal Stafford Loan - $5,480.12 owed - 6.8% interest
* 8/2007 - Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - $6,553.97 owed - 6.8% interest
* 8/2006 - Federal Stafford Loan - $5,480.16 owed - 6.8&amp; interest
* 8/2006 - Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - $6,909.07 owed - 6.8% interest
* 6/2006 - Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - $2,058.65 owed - 3.28% interest
* 1/2006 - Federal Stafford Loan - $1,482.98 owed - 3.28% interest
* 1/2006 - Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - $4,956.49 owed - 3.28% interest
* 10/2005 - Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - $2,108.30 owed - 3.28% interest

Total owed:  $35,172.78

Our payments up to this point:

* Principal Paid:  $6,457.09
* Total Fees Paid:  $0.00
* Interest Paid:  $3,742.91
* Total Amount Paid: $10,200.00

Now, I see offers from SoFi in my mailbox every now and then and I'm wondering if moving all of this to them would be a good move for us at this point considering half of the loan is on a 6.8% interest rate.  With our current cashflow we can usually manage to pay $500/month towards the loans, of which about $155 of that goes to interest.

What's my best move?  Stay put or try to refinance with something like Sofi?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off student loans or invest in 401k,"Bit of background:

I️ am 27 years old, 4 years removed from college with a little over $30k in federal loans due. I️ have the opportunity to clear said debt at the beginning of next year thanks to an expected windfall and was wondering what was the soundest approach to all this.

I️ am single with zero intention of getting married anytime soon. Own very little (no house, cars or other substantial fixed assets) and plan on heading to grad school at some point in the near future (will not contract additional debt for this). 

I️ have been particularly diligent in pumping money into my 401k (currently sitting at 130% of my expected contributions, 3 years in) and would like to keep doing so. My rate of return over the last couple of years has been ~12%

Would you: 
- clear the entire student loans debt
- clear a portion of it, send the rest of the windfall towards the 401k
- send all towards 401k and keep making above-minimum payments on loans
- do something else?

personalfinance,Some student loan questions and request for opinions.,"Hey all, probably some simple questions, but I can't seem to find a clear and direct answer/source of info. I'm fired up because I thought I was doing more on these, and turns out it's been almost all interest. Have done some research, read the debt sidebar, and I'd like the subreddit's validation/discussion.


Details
I have 9 student loans between me and my wife, about 72K, ranging from 2.6% to 6.8% (yikes!). I'd like to refinance my loans to a lower interest rate, but at the same time plan on increasing my payment slightly to pay more on principle and less on interest. 


My specific questions.

1. When I refinance, does the lender add fees into the loan? It seems like they don't, but I'm just surprised by that. They do with houses and cars, and I'm just expecting a hidden fee somewhere. I ask because I may just increase my payment and leave the loans as is, and not bother with the addtl fees. Or at least do the math and see if it's worth it.

2. What banks/institutions has this subreddit found success refinancing SL's with? I'm seeing SoFi, Earnest, etc, seem to have the best rates. Does the question above (fees) exist with any/all/some of them? Does anyone have good/bad stories with them?

3. Variable vs Fixed interest rate - what's the best thought on this? The variable rates are so much lower, and if the first question is ""nope, usually no fees"", is there anything keeping me from taking advantage of the lower rates now, and if they rise then refinance again with someone else or with fixed rates?

4. Any other recommendations? Seems like I'll only get better rates on loans higher than 4%-4.5%, but otherwise any other thoughts like ""don't expect this"" or ""hey you should try that""?

Thanks as always PF.",finance
Bitcoin,"If you did not buy Bitcoin in 2010, you are also the pizza guy. Discussion on opportunity cost of capital and how it applies to decision making","Every time we break a new all time high it seems that everyone makes a big deal about the 10,000 pizza guy. The general discussion is that he made a huge mistake and often no one also suggests how this literally applies to anyone that made a purchase of anything that day. There is always an opportunity cost of capital. On that same day there were numerous individuals who also purchased a pizza using US dollars. That money could've been used in exchange for Bitcoin. All throughout Bitcoin's history, any time you made a purchase with US Dollars, it could have been going towards Bitcoin. There was an opportunity cost with each decision you made. 

Does that stop you from acquiring the things that you want? It might actually, but it will really get you to question the general tradeoffs of what is in your present valued interest. 

Throughout most of history we have had floating market interest rates that allowed us to determine the opportunity cost of our money. This is why market pricing is so important. It sends us signals of how capital should be allocated. Growing up my parents could put money in a savings account and actually get a yield and return on their money. The younger generation has essentially grown up in an environment where they are constantly losing purchasing power any time they put it in a savings account. 

Governments and central banks around the world have destroyed their money system by keeping interest rates at close zero to where individuals have little opportunity for actual yield. Bitcoin is changing the system by getting people to really think in terms of opportunity cost again. Whether individuals really think deeply about this, that is what is happening when people buy and hold. There is a real tradeoff between savings and consumption. In time as liquidity in the system arises and usage grows, we will see a pricing system in Bitcoin where a market interest rate is determined. This will allow individuals to more freely determine how they should effectively allocate their capital and come to a better conclusion as to how they should use their money: on savings, or on consumption. This is when Bitcoin becomes widely used as a currency by all. We are liberating money, and in return, liberating the individual.",cryptocurrency

This will leave me with this debt:

$22k at 3%

$18k at 3.8%



Now is this a smart option or is there a better way to spend this loan? Will I see better returns investing it? Thanks!





EDIT: So it seems the consensus is that I should keep the flexibility of the student loans and NOT use this career starter loan to invest. Do you think there is anything smart I can use this loan for?",finance

personalfinance,"Working at large company with 401k, RSU, ESPP vs moving to startup with larger base salary but only stock options","22/M CA.

Current base: $102,000. RSU: Approx $15k a year, 30% 401k match all the way to the federal limit, ESPP offering that buys stock at 15% discount.

New offer at a smaller startup. Base: $128,000. That's it. No 401k match or RSU, but I have the option to buy a certain number of stock in the hope that the company goes to IPO or gets acquired and I get a huge profit from that.

From a career perspective, I like the domain of work that is being done at the startup. I kinda am unhappy at my current job because of a couple of reasons. I don't really like the domain of the work, and my manager is kind of a dick.

But I'm hesitant because obviously these stock options are worthless at this time, and I'd be giving up 401k, RSU, ESPP etc. The startup does give full medical, dental and vision coverage though.

For my spreadsheet I used a general interest formula, made the period to pay off the loans 120 months, and gave them an interest rate of 4.29%.

For example, using information from [www.cappex.com], I found that the annual tuition for UNC Charlotte is $19,903 to attend. That site also reports that the average aid that a student receives per year is $6,390. Based off of that, that gives them over $73,000 in debt and their student loan each month is $751.

I'm 22 year old student working part time as of last month. I have a 788 credit score with $900 in debt that'll be paid off by Feb 2018. I own a 2nd vehicle which I can sell for a down payment and a motorcycle. 

I was approved in July for a home here in CA that I wanted to use as a rental but I ditched that idea for reasons.

I recently started looking at homes in Texas. YOU CAN LIVE LIKE A MILLIONAIRE OVER THERE, haha. I found many houses around $50,000 even at $30,000. I'd really like to buy one as an investment. Costly repairs aren't a concern. 

My question is... has anyone bought their first home out of state? Was it hard to get a lender? 

I've read about getting personal loans for $50k, has anyone ever done that? I know the interest rates would be high.

I guess I'm just looking for success stories here and some thoughts or ideas. 
Edit:  I wouldn't use it for renting. But I guess I'd be open to it.

Initially I was inclined to just put that sum back into my student loans, but upon thinking about it further it might be more beneficial to wipe a significant portion of my auto loan out instead.

Here is my student loan information:

* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford = $6,062.59 @ 6.8%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford = $2,491.33 @ 6.8%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford = $2,052.68 @ 3.86%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford = $1,995.96 @ 4.66%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford = $3,560.66 @ 3.4%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford = $5,340.90 @ 3.86%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford = $5,243.83 @ 4.66%
Total = $26,596.40

Auto Loan Detail:

* $11,379.71 @ 7.04%
* $5,874.36 remains to be paid (after making payments for 2 years)

As you can see, the $3,000 would go a long way in helping with the auto loan and since it has the highest interest rate, I'm more inclined to pay that off.

personalfinance,Ways to get rid of credit card balance on an account where interest (23.99% APR) has kicked in?,"Hey friends! I made the mistake of signing up for an Apple Barclay Card US a few years ago in order to be able to afford a Macbook. Made dumb purchases and spent recklessly for 2 years and now the interest has kicked (about 8 months ago). Every month I pay about $120 dollars and it gets swallowed up by the monthly interest charge. I called a few months ago and they reduced my interest rate a few percentages down to 23.99% but that's still so high considering my balance is currently at $3500. 

A few key facts about my income -- I'm a graduate student (from a foreign country) so I can barely work -- I intern in NYC and make 11$/hr so I make about $360 every two weeks. Thankfully my school and rent are paid for but here are my monthly expenses:

Transportation($120)
Utilities ($30)
Phone bill ($45)
Food ($150). 
Barclays Credit card (the one with interest) ($120)
2nd credit card with Bank of America ($25)

personalfinance,"(Update) My girlfriends return flight was cancelled because she didn't board her outgoing flight. But the thing is, she absolutely did board her plane. And now she may potentially have no way home.","First of all I just want to thank you guys. . If it wasn't for the great advice I would of took my chances with going to the airport. So I wanted to update you guys on what happened, just in case you go through this yourself.

So after I read countless comments that it wasn't a federal violation to reinstate my ticket and that the first manager just straight up lied to me. Not only in saying it was a federal violation but also that if I go to the airport they will have a more in depth log to look through (they don't). I decided to call again. I thought maybe dropping names like DHS and DOT would bring faster results. Well I got the manager on the phone a lot quicker than the last time. But that's as far as the progress got.
From there on I literally sat on the phone for an hour going back and forth with the manager telling me my girlfriend didn't board the plane. She would use condescending remarks like ""A lot of people don't know if you cancel your outgoing flight, then the return is cancelled as well."" After I just mention to her that my girlfriend sat right next to me.  And when I would say she absolutely did board the plane. She'd remark ""well then I can't help you from here if you won't give me the full story."" This kind of conversation as I stated before lasted about a hour. 
It felt at times she was bribing me to lie. If I just tell her the real story then I can reinstate the ticket for $200. I thought about paying the $200 since I was shipping out the next day and I needed piece of mind , but she wouldn't let me until I told her the full story. Stating that the manifest has never been wrong and it says in her system in 3 different spots that she didn't board, and that's never happened  
I wish I could tell you guys there's a secret way around this or I have magical sentence that made it all right. But the truth of it is, i was persistent with my ""story"" and I think I just wore her down to reinstate the ticket finally. She sounded so defeated when she finally gave in. Almost sad?? Which baffles me because she just gave someone a ticket to go back home, instead of ruining their thanksgiving. I'm assuming she was just ready to get off the phone with me. I told her thank you and I hope you believe in karma and her remark was I hope you do too. 
We made it back so I guess everything is good on our end but we'll never be flying with this airliner again. Its sad we've come to a day where computers are more reliable and a real person pretty much begging to just go back home, is the liar. 

Edit: a lot of people are wondering the airliner. It was delta.  And like I said in my original post, it's a shame because we were giving them such high praise on our flight there.

I'm hoping you will all help me by taking a look at our income and expenses and point us in the right direction for reducing our debt and managing our finances better. My husband and I are both 30 and we have a 1 year old son. I recently left my job to take a nannying job so that I can take my son to work as child care costs would have resulted in a net loss of income for me to stay at work.  I've been wanting to make this post for a long time and I'm finally ready to put in the work. We're considering taking the month of December to get familiar with Dave Ramsey's strategy with a plan to start it at the beginning of 2018. I have a YNAB membership but it hasn't quite worked for us so far. It's a lot of managing tiny transactions and I can't keep up with both of us spending on debit cards or credit cards.

I am open to any advice you all have about where we should/could reduce costs and reduce debt. Let me start with the details: 

**Income:** 

Husband's Income:
$2400 gross, $1470 net
Paid every 2 weeks
Contributes 6% to 401k, with 100% matching
Contributes 5% to ESPP

My income:
$600 gross every 2 weeks
$250 quarterly bonus
New position nannying for a friend
Undecided how I will handle paying taxes on this

Additional income: 
$400 per month from roommate who rents a room

Total net income per month: $4968

**Expenses:**

Mortgage ($202K at 4.75%): $1353 (House was purchased 10 months ago and is worth $270k)

HOA: $267

Insurance (Car/Homeowners): $182

Gas/Water/Trash/Electricity: $235

Cable: $41

Car payments: $572 (406 lease, 166 loan)

Hulu, Netflix, iTunes: $37

Cell phone: $35

iPhone Upgrade Program: $112
(Loans just started, 24 month agreement)

Credit card minimum payments (details below): $429

Personal Loan: $135

Student loan payment: $50

Groceries: $600

Fuel: $100

Total Expenses: $4148

**Debt Details:**

Amex: $9312 @ 19.24%, $950 @ 7% until 1/10/18

Chase 1: $281 @ 24%, 1898 @ 0% until 5/6/18

Chase 2: $2626 @ 23.99%

Student Loan 1: $405 @ 7.25%

Student Loan 2: ~$23k @ varying interest rates between 3.6% and 8.6% (This loan is essentially prepaid out until 5/28/18 by donations from a great uncle and father. I don't make monthly payments on it, although the monthly minimum is $390.)

Personal Loan: $5500 @ 11% (This was a promotional offer through Amex where they would pay off part of other companies' credit cards with a max rate of 11%. I reduced the interest on that $5500 from 24% to 11%.)

**Assets:** 

Savings: $6791

Stock: ~$3000 in AAPL shares, plus unvested RSUs

401ks for each spouse

**Goals:**

We do some shopping and spending. Probably too much. I would love to get out from under that debt and free up some monthly cash to start saving toward larger goals (larger emergency fund, house remodel, vacations, etc) and generally feeling better about our finances.

Delicious dishes are served every hour. Geese with crispy crust, almond marzipans, cherry liqueurs, and three-story cakes shaped like Chinese boats are there. Everyone digs greedily into the food but only five people at one of the tables keep an unruffled look, glancing at their watches.

At some point, guests who were just eagerly absorbing food begin to writhe in agony and slowly slide under the table, dragging remains of delicious meals and snow-white tablecloths along with them. When all of them are dead, five people at the last table put on their gloves and gently gather watches, jewelry and wallets stuffed with money off of the dead bodies.

Then the waiters in the masks of the plague doctors appear and take the dead bodies away of the hall. After that they serve the tables with almond marzipans, geese with crispy crust and Chinese boats-shaped three-story cakes once again. Five minutes later, new guests appear, greedily jumping onto the food, unaware of the danger. 15 minutes later they are poisoned, and in 30 minutes their jewels turn out to be with the silent people from the first table once again. And so it happens time after time ...

This is not a Stanley Kubrick's movie, but the real state of affairs in all stock markets, including crypto-currency. Guests who eagerly eat their dinner are speculators and casuals, while silent people wearing gloves are big players and professionals who take all the profits for themselves.

According to statistics, only 5% of people earn stable income on the stock markets. The rest are just a lubricant for the exchange mechanism gears. This truth can be bitter, but it's a fact.

The growth of Bitcoin has driven most of the players into some sort of euphorea, but the bullish growth will be replaced by correction, harsh reality will show itself and the profit will fade away like a summer dream.

I now have a job where I make about 70,000 a year and want to tackle that mountain of debt. I know I'm gonna get killed on that high interest so was wondering what is the best way to consolidate the two debts. Personal loan with a fixed rate from my bank or seeking out a balance transfer CC with lower interest. I can pay about 500 a month towards the debt on my current budget.

Founded by the former CTO of PayPal, this company has raised half a billion dollars from investors and offers a new way to pay for your shopping.


I think it is worth discussing the dangers of using this kind of financing. Feels to me that this type of service will incent people to buy material goods beyond their means, and fall into a vicious cycle of high-interest loans.


&gt; The installment loans, made at 10–30 percent annual percentage rates, or APR, and averaging $750 according to the company, are offered for everything from mattresses and plane tickets to motorized skateboards and coding classes to $500 boots and $200 limited-edition denim.


&gt;For merchants, Affirm provides exceptional benefits, increasing average order values across the board; perhaps not surprisingly, people will shop more, and more often, when they don’t immediately feel the costs. And for many customers, including Jocelyn, the predictable, convenient payments are worth the higher interest rates.

personalfinance,How long after paying of CC with windfall should I wait to ask for personal loan?,"I received a windfall from a relative allowing me to pay off my credit debt in full all in one go. My credit score is about 685 right now (per Credit Karma), based on the 67% credit ratio I had with that CC debt. When I was carrying a 0 balance on CCs but had about half the limit I do now, I had a rating of about 715-720. I think it's reasonable to expect it to bounce back up to at least that range once credit reporting catches up with the payments.

Once that goes through, I want to hit up my local credit union (with whom I've already had accounts for over a year, and which offers savings-backed accounts) about getting a personal loan to try and pay off some of my student loans at a better interest rate.

My concern is that since the credit card payoff is obviously from a windfall, the credit union will be hesitant to give me a good interest rate on a loan. Should I wait a few months to establish responsibility visibly on my credit reports before applying?

Bonus weirdness for my situation: I was keeping a zero balance for a while in the past, but then moved back home from overseas and had trouble finding a job when I got back, which led to my credit situation getting bad. Living overseas and having my foreign address listed also meant that the credit card company on my oldest account stopped reporting to the credit bureaus (which I fixed as soon as I found out about it). Apparently I still have a weird hole in my reporting as a result, which I found out after trying to cosign a car loan for someone.

Transport: Car is owned outright, under warranty.  I need to price out car insurance for the area... in the past I've paid 6 months at a time to get a discount.

Health insurance - Company provided, so the net take home pay reflects that deduction.  I can lessen the cost by ~$60 a month in 2 months time by participating in the wellness program.

personalfinance,"Bad end to a contract position. Unemployment, other options?","I also posted a version of this in legal advice, but this may be a more appropriate place:

I'm not sure how much is relevant so I will start with the TL;DR: For the last couple of months I have worked as a contractor for a city agency (it's a little bit complicated, I am actually paid out of a grant through a non-profit, but my position is in and with an office in NYCity). Even though I am a contractor, I work out of the office 9-5 every day. Immediately on the heels of me complaining about delayed payment and other issues, I was just told the contract is going to be terminated at the end of next month (December 29). While I know contractors do not generally receive unemployment, I also realize I haven't been treated as a contractor exactly. I have been in the office every day 9-5, and this is not by choice - even though in my contract it says flexible work location (and in fact it says that I am supposed to use city office space and equipment ONLY when necessary, I was told that I had to be here every day). So, can I apply for unemployment? If so, to whom (the city, or non-profit)? (In NY State, I think the minimum to make to qualify for unemployment is $8400, and I have met that threshold).
Additional detail (if it helps): Last June I applied for a position, it was a 1 year term with a City department. I got the position, but because of issues, there were delays. I waited and held out, because I really liked the title and was interested in the work. position was now going to be a contractor position. There were a few delays and then it turns out they need to hire me as a contractor. I still felt it was worth it, and I was told there were certain benefits to being a contractor such as flexible work location and hours. I signed my contract in September but due to additional delays, I didn't start until October. When I finally started, everything was a mess - the project, the office was awful and disorganized and understaffed, there was no explanation of the work or a timeline for completion - everything was just kind of ""winging it."" I didn't have a login or email or anything, no one knew how to get me fingerprinted and cleared. Most importantly (to me) I wasn't getting paid, and the invoice process and pay kept changing. Now, if you're thinking ""you should have asked about this before beginning,"" please understand that I did, and I was told in writing that I would submit my invoice directly to the Director of the Fund that was paying me, and that it would be processed within a week. After I submitted my invoice, that changed. And then changed again. And then again. It took an addition several weeks to get paid for my first invoice. And then after I submitted my second invoice it changed again and I haven't heard anything since resubmitting (8 days ago). I have voiced disapproval and written a number of emails, to a few people, but haven't received any answers. I finally went to HR last wednesday for guidance. Today, at a meeting with the Fund and my supervisor where I was hoping to get clarification on the above issues, I was told they are going to terminate my contract (and go into a different direction) on December 29th.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin loan Solutions Abstract (Paper in Progress),"Introduction to Abstract
I am working on a paper to potentially combat one major problem with scaling bitcoin. The truth is no matter how good bitcoin gets if we can initiate loans efficiently, then fiat will rule. This the first paragraph of the 24-page essay, it explains the idea in layman's terms. Crits are welcome.

					     	                    Abstract 
For bitcoin to promote large economic growth on a macro scale, it must figure out a way to issue loans on a large scale. Purchases like homes and cars cannot be fulfilled by the average person without loans. For bitcoin to really stick around as the world reserve currency it must overcome this obstacle. Now bringing up a problem without a solution has its benefits, but it’s always preferred to have a follow-up solution. One solution is to get people early on to adopt putting their money in safe investment funds. These funds will take money given by investors and loan it to the most credible and qualified person or business. Now, we must market these funds as a way of savings, but here’s the problem. What if there is a mass panic and people take their money out in droves. Will we deny the investor of their own money? And putting a limit on how much money you can take out will bring down investor confidence. A solution to this underlying problem is maybe finding ways to issue altcoins on loans. So, if someone wants to liquefy there loan they must first sell it. People can buy these altcoins representing a loan in batches. These batches will be called CBL’s (Coin Backed loans), someone can buy a small part of these CBL’s called tranches. For example, there is a CBL for mortgages, there will be a group of mortgages with the similar default rate and structure. So, maybe 100 mortgage loans all with 3% interest rates and 15-year maturity with a total value of 1,400 BTC. The PPT or Price Per Tranche is .150 BTC, so there need's to be 9,333 tranches sold before the loan is initiated. If it’s taking too long for the money to be raised then certain mortgages in the CBL will be dropped. Each CBL will have a rating and a risk to reward ratio, higher risk loans will have higher interest.

personalfinance,(GA) My employer is not taking federal and state taxes out of my monthly bonus checks,"Hello, I am a salaried employee and have been working at this job for a year and a half. I receive a monthly cash bonus that is relative to our volume for the previous month. Though the bonus is in cash, it is still reported on pay slips so it’s not under the table. I never look at my pay slips cause my bonus is pretty steady throughout the months and since I’m salaried, I’m always paid the same. Today I decided to look on our online portal and found all my monthly pay slips and bonus slips. I couldn’t help but notice that there were no federal income taxes taken out of any of these bonuses as well as no state taxes taken out. Social security and Medicare was taken out. The bonus is technically higher on the slip than what I paid in cash to account for the FICA taxes. I am now worried that I will be short a lot of federal and state taxes (and potentially owe a penalty) for the year since these bonuses add up to $6500+ for the year. Is it illegal for my employer to not take out these taxes on my bonuses? When I started the job, those taxes were being taken out but sometime earlier this year it stopped.

personalfinance,Early mortgage payments vs. credit card debt,"So for a few years I've been paying approximately 10% extra per month on my mortgage payments, with the idea being that it will be paid off X amount of years early, and will save a bunch of money in the long run.

At the same time I've developed a few thousand dollars worth of credit card debt.

Am I better off continuing to pay extra towards the principal on the mortgage each month because of the overall amount of money remaining, while paying smaller credit card payments? Or, am I better off making the exact mortgage payment each month with more money going towards paying down the credit card debt that is of a higher interest rate?

personalfinance,Are employer-contributions to 401k immediately vested?,"So my wife and I are doing some renovations on our house, and some costs ran over a bit, dipping into our emergency fund. We're discussing stopping our 401k contribution for a short time while the emergency fund replenishes, but then I had this thought that I can't get a sure answer on.

My employer matches 50% of my contributions up to 18k, so they contribute a max of 9k/year. We currently take full advantage of this. On the Fidelity site, it says the ""vested"" amount is the full balance of the 401k. So I can pull out money that my employer put in? The reason this is a surprise to me is that my employer has contributed a full 30% of my balance. If I can pull that money out, even after taxes and penalty (my income taxes are low; I have 3 kids and a wife at home), it was still easily worth it to put the money in there even if I knew I was going to be pulling it out. So stopping this contribution would never make sense; it would make more sense to just keep contributing and pulling money out.

Does that make sense? What am I looking at incorrectly here?

Edit: Okay, so I just got off the phone with Fidelity. So they just put in there that it's fully vested, but it doesn't mean anything because with this plan, you're not allowed to withdraw from the 401k while you work here.

However, I can take loans out, and those loans include employer contribution. The interest rates on the loans are also paid into my 401k, so I'm not losing any money taking a loan out. I can get free access to the 9k my employer put into my 401k this year that way, which seems like something that you could pretty easily capitalize on.

It was technically 4 of them, and I have been repaying them since November 2015. Since I chose to college, I told my parents I would pay the loans in their names and my own. Please don't tell me about all the mistakes I made in the past. It can't be changed now and I'm well aware the awful situation I put myself in and the mistakes I made in just taking loans that are costing me an arm and a leg. Due to making 3 loan payments a month on my income, I had to lower my father's loan. Paying over $1000 a month just on his loan alone was not going to possible for me, and my parents make around the same as myself, so I couldn't ask them to pitch in money with what they already pay for their own cost of living. I made my payment the extended repayment plan, so 25 years instead of 10. I now pay $658.07 a month, with about 90% of it going to interest. My balance right now is at a combined $88,549.64 for the 4 loans. 

My father works for the city where we live (labor work) and I applied for Public Service Loan Forgiveness for him. I received a letter saying we qualified, however there was something that confused me. It said we had to be on certain payment plans. These were:
Income-Based Repayments
Income-Driven Repayments
Pay as You Earn Repayments
and I believe one more plan that was a pay as you earn type.

My issue is that when I try to apply to these plan on the FedLoan Servicing site, it sends me instead to studentloans . gov. I have applied for the income based plans on the site and once I have filled out all my info, I am told my balance is only a little over $2,000 and I am then denied being put on the plan.

My question is: What am I doing wrong? I want to be able to have my loan forgiven after 10 years, but it does not seem I am on a plan that allows it.

I looked into it and saw that parent plus loans supposedly are not applicable for the income based plans, but is that true? Do I apply for the pay you earn plan on studentloans . gov? Is there a reason why it cannot be done? My father has been of little help, always telling me he'll give me the info I need to do all this stuff, or to just call and say I'm him because they'll never know. Regardless of if he is right, it's not something I'm comfortable with. Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get myself on the PSLF plan and actually be paying into it so that I will be done in 10 years?

personalfinance,Moving abroad for a new job in January. My financial situation in my home country (US) is very bad. What can I do to improve it while I'm gone?,"Disclaimer: A little on the long side.

As the title says, I'm currently living in the United States (Chicago specifically) but I will be moving to China in January for at least a year, possibly longer. My current financial situation is pretty bad, as I will detail more below, so I am asking for advice on potential solutions that will maximize my time living outside of the country. I will most likely return to the United States at some point to buy a house and live, and I don't like the idea of trying to start completely from scratch in my 30s (I am currently 26). With that said, if anyone has done something similar, by which I mean work and live in another country while trying to grow their wealth and manage their finances in their home country, I would gladly take any advice.

My situation is this: After approximately 4 years of inconsistent employment and mental health problems, I've wracked up about $12,000 in consumer debt (approximately $6000 in installment/payday loans [including the interest they plan to charge; principal only the loans only total around $2000]. and $5000 in credit card debt). In addition, I have $35,000 in student loans, primarily unsubsidized federal loans, which are currently in default. I owe approximately $22,000 in principal on those student debt loans, and $13,000 in interest/fees (I graduated 5 years ago and have never made a payment, thought they were deferred for 2 years because of the post-graduate program I was in). When I checked my credit a few weeks ago it was in the mid to upper 400s, around 460-480 if I remember correctly. Finally, I owe my roommate/close friend about $2000 since he helped me out with rent/food when I wasn't working. 

I currently make about $2,000 net a month, but expect to make around $3,000 next month because of overtime, holiday pay, etc. I leave for China January 20th, where I will only be making $1300 USD a month, but with all my major expenses paid for (I'll need to cover food and entertainment only).

My first and foremost goal is to pay my friend back, for obvious reasons. My expenses are as follows:

Income: $2400

Rent: $830
Friend repayment: $800
Food: $150
Gym: $40
Personal savings: $200
China expenses (visa, passport, etc): $200

I'm aware I may need to send my friend a few payments from China, and have looked into how to do so and it doesn't seem hard. 

My questions are:

1) What can I do to improve my financial situation, most importantly my credit and student loans, while I'm living abroad? How easy is it to pay debts from another country?

2) I want to travel extensively over the next year while I'm in Asia. For anyone who has done this sort of travel/work experience before, how can I best budget and manage my salary to allow me to travel? From my understanding the job will give me around 3 weeks off over the year, not including random 3-4 day weekends, so I will have a lot of opportunities.

3) What would be some possible ways to invest or increase my wealth while living in a new country? I'm just concerned about subsisting at poverty for the remainder of my 20s and entering my 30s without a clear career path and a likely lower income.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/30/bitcoin-is-a-vehicle-for-fraudsters-warns-goldman-sachs-boss

Her's a list of their illegal activites

https://www.corp-research.org/goldman-sachs

&gt;During the first half of the 2000s, there were more ethical lapses at Goldman:

&gt;In 2002 it was fined $1.65 million by the industry regulatory body NASD (now FINRA) for failing to preserve e-mail communications.
In 2003 it paid $110 million as its share of a global settlement by ten firms with federal, state and industry regulators concerning alleged conflicts of interest between their research and investment banking activities.
That same year, it had to pay $9.3 million in fines and disgorgement of profits in connection with federal allegations that it failed to properly oversee a former employee who had been charged with insider trading and perjury.  
In 2004 Goldman was one of four firms each fined $5 million by NASD for rule violations relating to trading in high-yield corporate bonds; Goldman also had to make restitution payments of about $344,000.
In 2005 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Goldman would pay a civil penalty of $40 million to resolve allegations that it violated rules relating to the allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings.
That same year, it paid a fine of $125,000 to NASD for violating rules relating to the sale of restricted securities during initial public offerings. Shortly thereafter, it was fined $140,000 by NASD for late and/or inaccurate reporting of municipal securities transactions.
In 2006 Goldman was one of 15 financial services companies that were fined a total of $13 million in connection with SEC charges that they violated rules relating to auction-rate securities. In another case relating to auction-rate securities brought by the New York State Attorney General, Goldman was fined $22.5 million in 2008.
When the financial crisis erupted in 2008, Goldman and Morgan Stanley gave in to pressure from federal regulators to convert themselves into bank holding companies. Becoming subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve was a dramatic move for the two firms, but it was not as radical as the changes that befell their competitors: the purchase of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns by commercial banks (Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, respectively) and the dismantling of Lehman Brothers. Goldman also propped itself up by negotiating a deal in which Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $5 billion in the firm in exchange for a 10 percent stake. Buffett’s holding took the form of preferred stock paying a generous 10 percent dividend. Goldman also received $10 billion from the federal government’s Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). During this period, Goldman profited from subprime mortgages through its ownership of Litton Loan Servicing, which it sold in 2011 in the wake of numerous abuse allegations.

&gt;The forced restructuring of Wall Street took place largely under the direction of Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who left Goldman in 2006 to take the post at the request of President George W. Bush. Although Paulson was required to liquidate his sizeable Goldman holdings before moving to Treasury, his actions during the 2008 crisis were widely criticized as working to the benefit of his former firm. Chief among these was the allegation that he allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse while taking pains to bail out insurance giant A.I.G., which had extensive dealings with Goldman and which used its federal support to pay off its obligations at 100 cents on the dollar. In the case of Goldman, this amounted to $12.9 billion. The tendency of Paulson to recruit other Goldman alumni for his crisis team prompted the nickname “Government Sachs.” It later came out that Paulson was in frequent contact with Lloyd Blankfein, his successor at Goldman, during the height of the crisis.

&gt;During this difficult period, ProPublica and the Los Angeles Times put more pressure on Goldman by revealing that the firm had advised some of its big clients to place investment bets against California bonds right after collecting hefty fees from the state for underwriting some of those bonds.

&gt;Goldman, famed for its lavish bonuses, chafed at the limitations on executive compensation that were part of TARP and successfully pushed for permission to repay the federal loan, while it and other banks continued to enjoy essentially interest-free borrowing from the Federal Reserve.

&gt;In May 2009 Goldman agreed to provide about $50 million in relief to holders of subprime-mortgages in Massachusetts to remove itself from the state attorney general’s investigation of abuses relating to the origination and securitization of subprime loans.

&gt;Goldman, however, became a symbol of the excesses that led up to the financial meltdown. The Taibbi quote was the most colorful of many unflattering depictions of the firm. 

&gt;Blankfein initially responded to the criticism by making the far-fetched claim that Goldman was doing “god’s work.”  When that did not go over well, he issued an apology for the firm’s mistakes and vowed to spend $500 million to help thousands of small businesses recover from the recession. That did little to rectify the situation. In the 10-K filing it issued in March 2010, Goldman added to the usual risk factors “adverse publicity,” which it said could “adversely impact the morale and performance of our employees, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and results of operations.”

&gt;The adverse publicity soon escalated. In April 2010 the SEC accused Goldman of having committed securities fraud when it sold mortgage-related securities to investors without telling them that the investment vehicle, called Abacus, had been designed in consultation with hedge fund manager John Paulson (no relation to Hank Paulson), who chose securities he expected to decline in value and had shorted the portfolio. The Goldman product did indeed fall in value, causing institutional customers to lose more than $1 billion and Paulson to make a bundle. Paulson was not charged, but the SEC did name Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman vice president who helped create and sell the securities. (A federal jury later found him guilty of deceiving investors.)

&gt;Goldman initially defended its actions and claimed that it lost money on Abacus, but a Senate subcommittee later released e-mail messages between Goldman executive discussing how they expected to make “serious money” by shorting the housing market. The uproar continued as evidence emerged that Goldman had devised not one but a series of complex deals to profit from the collapse of the home mortgage values. A group of Goldman officials, including Tourre, were hauled before that Senate subcommittee and questioned for ten hours. A couple of months later, Goldman executives were grilled by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Committee, whose chairman Phil Angelides suggested that the firm had helped drive down mortgage securities prices in order to benefit from its short position.

&gt;In July 2010 the SEC announced that Goldman would pay $550 million to settle the Abacus charges. That sum included a payment of $300 million to the U.S. Treasury and a distribution of $250 million to investors that had suffered losses in the deal. The settlement also required Goldman to “reform its business practices” but did not oblige the firm to admit to wrongdoing. The Abacus scandal also led to a £17.5 million fine imposed by Britain's Financial Services Authority and a federal investor lawsuit that is pending.

&gt;In January 2011 Goldman announced that an internal review of its policies in the wake of the SEC settlement had found that only limited changes were necessary. Others apparently saw matters differently:

&gt;In November 2010 FINRA fined Goldman $650,000 for failing to disclose that two of its registered representatives, including Fabrice Tourre, had been notified by the SEC that they were under investigation.
 

&gt;In March 2011 the SEC announced that it was bringing insider trading charges against former Goldman director Rajat Gupta. He was accused of providing illegal tips, including one about Warren Buffet’s $5 billion investment in Goldman in 2008, to hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. (Gupta was later convicted and sentenced to two years in prison.)
 

&gt;In September 2011 the Federal Housing Finance Agency sued Goldman and 16 other financial institutions for violations of federal securities law in the sale of mortgaged-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In August 2014 the agency announced that Goldman would pay $3.15 billion to settle its role in the case (through bond repurchases).
In March 2012 the Commodities Futures Trading Commission announced that Goldman would pay $7 million to settle charges that it failed to diligently supervise trading accounts in the period from May 2007 to December 2009. Later that year, the CFTC fined Goldman $1.5 million for failing to properly supervise a trader who fabricated large positions to try to cover up losses.
 

&gt;Also in March 2012 a Goldman executive director named Greg Smith published an op-ed in the New York Times announcing his departure from what he called a “toxic and destructive” environment at the firm, saying he could “no longer in good conscience identify with what it stands for.”
 

&gt;In April 2012 the SEC and FINRA fined Goldman $22 million for failing to prevent its employees from passing illegal stock tips to major customers.
 

&gt;In July 2012 a federal appeals court rejected an effort by Goldman to overturn a $20.5 million arbitrator’s award to investors in the failed hedge fund Bayou Group who had accused Goldman of helping to perpetuate a Ponzi scheme.  
 

&gt;That same month, Goldman agreed to pay $26.6 million to settle a suit brought by the Public Employee’s Retirement System of Mississippi accusing it of defrauding investors in a 2006 offering of mortgage-backed securities.
 

&gt;In September 2012 the SEC charged Goldman and one of its former investment bankers with “pay-to-play” violations involving undisclosed campaign contributions to then-Massachusetts state treasurer Timothy Cahill while he was a candidate for governor. Goldman settled its charges by agreeing to pay $12.1 million in disgorgement and penalties.
 

&gt;Some good news for Goldman came in August 2012, when the Justice Department decided it would not proceed with a criminal investigation of the firm’s actions during the financial crisis and the SEC dropped an investigation of the firm’s role in a $1.3 billion subprime mortgage deal.

&gt;In January 2013 the Federal Reserve annnounced that Goldman and Morgan Stanley would together pay $557 million to settle allegations of foreclosure abuses by their loan servicing operations (Goldman's share was $330 million).

&gt;In March 2013 the Fed cited ""weaknesses"" in Goldman's capital plan and ordered it to submit a new proposal.

&gt;In December 2014 FINRA fined Goldman $5 million as part of a case against ten investment banks for allowing their stock analysts to solicit business and offer favorable research coverage in connection with a planned initial public offering of Toys R Us in 2010.

&gt;In April 2016 the Justice Department announced that Goldman would pay $5.06 billion to settle allegations relating to the sale of toxic securities between 2005 and 2007. 

&gt;In August 2016 the Federal Reserve imposed a $36.3 million penalty on Goldman in connection with a case involving a leak of confidential government information.

&gt;In December 2016 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Goldman $120 million for attempted manipulation of the foreign exchange market.",cryptocurrency

btc,Honest Money,"What is Honest Money?

Honest: truth, genuine, trustworthy, reliable 
Money: a token of trade

Honest money is a token of trade that is not fraudulent and cannot be falsified in ANY WAY. I think it's reasonable to assume that Honest Money is what most people find valuable and thus, would prefer to acquire (and use as needed). 

After seeing the financial crisis of 2008, honest money is what Satoshi set out to create, and he did: the world's first real form of Honest Money known as Bitcoin. A beautiful, immutable, append-only ledger of transactions called blockchain. You could also think of it as a keeper of records that (as best we can tell for now) cannot lie. After all, who would want to be lied to when it comes to money? 

“But what about gold?” Granted, gold had probably been the best attempt at honest money the world had seen. But it wasn’t perfect honest money. Whether it be from shaving off weight or degrading the quality (imagine a diluted and mixed form of bitcoin!) or gold covered lead bars or falsified papers representing certain holdings of gold, it got close to and was the best at being honest money. 

Until January 2009.

“But what about the US dollar?” The US dollar used to be one of those papers representing gold held in reserve. But paper is too easily counterfeited. [(George Washing sent an emergency mission to find and burn counterfeit dollars sent by the British to destroy America’s economy).](https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/10/faking-it-british-counterfeiting-during-the-american-revolution/)

[Staring in 1933 and ending in 1976](http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-us-gold-standard-2015-12),  paper dollars lost their redemptive value for gold. Today, (like all other fiat currencies) the dollar is just paper representing numbers on a spreadsheet at a Federal Reserve. For now, the trust in that ledger at the Fed and its’ associated dollars, are still highly prized and valued throughout the world. For now.

And you thought the Tether printing was bad.

But there it is again: a concern for honest money.

And bitcoin's immutable, append only blockchain ledger fixed the honest money problem.

Until August 1st, 2017.

Segwit invaded open honest money. Do I really believe Segwit (and thus Blockstream) subverted, diluted or changed the unique and special “honest-money” property value of bitcoin?

Yes I believe it did when it created a complicated layer of separation from honest money. You could even call it a back door of sorts to something other than bitcoin. (“Second layer scaling” is what I like to call “not bitcoin” or also known as the Lightening Network). So I wouldn’t be surprised if the lawyers representing the rights holders of Segwit called many of the NYA signers and/or blew up Garzik’s phone threatening lawsuits to protect their IP. Thus, the death of S2X.

So it turns out keeping Honest Money, exactly that - a true, genuine and reliable money - has proven to be hard.

personalfinance,Should I pursue bankruptcy? 25 y/o with $12k in credit card debt and $35k in federal loans,"I got too confident at too young of an age and put myself in a bad financial situation. I ended up with several credit cards by the time my finances got to a desperate point. I have had many lectures and am already down on myself-- I'd just like to know what my best options are moving forward. I had very unsound financial advice growing up. Here is some backstory:

I was the primary caregiver for my mother who was fighting cancer for the past year, and I lost my job in January 2017 for poor attendance (and a terrible boss). I've now been unemployed for 11 months beyond some contract jobs, been financially delinquent on every one of my accounts for four months, and cannot return to school for the foreseeable future because I owe money to them (I had to drop out of school to take care of my mom as well and they did not grant me a medical withdrawal). 

I owe about $1,300 in 2 checking account charge-offs, $12,000 between the credit cards, and about $35,000 in student loans that are now entering repayment (I've exercised all deferment and forbearance options).

I just moved cross-country to start the next chapter in my own life after caring for my mom, and start a new full-time job next week. I have contacted the above entities to try to make payment plans, but they're not very understanding and the payments are much too high.

I do have a car loan that a family member is currently making payments on and it is not delinquent, but my checking account with the same company is charged off--would this be in jeopardy while filing for bankruptcy? Any advice on transferring a loan to that person? 

Thanks in advance to those who offer advice.",finance

Banking,Goldman eschews bitcoin but wants to help clients crypto-trade while it looks for ways to rig ICO market,"[Full Article on Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-bitcoin/goldman-eschews-bitcoin-but-wants-to-help-clients-crypto-trade-idUSKBN1DU2O4)

&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is trying to figure out how to cater to investors who want to trade bitcoin even though the digital currency remains too volatile for the Wall Street bank to trade itself, according to comments by a representative and its chief executive officer on Thursday.

&gt;At an event, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said there was no imminent need for Goldman Sachs to develop a strategy around bitcoin, which rose to an all-time high of $11,395 on Wednesday only to lose one-fifth of its value on Thursday.

&gt;“Something that moves up and down 20 percent in a day doesn’t feel like a currency, doesn’t feel like a store of value,” Blankfein said at an event hosted by Bloomberg to promote Goldman’s 10,000 Small Businesses endeavor.

&gt;The bank will trade in bitcoin if it becomes more established, trades in a less volatile manner and has more liquidity, he said.

&gt;Even so, Goldman has been looking at ways to facilitate bitcoin trades for customers. It is still doing so, spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin told Reuters in a statement.

&gt;“In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space,” she said.

&gt;Established in 2009 as a digital currency not backed or regulated by governments, bitcoin was mainly supported by technology enthusiasts at first. Its reputation was marred by hacks that lost investors billions of dollars, and by those who allegedly used the currency to mask illicit dealings.

&gt;But as its price has soared, traditional investors have entered the market, and major exchanges plan to introduce bitcoin futures contracts. The technology that underpins bitcoin trading, called blockchain, has also become popular among large financial institutions that see it as a mechanism to more cheaply and efficiently handle other transactions.

&gt;Prominent Wall Street executives and U.S. officials have been split on whether digital currencies themselves are worth spending time and money on.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a “fraud” at a conference in early September, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) CEO James Gorman characterized it as “more than just a fad” at an event a few weeks later.

&gt;Meanwhile, Citigroup Inc (C.N) CEO Michael Corbat predicted governments will issue digital currencies of their own, something a U.S. Federal Reserve official said the central bank is considering at an event on Wednesday. The following day, another Fed official called bitcoin a threat to the financial system.

personalfinance,"Just got a new job, but going back to school in the near future.","Hi Reddit,

I'm fairly new to PF so bear with me please. I'm 22 and recently graduated university with around 30k in federal loans that I plan on paying off around March when my grace period is over. I was recently blessed with a new job paying around 24k a year minus taxes. I only plan on working at this job until I go back to graduate school to get my Master's degree. This job offers 6% matching which I have chosen to put into a Roth IRA. Furthermore, I recently opened an account on Betterment.com and deposited $700 USD. I plan on adding $400 each month to this account for now and won't be touching it for a long time. I will probably increase that amount once I find a job out of graduate school. 

I'm in a fortunate position where I do NOT have to pay for graduate school because my parents are paying. I also currently reside with them and don't have to pay rent.

I have no credit card debt but a few finance obligations that total to $1300 USD. I also owe my parents $6800 USD because I just purchased my girlfriend an engagement ring, but he said that I don't have to pay him back anytime soon.

What would be the best step from here in terms of securing my financial future? I have plans on establishing a few routes of passive income as I make more money in the future. I can live fairly frugally, but I like to enjoy myself (eating out sometimes, activities, gifts for special occasions, etc.)

Thank you so much in advance Reddit!",finance
