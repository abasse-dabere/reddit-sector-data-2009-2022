personalfinance,Need advice regarding elderly mom's finances - no retirement savings - should she sell her house? Or maybe refinance?,"Hello everyone,

I could really use some advice. I'm trying to help my 74 year old mom with her finances. She is thinking about selling her house and I don't know if that is the best course of action. Here's the relevant info:

Mom is 74. Husband passed away 5 years ago. My parents weren't very financially literate and don't have any retirement savings. She lives in FL.

The house is a little more than 1800 sq ft and there is about $123,000 remaining on the mortgage at a 4.625% interest rate. Her monthly payment is about $767.

Besides her mortgage, the only other debt she has consists of about $9500 of credit card debt (split among 5 cards).

Her monthly bills including food, water, electricity, internet, phone, etc total about $500/mo.

In addition to monthly bills she also has:

* Property taxes - $325 every 3 months
* House insurance - $1500 every year
* Car insurance - $525 every 6 months.

She also recently had a small dental emergency and it looks like that is going to cost about $1700.

Her only income consists of social security which is about $1740 / month.

She has about $8000 between bank accounts and cash.

She is thinking of selling the house because she thinks it is too big for her and it is in need of some work that she can't do and that she doesn't think she will have the money to get done. For example, she said it needed a new roof. She may have lucked out, because due to a recent hail storm, she was able to get about $15k from insurance for that, so it looks like that may be solved. But the bathroom also needs some work, there are problems with the tub and shower not working properly. I really don't know the details or what it would take to fix, if she is looking at a whole new tub or piping? Home repair is really not my forte. The AC also died recently and thankfully I have some money put aside so I bought her a new AC system.

She has a friend who is a realtor who thinks with a new roof she could list the house for $205,000 (though Zillow estimates $259,000).

She also recently got an offer from Chase to refinance her mortgage to 3.078% which would make the monthly payment about $523/mo.

I know this is not the ideal financial situation for someone her age to be in. What do you think she should do? Would it be wise to sell the house, maybe pocket $50k and move into an apartment? Or buy something else like a condo?

She's been in the house 40+ years. I don't know if she should sell. The one intangible is that her neighbors have also been there for nearly just as long and they help each other when needed.

What do you all think would be the best course of action? What would you do in this situation? Sorry for the long post, but I hope I provided enough details.",finance
defi,AAVE Ethereum Questions,"In the AAVE app (v2), on the page of a specific token to lend, I connected my wallet, clicked on the ""Deposit"" button, and then it asked how much I wanted to deposit, I entered the info, and it displayed in small print the estimated cost underneath, which was around 20 USD, which seemed very high. 

1. I did not proceed b/c I did not want to get charged, but is that the only fee I would have to pay to deposit, or are there more fees later on?
2. are the ethereum fee amounts independent of the deposit amount?
3. is there a similar cost to withdraw?

Someone else already posted about a similar question, but since there is no long-term data available for interest rates, which makes it impossible to compare products, for someone who is planning on holding &gt; 1 year, for the ethereum network, does anyone have an idea of whether it would make more sense to deposit directly into AAVE or to use something like yearn.finance or Vesper or one of the other solutions, considering that they are going to take out their own fees?",cryptocurrency
finance,"When deciding whether to invest or pay down debt... is it not as simple as choosing the higher interest rate? I.e. given x amount of cash, y% rate of return and z% interest rate, do you generally go with the higher rate: if y&gt;z then invest. If z&gt;y, pay down debt?",,finance
cybersecurity,Recently Started A Job As a Security Assessor,"Hey guys, I recently graduated from school (background in software development and security) and started a job for the federal government as a security assessor. I’m very thankful to have found a good paying and secure job right after graduating from college. With that being said, I wanted to know what the outlook is for security assessors going forward. Will they be in demand in the future? Will they be replaced? How much money can one make with 5-10 years of experience in the field?

The reason I ask is not because I am scared of losing my job, but because I’m scared of becoming stagnant. In my spare time I’m working towards getting my Security+ certification, and then planning to go for some more advanced certs, as well as CISSIP (when I’m eligible). Is this a good plan?


What are your guys opinions on security assessors in the present, and in the future?

*P.S. here is a quick and easy description of my job. I am the one who essentially calculates the level of risk associated with various projects and applications that want to enter the production environment at my organization. The main way this is accomplished is through an SA&amp;A process (security assessment &amp; authorization). During this process, I create a security control profile (based off of the ITSG-33 Framework) which the client provides evidence for. I then assess the evidence for each of these controls and determine the overall residual risk level of the system, which is summarized in various reports that I create afterwards.",technology
CryptoCurrency,Gambling and Crypto: The Perfect Pair,"On the morning of April 15, 2011 I fire up my Full Tilt and Pokerstars account eager to grind out some more cash at the poker tables. I'd been playing online since 2003 with success and used the money to supplement my income. However, on this unfortunate morning, later dubbed Black Friday by the poker community, I was greeted with the logo of the FBI who had seized control of the sites, and more importantly a large chunk of $ under UIGEA. It took over 5 years for the feds to payout the cash that I was owed. That lesson still isn't lost on me today and is part of the reason that I avoid playing online almost entirely these days. 

Like most poker players who played online at some point I got an introduction to BTC and later ETH as ways to get around sites being shutdown. In 2017, while playing poker a buddy mentioned to me that there was going to be an ICO of a new cryptocurrency that was going to allow you to gamble via sportsbetting and most importantly retain control of your own funds. Which coin was it you ask? 

Wagerr (WGR)

Therefore, like any good Cryptocurrency member I DYOR, read the whitepaper, and later got into the ICO. Since 2018 I've been able to retain my own funds and bet on sporting events anonymously. However, Wagerr today isn't like it was in 2018. It was clunky as hell then and initially you could only bet on one event. Back then it really was a gamble because Wagerr was just an idea. Today it's one of the very few crypto coins that has a working product. 

In the last 3 years, Wagerr has been quietly working in the background to improve their technology and accessibility. However staying quiet won't happen much longer as Wagerr (WGR) is an [EGR Marketing and Innovation Award Finalist for 2021.](https://news.wagerr.com/wagerr-egr-award-finalist-innovative-startup/) EGR rewards the most innovative and creative operators and affiliates in the online gaming industry, recognizing those who have pushed themselves to bring something new to the industry. For Wagerr, that means $37M worth of betting volume total on the blockchain, with almost $9M of that being bet since the start of the year when the [sportsbook webpage](https://wagerr.com/sportsbook) was released. If that wasn't enough [commercial bookies](https://news.wagerr.com/wagerr-partners-with-top-match-24/) are starting to use Wagerr's unlimited liquidity to increase their own clients betting limits. For those that are conscious about fees Wagerr has the lowest around due to being on its own blockchain. 

No matter the rage of NFTs and Meme coins crypto came about because of the technology and its with that spirit that I believe Wagerr was created. It solves a real world problem for punters that are restricted by bookies because of where they live. In addition, Wagerr always pays out bets due to the fact that the transaction is placed on the blockchain. Lastly, and most importantly for me, Wagerr allows you to retain control of all of your funds 100% of the time.

All Bets Placed on the Blockchain:

personalfinance,Refinancing Loan - 1 Loan Now Has Negative Balance,"I decided to refinance my private student loans with the same lender (been private since 2018) for a significantly lower monthly cost and lower interest rate. The loan that was paid off has a negative balance of $750. Will the lender just lower the new loan or will they try to send it back to my bank first?

Also, which value is used to assess estate taxes? The cost basis, or the current fair market value? What if the current fair market value exceeds the federal exemption? Do I have any options to reduce the tax burden above the federal exemption?

personalfinance,Reassurance for a young professionals financial situation.,"Reassurance for a young professional

Good Evening,
I am a longtime lurker here. Always entertaining and helpful. I am just looking for some reassurance that I am not missing anything in my current planning and investing.

My situation is as follows:
27 years old
Gross $150,000

Own a home. Mortgage payments is $1,100 a month. Interest rate is 3.2% for 30 years. Owe $160,000 on it. Worth around $300,000. Bought it as a foreclosure and remodeled it myself in 2018-19.

Truck payment of $550 a month for 72 months. 0% interest. $15,000 equity in it.

No other debt. Student loans are paid off. No credit card debt.

Have $35,000 cash in a emergency fund

Max out my 401K every year. Is currently at $42,000

Have a IRAP plan through work where they give me 8% of what I gross a year. I am fully vested and currently have $45,000 in it.

Have a Roth IRA I max out every year that has around $18,000 in it.

I really just started being smart and investing my money for my future in the last 2 years. I understand this sounds arrogant as to many I am doing well. But I am very self motivated and want to maximize my performance. I live well within my means. Yes I know my truck is expensive. But it was my big gift to myself. I’ll pay it off and keep it forever. 

Any advice is welcome. I work in the shipping industry so I have thick skin. Positive or negative they’re both welcomed.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Cardano (ADA) Co-Founder: Crypto Space Will Replace the Traditional Financial System,"Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed he believes the cryptocurrency space will take over the traditional finance system and change the world in the near future thanks to the innovation within it.

In a video published on YouTube, Hoskinson explained why he believes the nascent industry will become a dominant force solving some of the problems that the traditional financial system currently deals with. He said the industry is the “antidote to the excesses, corruption, and nepotism that we found.”

To Hoskinson the traditional financial system has “now been replaced by an industry of creativity and innovation. We’re going to change the world; it’s just that simple.” To the co-founder of one of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, there are simply too many people for the crypto space to be forgotten now, and the “markets are too large” while the “innovation is simply too vast.”

He added that it’s “no longer a question of if, it’s when, and how will these dinosaurs find a way to survive in this new world order.” Hoskinson also said that while cryptocurrencies may still be in their infancy, he sees the industry mature quickly and said that over the next 10 years “there’s going to be more advancement in monetary policy from our industry than the last 100 years of central banks.”

The co-creator of Cardano added that in the next decade he sees the cryptocurrency space become more advanced in financial engineering and the construction of financial products than there was in the last 100 years on Wall Street. Similarly, he sees more progress being made on the constant movement of wealth in crypto than through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and other fixed protocols.”

Hoskinson also believes that while the cryptocurrency market has largely been following BTC’s price movements, some projects may decouple from the flagship cryptocurrency this year. As the Daily Hodl reports, he said:

""Unlike the past cycles in 2017 and 2018 compared to today where we’re at, we’re now in a situation where we’ve decoupled from Bitcoin, and people are starting to realize that while [Bitcoin] was a great experiment, it’s not the end-all-be-all and that there’s more to the story""

As CryptoGlobe reported, Hoskinson has revealed in an ask me anything (AMA) session that he is now a cryptocurrency billionaire, even after the cryptocurrency market crash that saw the prices of some cryptoassets drop by as much as 40% and commented on the drop.",cryptocurrency
solar,Potential for home solar vehicle charging stations?,"Currently I’m in the process of getting a Segway electric scooter, with an e-bike of some sort on my wish list for the future. I’d like to make it even more of a “Green Commute” by using our Southern California weather to offset the power bill, and I was kind of surprised that there doesn’t seem to be any sort of existing prefab solar carport/charging tower available for home use.

 I see solar-roofed carports at newer or upgraded businesses and public buildings, and I see picnic tables with solar panel umbrellas that have charging outlets built in on campuses, but these are all at an institutional scale. On the other end, there’s the hardcore DIY, not-afraid of complex math &amp; wiring, component suppliers, and the camping stuff, but nothing ready-made and “finished looking” bigger than solar backyard lights. 

What I’d like, ideally, would be a kit that could be put together like Ikea, with the panels and weatherproof housing and the battery/controller, with everything guaranteed to work together. Multiple versions depending on how much power uou need (I first started thinking about this trying to find a good solar water feature/garden light power source after seeing the solar water fountain/lighted maps at tge Grand Canyon visitor center, then got interested in e-bikes &amp; working on digital files in the yard.)

Since nobody seems to make this yet, the next best thing would be detailed plan sets of the kind that someone who can build a greenhouse and put in a new light fixture could safely manage. Anything like this out there? The amount of math on DIY sites and the sheer lack of any way to easily compare components makes me feel like I’m better off not risking it!",energy

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
86. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

ethereum,How etherum saved my life.,"So I’ve been having struggles with money for all my life . Been strictly with one bank and used it ever since I was born. I recently started to branch out saving because they didn’t have any interest rates on my savings account . 

Along the way I got way into crypto. I have strong feelings about Eth, positive ones. And so I put a majority of my money in ETH. Which seemed risky at first. But I thought hey, it’s pretty good to have some money off the grid so to say. 

Well today it payed off. The bank has had problems with purchases from a month ago and it put me in the mud. I’m currently -200$ in my fiat bank and couldn’t even start thinking about paying it back. But..

I still have my ETH. That they couldn’t touch because of errors on their side. And that ETH is the one thing that’s paying for everything right now. Food, housing , the whole deal. 
I don’t know why more people don’t believe in crypto, but when I get my salary at the end of this month I think it’s time to invest more into this. It just seems logical. (After clearing my debt ofc) 

Just thought I’d share my positive experience with ETH. :)

edit/note: Fixed some spelling errors to the shorter version because people got butthurt. 
And I’ll also add , No I’m not breaking any laws. My bank has just done things slowly and I’m paying the price, my “debt” will be paid I’m not cheating the system, ETH is saving me by being a side currency I can use for food atm, so I’m not in need of borrowing from a 3RD party. 
Spelling errors aside, I’m not a native English speaker, and I am well read up on ETH. Just.. please be more civil in the comments towards each other :) Thanks for the rewards as well",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,US Regulators Partners to Regulate Cryptocurrency,"• The Joe Biden administration is filled with distrustful bitcoin regulators.

• New signals that US regulators aim to ‘rein in’ the crypto market.

The Joe Biden administration is filled with distrustful bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos regulators. This is because of new signals that US regulators aim to ‘rein in’ the crypto market by enabling partnerships between agencies.

Moreover, the US financial authorities gear up to regulate the crypto market actively. However, there are increasing concerns that a lack of proper oversight risks harming the investors. This may take time because the country’s regulators plan to figure out who has the power to oversee the market, according to Financial Times.

The newly appointed Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, expects that the US officials will work together to set a regulatory perimeter for crypto assets. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that bitcoin is a high-risk investment. Even more, there would be a change in methodology to crypto with the Hsu appointment at this position.

More so, another indication that the US is preparing for a new approach. It is the first meeting that happened earlier in May, which focused on crypto regulations. Moreover, it involves three major federal bank regulators. They include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

According to Hsu, blockchain technology is likely here to stand. However, various platforms create innovative and promising payment processing tools. More so, these also risky, potentially leading to a huge shadow banking process.

Moreover, Hsu took over the OCC from Blake Paulson, who stepped into the role after the January step-down took place by Brian Brooks, a former executive of crypto exchange Coinbase and current CEO at Binance.US. In addition, Yellen, Hsu, and their stances towards crypto are not the only change in the regime that could signal to strengthen the regulatory belt around the crypto.",cryptocurrency

vet,3y/o cat diarrhea and vomiting,"I came back from work today to big diarrhea cat poop outside the litter box, thrown up dry food on the floor and my 3 y/o cat hiding under the bed (something he does when stressed) and the rest of my cats acting normal.
 I knew something was up, so i rushed to the vet. His diagnosis was that other than a slight fever my cat seemed to not have pain or discomfort (which i doubted with the amount of poop on my floor) and asked about if my cat has ingested anything unusual. I told him that my cat stole a small piece of chicken from my lunch yesterday but hasnt ingested anything else as far as i know. He recommended i feed him some digestion royal canin dry food and prescribed pills he also gave him a shot of antibiotic. 
I got home fed him some food, my cat barely ate anything. And just now, 2 hours later he just threw up all the food he ate again and had another runny poop beside his litter box. 
I'm trying not to freak out because my cat seems to be drinking water more often so I'll try not to worry too much about dehydration. My cat is also very needy qnd wants to be pet, Im assuming hes feeling quite unwell and wants some love.
My googling efforts are telling me to probably make him fast for the next day besides water; im very confused because my vet said to feed him the royal canin food and i bought a whole bag. 
I'd appreciate any advice or guidance.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I help co sign my brother a house?,"So first of all I'm financially stable. I just paid off my car and all my credit cards this year and last week i just closed my refinance in my house. I dropped it down from 23  to 15 years with a 2.6% interest. I make 60k alone, my wife is currently unemployed (thank you pandemic), getting UI but will return to work soon, she was a daycare teacher. If she had been working i would've done 10 years. My house payment is only $1300.

Down to the nitty gritty, so my mom is helping my little brother get his own house, he's 31 single and no kids. She has her own house and its paid off. Problem is my dad past away last month and my mom has now lost all her income. She was his caretaker and it'll be another 4 years til she can get his SSI benefits. She's 56.

 My little brother only works 4-5 months out of the year. Its seasonal and he wont work year round, but he does have maybe 10+ years there. He makes give or take $20-30k a year.  My mom will also start working this month but no longer qualifies to help sign. no stable job and/or income.

So they've now come to me, they want me to co-sign, they were in the middle of the paperwork when my dad past away. I need advice on whether i should help or not? I honestly don't think they can afford another house. She guarantees me she can, but those are just words to me.  She barely last year bought a brand new Lexus $55k, my little brother has a new accord, $22k (he has 2 years with it). They're both still paying their cars. She wont rent her house out or the new one they're trying to get.

I can alone afford the payment of the new house myself along with mine. Its gonna be about $1400, from what my mom told me, But i feel like they're gonna struggle and mess up my credit. Could i even co sign right after closing on my house?

If i say yes how soon could i get them to refinance to remove my name? I did tell her the interest rates wont be the same in a couple years and payment will go up, but they are adamant and they really want the house. How will this affect my credit? I want to get a brand new car this year. Also if i sign, and a big if, i told my mom that if they miss payments I'm selling or keeping that house. Would this be possible? can i put an ""or"" in between our names like a car? Another question i have is how will this affect my taxes at the end of the year? will it hurt or help me? i got 4 kids. The main questions i have are if i help sign how will this all affect me on my credit and taxes? Is there any thing that can help me in cosigning....

Thank you for any help/replies and sorry for the long read.

personalfinance,What to do with extra money.,"In the last 2 years was able to save a good chunk of money.

What should I be wary of when looking at taking out a personal loan or transferring the balance to a new card? Obviously it would only make sense if the interest rate is lower, but I also need to borrow maybe an additional $1,000 since I will be in between jobs for a couple weeks while I wait to begin my new gig.

I know interest rates can change rapidly however, my loans are not due for payment till Nov and Dec mostly. The interest rate that the private bank told me is listed in the middle. They are a lot less than my current interest rates which are shown on the sheet as well. I have also made a chart of the amount I would save yearly (at least the 1st year) I think. I'm not a business or finance person so there is a high likelihood I did it wrong.

We have enough to put down 10% out of our own pocket(and keep a sizeable emergency fund) but would need a loan to cover anything above that - right now leaning toward a short term $50K 401k loan ($75 fee, 4.125%, and $31/month maintenance fee). Depending on sale price we’ll likely get back $100-110K after selling our current home. We plan to stay in this home for a very long time.

Our options (closing costs are similar for both loans): 
**20% down** - Take out the 401k loan and come out of pocket $47K. Repay the 401k loan immediately upon selling our current home.

**10% down** - come out of pocket $56K and don’t take out any loan. Upon selling our current home, immediately make a lump sum payment of 10% ($45K) to remove PMI and have the loan recast. According to our lender this would all involve fees of $650 or less. At the 10% option we also have the option to buy down the rate to 2.99% with an extra $1500-1600. We don’t have that option at 20%.",finance
personalfinance,21 Year Old College Student Recently Purchased a Used Truck That Appears to be a Lemon,"Really in a hole right now and not quite sure what to do here.

Back in mid-April, I purchased a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 with 119,500 miles. I made sure that I looked at everything commonly said to go bad with these trucks (which is a lot because it's a Dodge, I know), and everything seemed to check out. I had brought my father with me who is a bit more knowledgeable than I am when it comes to mechanical stuff, he said everything appeared to be okay at a base level. Test driving the vehicle, I had not noticed anything that sounded weird, smelled weird, or anything like that and neither did my father.

Fast forward to the end of April, I noticed a weird squeak coming from the Engine, I took it to the dealer, purchased an extended warranty for it, and they ""fixed"" the issue. This lasted for a few weeks, and then in mid-May, the check engine light came on. I had taken it in, and had also told them about a potential exhaust leak I had began to notice. They tried to tell me the warranty didn't cover any of it and were expecting $1700 to get it fixed (check engine light was a faulty oil gauge fuse or something like that). After 2 days of arguing over the phone, they found some more ""paperwork"" inside of my warranty that would allow it to be fully covered. I went to go and pick up my truck, everything seemed fine. About 5 miles down the road, the check engine light came back on. After the terrible experience I had with the the dealership service center, I looked into whether or not my warranty could be used elsewhere, and it could. I took it to my personal mechanic of 5+ years and spoke to them about EVERYTHING that the dealership had done and I made sure to give them the service receipts. A week and a half later, and they've just called me this morning telling me they have found metal shavings quite literally everywhere, and they told me that this thing is bound to grenade itself.

I put a $5000 down payment on the car and financed $10,000 through the bank. I have an interest rate of 5.31%, so I owe \~$11,500. I've made two payments on this car and I'm being told that this thing is already about to die. I am completely lost as to how I can get out of this car. Should I contact the bank and tell them what's going on with the vehicle? I wasn't sure if this was better suited for here or r/legaladvice. Thank you in advance for any help!",finance
personalfinance,Choosing a mortgage. Less money down or lower interest rate?,"I have 3 different options for my mortgage on a $300k home. I'm having a hard time deciding which one makes the most sense for me and was hoping for some guidance. All of them are 30 yr fixed $285k loans. Seller is paying $9k in closing costs. The higher the closing costs, the lower the interest rate. 

The lender told me the break even times are as follows:

6.7 years between 1 and 2

5.6 years between 2 and 3. 

I'm 27 years old and single and I don't plan on this being a ""forever home."" The home is located in a HCOL area and I imagine at some point I will settle down and move to the suburbs. I was leaning towards option 2 as a good middle ground, but does it make sense to go option 3 to have even more cash in hand? 

**Option 1**: 2.875% with $14,802 needed at closing. $1728 monthly

CryptoCurrency,Understanding Crypto Savings Accounts,"Cryptocurrency has already shown the potential for unimaginable returns over the past few years, but the rise of crypto savings accounts offers the opportunity to earn up to 10% interest on the crypto you already have; And even for those that aren’t invested in crypto, some accounts allow you to deposit dollars and get paid interest in dollars without ever having to buy and sell crypto yourself. But how do crypto savings accounts work, what are the risks, and should you put your money in them?

First let’s talk about what a crypto savings account is not. The name is a bit of misnomer because it isn’t actually a savings account and shouldn’t be treated like one. They lack the regulatory protection associated with regular banks, specifically none of them are FDIC insured. Aside from the lack of FDIC protection, what are some of the other negatives associated with a Crypto Savings account?

* Unlike traditional savings accounts, you will have to pay a fee every time you withdraw funds from you account along with a cap on the maximum amount of fund you can withdraw in a given period. While the caps are high enough that it would not affect most people, if you are placing a majority of your portfolio in crypto and need to use it for a large purchase, this could present a problem for you.
* With the more popular coins, you interest rate will actually decrease with the more coins you have. The dollar equivalent where this threshold starts is typically around the six-figure mark which won’t affect many newer investors. But for those who are invested heavily in the crypto space this can be a substantial negative
* For most of the crypto savings accounts, your interest will be paid back to you in the same coin that you deposited. So there if the coin you are invested in sees a significant loss in value, this could wipe out all of the interest you have earned
* Another potential issue with crypto savings is that it requires you to transfer your private keys over to the business so they can lend out your currency. While many of the new crypto banks tout the high security, they use to protect your keys, you are still giving up control of your currency to someone else.
* Many of the crypto banks advertise the amount of insurance they have to protect your money, but if you go into the fine print you’ll see that the insurance only covers your money in the event of commercial theft or embezzlement. While top companies advertise the extensive fail-safes they have instituted to protect your funds through maintaining a baseline of crypto so you can withdraw at any given time along with the collateral they require to guarantee their loans, they have not yet experienced any massive string of defaults. Ideally, their systems would be able to handle such a situation, but it is still untested.

**Now for the positives that crypto savings offer, and they are definitely appealing:**

* The returns offered easily beat out anything offered by traditional banks, and you would expect them based on the increased risk you take on.
* For the majority of platforms, the interest offered will be the highest on stable coins, with relatively lower interest on the largest cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you like to have a sizeable reserve of stable coins so you can buy into other cryptos when their value drops, this could be a great way to earn interest on your reserves in the meantime.
* Some crypto savings accounts allow you to deposit US dollars without ever having to deal with buying and selling cryptos yourself. This is a great way for investors who want to diversify and reap some of the higher yields from crypto without having to buy and sell different cryptos on their own
* Now is probably the highest interest rates we will see from crypto savings accounts. As crypto becomes more generally accepted and less volatile, interest rates on crypto will go down.

**So when does putting your money in a crypto savings account make sense?**

* As with anything related to crypto, because of the inherit volatility, you shouldn’t invest your entire portfolio or any money that you cannot afford to lose. 
* If you are new to crypto and want to dip your toe in the water without buying crypto yourself, the companies that allow you to only deal in US dollars are a great way to start reaping the higher yields immediately.
* If you are a buy and hold investor of crypto, then putting your coins into a savings account is another way to maximize the overall return, but this still involves taking on another level of risk on top of the existing risk by being invested in crypto.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Opinions Wanted: Savings Vs. Paying off Debt,"I live in a HCOL city, expenses per month roughly are rent $1.1k, Utilities $200, Parking $25, Food $250, Car Insurance $120, Car Note $315, Gym $40, and $300 for fun money. $350 per paycheck goes to what was a HYS but is now only at 0.4%. Admittedly, I don't stick to the budget 100% of the time, but that isn't what this question is for.

I owe 10k on the car with a 2% interest rate. I owe 8k for federal school loans which are 0% until September and I'm still hoping Biden does something about those. I work in an hourly position, roughly take home $1600 biweekly. I already put 17% to a non employer matched 401k, and $250 per paycheck into an IRA. I have 26k in the HYS. I have 3k in my regular bank savings. 

My question is, do I keep the savings or do I pay off the car completely to be clear of that loan? Having less of a safety net might make me prioritize savings, it might now. With the housing market as it is, and prices as they are, buying is not going to be feasible for a long while so I've gotten into the rut of ""it's pointless, why bother"" I know ideally the advice would be: Start budgeting better because the numbers don't add up perfectly, but I'm a single mid 20's female in a city that just reopened after a pandemic, so I'm going to prioritize a little fun before being serious. I'm more looking for people in similar positions and how you chose to do what you chose to do.

We were colleagues before I became his boss so often he's unprofessional and will share too much information, like how he's applying for other positions.  I really need him for his background so I allow the rants and the threats that he will quit. We are short staffed and over worked so he has every right to be frustrated.  

Although his frustration is understandable, I also need to ensure I have someone covering his area.  If I go to management it will end his career as it is a highly coveted position so if we complain or do negative things they will not extend our contracts.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as “transitory” and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.
* “Meme stocks” continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!
* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.

personalfinance,Anyone have experience with PenFed credit union for auto loans?,"As preface, I have never bought a car before. 

I'm trying to plan ahead for needing to by a car sometime in the next 1-2 years. I Have done some reading and saw that financing through a credit union can offer lower APRs and that Pen Fed was a decent option. 

My goal is to be able to be pre-approved for a loan before showing up to a dealership to make the process a bit easier. According to PenFed's site, in order to be able to be pre-approved for a loan without a specific car in mind, you need to be a member for 90 days. So my thought is to open a savings account with them, put a bit of money in it every month for 1-2 years until I need to buy a car. 

My question is basically, has anyone had any experience with PenFed/ have any other suggestions as to not get screwed when trying to buy a car.

deeplearning,Different Image Array Values? Transfer Learning Imagice Classification CNN Model -Imagadatagenerator and Flask Web App Deployment,"I have used ResNet50 transfer learning to train a model for image classification of 5 categories. It has 95%+ test accuracy. I save the model as .h5, .hdf5, .json, etc.  Then I attempt to deploy the model to a Flask Web App using various load\_model methods, but when I do so, the model accuracy is not the same.  I have tried many, many things and the best attempt I have been able to find works well for 4/5 categories, but then the 5th category performs terribly... like it doesn't seem trained at all only on that one category. The images are balanced for each class and are color images. I have been told that it may be the preprocessing pipeline and that I should make sure that the image that flask is giving the model when uploaded to the website is the same as the exact format that the model has been trained on. I have noticed that the image array values include negative values when fed to the model during training/testing from keras ImageDataGenerator, but are all positive values when fed to the model in the flask web app. So I might be on to something here, but just can't quite figure out what exactly is happening and how to fix it.

The preprocessed images from the ResNet model seem to output negative values from imagedatagenerator, whereas the array values of the images in the Flask app are always positive. So maybe some solution lies here where I can make sure both :

I also recently received a new job and HR is asking for information about my filing status and withholding allowance. I am unsure about my filing status (single or married) because domestic partnerships in Oregon receive the same tax treatment as married individuals. Thus, would I select the 'married' status for state taxes AND federal taxes, or just state taxes or neither. Secondly, how many allowances should I claim if I do not have kids and plan on holding two non-overlapping jobs this year? 1 or 2? Thanks for the help!",finance

I called today and they informed me my e-filing refund has been posted May 5th, to of course, my closed account. They said my only option is to go back to Chase and ask to get the money through them.

CryptoCurrency,"A report from the field involving the real identity of Satoshi, Allan Greenspan’s secret plan, $2.5-million bitcoin, and a well-known psychic predicting the future value of every coin.","OK people, strap in. First of all, let me assure you that everything below happened exactly as I’ve written it. I’m a former journalist; I love chatting with interesting people and kinda letting them talk. Today has left me shook, but thoroughly entertained. 

So, I’m in Las Vegas today on a post-Covid vacation with my wife and son. We hop in an a taxi to go to an arcade; my son wants to game, damnit.

Driver asks me, “What do you do for a living?”

I tell him I’m an author.

He says, “I’m a writer too, but my book is only 25 pages. It’s about cryptocurrency.“

I avoid talking much about crypto in real life, but I’m always interested in what people are thinking, and he says he’s writing a book. I lean forward as he turns out of Caesar’s Palace onto The Strip, “Interesting. Tell me more about that.“

He drives strangely: a kind of herky-jerky, gas on, gas off, gas on, gas off, like a drummer in a band keeping the beat with his feet. 

He starts with the big reveal of his book: “Satoshi is 6-7 Asian guys.”

I’m thinking, “Okay, I’ve heard that theory before,” but I don’t say anything. 

He goes on, “You’ll never guess who hired them. It’s a name you’ve heard.”

The whole interaction is strange as hell already, but keep in mind, this guy is around 65, with a kind of washed-out face caked with spray tan that makes him look like a corpse ready for viewing. 

He stares right at me in the rearview—eyes nowhere near the road, but he gave up caring about roads long ago—“Allan Greenspan hired 6-7 Asian guys to create Bitcoin.”

He goes on to explain that Greenspan—who was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve for 20 years, including the years just before Bitcoin’s launch—wanted Americans to be able to save money, given the weakening dollar. He was pissed about the financial crisis, so he hired the 6-7 Asian guys to create it. He concludes, “I’m not 100% sure about Greenspan, but the 6-7 Asians is definite.”

“How do you know for sure about the 6-7 Asian guys?” I ask. 

He looks at me in the rearview again—missing a turn in the process, and says the following as though I’m the dumbest bastard on earth: “America’s best-known psychic, Michelle Whitedove. She’s sure of it.”

I stare back to see if he’s trolling me, but he’s not. This guy is dead serious. 

So now I’m pretty curious. I mean, if I’m chatting with a psychic who knows the identity of the real Satoshi, what’s my next question gonna be? Same as his was: What coins will moon?

“Get out your phone,” he says. “It doesn’t matter how much you have to start with. Take notes if you want to be a multi-millionaire in 5 years.”

He goes on to tell me how the next few years will go, according to this psychic, staring me down after each sentence like he might shoot me if I don’t write it down. And as a former journalist, writing down batshit crazy quotes comes naturally, so I type as fast as I can. 

Here’s a small selection:

“Anytime a currency starts with an X that’s a world currency. Buy as much as you can even if you have to live like a pauper. Why the hell do you think I’m driving this taxi?”

“Most say Bitcoin will be half a million dollars. I have it from two good sources that it will be 1.5 to 2 million.” (I assume one source was the psychic. For the rest of my life I’ll regret not asking who the second was.)

“Bitcoin Cash will be way bigger than Bitcoin.” (I asked whether he thought that was due to BCH becoming more of an everyday transaction coin, which I still wouldn’t agree with but at least it would have had a theory behind it. He shook his head like I was a tool. “Michelle Whitedove.”

On Dogecoin: “shouldn’t be worth what it is but people love dogs and e-coins. So you take the word ‘dog’ and add an ‘e’ for ‘electronic’ and that’s why.”

“XRP is going to at least $1200.”

“Theta is is the big one. Combine Microsoft, Google, Apple and eBay. Bigger than that. Easy. It’s the Godzilla. It’s market cap will be 100x all those companies combined. Sell everything you own and put it in Theta.”

“Stellar Lumens. Easy 10,000x. Imagine buying the whole internet. Ethereum is dead. XLM was at 5 cents on March 3 and already at a dollar.” (Spoiler alert: neither of those prices are even close to correct).

Toward the end I asked him about Cardano, just because it was the biggest coin he hadn’t talked about. “I don’t have time to research everything.”

When we got to the arcade after another few wrong turns, he didn’t want me to leave. He was staring at my phone just to make sure I’d captured his words. I thanked him for the advice and stepped out into the 105-degree heat and asked my wife, “Should we drop all our savings on Theta?”

We got pretty lucky at the arcade. Won a lot of tickets. Exchanged tickets for some toys. 

TLDR: Las Vegas cabbie and well-known psychic are bullish.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage lender's advice knocked 63 points off my credit score,"Hi,

I'm currently in the final stages of closing a home loan. Even though Credit Karma show(ed) my score in the 760's, the lender said that the FICO score was only 720's.   


They wanted me to use Credit Xpert Wayfinder to boost the FICO to lower the interest rate. One of the moves was for my wife to remove me as an authorized user on one of her cards.  


The next day after she removed me, my Credit Karma TransUnion showed a drop of 63 points to 699 and my wife got a bump of 67 points.   


I contacted my loan officer and honestly they've been kind of trying to dodge me as they don't seem to have any answers. I tried to contact TransUnion directly but they would give me no information other than saying they would mail me my scores for $10.   


I'm stuck in a holding pattern until the letter from my wife's card that shows me as removed arrives and then the lender can complete the Wayfinder thing.   


Has anyone seen this before or have any information at all they could give me? This sucks really bad, I went from excellent credit to fair credit.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

1. The msrp of the car is $44k posted on the window. The dealership was trying to sell it for $51k but I managed to bring it down to $50k. Is this still a good price?
2. I traded in my 2020 Sienna and they took it in for 30k. It was in really good condition.
3. I took the optional extended Toyota Care with the price of $2295 for 7 years. They talked me into this saying that if I took this option my interest rate with the bank would be only 4%. Whereas if I were to not take it, my interest rate with a different bank would be 6%.
4. I handed them a 3k deposit. But I just now noticed that on the Vehicle Invoice, there's a N/A next to the deposit row but a 3k next to the Cash On Delivery row. Where exactly did my 3k go to?

personalfinance,Paying off credit card debt - Need help prioritizing cards,"I have multiple cards that I plan to pay over the course of 6 months. I have calculated APRs, balances and utilization rate for each, and decided to go with paying off the highest APR card first to tackle with racking interest rate.

This card happens to be a no preset credit card, which makes me think if I should go with paying off the second highest APR card with the highest revolving utilization rate at 28%. 

I need advice on how to tackle to improve credit score to high 700s from low-mid 700s since I am waiting on a construction and will be closing out mortgage around January where the interest rate will be determined. I do not only want to save on interest but also make sure credit score is improving based on decreased utilization rate. So no preset limit card is a big question since there is no utilization rate reported. 

So following are cards I am not sure how to prioritize:

Card 1: 16.99% APR - second highest APR and 28% utilization rate of revolving balance, will be paid off around 2.5 months paycheck. 

Card 2: 22.99% APR (highest APR), no utilization rate is reported. Will be paid off in 1.5 months paycheck after the first one is paid off. 

Card 3: 6% APR and 12% utilization rate. 1 month pay off. 

Do you recommend paying off first card or the second first? Why and why not? Or do you recommend transferring the second one to a lower APR card (6%) to tackle that later on and increase utilization rate of Card 3 to 25% ?

Any insight is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Tax implications of selling land,"I purchased a lake lot in Minnesota for $105k about 2 1/2 years ago and am likely going to sell.  I live and work in Colorado.  Owning the land has cost me about $10k with property tax and undeductible interest.  I will likely need to work through a realtor who charges 5% and recommends listing at $125k at which point I will basically come out even before taxes but imagine there will be some tax just not entirely sure what that will look like.  I am also considering listing at $140-150k as there are very few lake lots for sale in this highly desirable area.  I'm thinking MN will tax the cap gains at 7% and I'd fall under the 15% federal cap gains leaving me \~$4.5-7k loss.

I am planning on a major career change next year that would likely leave me well under the income to avoid the federal 15% and drop the MN to 5.25% leaving me only $1-2k down. So far it's a simple decision however, I'd like to put a significant portion of the proceeds toward my current home mortgage and refinance a much lower balance to decrease my monthly required payment to ease my cost of living during the career change but my current mortgage is at 2.7% and I think rates are going to get pretty squirrelly soon.

Questions:

1. Do my numbers seem right?
2. Is the realtor fee deducted from the cap gains amount?
3. Is any of the cost of owning the land deductible in some way?
4. I have a time share  purchased as fractional ownership that I rarely use but do bank for future travel. If I sell at a loss (obvious), would I be able to offset the cap gains from the MN land with this loss?
5. What should I be considering that I'm not?

Editing to add: My current loan to value ratio is under 50%, cash infusion and refi would put me 25-30% LTV.  Income hit will likely be 75% and would like to move on this in Q122 when lake lots are not as likely to be selling.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Wasn’t sure if where to ask or discuss this; But i think crypto can help?,"So, no idea where to ask this question as this is a random stoner thought at 12 am as i prepare my next hit. But i just saw some posts in regards to inflation, cost of living and the declining value of fiat. 

It’s no surprise that the USD is losing its value and the price of goods and services have increased outrageously. The fear of a market crash and a repeat of ‘08 is heavy in the air. The cost of living is beating the monthly wages. Housing market is exploding. Asking prices are receiving 20% higher offers. Cost of lumber is through the roof and everything around us is just really feeling like it’s about to pop. (To everyone in 3rd world countries.. i know we have it no where near as bad as you and my thoughts go out to you. But maybe crypto will be the answer)?

What’s going to change this? What’s going to make us go back to a livable society? Where housing isn’t a kidney and left testy. Where I’m able to afford education. Save for retirement while also living a stress-free financial life. Is crypto the answer? 

I’m newbie and haven’t been around for a long while. I’m just trying to figure out how Crypto can truly save 3rd word countries and countries like the US whose inflation is getting out of hand for a first world country as our printers keep going brrrrr. Can crypto be the future with a coin that resembles the USD and never loses value? What about a universal currency that? 

I would like to see crypto take over the way individuals are paid. I’d like to see prices for goods and services decrease and for me (in my younger 20’s) able to afford a house and mortgage. To live a peaceful life. Or will i have to continue hoping my coins moon or I get lucky in life? It’s a shame the american dream is slowly being lost because of how much $ you have to put up off the get go and banks not trusting me.. yet i can take a student loan out for 40k and a 9% interest rate.. 

I’d love to hear thoughts. Where do you think crypto will go? Will it be a universal currency in the future? Or will it continue to be treated like a shit asset until the “whales” can continue to get in and fuck it up",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Sentiment: Banks are Ripping off Customers. Proof: Compare their interest rates to that of DeFi Stablecoins. (Agree or Disagree?),"The Bank of America ""Advantage Savings, Platinum Honors"" account only gives 0.05% interest rate. That is their highest tier by the way, the lower tiers give 0.01% interest.

([https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/bank-of-america-savings-rates/](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/bank-of-america-savings-rates/))

On the other hand, DeFi applications like Aave provide up to 12% interest for Stablecoins.

For example, it is 11.50% for DAI on Aave AMM Market, and 12.30% for USDC.

([https://app.aave.com/markets](https://app.aave.com/markets))

# Conclusions

Bankers are taking the bulk of the profit, and only distributing the scraps to customers. 

DeFi eliminates the middleman, hence the bulk of the profits go to the customer.

Even considering that DeFi rates will eventually stabilize and go down, there is a huge discrepancy here between 0.05% and 12%, it is a 240X difference.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Earning interests on crypto – my experience,"Disclaimer: I only own BTC, so my review doesn’t take other coins into account. In this context, platforms pushing to earn rewards in their own token are penalized.

I don’t put all my eggs in one basket, so here is what I do.

1) 60% of my BTC are in cold storage (Ledger Nano)

2) 20% of my BTC are at Hodlnaut.  
 Hodlnaut is my favorite platform. They are based in strictly regulated Singapore. They offer the highest rates for my BTC, 6.2% APY paid out weekly. Our BTC are secured in cold wallets, they use Fireblocks. If this is important to you, they also have an instant swap between different coins function. Support is very responsive. For the moment, they have a small withdrawal fee (0.0004 for BTC), but they are planning to offer one free withdrawal/month. If you are introduced by a friend (like me), you receive $20 if you deposit $1,000. Security is top notch: each time you make some action, you are alerted by email (whitelisted address modification, deposit and withdrawal amounts and transaction hash, connection to the website, etc.). Platform is nice and clean.

3) 15% of my BTC are at Ledn. They are based in Canada. They recently received an excellent review by prohashing. However, they are only my nr. 2. Unlike Hodlnaut, the emails they send you don’t contain enough information for me (no mention of the transaction hash or amount when you deposit, no email when you connect, no mention of the address when you change the safelisted addresses). Some may think this is great for privacy, but all the other platforms send you this information. Interest payouts monthly, 6.1% APY. Withdrawal = miner fees. You can refer a friend, but he must take a loan. Platform is minimalist.

4) 0% at BlockFi. BlockFi was my favorite, but they recently had some problems distributing erroneous rewards. Also, withdrawals are not instant, and interest rates are lower than the two mentioned above. One free withdrawal/month. If you withdraw often, it is very expensive. You are also rewarded when you introduce friends. BlockFi is the biggest player in the game. Platform is very nice, with instant swap function like Hodlnaut.

5) 5% at Celsius. I don’t like Celsius because if you don’t accept rewards in their CEL token, interests are low. BUT from time to time, they offer some promo codes, like $50 if you deposit $400. All the withdrawals are free. You also receive some good money if you refer a friend.

6) 0% at Nexo. Same problem: you have to use their token.",cryptocurrency

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts.

You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

personalfinance,1099-C and amending a return,"I did my taxes about 2 weeks ago. And just now I was sorting through my mail and found a letter from a credit card company, that I thought was junk mail (doesn't look THAT much different from another predatory credit card offer). I had a credit card with them years ago, and couldn't make the payments on back in 2014. Opened the letter and its a Cancellation of Debt 1099-C from back in January. Apparently they discharged the debt on Dec 31st, making it part of tax year 2020.

I did research on Google/reddit and in an old thread with the same situation someone mentioned that the OP should amend their return ASAP lest it trigger an automatic audit. I just went on my FreeTaxUSA account and went to amend, and it says on there to hold off and wait for the IRS. Basically says that the IRS will match up 1099's and just send you a notice with your updated balance owed. Also says that if I amend before they send anything out, it can cause confusion in their system. Before looking online I was already thinking what FreeTaxUSA is recommending, to wait for a notice.

Also, the debt was $2600. I made $22k last year, and currently owe $200 in federal. My marginal tax rate is 12% on this $2600, so I'd owe another $312 in taxes??? Does my standard deduction or anything else help with this, or is it just a raw increase of my tax burden since all that is already factored in on the $22k I made?

Is there anything with COVID aid or forgiveness that helps with this?",finance
stocks,HRTX Summer Pop,"HRTX Summer Marketing DD

TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery. 

Edit: UPDATE 6/3

New Motley Fool commentary.

“Entering last month, Heron Therapeutics had two FDA-approved drugs on the market. Both were designed to treat nausea in cancer patients. But in mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Heron's post-surgical pain relief drug Zynrelef. The therapy combines a local anesthetic with an anti-inflammatory drug, and is administered as part of the surgical process. The delayed-release medication provides pain relief for 72 hours after surgery. Heron management believes this is key in helping post-surgical patients avoid the use of opioid pain medications.

The FDA approval was given for a limited set of surgeries: bunionectomy, total knee replacement, and a type of hernia repair. Those account for more than 2.1 million procedures annually, with 60% of those performed in an outpatient setting. Management has indicated it sees the potential for Zynrelef to hit $450 million in annual sales. Heron's other pain management candidate, HTX-034, recently entered phase 2 clinical trials. It aims to extend the pain relief to five to seven days. 

Given a boost from a federal budget that includes significant funds for research and raising awareness about addiction, Heron's opioid alternatives could quickly gain wide adoption in the medical community. Beyond public service campaigns and a speedier approval process, agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could create incentives for surgeons to use opioid alternatives like Zynrelef. There could also be regulatory support for its use in additional indications. There is already a precedent for Zynrelef's use beyond those initial surgeries approved by the FDA. The drug is authorized in 31 European countries for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. All of this adds up to a significant opportunity for Heron Therapeutics to grow its sales.”

investing,HRTX Summer Marketing - Bullish Q3,"HRTX Summer Marketing DD

TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery.

2. As long as one can generate more returns than the cost of debt, the debt should be used to increase wealth.

Electricity,Trying to understand how wind turbines connect to the grid,"Hi! I've recently become really interested in wind turbines and more generally how the power grid works. However after a lot of reading I'm still struggling to understand a few things.

So starting with the wind turbine: depending on many factors (wind speed, air density, ...), I understand that it will generate a certain amount of power.

My first question is: does the voltage produced by the wind turbine change depending on those factors as well? From what I understand of the laws of electromagnetism, the induced voltage depends on how quickly the magnetic flux changes inside the turbine. So if my turbine is rotating very quickly, the magnetic flux caused by the magnet inside is changing quickly, which means the induced voltage will be higher. Does this make any sense, or am I completely on the wrong track?

My second question if about frequency: if a turbine can rotate at varying speed, the frequency of the current it generates will vary. How do we make sure that the output current is, for example, 60 Hz AC? Do we transform it into DC and back to AC?

My third (and last) question is probably more complex. I'm struggling to visualise in my head how wind turbines are actually connected to the grid. It's hard to explain, but I guess my question is what are the wires that come out of the turbine connected to?

From what I've read online, they go to a substation, where the current is transformed into high voltage and fed into the grid. I just don't understand how this works to be honest, how the electric current from my turbine is fed into the grid where there's already current from other power stations... I guess what I'm looking for is a simple model of how this works, a circuit diagram that shows how the different power sources are connected to the grid... Does anyone know of such a thing?

retirement,Choice of lump sum or annuity on pension fund,"I have a pension fund that I can choose to withdraw in either lump sum, or an ""annuity-like"" (at 7%).  I've been sitting on it for several years and since it is earning a low steady interest rate, I used that to offset putting all my other retirement assets into stock funds and ETFs.  Now I'm 59 and wanting to retire soon, and trying to decide which way to go with it.

The total of the pension fund is only 13% of my total retirement assets and less than 10% of my net worth, so moving it to an annuity doesn't dramatically change what might be left to pass on after my wife and I are gone.

I'm not a fan of annuities in general, but this would pay out about 7% on a double life annuity plan.  Using a 4% draw strategy, the overall monthly income difference between taking the lump sum vs. annuity is 10% higher with the annuity plan (now).  If I retired now and didn't start SS until I'm 67, it would also require me to take less out in the non SS years and seems to recoup the retirement asset loss from converting it to annuity fairly quickly.  Also, when I get to starting SS, the SS + monthly pension would pretty much cover our expenses.

I'm trying to convince myself to take the decrease of 13% in retirement assets and do the annuity.

Is there anything I'm missing here?  Take the lump sump or get the 7% payout during retired years with nothing after double life?

stocks,The pretense of knowledge: my bear thesis.,"***""The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning news""***

One thing I'm exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than ""experts"".  Obviously this is not always the case, and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff it's best just to follow the restrictions and what not.  But immunology is deeply rooted in science, and is easily testable.

I have a degree in economics, so I'm not one to sling the profession through the mud.  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic.  F.A. Hayek talked about this.  Economist William White, who predicted the '08 crash, also talked about this.  I'm not the only one saying it.

I recently read in a book, *The Shadow of the Wind,* by Carlos Ruis Zafón, a passage that struck me.  I will provide the original text in Spanish, for those who speak it, as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translation:

*""Era un buen lector de la historia y sabía que el futuro se leía en las calles, las factorías y los cuarteles con más claridad que en la prensa de la mañana""*

*""He had a good read on the future, and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets, in the factories, and in the troop quarters than in the morning news.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**The '08 Crisis**

When the real estate bubble burst in '06, and the financial system came toppling down in '07-'08, economists and central bankers were left scratching their head.  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming, but in the [Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf), they debunked this, and said that there was plenty of warning.

People on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming.  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming.  People at ratings agencies saw it coming.  But at all levels they were ignored.  There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.

But Michael J. Burry saw it coming.  He was a bit of an outsider, and it's no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say, ""wait a minute"".

Peter Schiff saw it coming.  I have mixed feelings about him, as he has strong (and oftentimes incorrect, IMO) political views.  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesn't pull any punches.  He didn't buy it when Bernanke said ""subprime is contained"".  A lot of people did.  The market did.

&amp;#x200B;

**2021 - Anecdotes from the ground**

My mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her $11,000 for it.  It wasn't in bad condition, but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parents.

She told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise.  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out, but no problem or solution was found.  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership, and they even took it for a test drive.  No problem.  They were willing to give her the full $11,000, no more questions asked.

To me this looks like speculative behavior.  Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to *increased demand*, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in.  Sound familiar?

How about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?

What about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? Look at the meme stocks.  Look at Archegos.  Look at Tesla.  Speculation is running rampant right now.  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say ""let's not overcomplicate it, it's goin' north!""  Ie, the trend is up right now, so it's going to keep going up.  What in the world kind of analysis is that?

In addition, the S+P 500 hasn't had a serious downturn since 2008... remember, stocks always go up, right?  Covid doesn't count.  It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.

I follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money (highly recommended, this sub won't let me link it).  The main analyst, Paul, has been investing since just before the dot-com bubble.  He knows that it's NOT normal for stocks to always go up.  This guy isn't an economist.  He's not a new investor.  He's not some pundit.  He's an investor who has been battle-tested.  He's a guy on the ground.  He knows this isn't normal.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Stubbornness of Ineffective Paradigms**

In my own job as an English-as-a-foreign-language teacher, I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that don't work.  I had one friend today tell me that ""this is coming from a place of ignorance, but I don't think their method of focusing on grammar works"". I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their ""expert"" methodology.  He is correct, as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real English.

It is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students' learning who simply end up getting in the way.  We can't engineer the ability to speak a foreign language... all we can do is provide contact to it, and just like a baby learning their native tongue, eventually it starts happening.  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learn.

And if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment, why not in others?  How about the war on drugs?  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs?  Does it make any sense?  No.  But people don't like to change their views - they cling to them.  And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.

F.A. Hayek would call this ""the pretense of knowledge"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I don't know what's going to happen, and hey, I could be wrong.  Maybe stocks will always go up and we'll just avoid any major crises from here on out.  It could happen.

The issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that ""hey, I could be wrong"".  To them it's science.  Physics.  Math.  That's the economy; that's the market.

But the market is not science.  We can do our best to try and understand it, but IMO, part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely, and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitations.

I'm predicting that this situation is not sustainable, and I'm predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008.  I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis.  I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.

I'm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong.  I'm still learning and developing my theory every day.  But I am playing things very, very conservatively.

I am going to take the step to post this, because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct, or learn by being proven wrong.   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything, and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoever.

Good luck to everyone.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off low interest loan,"Hi - I have $32k left in student loans at a fairly low interest rate (3.8%, but looking to see if I can refinance at an even better rate), have a low interest 30 year mortgage (2.6%) and car loan (.9%). I would almost certainly do better than any of these rates by putting money into retirement or a reasonably balanced brokerage account (that I don't plan on touching for several years). Is there any reason where it would make sense to pay off any of this debt instead of investing (we have no other significant higher interest debt)? I don't believe there is, but there's a part of me that would like to see some of these monthly payments wiped from my ledger. Thanks!",finance

It turns out that the second fee made to my count was an authorization charge to ensure my account had the money I needed to pay the dealership. To sum it up, I made a $300 payment for a reservation to reserve a car and the merchant has already received the full amount. However, there is still a hold on my account for that exact amount that has not only overdrawn my account, but it also has taken the remaining money I had saved and it threatens to take my payment from work for this week as well. I have gone back and forth with everyone involved, PayPal, Bank of America, and the merchant I sent the payment to, but each of them is blaming the other for the charge. At this point talking with any of them isn’t going to resolve the situation and now I fear that it will take weeks before I get my money back.

personalfinance,Applying for Student Loans with a Thin Credit Report,"Hey r/personalfinance,

So I'm a prospective college student. At this point, I've received the maximum I can for FAFSA loans (including the additional $4k in unsubsidized loans because my parent was rejected for the PLUS loan). However, I am still needing more money to close the gap in funding. My parents are unable to provide much at all towards my college education, but the FAFSA says they can (high EFC), so schools offered me rates that are difficult for me to match without loans.

Having said that, I opened a credit line. I have a credit card with Discover which has been open for about a month now. This is my first ever credit line so it's the beginning of my credit report. I've kept my utilization under 10% and pay it off in full at the end of billing periods. 

The main use of this card is to bulk up my score a bit, so I can begin to be financially independent and apply for loans on my own. However, by the time I'm in college, I will only have had 1 line of credit for \~4 months. 

That leads me to my question: Are there any loans I could be approved for with such a thin line of credit? If so, roughly how much? And do you have any other tips on how I could close the gap and make this happen?

I've already explored all of my options involving local scholarships, and have the maximum amount allowed for federal loans. I suppose I could ask for more aid from my school, but I'm not too sure how to approach that conversation.

(edit: this time last year, my checks after all taxes, savings, etc were about \~$800-$900)

each check, 6% goes into a 401k that i recently enrolled in and $50 goes into my savings account. given those numbers, it's about $100 or so that goes into savings each check.

my debt is about $15,500 spread across 5 credit cards, all with interest rates above 19%, with the lowest balance being $1,300 on a card (capital one, unsure what the minimum payment on this one is) and the highest balance being $3,600 (paypal, min payment $130) on a card.

However, I’ve applied to consolidate my loans and have been denied multiple times due to the delinquency even with a co-signer. I assume this will also prevent me from leasing a car or buying a home. The loan company that reported the delinquency, Cornerstone, has since shut down and passed all loans to FedLoan. I have disputed the delinquency with FedLoan multiple times and keep getting denied because they did not report it and do not have the records of my Cornerstone loans.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper.

Basically I currently work in management consulting. I'm 29, I've been to grad school, and I make about $75K a year. My bonuses are usually around $10K - $15K. Standard benefits like a 401(k), not very good high deductible health insurance, all that. I kind of hate the term, but a lot of people in this industry call consulting a ""career accelerator"" so within ten years I could probably move into a management role either at my company or at another company.


I interviewed for and received an offer for a job with the US federal government, and I am TORN. The base salary would be about the same, and my cost of living would probably be around the same. I'd be moving/relocating within two similarly priced cities on the east coast. Obviously the government job has much better benefits like health insurance, the thrift savings plan, and the retirement pension. That's all pretty amazing. The growth/advancement would be slower, though obviously. Moving up one pay step every year or two but with opportunities to move laterally in government. Maybe.

My hours aren't too bad right now either despite working in consulting, so work life balance is probably around the same. What else should I be considering?

&gt;  
&gt;The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, held $5.21 billion of bonds from companies including Whirlpool Corp. , Walmart Inc. and Visa Inc. as of April 30. In addition, it held $8.56 billion of exchange-traded funds that hold corporate debt, such as the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A Fed official said the sales should be completed by the end of this year. Net proceeds will be remitted to the Treasury Department.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed’s corporate-debt holdings are distinct from its $7.3 trillion balance sheet of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The central bank is continuing to purchase those types of assets to the tune of at least $120 billion a month as part of its monetary-policy goal of holding down borrowing costs until the economy recovers further from the pandemic.

Bitcoin,Devaluation of the Lira and possible hyperinflation in Turkey,"So, i'm not usually a great critic of inflation and arguments from hurr durr conomics as in ""the fiat system is taking away my freedums"", but there is one particular event as of right now that, similar to Venezuela, could let people turn to Bitcoin and crypto out of necessity, for the lack of an actual functioning national currency.

That event is the refusal of Erdogan and his followers that he set up the turkish central bank with to lower interest rates. Erdogan refused to lower the interest rates of the central bank as it would crowd out businesses that rely on the infusion of more money into the market.

That is done in an effort to force economic activity and the jobs that come with it.

But with the prior lowering of production output in major western economies like turkey in the pandemic, the devaluation of the turkish Lira that comes with this step will not just lead to a lower exchange price for turkish goods and services, as those will need to be produced first.

Instead, turkish production companies holding Lira will simply not have the purchasing power to buy their raw materials on the international market to even get production going. This will be particularly problematic with natural ressources often doubling and tripling in price, now that producers are buying out markets to get started again with the lift of lockdowns in western economies.

This means that not just will the turkish Lira be devaluated in relation to it's market capitalisation, but the general output of the turkish economiy will stay low and most likely even lower in comparisson to pre-pandemic levels.

More currency in circulation, less stuff to buy in that currency. Both sides of the inflation equasion are affected. This is screaming hyperinflation.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar)

Now, before the ban in Turkey, Bitcoin had a relatively strong distribution in turkey. It had a lot of miners and speculants looking for a quick buck. It could very well turn out that the turkish will, out of sheer nessecity will have to turn to alternative currencies and with that they will turn to Bitcoin and other crypto.

Now, i thought about trying to justify making money from the suffering of the Turkish people by speculating in Bitcoin, but i really do not feel compelled to say sorry. I simply don't like muslims, so i'm fine with them having to buy the coins that i mined for a price that will probably ruin them because they don't have a choice.

What i only wanted to say with that, really:

Prepare for another moonshot. A major industrialised nation is going into hyperinflation and billions of dollars worth of purchasing power of the turkish people could flow into crypto.",cryptocurrency

I make $75k/year. I have $17,000 in an HYSA and $25k in retirement accounts. I max out my HSA and IRA and contribute 6% to a 401k. 

Currently, I pay $720/month on a private student loan with 4% interest. With my current plan, I have about 9 years left.

I started looking into refinancing (again) to rid my co-signer of the burden and was pleasantly surprised with what I got approved for. I could keep my $720/month payment but get a 3.15% fixed APR. It's a sliding scale where I can choose my monthly payment and the interest rate adjusts accordingly, so on the other end, I could pay $395/month at a 3.95% APR. 

I **know** that by lowering my monthly payment I would be freed up to contribute more to my 401k (maybe even max it out) and easily come out ahead, but I'm having a hard time staring at the ""20 year loan term"" that theoretically comes with the $395/month 3.95% APR plan (theoretically because I also know I could always pay more each month and pay it off earlier). 

I guess I just need someone to talk some sense into me (and make sure I'm not missing something glaringly obvious). Psychologically my impulse is to get rid of this student debt ASAP but I don't want to miss out on big gains because of my neuroses. 

Thank you so much! I friggin love this subreddit so much &lt;3",finance

personalfinance,Why is it important to get a good deal on a house if the alternative is paying a landlord?,"Im a recent grad making decent money. I know the housing market is not great for a young guy with currently modest savings, but I'm wondering why I'd ever pay a landlord longer than I have to? Interest is low, so even if I overpay by like 10% is it not better than another year+ of throwing money at some apartment complex? At least I'm putting a lot of my money into equity with a house, right? And if the market gets worse and I can afford another, I can rent the first out and get any cap rate higher than my interest rate, I'm sure?

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps, I'm not a big spender, have a decent salary, and fantastic job security.

personalfinance,Question on delinquent payment history,"Looking to buy a house been at 720 for 9 months. Payed off cc last summer. Saving.
Question is this if I pay off my two fed loans I was delinquent on do those missed payment history go away? What else can I do to remove this 12month of nonpayment history. 

Little more detail
. I've pulled my reports and I had an almost year where I ignored my fed student loans (I didnt pay attention they came off deferment). This was on two separate ones. They both show 12.months each that I missed payment. I have the money to pay both of them off now. 

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Pay off debt for the interest rate or monthly payment?,"Long story short, which would you rather pay off first. 

$20k student loan at 5% interest @ $125 per month
$20k auto loan at 1.9% interest @ $426 per month. 

Logically, I'd pay more in the long run on the student loan. However, getting rid of the car payment gives me a lot more money flexibility once paid off.

gaming,"You know it’s bad when the PS4 subreddit is complaining about games being cross-gen. I’m a PS5 master-race dude but loved my PS4.

That said, I thought when I got to the PS4 sub Reddit people for the most part would be overwhelmingly happy. That was not the case and I’m actually really happy to see it, because I want games to move forward not be held back by hardware that’s what are we looking at, 9 years old?

personalfinance,I'm looking for a new savings and checking account,"I'm looking for a new checking and savings account. I'm interested in the online options due to the lower fees and higher interest rates. 

Other features that I would find useful:

-  No Foreign Transaction Fee. I have a Master Card (credit) that has this, but it would be nice to withdraw from ATMs in another country without paying a fee. 
- Limited Number of Other fees.  Furthermore, the automatic ability to draw money from my savings account if I overdraft instead of being charged a fee. 
- Cash deposit ability.  I rarely have to do this, but it would be nice to have the option to go to an ATM and deposit cash and not have to do it in some roundabout way.  
- ATM fee reimbursement. The ability to use any ATM would be nice. 
- Large ATM network

Does anybody know of what options check most of these boxes? Or better yet, where I can find an article or chart comparing features of various banks?

CryptoCurrency,I believe in the future of crypto more then just about anything else. Ive held since September 2017. But today i had to sell.,"Well im not gonna tell my whole life story, but hopefully it can help some of yall out, as reading alot of yalls stuff has helped me out over the years. 

short story, i saw in sept of 2017 bitcoin was making new highs. Having herd of bitcoin in 2012, and seeing it still be relevant, and  at 2500$,i figured i needed to look into it. 

so after a week of starting to dive down the rabbit hole, i did the logical thing. i quite my job, lived out of my car, and spent the next 3 months glued to the computer. i had to learn finances, economics , computer science (i built a computer and actually learned linux as well as ran a bitcoin node) as well as a lot more. all the while bitcoin is running to 20k, and everything and everyone is going crazy. it was an insane time,  and ill never forget that feeling. 

i didnt buy that much before it went parabolic, and my highest i bought some bitcoin was at 9500$. fast forward a month, and the beginning of the bear market starts. but im actually in it for the tech. i really believe its the only way for a peaceful revolution. i had taken some profits (again small  amounts) so i never sold and watched my alts and bitcoin go down 50-90%

but every week i would dca in. every chance i got some extra cash i bought some alts. after a couple months of living out of my car i had saved up a bunch of money so i moved into an apartment. got a better job with my new self taught tech and finance skills so i had more money i could afford to throw into crypto. not a lot, but an extra 10$ here and 20$ there. 

bear market was rough. lotta days i thought i fucked up and i might be wrong. lots of days i doubted every decision i’ve made. people laughing and asking how my crypto was doing.   but i really believed in this stuff, and i never stopped learning about it. i listened to Ivan and lark as well as many others everyday, and i gotta be honest that really helped from a mental perspective. 


anyways 2021 comes around and things area great. havent sold anything, cause i believe in the tech, and wanna hodle untill i can just spend my crypto and dont need to sell it for trash fiat. 


but today i had the opportunity to buy some land. not a lot, but its land. so i had to sell some of my crypto for it. not gonna lie after i hit the sell button i almost got sick. i dont want to sell, but ive wanted a small piece of earth as my own all my life. and if it wasnt for crypto i wouldnt have this chance. 

now while i did sell a couple different crypto assets, i immediately used the funds to buy  eth, and did a cdp to get dai to sell for cash to pay for the land. my  liquidation price is extremely low so even in a bear market im safe. and this way i wont miss out completely on the insane bull later this year.  i just gotta rely on eth to hopefully make up for the potential gains of cryptos i sold. 

anyways i just wanted to tell this story cause i know there are lots of yall who are new to this, and while im not a smart man, i wanna share the biggest tips that have helped me here. 

 you can get rich in a week, or lose everything in a second. only play with money you can lose. in fact consider it lost until you sell and receive your good/product/service or trash fiat. dca and time in the markets beats trying to time the markets. 

make a plan with contingencies, and stick to it. 

day trade works for 10% of people, and unless your willing to spend alot of time to learn, dont dabble with more then 50$-100$ trades. same for leverage. 

diversify, have a couple major plays and 10% of your bag should be moon shots. 

find good quality sources of information and vet them. so much trash crypto tubers and  podcasts. but theres amazing sources for practical and solid knowledge. just really do research and vet whoever your listening to 

and most important learn. i listen to an hour or two of crypto related content every day. practical knowledge and skills are something that doesnt go up or down, it only increase your value. 

dont let crypto be your life. have passions and hobbies so on the  red days you can put down the screen and do something fun or productive to  distract you. 

and finally, no one ever went broke taking profits pulling out a little here and there is never bad. but never sell everything , always keep a small moonshot bag. and have a hodl bag of quality projects  and stick to holding them for at least 4 years. 



anyways i hope this helps someone out.i know most of the is just the usual tropes and sayings. but ive found great wisdom and power behind these mantras .  i hate to sell some of my assets ive held for s long, and it really hurt. but im still in crypto, and i will never fully leave, cause im in it for the tech😸 and the peaceful revolution it brings. good luck y’all!!!




tldr: A paranoid weird and ignorant guy found out about magic internet money, and was crazy enough to see what it might bring, and through luck, some hard work, stubbornness, and a powerful hate/distrust of the federal government and banking system, through four years of preservation, managed to leverage crypto to buy a small plot of land and fulfill a lifelong dream.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,The Federal Reserve has discontinued the weekly release of money supply data and you should be very worried,"In 2006, the Fed decided to abort publishing the M3 stock, dismissing it as ""irrelevant and not being part of monetary policies for a long time""

But the truth was, M3 was increasing at a much more alarming rate (nearly 2x) than M2 following the dot-com bailouts in the early 2000s. Just as the Fed and pro-administration pundits habitually make sure to focus on whatever consumer price measure increases the least to play down inflation, the Fed wanted to divert public attention towards a money supply measure which was increasing at a relatively lesser rate at the time - the M2 stock.

We all know what happened 2 years later.

Now fast forward 15 years, this is what M1 and M2 look like

&amp;#x200B;

[M1 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/uu489cywuz271.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228f277cf10f073b536140e25ce9ffa87edef693)

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/5ambkp70vz271.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684238dad9f8178843e5bebb2239b572bef6dd63)

As you can see, M1 stock, which is all the loose money in active circulation plus your checking bank deposits, is melting faces and going to the moon!

**M1 has risen from $4 trillion in March 2020 to $18 trillion in February 2021.**

M2, which is M1 plus savings deposits and funds, is up as well but not as much. This is a clear indication that people have been forced to abort saving/investing.

Both these metrics are a bad look for the economy. So for the time being, the Fed has stopped the weekly release of this information while they figure out how to spin this in their favor just like they did in 2006. Again, we know what happened 2 years later.",cryptocurrency

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown JUN 03 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Vitalik and the ETH documentation are implying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking](https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking)

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation problems - not sure how to proceed,"TLDR: I'm stuck in a catch 22 and I have no idea how to get out of it. I literally can not refinance my debt to lower my monthly payments because my monthly payments are too high. I privately financed $35k in 2019 to purchase a project house. Things would have been fine but COVID screwed up a lot of timelines/costs/etc. The house isn't as far along as it should have been by now and I've had to use some of my credit cards to keep things going. I'd like to refinance between 20-40k in debt to lower my monthly payments. There is basically nothing negative on my credit reports other than the amount of debt/monthly payments. Several attempts to refinance to lower my monthly payments have gone nowhere because my monthly payments are too high.

Backstory: I got the chance in 2019 to buy a house that needed a lot of cosmetic work and a couple of smaller serious repairs.  I work in housing and I am able to do a lot of the work either myself or via contacts/friends who I can trade favors with to get a lot of benefit to sweat equity. I looked it over with a colleague and was able to put an estimate together that I could get most of the work and upgrades done for a total that would be at least 10K below it's value when completed, and maybe more (the neighborhood is slowly improving, lots of houses getting worked on and a hospital a couple blocks away is expanding).

I wasn't able to use a traditional mortgage because the sale price was very low ($25k, in a neighborhood with average home prices around 70k) and the banks I spoke to would not loan me above about 80% of the assessed value of the house unless I had contractors (approved by the bank) with bids in hand to spend the extra money to make improvements/repairs. I would have lost out on thousands of dollars in potential value via sweat equity, and at the time that didn't make any sense. If I'd known then what I know now about how the last year and a half were going to go, I might have said screw it and done it differently. but that's besides the point now.

So I took out personal loans to buy the house. The total was 35K across two loans, and the interest rates were not great. 10k at about 15% and 25k at about 20%. That said, they were short term, 3 years each, and the total payments would have been about the same if I'd done 35k at 10 years/6%, which is in line with what some of the secured loans I was looking into would have been (the rates on a mortgage to buy the house would have been high because I wouldn't be living there immediately, since it needed too much work to make that feasible).

Then, of course, 2020 happened. I had contractors lined up for two projects that are outside of my skill set - adding a bathroom and repairing some damage to the foundation of the kitchen (not the main foundation, the kitchen was an addition done about 20 years after the initial construction). Those both got pushed back because the contractors scaled their operations back last year, and material costs have gone nuts for the last several months and slowed things down even more.

So, here's where I currently sit:

I make about 56-57k a year. I have about 74k in debt - \~12.5 k in a car loan, \~16k in student loans, most of which is currently on hold thanks to the covid relief programs, and the remaining \~46k is in unsecured debt - either credit cards or personal loans. I own the house outright and its' probably worth somewhere between 30 and 40k. Pretty much all of the unsecured debt is due to the house, either materials, paying contractors, taxes, etc. A couple grand is cause I took advantage of a payment deferment on one of the loans when my hours got cut back last year and didn't realize they weren't freezing interest rates until it was too late, so that's my bad. My monthy payments are uncomfortably close to my monthly income. I'll have the small loan paid off next spring, and after that I can snowball my way through the rest of the debt, but I'd rather try to lower some of these interest rates in the high teens/low 20s.

I spoke to a credit union about doing an equity loan to consolidate my debt, and got shut down pretty hard. Even accounting for using the borrowed money to pay off existing debts, they weren't willing to loan me much of anything until I'm able to live in the house. I've done preapproval tyep applications for debt consolidation loans and I've hit wall after wall, and it's insanely frustrating.

I pulled all my free credit reports over this past weekend. There is literally not a single negative on my Equifax or Experian credit reports, and the only thing on my TransUnion is a 90 day delinquency on 4 student loans (all via the same lender, so they look like one loan to me) just in August of 2014 (I had taken a deferment because I was between jobs, and during the deferment I moved from one state to another. They hadn't updated my new mailing address and I lost track of when the deferment was ending).  Other than that, I have perfect payment histories on every single account that comes up on all of my reports. My oldest account is like 17 years old, I've got a reasonable number of credit pulls.

I have recently applied to three different debt consolidation lenders that I found via direct mailer or online shopping: Upgrade, LendingClub and Best Egg. LendingClub is actually the originator/current holder of the largest single unsecured debt I have, the $25k loan for the house, currently with a balance of about $14.7k. Per Nerdwallet, they have minimum required credit scores of 550, 600, and 600 respectively. Best Egg and Lending Club both denied me outright, despite my adverse action letters stating my credit score was 677 (Lending Club, using TransUnion) and 692 (Best Egg, using Equifax). I specifically stated in the Best Egg application that the entire loan amount would go to refinancing my existing debt. Lending Club didn't ask that, but they did ask the purpose of the loan and I listed debt consolidation. Upgrade offered me a $14,900 loan with an 8% origination fee, 26.99% interest rate, and 5 year term. This would mean I'd get about $13,700 and, assuming I didn't pay it off agressively, pay a little over $25k total after 5 years.

One other company I checked in with is named Priority Plus Financial. They sent me something in the mail and I checked out their website, and it basically just said ""thanks for your inquiry, someone will reach out to you"" when I put in the offer code on the mailer. The mailer and their website both suggest they offer direct lending, but the person who called me is trying to push me into some sort of principle renegotiation program. He described it as being like HARP from the 2008/9 crisis but for unsecured debt. He mentioned the name of the program but I wasn't able to write it down (I was at work while talking to him) and I can't find any similar programs described anywhere, including on the Priority Plus Financial website. He's saying he could wipe out a few thousand dollars of the existing principle and get me on a 4 year term at an interest rate in the high single digits, which would lower my monthly payments on that debt by like 60%, but it would hurt my credit in ways he's not being super clear on. I'm not sure if that's because he's genuinely unsure, since who knows how various credit companies will handle it, or if it's just part and parcel of some sketchy bait and switch. I'd rather not voluntarily hurt my credit  when I could in theory sell my house and get out from under most of my unsecured debt immediately, which would make my credit pretty damn good at that point. If this is a real program, I'd like to look into it some more before I agree to anything/sign anything, but I can not find any evidence that this program exists.

(I'm pretty sure I was being offered a similar scam/program by another company late last year, but the person I was talking to was pretty unhelpful and wasn't willing to explain how anything worked, so I had a bad feeling about it and backed out pretty quick. This guy talks a much better game and actually explains things in a way that sound plausible, at least.)

As an aside: I had a small car accident caused by bad weather conditions in December of 2019, and despite going about 4 mph when the impact happened, my car was declared totaled. I had to buy a new car on short notice, and my interest rate on the auto loan also shot up. Despite having never missed a car payment, I can not even get my car loan refinanced to lower the payment because my overall payments are too high. The previous auto loan was in the low 3s, the current auto loan is in the mid 8s. The first car was slightly more expensive, but my monthly payment actually went up because the loans are the same terms and the new interest rate is so high. One of my credit card companies sends me ""you're preapproved to refinance your auto loan and reduce your monthly payment!"" emails every like 6 weeks and I've tried it a couple times over the last 17 months and was denied both times due to outstanding debt. Even with secured loans, I can't refinance to lower my monthly payments because my payments are too high.

I'm at a complete loss here. The terrible terms from Upgrade would still lower my monthly payments by a few hundred dollars because it would extend the term on the existing debts significantly, but it would also raise the already high interest rates and cost me a ton more money in the long run. The possibly (probably) sketchy program from Priority Plus Financial would, if it's real, get me in a place where I could probably pay most of my debt down really quickly. I just have no idea how trustworthy it is, or how much damage it might do to my credit. I think I could get a family member to cosign for me, but it feels insane that I even have to do that, and I don't feel super comfortable asking anyone to.

personalfinance,Questions about Tax Return!!,"So I recently filed and I didn't receive any stimulus checks yet so I claimed the Recovery Rebate credit. I was claimed in 2019, but this tax year, I was an independent. I went to HR Block and paid to have them filed, and made sure to ask multiple times if I was eligible since I was claimed in 2019. She assured me I was, and that was April 27th. My tax return was received the next day by the IRS, and I was able to see the status bar. It's been over a month, and obviously it says ""tax return needs to be processed, a refund date will be provided when available."" Today I got tired of waiting, so I called and waited 40 minutes on hold just to be hung up on. So then I called again and waited ANOTHER 40 minutes, but when she answered and I was still super nice. I told her my situation, she checked the status, and she offered her personal experience advice since she couldn't give me any more answers. I accepted, and she told me that I wasn't eligible for the first two payments because I was claimed in 2019, and said that it was on the IRS website, and that I should trust that more than a tax professional at HR Block. She even said, ""It's in simple first grade English, anyone can read it."" So I said thank you and hung up, sad I waited to get a payment I couldn't have, but then I checked their website and it said I should be eligible as long as I'm an independent for this year, which I am! So I called HR Block for a second opinion, and the woman who answered was very nice and said confidently that I am eligible, and that if i was told by one of their tax professionals, that I WILL receive the full $1800 plus the additional $1400. I won't truly know until July 6, because the IRS representative told me that they won't even begin to process it until then. I also have received both my state returns, and my federal return I had to file from 2018 this year because I was unaware I didn't file. I just don't understand who is telling the truth, can someone accurately answer my question?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto’s curse: the stable coins.,"The core problem is this: ALL the ‘stable coins’ are frauds. Every single last one of them. The only thing that differs is the extent and brazenness of the fraud.

They are all taking advantage of the most profitable scam known to man: fractional reserve banking. Which, as we know in the real fiat world, can operate on margins as low as 3%. 

Fraud triangle: Opportunity Incentive Rationalisation. 

EVERY stable coin issuer has the Opportunity to mint unbacked tokens. Undetected. Silent. Virtually impossible to disprove. Minting on the blockchain or wherever does NOT prove you got the extra fiat to do so! That is the loophole.

The Incentive is enormous. Completely irresistible: ‘free money’, to use on inflating your underlying: whatever is your crypto stock in trade. Number goes up = more newbies with fresh fiat FOMOing in. Clamouring for your stable coin. 

The cheat might start out ‘just a little here &amp; there’. Like Nick Leeson you bluff yourself ‘I’ll make it up later, it will be OK’. Rapidly snowballs as the awesome power of minting free money takes its inexorable grip. Dazzlingly successful, better than cocaine, speed or any other drug. Ask the Fed.

In the beginning, nothing whatsoever happens. You discover you can buy ‘audits’ or ‘attestations’. Hell, you can buy whole banks in the Bahamas! 

Rationalisation. 

Coinbase’s USDC is now issued by ‘Circle’. USDC in circulation went from $14 billion to over $20 billion in a couple of HOURS recently. During a crypto sell off approaching 50%? You should be ‘burning’ tokens in a downturn, not minting more! 

Unless you are running a fractional reserve scam, in which case it makes perfect sense: you are desperately trying to hide the hole. 

And the deniers rebuttal? ‘You don’t understand: people are selling their crypto and moving into stable coins, so they NEED to mint more’. 

Despair. BTW, Circle’s last ‘audit’ was ~~Feb~~   March 2021. Sorry, my mistake. Hmmmm...

Forget the rest. Only the stable coins currently matter. The curse of crypto. It WILL continue working till it does not cf fractional reserve banking. Thing is, when it eventually crashes, the fallout will be magnified by the extent of the fractional reserve scam. Nothing else currently matters. Nothing. 

Be interesting to see how long this stays up! It is the truth you do not want to hear. Sorry.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak loses Bitcoin scam case against YouTube,"After filing a Bitcoin scam-related lawsuit against YouTube last year, Steve Wozniak now has 30 days to revise his complaint.
A recent court ruling said that video hosting giant YouTube is not responsible for cryptocurrency-related scams posted on its platform.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak failed to support his lawsuit against YouTube over an advert using his image to promote a fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway, Bloomberg reports.

Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil Kulkarnia said in a tentative ruling Wednesday that YouTube and its parent firm Google are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a federal law shielding internet platforms from responsibility for content posted by users.

Wozniak sued YouTube in July last year over a typical bogus crypto giveaway that stated that anyone who sends cryptocurrency to a certain address will receive more cryptocurrency in return. The Apple co-founder argued that YouTube not only failed to remove the fraudulent ads but “materially contributed” to the scam by selling targeted ads driving traffic to the videos and falsely verifying the YouTube channels that carried the videos.

“If YouTube had acted quickly to stop this to a reasonable extent, we would not be here now. What human would see posts like these and not ban them as criminals immediately?” he said. In the suit, Wozniak reportedly noted that similar crypto scams on YouTube also capitalized on other tech celebrities like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

However, Judge Kulkarnia said that those factors were not enough to challenge the immunity provided by Section 230. The judge gave Wozniak 30 days to try to revise his complaint.

Wozniak is not the first entrepreneur to lose his battle against bogus YouTube ads. Last July, YouTube lawyers filed a dismissal bid in a similar case brought by major crypto firm Ripple Labs, arguing that the platform was not liable for any content — including scams — provided by third parties.

The latest court ruling comes the same day Google overturned its 2018 policy banning crypto exchanges from using its advertising services.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is it possible (and worth it) to transfer my retirement savings from money market IRA to Roth IRA or similar Without penalties or fees?,"I'm about to turn 40.  Working in a very small office for the family, I get personal deposits once a year to put into a money market IRA that is held by Bank of America since 2016.  It currently has a little over $8,000 in it.  Interest rate is 1.3%.  Currently debt free.  This is all of my retirement savings at the moment so I'm late to the game of being serious.  I did get married a year and a half ago if that is relevant although my wife is a foreigner and doesn't have a green card yet.  

I'm about to deposit $2,400 into this account.  I have to deposit it into retirement but I feel like I'm wasting my time with a money market IRA especially with the penalties before the age of 60 without any growth.  

Is it possible for me to transfer the $8,000 in the current account to a different retirement account such as a Roth IRA without incurring any penalties, including if I do not want to use Bank of America anymore? 

And is there any reason why I should continue with the money market IRA as I have no ability to withdraw the money without similar penalties and taxes?  As someone who is late to the game for taking my financial life seriously again, I want to focus on growth over maximum stability.  At an interest rate of 1.3%, this account hasn't changed much and I feel like I'm losing money due to inflation.

Any suggestions appreciated.",finance

defi,Borrowing using Crypto as Collateral: My Experiences and Findings,"As tax day in the U.S (5/17) quickly crept up on me, I found myself in a predicament: I was crypto rich but cash poor and did not have enough dollars to pay my taxes. This led me to doing research on how to borrow using crypto as collateral for I was trying to avoid selling crypto to pay taxes, which in turn would trigger more taxes.  Here are my findings below:

Since crypto is an extremely volatile asset and there is no yet established credit system in the crypto lending space, meaning crypto-backed loans are all over-collateralized. Most cases, the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) ranges from 20%-50%. LTV = Loan Amount/Collateral Value. So to borrow 10k with a loan with LTV value at 50%, you would need to put up 20k in crypto value as collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

**BlockFi**: Custodial crypto company which offers services including trading, borrowing and earning interest on crypto deposits.

Loan: 10k minimum loan, acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETC, LTC, and PAXG, only allows monthly payments for interest (monthly payments are much lower but you will owe entire principal at the end), collateral must maintain 70% of value or will require more collateral

Rates:

LTV: 20%, Interest Rate: 4.50% (Only available with BTC)

LTV: 35%; Interest Rate: 7.90%

LTV: 50%; Interest Rate: 9.75%

Pros:

\-Loan direct deposit into bank account

\-No protocol hack risk

Cons:

\-Limited cryptos accepted as collateral

\-KYC

\- Legally binding contract for loan, must adhere to BlockFi’s terms

&amp;#x200B;

**Salt Lending**: Founded in 2016, Salt was one of the first companies to introduce crypto-backed lending. Salt currently offers institutional-grade crypto custody and blockchain monitoring products as well.

Loan: 5k minimum, 1m max; acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, SALT, Paxos, USDC, TrueUSD, PAXG, 3-12 month loan duration, option to pay interest only or principal and interest, ability to redeem SALT tokens to lower interest rates (SALT currently \~30c)

Rates:

LTV: 30%, Interest Rate: 2.95% - 4.95% (2.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 40%, Interest Rate: 5.95% - 7.95% (5.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 10.95% - 12.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 60%, Interest Rate: 15.95% - 17.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

Pros:

\-more reasonable rates with the SALT redemption

\-loan direct deposit into bank account

\-no protocol hack risk

Cons:

\-availability varies (really only available in the US. Outside US, Canada, UK and Australia are business only; Brazil, HK, New Zealand, UAE and Switzerland for individuals and business)

\-KYC

\-must accept Salt’s terms and conditions

&amp;#x200B;

**Celsius Network**: FinTech platform that offers interest-bearing savings accounts, borrowing, and payments with digital and fiat assets.

Loan: $500 minimum to borrow stablecoins ($25k minimum for fiat except in NY and TX where min is $500); over 35 acceptable forms of collateral; 6 months to 3 year loan duration; monthly payments on interest only

Rates:

LTV: 25%, Interest Rate: 1.00% (.95% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 33%, Interest Rate: 6.95% (6.60% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 8.95% (8.50% if you pay with CEL token)

Pros:

\-wider array of collateral accepted

\-longer loan duration

\-lower min for stablecoin loan

Cons:

\-more KYC than other platforms (Government ID, Address, Tax ID)

\-primarily a phone app (can only borrow via phone app)

&amp;#x200B;

**MakerDAO/Oasis**: Autonomous protocol built on ETH blockchain that allows anyone to open up a smart contract/vault to deposit collateral and generate DAI.

[https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO)

Loan: 5,000 DAI minimum (dust limit); wide range of ERC-20 tokens can be used as collateral (including LP tokens), no duration limit (in order to access collateral again, required to deposit DAI)

Rates:

Stability fee (interest rate) ranges depending on the token used. Balancer stability fee is 2.00%, AAVE is 3.00%, ETH is 5.00%. Most stability fees are 5.00%. Liquidation Fee is 13.00%. Non-stablecoin minimum collateralization ratio is around 150% (LTV of 66.7%) but that will risk liquidation for even slight down movement. Recommended collateralization ratio is 200%-300% (LTV of 33%-50%)

Pros:

\-fully decentralized, No KYC, no restrictions

\-wide range of collateral including some uniswap liquidity token

\-very competitive rates, fully flexible

Cons:

\-entirely up to the individual to understand and learn the process

\-if vault falls under liquidation ratio, it will automatically get liquidated so individual must be aware

\-gas fees on ETH network ( much more reasonable now)

&amp;#x200B;

Although I did not end up borrowing, I am a fan of MakerDAO as an option. Not only are you getting very competitive rates, but also getting more flexibility and are contributing to the shift towards decentralization of finance. At its core, cryptocurrency is about financial freedom and empowerment through decentralization from traditional financial institutions, and MakerDAO encapsulates this.

 Please do not treat this as financial advice, but rather a starting grounds for your own research and DD for the best option for yourself. Realistically, until there is some sort of credit system for wallet addresses where loans do not need to be 2-3x collateralized I do not see borrowing against crypto to be feasible for most people. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral.",cryptocurrency

Realistically, until there is some sort of credit system for wallet addresses where loans do not need to be 2-3x collateralized I do not see borrowing against crypto to be feasible for most people. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral.",cryptocurrency

ethereum,How Chainlink Powers bZx’s Multichain Growth Strategy,"As the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) becomes more multichain, DeFi protocols are increasing their total value locked (TVL) by expanding across different blockchains. Providing fast, secure, low-cost decentralized services (lending, borrowing, margin trading) to more DeFi users requires an oracle solution that supplies high-quality, tamper-proof data to various blockchains.   

One such protocol is [bZx](https://bzx.network/), which connects lenders, borrowers and traders in a growing DeFi ecosystem. In 2019, bZx launched two core products – [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/), a DeFi margin trading and lending platform, and [Torque](https://torque.loans/), a tool for borrowing assets with indefinite-term loans and fixed interest rates – on the Ethereum blockchain. In April 2021, bZx expanded these services to Binance Smart Chain (BSC). In May, [bZx announced its launch](https://bzx.network/blog/bzx-launching-on-polygon#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20bZx's%20multi,growing%20list%20of%20supported%20blockchains.&amp;text=Polygon%20is%20a%20layer%2D2,and%20interoperability%20between%20other%20blockchains.) on Polygon’s layer-2 scaling solution.

personalfinance,Reasonable plan to pay off student debt,"Hi! My wife and I are recent grads, and through some luck we’ve managed to graduated with low student debt and high incomes. We make 260k combined per year, and we have about 40k in student debt.

We are considering paying off as much of this student debt as possible before forebeafance lifts. We take home about 16k after taxes, and our recurring expenses are 3k for rent and 1250 recurring expenses and our food budget. Our expenses are low (and we’d like to keep them that way because we want to buy a house)

We have about 41k saved in a HYSA and 12k in our IRAs, 20k in our brokerage through wealthfront and no debt other than our student debt and our car loan which is 300/mo on a 1.6% APR, so no rush to really pay that loan off. 

Our plan is to put about 9-10k each month into our student loans in order to pay them off by October. Then since our lifestyle is used to not having that money, we’d just stockpile that money into our HYSA and our brokerage to put towards our house down payment.

Is this a viable plan or are there some alternatives approaches that I can take here? All of our loans are federal student loans so it seems like the perfect time to pay them off right now.

The gadget uses 100 to 1000 times less energy and space than current CMOS-based technology to perform neural network computations. The work has been published in a paper in Nature Nanotechnology.

The basic idea behind Neural networks is that each layer’s output is fed as the input to the next layer. And to generate those inputs, a non-linear activation function is required. However, because this function entails transmitting data back and forth between two different units – the memory and an external processor – it necessitates a significant amount of computational power and circuitry.

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain is Changing Banking and Financial Services,"Blockchain technology is going to radically change the financial services sector. Blockchain networks will reduce fees, bring more transparency to the murky world of big finance and dramatically reduce the transfer time for sending money around the world.

In this post, our own Sam Klemens explores what blockchain is, how blockchain in banking will work, and a few of the key advantages that blockchains offer versus the existing financial system.

# How Blockchain Works

A blockchain is a decentralized network that typically has several qualities:

* Anyone can use the network without having to acquire special permission
* Most blockchain networks are transparent
* Good blockchain networks are immutable, which means that data and transactions cannot be altered
* Blockchains are secured via community participation rather than via a centralized server

It can be helpful to compare and contrast a blockchain network with a database. Only certain permissioned users can access the information stored on a database. A database is centralized in one location and secured by a single company or organization. Authorized users can easily alter information that’s stored on a database. 

Blockchains have many different use cases:

* Blockchain banking is popular right now with [DeFi on the Ethereum network](https://www.exodus.io/blog/tag/decentralized-finance-defi). Users can lend, borrow and exchange assets on decentralized platforms that a centralized company doesn’t control
* Blockchains can be used to send value, as is the case with Bitcoin and other monetary blockchains like Litecoin or Nano
* When considering blockchain financial services, most blockchain currencies have a limit on the number of coins that can be created. This makes them suitable as inflation hedges (there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin)
* Anyone can use a blockchain to timestamp data. Blockchains are fantastic for timestamping because they cannot be modified
* Blockchains will eventually make a majority of accounting and back-office jobs redundant, although this could take ten or fifteen years

One downside of blockchains is that they’re not very good at storing data. If a blockchain financial services firm needs to store significant amounts of data, a database is much more suitable. However, some blockchain projects (such as Bluzelle, SIA, and Filecoin) have been built to address this.

Another downside is that many public blockchains have scaling problems. Most blockchain banking networks are not currently fast enough to support the type of traffic that PayPal can process.

**Private blockchains**

A private blockchain is a network that’s controlled by one company or a consortium of companies. [R3](https://www.r3.com/) is one of the most well-known private blockchains, and it’s [been around since](https://www.r3.com/history/) 2014. For blockchain in banking, JP Morgan also has a private blockchain that their [JPM stablecoin](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments) is built on. Only institutional JP Morgan clients can use the JPM coin.

A private blockchain’s key disadvantage is that it’s a closed-off system that only a select group of people can access. Private blockchain financial services solutions lack the interoperability of a network like Ethereum.

The major advantage of private blockchain banking is that these networks can scale to thousands of transactions per second. Private blockchain networks are usually faster than public blockchain networks because they sacrifice security and inclusivity for speed and efficiency.

If private blockchain financial services are faster, does that mean they’ll be the most adopted solution?

It’s unlikely that this will be the case. Public blockchains have such a large network effect that it makes a lot more sense to build on them, versus a private blockchain. The consulting firm EY has spent several million dollars [building out infrastructure](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/01/06/ernst--young-doubles-down-on-their-bet-with-ethereum/?sh=52649b7348b1) on top of Ethereum because they believe that businesses will use public blockchains in the future.

Furthermore, there’s a lot of work being done to scale public blockchains so that they can handle enough transactions to make them commercially viable.

# How Blockchain Financial Services will Change the World

There are quite a few ways that blockchain in banking is going to change the legacy financial system. Here are a few of the best examples:

**Faster &amp; Cheaper Remittance**

Multinational corporations are going to be one of the largest beneficiaries of blockchain financial services. Corporations can use blockchain based stablecoins to send millions or billions of dollars to anywhere in the world for a negligible fee.

International money transfers with the existing financial system can take days or even a week or more, depending on the location. Blockchain banking will be an exponential improvement over this outdated system.

**Smart Contracts to Take Over the Accounting Department**

Software is eating the world, and blockchain financial services are just the latest example of this phenomenon. Financial smart contracts are going to revolutionize the accounting industry. Here are a few of the services that smart contracts can offer. 

* Automatic payments to a distributor once the merchandise is received
* Automatic tax payments
* A more efficient accounting ledger for a business
* Automatic currency exchange between stablecoins

While it’s not a positive sign for employment, the stark truth is that smart contracts are going to make millions of jobs redundant. Blockchain banking contracts will replace many accountants, back-office staff, and lawyers.

The employment situation is bad news, but the good news is that smart contracts will lower the costs for businesses all over the world. Some percentage of that saving will be passed on to consumers.

**Offering Blockchain Financial Services to Customers**

DeFi, which stands for Decentralized Finance, has become an extremely popular part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. DeFi users can borrow money, deposit money to earn interest or exchange their assets on decentralized exchanges. All of this is groundbreaking technology and the amount of money that’s locked up in DeFi has been [growing exponentially](https://defipulse.com/) since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0n40eijy2371.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8771d25a2ac7afeaf7ac53b79ddb3c09f29f9011

The problem is that decentralized applications are not so easy to use. To use DeFi you have to know how to set up a crypto wallet, send money to different addresses, and interface with blockchain apps that are not always intuitive.

The legacy financial system could benefit from DeFi by creating a more user-friendly interface for some of these decentralized applications. A bank could connect to a DeFi protocol on the backend and then allow their customers to access that application right through their banking website.

The bank would benefit by taking a small fee for this service, and customers would benefit because they could access decentralized protocols without needing a deep understanding of blockchain technology.

**Who Will Benefit the Most from Blockchain Banking?**

The cool thing about blockchain technology in banking is that everyone is going to benefit from it. Blockchain is like the internet, it’s a universally beneficial technology.

Large corporations will send money all over the world for only a fraction of what it costs today. People who save money can deposit it with DeFi applications to earn a real interest rate, not the 0% rate that’s common for most bank accounts.

Banks that adopt blockchain will be able to offer sophisticated financial products to their customers. These forward-looking banks can charge for the service and also grow their customer base.

Who will get hurt? Businesses and banks that don’t adopt blockchain. They will become uncompetitive compared to their rivals who keep up with the latest technology.

# The Advantages of Blockchain

Here are a few more advantages of blockchain financial services that we haven’t covered yet.

**Micropayments**

Certain blockchain networks make it financially feasible to send micropayments as small as just ten or twenty cents. Granted, this is not possible with every network. For example, on Bitcoin, the typical fee is a few dollars. However, on other networks, the fees are so small that micropayments are a possibility.

**Full Financial Access**

Anyone in the world can access financial services that are built on the blockchain. All you need is a way to get a bit of crypto, and then you can participate in these ecosystems.

Blockchain banking is much more inclusive than the traditional banking system, which shuts billions of people out because they don’t have the right documents.

**Bitcoin is an Independent Currency**

Out of all the blockchains, Bitcoin is the most secure. Bitcoin is not controlled by any state, organization or company. It’s a currency outside of the jurisdiction of nation states.

Bitcoin’s supply cannot be inflated, and governments cannot take Bitcoin from people who are holding it. This makes Bitcoin an elegant solution for citizens living under repressive regimes.

# The Future is Blockchain Banking

Blockchain banking is the way of the future. Building a financial system on top of the blockchain offers so many benefits that there’s no way the legacy system is going to survive.

It might take a decade or two to transition fully to blockchain, but the process has already started. We’re currently experiencing mass Bitcoin adoption, DeFi is taking off, and multiple countries are talking about creating their own Central Bank Digital Currencies. The future of financial services is coming, and it’s coming fast.

personalfinance,Construction Loan / Cash out Refinance - Advice,"Thanks in advance for any advice. Located in Texas.

We are planning on building a house and we have the required money to fund about 60% of the build ourselves. Construction loan fees seem excessive (title insurance) and origination fee (ignores the cash we bring). But it is available at 30 years at 3.15%. I believe this would be a one-time close deal.

Instead of getting the loan, We were looking to possibly do a cash our refinance on an investment property we own - but most banks are doing that or are offering 15yr or 20yr deals with interest rate about 1% higher than the construction loan %. Although this would save us interest paid over the long the years, it would also mean higher monthly payments. One bank did offer 30 years at 4% @ 0.684 (but only offers 75% of the house value; so we'd be short a bit).

CryptoCurrency,A tax proposal for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to tax every transaction like the crypto projects that tax transactions.,"Certain coins have a burn mechanism for every transaction with the crypto. That mechanic could be used to better *spread out the tax burden to those with the most and reduce the burden on those with the least*; while fully funding the government. 

**Simple tax: 1% to government for each transaction with the CBDC.**
(1% is not the right amount, maybe it has to be higher. 1% simplifies the math. We can easily estimate something like 4%, being 4x more tax paid. )

**Explaining the tax:**
If you pay someone, they will receive 99% of what you sent. You and them can work out who pays the 1%. Maybe they request you pay 1% more or absorb it as a cost of business. 


If someone earns $24,000 per year the tax will be less than someone earning $240,000. 

**Scenario: Laborer earning $24,000**

Once they receive the salary, they keep it in a bank account and spend on bills, food, needs, and a little entertainment. 

They are taxed only 1% when receiving the salary and 1% when they spend. Making so little, they spend the majority each year. 

In total, taxed 2%, $480

**Scenario: Analyst Job, $100,000**

They receive a salary and taxed 1%, 1k. They spend 50k, and invest the rest 49k, 

Spending 50k incurs 1% again, $500 tax

Sending 49k to a broker to invest in stocks would mean a 1% cost to get funds to a broker. The broker would collect 1% tax per transaction to invest the money. So 2% total. Or $980 tax

Total tax is $2480

**Scenario: Rich person with no job with $10,000,000; 100% in stock market. earning 10% APY.**

This person already has a 3 million dollar home and car they bought with cash years ago before this new tax plan. 

When they pay state property tax for the home and car they also pay 1% tax to feds because it’s a transaction. Let’s say the $3 million home has taxes due of $30,000. Tax paid is $300

Car tax is 4k per year. Tax is $40. 

Because they have 10 million, they spend $300,000 per year on house hold bills, clothes, air travel, hotels, eating out, gas, groceries, etc. 300k is $3000 in taxes paid. 

Total: $3340

If in one year the same person buys another car for $100k then that will add $1000 in tax

If they buy another home for $3 million it will add $30,000 in tax. 

If they spend $1 million in a year it’s $10,000 in taxes paid. 

**Scenario: Billionaire **

The billionaire spends $25 million a year for their lifestyle. Tax $250,000 

They sell and invest in other businesses. Total of $100 million worth of transactions.  Tax $1 million

Their $100 million dollar yacht costs: 2 million a year to maintain, $20,000 tax

Their $300 million worth of property is taxed and 3 million is owed in state property tax. $30,000 tax

Billionaire Tax Total: $1,300,000 

The more money someone earns, or has, they will spend more to live their life. The high spending means 1% tax on a higher amount of spending. Investing done by billionaires increases tax revenue too.

**Summary:**
Even if a billionaire owned everything and tried to sit out a year to avoid tax they could do that but that means they do nothing and eat food they grow themselves and harvest themselves. 
Owning means property tax thus more fed revenue because every transaction is taxed the same. Even transactions paying taxes to local governments. 

Even if they had a farm, they’d probably want to pay employees. And they still pay property tax. That’s tax revenue because every transaction is taxed 1%. 

How would a tax like this would be avoided?

Would it disproportionally tax the poor and not the rich?

Would it cripple certain, high transaction industries?

Why would it not work? (Besides 1% being too low, and assuming people use the CBDC network and not public blockchains instead)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinance public loans to lower private rate ?,"My public student loans are about $25k at 4% to 4.5% average interest rate with 8 years left once I start paying again.

CryptoCurrency,Central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the status of the initiatives in each country,"A **central bank digital currency (CBDC)** uses an electronic record or digital token to represent the virtual form of a fiat currency of a particular nation (or region). A CBDC is centralized; it is issued and regulated by the competent monetary authority of the country.

Also called digital fiat currencies or digital base money, CBDC will act as a digital representation of a country’s fiat currency, and will be backed by a suitable amount of monetary reserves like gold or foreign currency reserves.

Each CBDC unit will act as a secure digital instrument equivalent to a paper bill and can be used as a mode of payment, a store of value, and an official unit of account.

Like a paper-based currency note that carries a unique serial number, each CBDC unit will also be distinguishable to prevent imitation. Since it will be a part of the money supply controlled by the central bank, it will work alongside other forms of regulated money, like coins, bills, notes, and bonds.

**Pros:**

* The production, storage, transportation, and disposal of Central Bank Digital Currency does not demand a massive amount of money.
* Distribution is much safer reducing the fraudulent activity in the payment ecosystem.
* Efficient technology allows to do the financial payment settlement in real-time by improving its speed and reduces dependency on the intermediaries.
* Can be used as a direct monetary policy tool.
* Can also enhance financial inclusion because there’s no need for consumers to have a bank account to hold such currencies 

**Cons:**

*  Strong control that the state would retain over the blockchain network within which the digital currency would operate upon introduction
* Central banks would have increased control over money issuance and greater insight into how people spend their money, potentially depriving users of their privacy 
* As the cryptocurrency shows a high level of volatility, this can be speculated
*  Only the issuer country can accept CBDCs, and none other can accept them
*  Additional compliances and monitoring can be required here as per the CFT or AML laws

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) survey, showed that 80% of central banks are exploring CBDC at some level.  Many countries are working on developing these CBDCs and here is the strategy of them.

**Bahamas**

* The Bahamas is one of the few countries that has actually introduced a live CBDC, the Sand Dollar, which launched in October 2020.
* The Sand Dollar is designed to distribute cash among the Bahamas' vast network of islands to avoid the expensive process of moving cash using private planes. It's also designed to serve tourists and other visitors.

**China**

* China, which has been working on its digital currency for seven years, plans to test the digital yuan at the upcoming **Beijing Winter Olympics** in 2022, providing a view of how comfortable travellers from outside China are with the nation's CBDC and digital currencies in general. 
*  There are concerns that the government will use the technology to spy on its citizens and displace Alipay and WeChat Pay, China's major private-sector digital wallets.
* There's also a Cold War element, as the digital yuan is positioned as a way to counter the influence of cryptocurrency, the U.S. dollar and major U.S. firms that seek to expand in China, such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Apple and Amazon.

**United States of America**

* The **U.S. government is working with** **MIT** to build and test models for a digital dollar, though the earliest word from these experiments is not expected until later this summer.
* A digital dollar briefly made its way into coronavirus relief bills in the U.S. Congress in 2020, though the initiative was dropped during negotiations (the uneven rollout of pandemic stimulus checks added momentum for a U.S. digital currency as a way to streamline government disbursements).

**United Kingdom**

* The **Bank of England and HM Treasury** in April formed a task force to research a potential CBDC for the U.K., bringing together government agencies and the private sector to consider a currency that would be an alternative to traditional cash and deposits.
* The task force will identify use cases, opportunities and risk and will evaluate a design for the digital pound and assess the overall case for CBDC in the U.K. It will also track developments in other nations

**European Union**

* While the U.S. and Europe have taken a slow approach that doesn't consider China's progress, there is a need for more urgency given China's influence, according to Antony Welfare, executive director at NEM Software in Gibraltar who has consulted on CBDC projects in the U.K. and several other nations.
* Western central banks ""need to get their heads around China moving at lightning speed,"" Welfare said. ""China has a CBDC and it's being rolled out. China is the largest country in the world and the largest trading partner. It's a warning sign."" 

**Sweden**

* The e-krona project by the **Riksbank** dates to 2017, starting with research to determine whether a digital currency is necessary. It accelerated in 2020 with pilots in conjunction with Accenture, which is also part of the Digital Dollar project that advocates for a CBDC in the U.S.
* Riksbank plans to include other commercial banks to pilot different use cases for the e-krona, including general retail payments and business transactions.

**France**

* The **Banque de France** completed a CBDC test that used a blockchain to support an interbank settlement of about $2.5 million through a private blockchain from **SETL** earlier this year. 
*  French politicians have additionally expressed opposition to **Diem**, the Facebook-affiliated stable coin. CBDCs are seen as one way to counter that influence, along with an **independent European** payment system that would also support a digital euro.
* The ECB's Lagarde has pushed central banks across the EU to develop compatible CBDCs as a competitive response to foreign corporate incursions into Europe's payment market.

**Japan**

The **BOJ** began tests this year that would ensure stability for settlement and payment systems for transactions. It's hoping to address concerns that **CBDCs** would cause some users to drain their private bank accounts in favour of digital currencies.

**Switzerland**

* Switzerland is part of a **CBDC collaboration** with the Bank for International Settlements, the Swiss National Bank and the financial infrastructure operator SIX.
* These partners completed a joint proof of concept this year for a project that integrates tokenized digital assets and central bank money. Called Project Helvetia, it's exploring the technological and legal feasibility of issuing CBDCs through a digital asset platform and linking that platform to a payment system. 

**Hong Kong**

* The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand built a prototype to transfer CBDCs to execute payments between the two jurisdictions. 
* China's central bank is also working on a CBDC bridge that will connect to the Hong Kong and Thai central banks, as well as the Bank for International Settlements, to create an international network for cross-border CBDCs.

btc,Crypto-Crash Aftershocks Hit Traders With 50% Premiums Vanishing,"(Bloomberg) -- Speculative investors may have been pushing meme stocks “to the moon” earlier this week, but their crypto counterparts have been coming back down to Earth en masse.

Hedging activity is on the rise and bullish bets are finding limited demand -- even with Bitcoin still almost 40% below its peak. These are rare times of restraint among day traders, who until last month’s $500 billion crash were famously in the throes of bullish mania.

Another way of looking at it: A slew of market excesses fueled by leverage are getting snuffed out.

“Price and narrative are the fundamentals in cryptocurrency markets -- right now, both are shaken,” said Nico Cordeiro, chief investment officer at Strix Leviathan, a digital-asset investment firm.

Take the gap between Bitcoin futures market and the spot price. At the height of the mania in April, the premium shot to 50% on an annualized basis -- meaning investors could lock in a massive profit with a simple convergence trade.

It’s now collapsed to just 9%, according to data provider Skew, which tracked rolling three-month contracts on crypto exchange Binance.

Volume in derivatives typically exceeds spot activity on most days, on strong demand to speculate with easy-to-trade instruments that offer leverage -- often 100 times -- to boot. All that means bulls almost always outnumber bears.

Now, crypto conviction is falling. Support from Bitcoin’s star promoter Elon Musk has wavered and there are new regulatory hurdles in China and the U.S. For the past two weeks, prices have wobbled around $40,000, unable to move much in either direction.

Retail demand for long positions across the curve is vanishing. The futures-spot spread is narrowing on BitMEX and other crypto platforms to bring it closer to the level on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an institutionally oriented platform.

It all signals harder times for quants like BKCoin Capital who have notched outsize gains with simple arbitrage strategies that involve going short futures and long the spot.

“In mature, liquid markets, institutional and sophisticated investors search for various arb opportunities,” said Kelly Pettersen, head of business development at Skew, now acquired by Coinbase Global Inc. “Applying this same strategy in crypto, over time, means the market and the trade will continue to get more popular, and the spread will narrow.”

Demand to go long is also falling in a typically lucrative trade known as perpetual futures.

The uniquely crypto derivative has no expiry date and is kept in line with the spot price thanks to incentives created by a funding rate. When sentiment was rosy, the charge got as high as 0.3% on the BitMEX platform -- meaning bulls were willing to pay up to hold onto a Bitcoin bet for just hours.

But over the past two weeks, the rate has been sitting at zero or in negative territory.

Hedging Demand

While traders in the stock market primarily use options for hedging, investors in crypto assets have long preferred to buy them as a way to bet on further gains. For that reason, outstanding calls have always exceeded puts in crypto markets, Skew figures show.

Open-interest data show that’s still true. Yet over the past month the cost of one-month puts on Bitcoin has risen above the price of comparable calls -- a sign of rising demand to hedge.

That suggests crypto options are looking more like equities where defensive contracts have long commanded a premium over bullish counterparts.

The upshot? Caution is building across a Bitcoin ecosystem acutely prone to speculative extremes.",cryptocurrency

My husband and I are torn on what to do with this money. For background: we're around 40 with two young kids (one still in daycare). Income of $130k a year with a $1300 mortgage (includes escrow) that we pay $1400 on. I still have $20k in student loans with a pretty decent interest rate. No credit card debt. Both cars paid off, but one that is 12 years old and will probably need to be replaced soonish (timing belt blew 3 years ago and was fixed, but engine has never been the same), but still runs okay for now. $35k in savings, but only about $7k in college savings for each kid. We each have about $100k in our 401k and contribute 13% once employer contributions are added.

I'm leaning towards putting $12k in student loan payments, $3k for each of our kids' college, and $2k to throw towards a vacation. Husband wants to put the majority towards a new (used) car. We'll probably compromise in the middle a bit, but it's there anything we might be missing? I feel like I'm forgetting some big important thing we should be doing with this money.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 3, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**

Stocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.

Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. 

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations

personalfinance,Late 30’s and trying to invest for the future - here’s my plan.,"I’m 38 years old and, after a few financial setbacks (which I don’t have the time to go in to here) I’m now looking to get on the right track for the future. Here’s where I’m at:

- Salary: $92k a year with roughly $10k in bonuses each year.

- Debt: $14k not counting my car loan, which has a 3% interest rate

- Rent: $1,200 a month (splitting rent with my GF in NYC)

Investment wise I have a few stocks in Tesla and two Ethereum, both of which I bought about a year ago. I also had a nice chunk of cash savings at the time, but that got drained due to a family/medical emergency. 

Moving forward I’m thinking this is the plan:

- Spend the next six months paying off my $14k in debt, after which I’ll start to put 20% of my income in to a saving’s account. Do this until I hit my goal of $10k.

⁃	Once $10k is reached keep putting 10% of my income in to savings, while putting the other 10% in to my 401k.

⁃	Eventually cash out my savings account and stocks/crypto (if it yielded a return) for property purchase with my girlfriend.

⁃	Continue to put 10% of income in to 401k and 10% in to building a new stock portfolio.

investing,Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : Ready to Test 2021 High Again as Q1 Earnings Report Approaches (June 24th),"As Rite Aid ( RAD ) approaches its fiscal Q1 earnings report date of June 24, 2021, will the stock approach its recent high of $32.48 attained back in January of this year?  

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A &amp; B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

That being said, today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid and made the following statement:

***""Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***

And finally, a potential dark horse suitor has emerged...or re-emerged, I should say.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( WBA ) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen ( ABC ) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal.  With that $6.5 billion windfall, Walgreens is now is a position to purchase the remainder of Rite Aid, finally completing the acquisition that it set out to accomplish way back in 2015.  Such an acquisition would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  

\* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS 

\* Providing Walgreens with a PBM to help it gain share in the prescription drug market and become more competitive in that segment

\* Blocking both Amazon and Walmart from acquiring Rite Aid as part of their pharmacy strategy which would quickly catapult either company into the position of 3rd largest retail pharmacy in the USA  

The race appears to be on to see who will ultimately acquire Rite Aid! 

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. I personally believe that the stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

vet,Found Feral 4-6 week kitten in distress,"I am about to go check the trap to see if I've caught it. I think it's 5 weeks old. Lightning fast but, it's crying like it's in serious distress. A loud, repetitive mew that has been going on for hours. I tried to let it come to me but, it is very unsure. It changed the tone of it's mew while looking at me sometimes. It was even quiet for a few minutes but, it goes back to practically screaming and gets loudest after I walk away. It got maybe 4 feet from me, before doubting it's choice and going back under the car. It's interested but, afraid. I saw an adult cat but, they did not interact and, this is the only kitten I saw in the area. We do have feral cat colonies around the area. 

What do I need to do when I catch it? I have a geriatric senior cat and, I don't want them to interact until after I get this baby tested and cleared of fleas and worms. I don't want to leave it alone overnight because I think it will continue yelling without comfort.

Update: Caught it with the havahart. I had to rig it to trigger under such a smol kitten, since it got the food once and got away. I have it in the laundry room, in the trap, for the night. Put in towels, water and a little litter box. It's not yelling anymore but, it's definitely not in the mood for cuddles. I was able to put things into the trap without getting big hisses or swats but, petting is not on the agenda for the night. It tried to make an escape when I got horizontal to put in the water. It saw my dog and was not pleased. My dog is super chill he just wags his tail and watches so, I just sat with him and pet him in front of the kitty for awhile. Maybe it will catch on.

Update 2: I've been feeding the baby from a spoon and petting. He's still skittish long term but, during and shortly after feeding, HE is all about the love and cuddles now. I thought this would be harder.
He feels a bit boney so, I'm thinking he may actually be closer to 6-7 weeks but, just under fed. His poops look healthy. I just need to train him to poop in the litter. Being feral, I think is why he has been going on towels, burying it, then laying on top of it. He is peeing in the box for the most part.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Am I making the right choices?,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. I grew up poor with parents who made terrible financial decisions (gambling, massive credit debt, etc) and I am making a decent income of about 50k now and want to ensure I'm on a decent path towards financial security.

I'm currently 30, single, no kids, about 20k in federal student loan debt. No credit debt. I'm a freelancer and make between 4k and 4500 a month. Outside of rent and bills, I'm putting 500 into a traditional IRA a month and trying to bulk my savings account by putting 500 into it a month. My student loan payment minimum is 200 a month and I'm making minimum payments. Outside of that I have about 800 in free spending money that I'm comfortable being frugal with and putting towards anything I've mentioned, but I'm not sure how to ratio that money.

I want to invest in stocks but feel like I should have a decent amount in my savings account and IRA, as well as pay down my loan. I currently have 6k in my savings and 2k in my IRA.

Am I on the right path? Should I be focusing more on paying off student loans? I've received absolutely no advice on this growing up and even after doing a lot of personal finance research, I'm getting a lot of mixed messages. I'd appreciate any advice.",finance

personalfinance,Is financing a new laptop for school a responsible use of credit?,"I need to buy a new MacBook for school/work, as my old one has been slogging through my computer science classes that require VMs, and I want to take a job soon that will require iOS development which my computer can't quite handle anymore. I want to buy a new laptop with Apple's trade-in credit, and I am considering financing the purchase. However, I'm not sure if financing the laptop is a responsible use of consumer credit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in the process of building credit, but have made good headway. I have two federal student loans (2.75% interest) and a Discover card, totaling 3 open accounts, with a 711 credit score. Will opening a new line of credit to finance the laptop help or hurt my credit? I've heard that I should have about 5 open credit accounts ideally, but I opened my Discover card only about 3-4 months ago, and I'm not sure if opening two accounts within that timespan will look bad. I barely use my credit card (I strictly follow the 6% rule) and I am confident that I will have no trouble making the laptop payment. However, I could pay the full amount to purchase the laptop up front if I wait about two weeks, but that would eat a big chunk of my small emergency account, and waiting on the purchase would be very inconvenient for me because I am moving in about that amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

So overall, is it a responsible idea to finance the laptop, or would it be better to delay the purchase and just buy it up front?",finance

personalfinance,After reading the wiki and using search bar I think whole life insurance might still be right for me. I'm not wealthy nor rich. Am I missing something?,"33, no dependents, unmarried male. Don't get it, yeah I know. I realize this sub is overwhelmingly against WLI, but despite reading all the threads and wiki I think it might still be right for me. Would be great to hear why if is still a bad place to park money with the following rationale.  

Current financial practices: contribute to 401k enough to max the company match, contribute to IRA yearly (the max $5500 or whatever), and 6 months' emergency fund in savings account. I have a car loan for around $12k, no student debt or other debt. Aside from the car loan, almost any money not going to rent/food/living expenses goes into my brokerage account. Stocks are my investment, not the life insurance, if I were to get it. 

Again, this isn't being considered an investment but rather somewhat like a CD/money market account that could offer enough to match inflation (my bank offers a pathetic 0.55% on MMA). Also I live in an area where home ownership is a pipe dream. An area where if I saved the premiums, it would have no real effect on my ability to own a home. 

Here's a quote from a reddit thread:

&gt;Whole Life insurance: FUCK WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE. This is the worst investment known to man. Buy term. Whole is a savings account with life insurance attached.

Wait... but that's what sounds appealing. My stocks are my investments, any leftover free cash will continue to go into the stock market. But you're telling me there's an option for a kind of savings account where they actually give you an interest at LEAST equal to inflation, and they'll throw in life insurance for free on top? Why would I choose a savings account giving 0.1%, or bonds which probably lose out to inflation too, with the way things are? 

The kicker for me was, the dividend payouts are tax-deferred, and apparently you can actually take out a loan at a low interest rate against the money if desired. 

If there is something I am missing I'd love to hear it.",finance

1. Sundaeswap ISO delayed due to regulatory concerns.  This brings up interesting questions for the whole space about requesting regulatory permission vs. possibly being forced to ask for forgiveness. [https://www.sundaeswap.finance/posts/iso-update](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/posts/iso-update)

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
86. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

investing,The stock market won’t crash soon,"At least until after the midterm elections. The money printers at the federal reserve have been working overtime to keep the markets afloat. You can already see inflation in action, with consumer prices leaping 4.2 percent (the fastest climb since 2008 - see end for an article explaining it more in depth) as well as the rise in lumber and metals prices. 

The Federal Reserve intends to keep the market from crashing for as long as possible. As long as the fed keeps printing money, the stock market will stay afloat. 

TLDR buy gold, silver, real estate (though I’ve been told interest rates will start to rise within a few months), semiconductor stocks, silver, pretty much the same thing you’ve been doing for the past year.

hardware,"Prediction: Upcoming Macbook Pro 14"" and 16"" will have SoCs based on A15, not A14","M1 is based on the A14. Many believe that the upcoming MBPs (expected to be announced next week), will have an M1X which is still based on A14. This is unlikely.

Here's why:

* Latest Bloomberg report point to an [8/2 big.Little design](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips) for the Macbook Pros which suggests it's different architecturally to the 4/4 M1. Perhaps the two new efficiency cores have been beefed up to be equivalent to the A14 four.
* A15 production for iPhone 13 at TSMC has [already been started](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/a15-bionic-chip-reportedly-begins-for-iphone-13/) which suggest that the A15 design has long been ready for the new Macbook Pros as well
* It makes more sense for the Macbook Pros to receive the latest SoC designs first over the Macbook Air/Mac Mini/iMac because you can produce the biggest chips first, bin the best for the Macbook Pros, and use the defective chips for lower-end Macs. For example, you can use the defective 8/2 dies as 6/2 dies for an upgraded Macbook Air. AMD/Intel/Nvidia almost always releases top-end chips first for this reason.
* It doesn't make sense for the low-end Macs to have the highest single-thread performance. Apple's year-over-year single-thread improvements can increase by as much as 20%, unlike Intel's 1-5% increase previously. Having the Macbook Air outperform the expensive Macbook Pros in single-thread by 20% for 9 months every cycle is simply weird and unacceptable.
* Many have already observed that the M1 could have easily been a rebranded A14X with extra IO bolted on. The real Mac SoCs will start with the upcoming Macbook Pros.

Don't be surprised if the Macbook Pros get announced with an A15-based SoC next week.

Bonus prediction: The new SoCs could have hardware ray tracing. Apple's software APIs have hinted at hardware ray tracing support.",technology

Bitcoin,How to make passive income on cryptocurrencies. Three ways,"Owners of digital assets are not limited to trading and investing. Participants of the crypto market can earn passive income, which usually exceeds the interest on traditional bank deposits

[Photo by Vadim Artyukhin](https://preview.redd.it/gapba5fo19371.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de560bc7be417a303301c69b1264e37b2bafa1c)

## Deposit

Many centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have adopted the principle of working from banks. They attract users to deposit their funds on the platforms. The exchange benefits from increased liquidity. Some platforms allow you to open deposits with a fixed or floating interest rate. Deposit holders receive a small portion of the cryptocurrency’s income as compensation. For example, on Binance you can open a deposit in Tether for 90 days at 6% per annum.

The yield of fixed-rate deposits is easy to calculate: the longer the term, the higher the yield. Profitability of deposits with floating rate is difficult to predict, since the interest rate regularly changes based on the situation on the stock exchange.

The owner of the deposit takes the risk, providing his funds to the exchange. In fact, the investor stops owning the digital coins, since they will be stored on a wallet of the exchange, which can be accessed by intruders.

## Loans

Placing cryptocurrency at interest is not only possible on exchanges. Many cryptocurrency services allow cryptocurrency owners to lend their digital coins to other users for interest. There are two types of such platforms: decentralized, including Maker, Compound, and Aave, and centralized, such as Nexo and Crypto.com.

Decentralized venues usually have lower returns. They are more secure because they don’t store user funds. Interest rates on cryptocurrency loans are usually not fixed, but vary depending on the amount of digital coins on the lending platform. At the time of publication of this article on the decentralized platform Aave, the return on loans issued in Tether is 11% per annum and in DAI is 12% per annum.  


The lender’s risk is that when using decentralized platforms, there is a chance of encountering unscrupulous borrowers. In the case of centralized exchanges there is a risk of losing funds due to hacker attacks on the wallets of platforms.

## Stacking

Stacking is a method of passive earning in which users store coins on the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm and ensure that the blockchain works. This entitles them to receive rewards.

To start the stacking process, you can give your cryptocurrency to node operators — validators (easier way) or start your own node. The latter method is suitable for those who have sufficient technical skills and plan to invest a large amount. Owning your own node is considered to be a safer and more profitable way of stacking, compared to transferring coins to validators.

Stacking is available on many cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance. As of the publication of this article, Binance Coin’s internal token stacking yield is 8.4% p.a. and Ethereum’s stacking yield is 1.7% p.a.

When placing funds on Binance and other centralized platforms, it is worth bearing in mind that such platforms are susceptible to hacks and there is a risk of losing your money in the event of a hacker attack.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Running Out of Time: Panic Mode (Student Loan Debt),"I posted this in the student loan advice forum as well but I need all the help I can get.
__________

So I am a first generation college student with little financial support other than my mother who has always had excellent credit. She was passionate about me persuing my future however I wanted to and encouraged me to pick a school without concerning myself about the cost - we would figure it out. 

I chose a school where the tuition isn't the worst but it isn't cheap. With no college savings and little scholarship funding but great credit, I attended all four years on private loans. 

I was strongly recommended Sallie Mae by a highschool teacher so thats what I went with for a lender even though I had a gut feeling that it was the wrong desicion. They don't really have any repayment options and they don't consolidate. 

Here I am, a year post graduation with nearly 120k spread across 7 private loans (only one year was I smart enough not to borrow per-semester) all accruing interest. The payments total around 1.5k a month (not including my federal loan payment which i easily consolidated through Great Lakes) while I'm still only making 20k a year between two jobs... 

(Edit: Some commentors pointed out that my math was a off, originally I was somewhere between 25k and 30k but today I was able to secure a $5 raise at one of my jobs to 20/hr. That position is still part time for now but at least I'm leveling up a bit.)

I've attempted all of the major refinancing providers with my mother as a cosigner and while she was able to increase her annual income this past year, we keep getting denied, usually due to a poor debt:income. We've worked hard getting any other debts down in order to prepare for this but it hasnt been enough. 

I don't know how I'll be able to pay this debt if I can't consolidate it into one payment and my forebearance ends in July (two months) when we are supposed to be moving across the country from Chicago back home to New England (obviously that alone will be financially stressful). 

Anybody I ask for advice doesn't know what to say, I've even tried asking friends who are accountants or low income financial aids by profession. I'm running out of options and out of time, I've worked hard to build my own credit, at 23 I already have a perfect score but it's already rapidly declining after only a couple months of interest. This past month my equifax dropped 50 points, at that rate I won't be able to qualify for anything by the end of the year. 

I'm afraid this is going to just completely destroy my life... And my mother who is single heavily relies on her credit. 

Any advice is much needed, thanks.",finance
Bitcoin,"When Billionaires Tweet, FREE Markets Will Move","A lot of people act like Elon's ability to move the Bitcoin market with one tweet is a bad thing. It's not. It's actually an indication that Bitcoin is still a FREE market with heavy price discovery.

There will always be influential people in the world. When those influential people say things, the sheep WILL follow. This means that almost any asset with less than, say, a $10T market cap, will move a lot on the tweets of billionaires. 

That's just how people think.

Let's contrast the Bitcoin market with the stock market, which, in its current form, is NOT a free market with price discovery. **The Fed has essentially outlawed bear markets.** Every time there's a market dip, the Fed extends lots of essentially interest free credit to big companies in order to correct the price, (via them buying their own stocks, among other things).

In trading circles, there's this idea of whether the Jerome Powell's comments resemble a ""Hawk"" or a ""Dove."" Here's what they basically refer to:

* **Hawk:** let the market drive interest rates up, allow bankruptcies, allow liquidations, allow reallocation of capital and labor
* **Dove:** force interest rates down, lots of low interest rate lending, bailouts, no liquidations, guarantee employment

Now here's the insight: ***The stock market is driven almost entirely by Jerome Powell's latest comments.*** When JPow has a press conference, if his comments aren't quite Doveish enough, the market tanks. When he clarifies later, it goes back up.

When the interest rate on the 10 year treasury note rises just a few tenths of a percentage point, the market tanks. When JPow comes in and assures us that the Fed will continue QE (or whatever they call it now) and prevent the recession, it recovers.

It's not even that JPow needs to say Hawkish things to move the market down. It's even the case that if he's simply *not dove enough,* there will be a small sell off to test the waters.

**tl;dr** \- All this is to say, what you're seeing with Elon and market movement indicates that Bitcoin is a healthy free market with real price discovery. Free markets can be manipulated for the masses, but as long as you understand it, they can never take your Bitcoin or steal it through inflation.

The alternative is the clown world stock market we live in where the entire market lives or dies on each JPow press conference, and your savings are debased as they prop the whole thing up.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Credit Card Debt: Balance Transfer vs. Credit Union Loan,"I had some CC debt that turned into a lot of CC debt when I lost my job.  I'm back to work, but making significantly less income.  I've quit using Credit Cards while I try to get this under control.

I've got $12.5k credit card debt on a $20k limit (only one card) at 20.99% interest.  FICO Score:  723

My thought is to take the balance transfer hit at 3%, keep paying roughly what I am now (\~$500/mo) as best I can to pay it down with the 0% interest for some period of time.  


HOWEVER - I could hit up my credit union and ask for debt consolidation, but I imagine I'd still have a high (albeit better) interest rate as it's unsecured debt.

dogecoin,Analysis of what is going on,"Guys, let me put it as simple as this. The federal bank in the US is going to regulate crypto currencies as regular currencies. Norton allowed people to mine. Big investors are pushing funds into cryptos industry. Google is allowing ads on crypto currencies. Facebook is allowing it as well. All ads everywhere is promoting investing in crypto currency. And more things that I don’t remember at the moment. All that means that there is a great future for crypto currencies. And that is exactly the reason people are manipulating the market, like Elon and others. Because they are basically targeting people who has no balls and will get scared and sell immediately when the prices drop. So they can invest with lower cost. Let’s just be clear, to gain profit. It is a year from now. Other than that we are kidding ourselves.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,What is the biggest risk to high-interest stablecoin lending?,"I'm just looking to learn, and I think I'm mostly there as far as understanding how these rates are possible, but not quite. I've long accepted the truism that returns are compensation for risk at the asset class level. It's What's going on here that keeps these rates so far above rates in equivalent fiat?

As far as I can tell, there are chains of loans being doled out at each level, but I don't see why stablecoin issuers can't themselves take fiat deposits from consumers and/or borrow from fiat institutions at far lower rates to make more from the spread. This would result in interest rates converging towards those of fiat plus some premium, naturally.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"To take full advantage of the cryptocurrency world, you need to learn how to filter out the ambient noise to focus on the real signal","For many investors, this crash we just experienced is their first-ever with Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world.

This is part of the learning process. Some will leave this world after selling at a loss, while others will look to use this crash to learn more.

The key lesson is that you need to take a step back after investing in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

You must act only after you have made your own decisions.

Then, you need to learn to filter out the ambient noise. Some weeks in this industry are as information-laden as 3 or 4 months in the world of traditional finance.

So you have to sort out the noise from the real signal.

Let's take the example of Bitcoin right now. The ambient noise is presented by Elon Musk's tweets, the FUD around a ban in China, the FUD around a hard regulation in America, potential money laundering investigations against some exchange platforms based on information from anonymous sources, ...

All this is the noise that only creates confusion in a useless way.

To take full advantage of this revolution, you need to focus on Bitcoin and its fundamentals. Is Bitcoin's promise to be an encrypted P2P currency accessible to everyone being kept? Is its monetary policy being followed? Are institutional investors still coming to buy BTC?

This is important information to watch.

By learning to filter out the ambient noise, you will be able to focus on the long term. This is how you will be able to seize the opportunities that the market offers you as it is currently the case.",cryptocurrency

Why would my Prius appreciate in value? I've only ever heard of depreciation of cars, so that's what has me slightly confused. I tried googling some of the language in the email but didn't find anything online.

Email:

&gt;I am reaching out regarding your 2014 Prius that you purchased from us back on xx/xx/2018 at an interest rate of 5.52%. Unbelievably your Prius has appreciated in value by thousands of dollars over the past 6 months which has improved your equity position much faster than normal. If you have made your payments on time, you are in position to take advantage.  I would like to offer to buy back your Prius outright or help you leverage your improved equity situation by combining the highest trade vales in history and interest rates as low as they have ever been.  It truly is the perfect time for you to take action and consider upgrading to a newer model.  You can likely get you a lower interest rate with no money down and potentially a lower monthly payment.  

My questions are: is this legitimate; why would my car appreciate in value; if we have about $10,000 left on our car loan, would this be a good idea?

personalfinance,Auto Loan rate review,"Auto loan rates are super low right now. I am currently 14 months into a 60 month auto loan at 2.39%. However I am a nerd with nothing better to do in my life, so I called my credit union and asked for a rate review (Also known as rate modification, thanks u/ack154). They got back to me within 48 hours and said they could lower my rate to 2.24% without any other modifications to the loan at all. ~~This is not a refinance, so your credit is not pulled / affected at all.~~

**EDIT:** There MAY be a credit pull, so please verify with your bank before going ahead with this if you do not want anything added to your credit report. In my scenario there was no credit pull!

Some may think this is tedious, working to reduce my interest rate by 0.15%, and they may be right. However I am sharing this to hopefully help somebody who can benefit greatly from this. Some of you may be able to significantly lower your interest rates and monthly payments!

One downfall to this is you can only do this once per loan, so if rates come down even lower, you will have to refinance to get the newest rates in the future.

TLDR; call your bank and ask for a rate review to save money on your monthly payment without pulling your credit

2. reduce IRA balances before RMDs kick in
3. take advantage of lower tax brackets before 2026

Basic numbers: 2 mill in IRAs, 300k in Roths; income needed per year: 100k. *Unfortunately, no taxed accounts to pay taxes from*. Mortgage is paid off, home value is about 360k, but we don't want to sell. No other debt. Free health insurance in retirement through the state.

**Plan A**: Withdraw 170k from IRA; 100k = living expenses; 70k is for Roth conversion (to stay in 22% tax bracket). Pay 31k in taxes (23k fed, 8k state) out of the Roth amount. Effective conversion amount is 39k. 

* Ending balance of both accounts: 2.138 mill.

**Plan B**: Withdraw 100k from Roth (living expenses). Convert 80k of the IRA (to stay in 12% tax bracket) and pay 9k in taxes (6k fed, 3k state) out of the Roth conversion amount. Effective conversion amount is 71k.

* Ending balance of both accounts: 2.182 mill.

(Of course I'm neglecting several factors, such as possible losses or gains. We'd reassess the plan each year.)

Seems to me that plan B is best. But am I thinking this through correctly? I don't like to eviscerate our Roths, but they are basically our ""slush funds"" since we have no other available funds.

personalfinance,Qualifications as a first time homebuyer after mobile home,"Here is my situation. I own a manufactured home (aka mobile home/trailer- this term not used legally any more). I bought it in Oct 2019. I do not own the lot that it sits on; I lease it. I have a mortgage for it, and took no federal assistance in obtaining the mortgage. 

What I want to do: save for a house and keep those savings in investments in the interim. I learned that you can use IRA funds up to $10k for a first time home purchase. I have a Roth IRA that has performed well and it would be quite easy to contribute to it. More importantly, I want to use said Roth so that the withdrawal is free of tax. 

So my question - does my mobile home disqualify me as a first time homebuyer? From my limited understanding, it appears I still qualify for FHA, but it's the Roth withdrawal that concerns me.

If so, how would you recommend investing the savings instead of the IRA? Are there other funds that allow for paying tax in advance?",finance

First a bit about me:
23m, I make $32,000 a year, I am financially independent, all my bills are in my own name and have been since 18. The only money I've ever borrowed was for a $4,000 student loan that was promptly paid off and doesn't show on my credit report. 

I am posting for two reasons here. 

1. Do I need credit? 
2. If I do, is taking out a personal loan an effective way to build credit?

So both my parents are big Dave Ramsey fans (I have read his books) and are believers that debt is not necessary unless you purchasing a home. I tend to agree, as I don't drive a fancy car or own a credit card. I think it's good practice to only purchase things you can afford but I can't help but fear that when I do go to purchase a home I won't be approved for a loan or at least approved with any decent interest rate. I can't even get approved for a credit card right now let alone a mortgage and I've talked to the loan manager at my bank about what my options are as far as a personal loan and I would be approved for a 10% interest rate on a small loan (less than $3,000.) Yikes. 

So, do I need credit? Or should i rely on these Dave Ramsey values and hope a bank is willing to loan me money based on the fact that I have never borrowed money. 

If I do need credit I have an idea of how to build it and I would like your opinions on if this would be effective/smart. I have a decent amount of money in my savings and I am thinking of taking a personal loan out against my savings (savings would be collateral) for a repair bill I owe ($2700) and just essentially pay the interest of the loan to build my credit instead of paying the bill directly. 

Tldr: I have no credit and I'm wondering I need it and if a personal loan against my savings is an effective way to build credit. (paying interest to build credit)",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**

Stocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.

The Labor Department’s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a “string” of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, “What I see here is somewhat of a ‘goldilocks’ overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important."" 

Recent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was ""still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we’re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.""

**Highlights**

* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company’s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.
* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)
* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. 
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona.

I've only been working since October, so our financial position isn't good yet. We have remaining student loan debts of $49k from my wife's master's degree (interest-free until the end of September) and $49k in cash. No other debts on anything. $15-20k is for our emergency fund and the rest was saved to go towards loans. We plan to save at least another $8k before the end of September, so we could get her debts down to around the $10k mark (whilst keeping an emergency fund).

I know that some people would shout ""pay off the debt"" at me, but my thought process is more geared towards getting to the point where we have no debt AND enough to buy a house with a decent amount of savings. We live in San Jose, so the cheap end of the market is over $800k. We currently have around $51k split between Fidelity and Vanguard (in addition to the $49k cash). They consist of a range of popular, high-performing ETFs.

We've already decided to pay off the 2 higher interest rate student loans (about 7 %). Interest rates on the last $19k would be 5.41 %. Historically, good ETF funds make considerably more than 5.41 % and my portfolio is doing well so far. My current thought process is to pay off the first 2 loans just before interest kicks in again, leaving about $19k of debt, and then evenly split any money that we don't need for rent/essentials between ETFs and loans. The first part (paying off 2 loans) is already decided on. I'm just struggling with choosing whether to pay off the third loan as fast as possible, invest in the market, or hedge my bets by going halfway. That way we'll have lower debts each month (regardless of the stock market) and also be adding to our portfolio.

CryptoCurrency,"If the US Fed adopts a CBDC, is automated inflation/deflation possible? And what do you think of the prospects of more equitable stimulus disbursement","Right now, the Fed has two major tools with which to implement monetary policy: raising/lowering interest rates, and quantitative easing. The former isn't relevant to cryptotechnology, but the latter is.

With quantitative easing, the Fed injects money into the economy indirectly, by buying government bonds in the hopes that government spending will disburse the money into the economy. The effectiveness by which it is disbursed is....disputed to say the least.

But the adoption of a ""Fedcoin"" would add three more possible tools to their disposal: direct stimulus, selective deflation, and automated stimulus/deflation. The third one is the one I'm interested in, but first I need to establish what I'm thinking for the the first two.

Regarding direct stimulus, this has the potential to be a more equitable method of disbursing stimulus funds. Assuming the Fedcoin uses a public blockchain (big assumption, I know) with public staking/mining, the Fed could choose to disburse stimulus funds by simply raising the staking/mining rewards rate. This puts more money directly into people's personal wallets instead of only going into the coffers of government contractors.

By the same token, the Fed could deflate the money supply by burning transaction fees. This would help alleviate concerns of inflation after a large stimulus program.

My question is: can the decision of whether to stimulate or deflate the money supply in this way be automated? Is it possible (or even advisable) to entrust an automated entity with judging the state of the economy and dynamically raise rewards or burn transaction fees in response to economic conditions?

And by ""automated,"" I don't necessarily mean by an AI, but maybe something based on the principles of game theory and decentralized finance so that the users of the Fedcoin themselves determine the inflation or deflation rate. I'm thinking of something similar in concept to AMMs and liquidity pools, and how they leverage human greed to determine exchange rates.

CryptoCurrency,Pay attention to APR vs APY,"Many exchanges offer interest rates on your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when you deposit with them.  When shopping for the best interest rates, pay attention to whether the rate is APR or APY.  The difference is subtle, but important, especially for large amounts.

APR, or Annual Percentage RATE, gives you the rate at which your original deposit accrues interest.  If you allow it to compound, rolling the interest into the original amount, the APR number does not take that interest into account - so you're also earning interest on your interest.

APY, or Annual Percentage YIELD, gives you the amount at which your deposit will pay out after one year.  It takes the interest that you're earning into account on that payout.  You're not earning any additional interest on the interest, because it's already been factored into the APY number.

This site has a handy calculator to help you see the difference: https://www.aprtoapy.com/

Edit: A quick edit for something u/MegaUltraHorndog pointed out:
Pay attention to where your interest on the deposit goes.  

APY interest *must* be rolled back into the original deposit in order to work, and the money can't be touched for an entire year in order to get that APY number.  If you withdraw any of it early, you're not getting the APY percentage.

APR interest is often deposited in a different part of the account, so you have to manually roll it back in yourself if you want to earn interest on it.  The good part is, you're still earning the same *rate*, even if you withdraw the interest, or take your money out early.

I hope that clears that up.",cryptocurrency

*****
&gt; Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.
*****
&gt; May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected.
*****
&gt; Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January.
*****
&gt; Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%.
*****
&gt; But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market.
*****
&gt; “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention.
*****
&gt; “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC.
*****
&gt; “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.”
*****
&gt; Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814.

&gt; # Watching the inflation signs
&gt; Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year.
*****
&gt; “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.”
*****
&gt; He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed.
*****
&gt; “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.”
*****
&gt; Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market.
*****
&gt; Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected.
*****
&gt; Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking?
*****
&gt; “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca.
*****
&gt; # Taper talk
&gt; The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying.
*****
&gt; After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023.
*****
&gt; Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.”
*****
&gt; For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said.
*****
&gt; There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.
*****
&gt; G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

&gt; # May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold

&gt; Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors.

&gt; One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery?

&gt; Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions.

&gt; It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways:

&gt; * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs.

&gt; * The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%.

&gt; * Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases.

&gt; “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market &gt; Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.”

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.4.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well.

&gt; The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy.

&gt; Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

&gt; For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released.

&gt; # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

&gt; S&amp;P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

&gt; We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

&gt; # June Swoon?

&gt; Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&amp;P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are some stats to think about regarding S&amp;P 500 performance in June:

&gt; * Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse).

&gt; * It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s.

&gt; * The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month.

&gt; * According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June.

&gt; * Building on this, when the S&amp;P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%.

&gt; We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings.

&gt; Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&amp;P 500. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate.

&gt; # Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks

&gt; Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Neut.png))**

&gt; With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Cons-Above-20.png))**

&gt; Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&amp;P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

&gt; # Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps.

&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade

&gt; The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift.

&gt; “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

&gt; Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Returns Relative to History

&gt; May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&amp;P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&amp;P 500 to the S&amp;P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928.

&gt; We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&amp;P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&amp;P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Current-vs-Avg1.png))**

&gt; The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Percentile-Rank1.png))**

&gt; Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&amp;P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&amp;P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&amp;P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?

&gt; For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&amp;P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

CryptoCurrency,What if...,"Federal Reserve + IRS + Digital Dollar will bypass the banks and run them out of town. They won't have to deal with the banks greed, risks and they will become the ultimate monopoly they've always dreamed of. They will impose their ledger, keeping the cryptoverse hostage as side chains. This will buy them more time for their next scheme.",cryptocurrency
computers,"Legion 5 Pro, Acer Nitro 5, Asus ROG Strix G15, or Gigabyte Aorus 15G?","Here is what I'll be using the laptop for:

\-School Google Stuff (i.e., docs, slides, classroom, sheets, etc...)

\-Adobe photoshop (and possibly some other adobe video editing softwares)

\-Python programming (I'm a beginner so I won't need any crazy editors, engines, or data analytics engines that demand extremely high resources)

\-Streaming softwares (I use twitch studio and/or OBS (still deciding)) (no face cam though)

\-Gaming (roblox, valorant, online .io games (i.e., [shellshockers.io](https://shellshockers.io/) and [krunker.io](https://krunker.io/), modern warfare, GTA, etc...))

I'm kind of getting set on the Legion 5 pro as it comes at such a great price with absolutely phenomenal specs. It's the only laptop with a 3070 at a reasonable price on this list. It also has a great 165 Hz, 16 inch, quad HD IPS Display panel, which is great. Here are the specs I'm thinking of getting for the legion 5 pro (AMD 2021) (recommendations welcome):

Total: 2383 SGD (student pricing)

However this laptop is quite heavy, and just to consider other laptops, I looked at 3 other ones.

The acer nitro 5 is a great priced laptop that is also heavy, but with great specs.

It has great specs, but an intel wifi card and ""only"" a 3060 (still great but the former has a 3070), with a slightly lower refresh rate and smaller screen. It does have 32 gb RAM to be future proofed, and 1 TB SSD (also future proof). Judging by the stuff I'm going to be doing on the laptop, I don't think I'll need that much RAM, right? Or should I opt for a laptop with 32 gb ram (configurable on legion 5 pro)? Also I only need 512 gb SSD (I only used 96 GB on my 256 GB SSD MBA 2017 after 3 years of school and games (but no actual games–only roblox). So I don't really need 1 TB storage.

The Asus ROG Strix G15 is also a great laptop and I also like Asus products quite a bit for their good build quality and design. Here are the specs I'm thinking of getting for this laptop:

* Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H
* OS: Windows 10 Home (64-bit)
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU with 6GB DDR6
* Screen: FHD 144hz
* RAM: 16GB DDR4 RAM
* Storage: 1TB SSD
* Warranty: 2 YEARS INTERNATIONAL WARRANTY

Weight: 2.3kg

This laptop doesn't have a webcam and that could potentially be a deal breaker as it's also a school laptop (tbh though, not sure if I'll need it though since I have a webcam on my mac, should I need it for potential future online classes). It also has 3060, with 144 Hz refresh rate, but it's slightly lighter than the 2 other laptops I just mentioned. There is also a free upgrade to 32 GB RAM for some reason, so I'll definitely do that for future proofing. I'm not sure if this one is worth considering, unless it's got a really cool feature(s) you know that other laptops don't have.

The final laptop I am currently considering is the Gigabyte Aorus 15G. Here are the specs I'm thinking of getting:

Processor: i7-10870H

OS: Windows 10 Home

Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 3060 GDDR6 6GB

Screen: 15.6"" FHD 240Hz IPS-Level

RAM: 16GB DDR4

Storage: 512GB NVMe SSD

Warranty: 2 YEARS WARRANTY BY GIGABYTE

Total: 2499 SGD

Weight: 2.2Kg

This laptop is the lightest, but also the most expensive (well by 1 SGD lol (to the strix)). It has great peripherals and even though it's FHD, I've been looking at that 240 Hz refresh rate–I do some competitive gaming and streaming so will 165 Hz on the legion 5 pro be enough? Or will it be a bottleneck and I should opt for 240 Hz refresh rate? It has a 'nose cam' but at least it has a webcam. Also a bit worried about the intel CPU, as I like AMD way more, but a lot of people told me that this CPU will be great too, what do you think?

I don't really know about this one as it's the most expensive on this list (my budget is 2600 SGD though), and unless it's really good in some aspects (if you have one please tell me about it), I'm not sure...",technology

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. The Essential Cardano List is published by IOHK. (credit to [/u/cascading\_disruption](https://www.reddit.com/u/cascading_disruption/) for pointing this out) [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1390728385945550848)
2. Cryptodoggies.org NFTs are now available. The website says 50% will go to a community voted animal charity. [https://www.cryptodoggies.org/](https://www.cryptodoggies.org/)
3. For those learning Haskell, Check out this new video on Type Theory. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8)
4. Also, Lars puts out a new Plutus Pioneers video on Native tokens. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbhY162GQA)
5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

6. IOHK has dropped a new article on the status of KEVM and IELE. Grigori Rosu of Runtime Verification says a proof-of-concept of IELE should be ready in six months. This is a key component in how we get to the ocean of all developers as we grow beyond the pond.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

23. The saga of BTC maximalists being angry at Elon continues with Elon implying that Tesla could sell its BTC while Cardano continues just doing its thing like normal. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies)
24. Likewise, Marc Cuban tried to FUD real world use of Cardano only to be confronted with a giant infographic of use cases and partnerships along with an explanatory video just for him.

26. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets.

30. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

34. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

36. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment.  When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature. 
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.  
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
86. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

economy,Inflation is caused by broad-based rising wages for wage laborers?,"So if I understand this economic argument correctly:

1) Higher broad-based wage gains for workers lead to inflation

2) Inflation erodes the purchasing power from the additional wage gains, leaving those workers in essentially the same position in real-world purchasing power terms as they were before....

3) Therefore, the Fed needs to raise interest rates to control inflation whenever wage laborers start enjoy broad-based wage gains in times of labor shortages

4) Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money, get a mortgage on a house, etc.  The people who actually need to borrow money to make major purchases are....wage laborers.

It's almost like there is literally no way for wage laborers to win here.....

Which is why

5) We completely disregard any interest in raising wages and instead focus on creating such a massive oversupply of goods and services by pandering to the every whim of the entrepreneurial class that eventually one person's trash becomes another person's treasure....In theory.  

6) Which sort of works for a little while, until the ever-growing inequality between the haves and the have nots becomes so divisive that the fabric of society gets torn apart and all our vital institutions for preparing people for the world, maintaining law and order, electing legitimate governments, etc. start to break down.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"We can be heroes, just for one day","So amid the tribalism and the political leanings and the vast difference of opinions about certain talking heads and how they influence this space, let’s remember something as a community;

#We are here.  We aren’t going away, and we are what is making crypto successful.

Not the institutions.  Not JP Morgan.  Not Elon Musk or Mark Cuban or anybody else.

The discount varies by the amount of money I would transfer, but I think the discount I'd be looking at is 0.25% off the interest rate in exchange for sending 75% of the loan's balance to JP Morgan. My plan would be to just move my VOO money at Vanguard to JP Morgan's low expense diversified US equity equivalent that has a 0.02% expense ratio. I have no foreseeable immediate need for this cash. It is my long-term savings.

Has anyone done this? Is there any real downside here? JP Morgan's other ETF products look like they have awful expense ratios, but their vanilla US equity ETF is as cheap as Vanguard or Fidelity. 

Also not sure this matters, but the mortgage would be a primary residence and jumbo/non-conforming. Not sure if I want to go with a 30 year fixed or 7/1 ARM. Unclear how long I'd be staying there but hopefully at least a few years.

I have a few concerns, that honestly have nothing to do with Dogecoin it’s self, mainly growing concerns over the Government/IRS taking notice, whether they acknowledge it or not.  I know that the DC crooks amongst the other crooks, Big Tech, Federal Reserve, etc.  are taking plenty notice.

That said, me personally, I’m not selling Doge or any of my other cryptos, Idc what the price is to be 100% honest, for I hold several different crypto’s, and it’s not for the purpose of converting it BACK to USD.  

I buy crypto to get ahead of the Collapsing USD, amongst other things, I genuinely believe in the idea of crypto, and even more so I TRULY believe in what it will do for average Americans like myself and the rest of the (crypto) community. 

There are weak ones amongst us, that will allow themselves to be manipulated along with their crypto, if you DONT sell and convert your crypto to USD than the IRS have not a leg 🦵🏻 to stand on.

personalfinance,Mortgage financing a home while also renting apt?

I called around and the consensus from lenders/agents/banks was that for a second home you’re going to have to put down usually 20% with usually a higher interest rate. 

After learning this... I don’t think it’s feasible to get a loan for a vacation property but instead of a getaway home can I buy a regular house and just declare that my primary residence and keep my apt and rent in the city.

I would spend time in both locations, perhaps even more in the house, but I guess I’m just confused how they count your residences and if there’s anyway they would check in regards to taxes, ID, registration, etc.

But I figured if I declare something as a primary residence then I’d get a typical 5% down and lower interest rate and perhaps even a first time homebuyer assistance program.",finance

investing,Looking for feedback on my medium term aggressive strategy using margin.,"Hi everybody! First time posting here but I figured this would be a solid place to start to get some feedback on a strategy that I have been using involving about 25% margin and using dividends to pay the interest down. Over the years ive found that when something seems easy, its generally because I’m missing something in the bigger picture which isnt factored into my overall plan so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! This portfolio is founded on higher cap tech heavy stocks leaning towards growth, some value and some less fun index funds, the key component is really focusing it around dividend paying investments…I’ve chosen to omit the actual investments as to not create any bias or general judgement on my holdings. I am simply looking for feedback on this strategy regarding my utilization of margin and how to more effectively use it. So here’s what ive been doing for about the past 6 months. 


I started this portfolio with 10k and have generally been DCA’ing in every week or so and recently I made the decision that on some of my positions the bottom was in and I took about 20 percent margin to buy more. Currently the entire portfolio is worth about 15k and here’s where I am looking for feedback..My plan is just to continue to DCA in as I normally do, pay down a small amount of my margin every month and then when the opportunity arises buy back in using leverage when I feel like a dip presents an opportunity. My margin interest rate is about 6.5% so its not the end of the world and my dividend payout will be used to cover majority of the interest on that anyway. I personally feel that 30% seems to be a safe number however I could be completely wrong. 


I guess my question is, am I utilizing margin effectively or am I making a mistake by paying down margin too quickly where that money could be better utilized by just buying more. What am I missing and/or what are some strategies you use regarding margin for growth heavy stocks? Am I paying my margin down the right way or is it better. Also not looking for “dont use margin”…obviously I am aware of the risks of using margin. 


I know theres a lot that I’m leaving out here with my personal risk tolerance, but I’m just kind of trying to get a feel for the best way to utilize leverage in this weird turbulent market. Another note, I do not wish to exceed 30% margin under any circumstances. This is just a portfolio that I have to learn and develop some skills and not max out margin and try to make as much money as fast as possible.

EDIT: I want to avoid selling anything to pay down my margin, I would rather pay it down from other sources of income rather than selling stock to cover that cost as well.",finance

defi,If you're winning big at DeFi... how do you pay taxes on it?,"I'm looking at the high interest rates at anchorprotocol.com or yearn's yvBOOST vault and drooling a little.

If someone bought into these, maybe by transferring USDC from Coinbase, will the IRS know whose wallet address the money came from or went back out to?

personalfinance,Refinancing in the current inflated housing market,"I currently owe 205,xxx on a condo I purchased in 2018 w/ 4.5+% interest rate for 215xxx (FHA loan 3.5% down rolled in closing costs thanks to bad advice). 

Before the pandemic, I did a streamlined FHA refi with fees paid by my mortgage company and got a slightly better rate (4.25%). 

My home value, like everyone else’s, has skyrocketed during the pandemic, with comps that are not updated (90s) going for 250-260k. I also have made some major (close to 100%) renovations since the last appraisal of 215k in 2018.

I would like to refi to get a better rate and remove the $144 PMI I pay. 

What is the best strategy here? I don’t have a support system with financial knowledge, so I’m a little overwhelmed. I’ve reached out to my mortgage servicer (Mr. Cooper) as well as my personal bank (a semi national big bank) and a local broker at another big bank who works with a specialty loan we qualify for (like VA but different program). 

What should I be asking, what types of tricks do these companies pull? How do I ensure the best savings here, without added fees being rolled in?

personalfinance,Yet Another Refinancing Question,"I read through a lot of other posts on refinancing houses and it seemed like almost every situation encouraged to refinance. I’m trying to find out if it is right for me. 


House bought in Greater Seattle Area in July 2020 for 633,000

Current loan: Conventional 30 year “Effective interest rate” 3.00%
Balance: 590,000

Redfin and Zillow estimate house value anywhere between 719k-829k. From what I have seen comparable houses have sold for 750-800 in our neighborhood. This would change the LTV to sub 80% potentially and remove the PMI. 

I believe I also have the ability to get an appraisal and send a formal letter to my lender to request the PMI drop off. 


Here are my concerns:
-I don’t think we could get a better interest rate. 
-We don’t have a lot of free cash to pay for closing or appraisal. 
-Appraisal could come back within a pretty wide range

personalfinance,Currently own a home but planning to move in ~5 yrs. Buy future home now?,"My wife and I live in Seattle but will be moving back home (Orange County, CA) in around 5 years or so. We have enough saved to buy a second home and I'm wondering if this is a good idea to buy one now to lock in these crazy low interest rates. If we did this we would probably just rent it out until we decide to move back. Is this a dumb idea? The only thing driving me to consider this is the low interest rates.  
Right now all the money that we would be using for a down payment is in the market earning us gains so we would lose out on those future gains. So the decision is pretty much: leave our down payment money in the market and use the balance in 5 years to buy a house or buy a house now and benefit from low interest rates.

maticnetwork,Best place to earn a return on MATIC on Polygon,"I have a bunch of MATIC and I'm trying to figure out the best way to get a return on it ideally on the MATIC network. I don't really wanna bridge it back to ETH and stake it.

I was gonna deposit it in AAVE and then borrow as much MATIC as possible and then redeposit it in AAVE and then borrow as much MATIC as possible, etc. But I realized that the deposit rate is 5.7% and the variable interest rate is 14% and I can only borrow up to 50% of the value of my collateral. Therefore I think I would not be making MATIC by doing this because I would be paying 14% on half my collateral but only making 5% on my collateral, leaving a -2% differential. Let me know if I'm messing this up somehow. 

So is my best option just to deposit on AAVE for 5%?

Let's say I want to give my recently-graduated child a lump sum for her to invest long-term (20+ years), $200,000. I've got several options here:

1. If I gift it directly, then I have to file a gift tax return. I would only have to pay additional taxes if it exceeds the lifetime exclusion of 11 million, is that right?

2. If I turn it into a loan of $100,000, then there's a federal minimum interest rate I have to charge on it, around 2% currently. If my child pays me this interest, it would be part of my taxable income, right?

3. If my child *doesn't* pay me this interest, then I would *still* get the interest added to my taxable income, but it also counts as a gift?

1. Is there a certain amount of equity needed in relation to the amount borrowed. Do i need 40k equity to borrow 20k etc..
2. Is there a mandatory length of time the homeowner has had possession in order to qualify?
3. Best institutions to finance this thing? Banks? Current mortgage holder? Credit unions?
4. Interest rate? Does this follow the current FED housing market at all? Is it more of a personal loan rate? Can this be paid off when the borrowed amount is paid or does the credit line stay open? How does this affect interest? Can i pay extra on the principal each month to knock it out?Once fulfilled does is my equity restored? How does it affect a sale on my home? I'll have this cash in about 24 months, but i just dont know if I can wait that long to tackle this. My plan would be to AGGRESSIVELY pay it down. Im looking at around 20k.
5. Is it worth it? Im in need of home repair/upgrade and considering it but obviously I'm in the initial stages. Savings is not where it needs to be.

It is the central banker mankind has always needed and wanted but never had. Until now.

THIS IS THE REVOLUTION of ALL REVOLUTIONS. If you REALLY want to make a difference, join our fight.

Bitcoin,Ron Paul wants People to decide between BTC &amp; USD,"Former U.S. congressman Ron Paul says that he wants to legalize the dollar’s competition, including bitcoin, and let the people decide which money to use, not the government. “Freedom of choice will sort it out,” he said.

Ron Paul Wants to Legalize Bitcoin as Money to Compete With Dollar

Former presidential candidate Ron Paul discussed bitcoin as an alternative asset in an interview with Kitco News’ Michelle Makori Wednesday. Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former congressman from Texas launched The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to bring “provocative opinion and analysis to the breaking issues affecting our lives and finances,” its website details.

When asked about his views on bitcoin, Paul said that he knows a lot more about precious metals being money than cryptocurrency. “I was fascinated with it for a long long time. But I’m also fascinated with what’s coming,” he opined.

The former congressman added that “people ought to have as much freedom as possible to have choices.” He then describes a bill he introduced in Congress to “not only audit the Fed but also to get rid of the legal tender laws.” He explained that currently, the government will not allow anything to compete with the dollar on the national level, elaborating:

My goal is to legalize the competition and the people will sort it out. Freedom of choice will sort it out.

“My concern is that governments over centuries have been notoriously very eager to have control of the money. Believe me, they will not give up control of money,” he emphasized.

Paul was asked to elaborate on what he meant by legalizing the competition. He replied: “Right now, if you buy and sell gold, you get it taxed, they can do that. If you make a profit in bitcoin, you read stories about people being taxed on it. You can’t tax money, you don’t tax it. If you bought a dollar a year ago and it went down 10%, you can’t take a loss because your dollar lost value.”

Paul will also be speaking at the Bitcoin 2021 conference Friday. Regarding what he plans to say at the conference, he said: “I will argue more the case for the legalization of freedom of choice, and the people should make decisions and not the government.”

He acknowledged that some people are very enthusiastic about bitcoin and think that it is the only money that will exist, replacing the dollar. However, in his opinion:

I think the dollar is going to be around but it’s not gonna be worth much.

Nonetheless, he noted: “the legal tender laws force you to use legal tender, so they won’t even allow you to replace the dollars with cryptocurrency. There will be laws against that. But, I want to totally legalize it.”

He further opined: “I think our problem isn’t the technicality of the gold standards or crypto. Our problems are the dependency on government and less concern about personal liberty. What about property rights and contract rights? This is what we need to be concentrating on.”",cryptocurrency
economy,The FED can use the planet Mars to set interest rates and control inflation,"The FED can use Mars to set interest rates. A new book called ""The Mars Hypothesis"" presents the idea that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars. In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.

So maybe by now you have heard about IOTA, but what is **STMicroelectronics**?

For me at least, even as a software dev, I was not aware of it a few weeks ago. STMicroelectronics is a “French-Italian Dutch-domiciled multinational [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics) and [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) manufacturer \[...\] resulting from the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies in 1987” ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics)). Last year, their yearly revenue increased to **over 10 Billion Dollars** ([Source](https://investors.st.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stmicroelectronics-reports-q4-and-fy-2020-financial-results)).  
They are operating in too many fields to break down here (look at their [website](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) under “products), but one field I am extremely bullish on where DLTs can have an remarkable impact is the *automotive industry*. STMicroelectronics ranks here as the **5th largest semiconductor supplier** **worldwide** ([Source](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/infineon-becomes-king-auto-2019-06/)).

Amazing use cases are possible if a ST microcontroller is being used in the car you are driving, for example stuff like this here ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwVf4t8bhl8)) from [ETO Group](https://www.etogruppe.com/) &amp; funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transportation and Digital Infrastructure could become reality. What also helps is that IOTA is part of [MOBI](https://dlt.mobi/) (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) to explore future use cases for DLT in the mobility ecosystem.

If you are creative enough, maybe you have more ideas for machine-to-machine communication DLT use cases in the automotive field or any other business sectors that use machines.

Why so extremely bullish on the partnership between IOTA &amp; STMicroelectronics?

1. They are an incredible huge company
2. Specialized in the IOT/M2M communication field that also IOTA focuses on
3. And now after the IOTA Devnet 2.0 got released, they published this beautiful [tweet](https://twitter.com/ST_World/status/1400391942521950208) (lots of shiny IOTA coins in the beginning 😍) and published [this blog post](https://blog.st.com/x-cube-iota1/) on their website.  
They used their manpower &amp; resources to develop their own “IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology software expansion” for their STM32 microcontroller You can read about reasons, advantages and so on why they chose IOTA in the blog post, but for the lazy ones I want to leave the biggest one: The software extension takes “advantage of the new **IOTAs Chrysalis that can perform 600 million transactions for the same amount of energy as one Bitcoin transaction**”. Another special paragraph is “*The New Face of IOTA*” - read it if you are still thinking that IOTA hasn't matured a lot over the past 4 years.

If you are a technical person, you can look into the software yourself ([Source](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-expansion-packages/x-cube-iota1.html)). If you don't know enough about this topic, be a smart investor and think/learn about projects that create true value. And no, even if it sounds highly appealing, 20% staking rewards for a useless currency that nobody uses is *not* valuable in the future.

My opinion:  
Just realize that you are still so incredibly early for mainstream adoption. In this whole crypto space we don't have fully functional projects right now, *everything* is in development. But you should invest in projects that can have a huge impact on the future. For me personally, it is just inevitable that machines will need a **secure, scalable, energy-efficient and feeless communication mechanism** in the future - and IMO this will bring value in a way that more automation of processes will be possible than we can imagine right now. I don't recommend investing your money into IOTA in particular, but please do your own research and think about partnerships that really matter in the long run.

datascience,I got a DS related internship at HP!,"Hello all! So recently, I started working at HP as a product management intern. I know, that’s marketing, not data science, but I’ve spent the past two weeks learning all about it, and I find it very interesting. 

So, for context, I’m a senior and this is my first PAID internship. I’ve done 5 unpaid internships over the course of 3 semesters before this in hopes it would land me a real one, and it actually did. I spoke to a HP recruiter which gave me a contact at another company. After 3 months of speaking to several people at the other company, just to result in my intern application being rejected, I returned to said HP recruiter. Their website had no internship that fit me, so I spoke to her directly, which led to two interviews and an offer. And after viewing my work profile, I saw that said internship was meant for an MBA candidate, not an undergrad. Therefore, I’m guessing my experience made up for what level of education they were looking for.

Thus, I signed on to be a marketing manager/product management intern for the Z by HP division. And Z makes computers for data scientists, like high gigs of ram, more core processors, and intel gold (and probably some other stuff, but my tech knowledge isn’t super expansive). And while working with them, I’ve interviewed a lot of DS professionals about their computer needs and what type they use. Also, about what SW stacks they like, and what language they code in. And there has been quite a consistency amongst their answers.

Therefore, if you are a DS undergrad/graduate looking for a job or internship, I have some advice for you:

1. Diversify your skill set. Most people I spoke to didn’t have a DS degree, rather they started their careers, something went wrong, and they made a career shift to DS. It was easy to switch to because from what I can tell, DS is growing, all companies are dependent on some sort of cloud, and python is their preferred code language. So with the influx of people entering DS, if you started in DS, learn for than one coding language, and make sure you can use a variety of SW stacks so that you can separate yourself from the competition.

2. Take an unpaid internship (only if it is worth it). Like I said, I’ve had 5, but I quit one early. The reason is if you aren’t going to pay me, I’m not going to perform work I believe a paid person should (which I know, is technically any work, but just watch where I’m going with this). I quit one because there was no way I was going to be at the stadium 3 hours before the game starts, run around setting every event table up and it’s accessories, miss the entire game because I have to help people the entire time, not have a break, get off at 11 pm, not have a parking pass, and on top of that only be fed a mini Jimmy John’s sandwhich. 

But, there were others where I liked what I was doing, and they only required 10 hours or less work a week. I’d never advise anyone to work 40 hours a week for free, I wouldn’t advise even 15 hours a week for free. Just a few internships to pad the Resumé, but most importantly, actually provide you with some knowledge that will be applicable to your next job.

3. Apply even if you are not qualified. This applies to both internships and scholarships because I’ve gotten my way with both. These things provide too much for you not to try. I almost didn’t apply to the scholarship that takes care of all my tuition for my last two years of college, but I did. I almost reach back out to the recruiter that led to my internship now, at a company that will pay off the few student loans I do have. Hell, I almost didn’t apply to transfer to the university in at now after my freshman year at one I didn’t like, but was the epitome of “safe”. So believe in yourself and pull the trigger. This saying be be shot to hell but it’s true: you only live once (unless you believe in reincarnation, but you still only live THIS life once).",technology

Bitcoin,"Be careful out there, we just poked the bear...","El Salvador (a country that uses USD as currency) declaring Bitcoin legal tender flies directly in the face of the federal reserve, modern monetary theory, and is another crack in the USD facade as the world reserve currency.

bonds,The Federal Reserve can use the planet Mars to set interest rates and control inflation...according to a new book,"The Federal Reserve can use Mars to set interest rates. A new book called ""The Mars Hypothesis"" presents the idea that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars. In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.

2. Nigeria Bans Twitter after Twitter censors Tweet from Nigerian President. This emphasizes the need for decentralized social media.  A decentralized solution running on Cardano could fix this.

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

30. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become.

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
86. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

personalfinance,Helping My Retired Mother cash out Refinance and putting the house in my name. Help,"My mother retired during covid last year 2020. We have been holding off with the refinance for a couple of months. Plan to do a cash out refinance as the the house needs a new roof and front yard done over. Which would be about 20K. She has some debit that she has to take care of also. I was told the the house has a lot of equity. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things i need to look out for? I am not sure about the interest rates but again i am new to this. the plan is to fix up and house hack the house. Rent out one floor and keep the first floor and basement to herself.

It would be great if someone can help me out before i start calling banks. 

Any article, blog anything would be great.

stocks,The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD),"**Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take out a loan if my law school will pay it off?,"Hi everyone,

I just graduated law school and plan to go into public interest law. I currently have about 60k in debt. My law school will cover my loan payments (the entire payment) as long as I work in public interest. However, if I start making over 100k, I will have to contribute 40% of whatever income I make over 100k (e.g. if I make 110k, I will have to contribute $4000/year, or $333/month). The job I have lined up for September starts at 60k, but after I (hopefully) pass the bar and am officially hired, my salary will be 106k. 

The law school program is integrated with the federal government's loan forgiveness, so after 10 years, any debt I have remaining will be forgiven. 

My dilemma is this: my law school will also cover up to a 10k bar loan (living expenses while studying for the bar exam). Bar loans are private loans, and they have a high interest rate (8-10%). While they aren't eligible for federal forgiveness, my law school will make payments so that this loan will be fully paid off in 10 years. 

 I don't strictly \*need\* the money, since I have enough money in savings to cover my living expenses, but I would obviously like to keep my savings if possible and it would be nice to have a cushion since I'm also moving this summer.

If the amount I pay in loans is \*not\* dependent on the amount of my loans, but rather just dependent on how much I make, then it's okay to take out another loan, right? I'm a little nervous about taking a high interest loan, even though theoretically, I won't be paying it back, or at least won't be paying \*all\* of it. 

Thanks if you made it this far, I know it's a lot of info!!",finance

personalfinance,27 &amp; Confused on what to do with money in a new life situation,"Hello everyone and thanks for everyone that reads this and wants to give me some advice.

I'm 27 and make \~160k living in Colorado.

I want to know what my next best steps should be for my money to grow while also having a nice safety net and the ability to possibly make a bigger purchase in the future like a car in maybe 1-2 years and maybe (don't know if this is smart) a small condo in 2-5 years. I also am confused as to where to invest because I think I'm outside of the roth ira limit and have no 401k match.

For some background,

My first job was on the east coast where I made \~60k and lived with people in finance and invested my money pretty well and got a nice 401k match when I left my first company after around 4 years.

My second job was in NYC where I made around 115k. Due to the high cost of living and me living a pretty extravagant lifestyle at the time I feel like I didn't really make the best money moves.

When the pandemic started I pretty much shifted my whole life, moved to colorado by myself and kept working remote. I had to foot the bill for all my own expenses/ rent and had a personal trainer so still wasn't saving a ton.

Fast forward to now, I got a new job making around 160k but also lowered my expenses by moving in with my sister and lowered my tax bill as well. Unfortunately, I'm a contractor so I don't have a 401k match.

Net worth / accounts:

Total Net worth: \~87k

Fidelity:

Rollover IRA - 50k

Wealthfront:

Roth IRA - 30k

Personal Investment Account - 11k

Robinhood - 26k

Savings - 7k

401k waiting to transfer from last job - 8k

\--

Student Loans:

Total: 45k

30k @ 3% interest - 500/ mo payment

15k @ 4% interest - Federal loan / not currently paying

\---

Expenses:

Total: \~4300 / month

Rent: 1300/ month

Car/ Parking/ Insurance: 150/ month. It's a beater that is paid off I just pay for parking and insurance and let my sister drive it to work.

Student Loan: 500/ month

Gym: 175 / month, I do some personal training

Music: 120/ month, drum lessons

Misc expenses:  \~2000 on going out to eat, buying things that I want, clothes etc. I know I can cut this back, I've been trying to keep it around 1400.

\---

So with all that taken into account I have around 4,000 dollars to save and really no idea what to do with it.

Here are my main questions:

1. Should I be saving more money into an emergency fund situation or putting it into investments? I feel like my 7k is super low and I have no liquidity to buy things cash.. but what do I really need to buy in cash anyway?
2. After that is situated where should I be putting the rest of my money? I have no 401k match, I think I'm over the roth IRA limit, and things like robinhood are too volatile for me right now. Should I just be putting it into index funds with wealthfront?
3. Should I be paying off my student loans more rapidly or just stick to the market because my rates are so low?
4. What if I wanted to buy a car? Should I save more money in case I find a good used one? Should I just finance it? Should I lease? Should I not buy a car?
5. What if I wanted to buy a house? Do I need the down payment in my savings account? Can I use some of my stocks or investment accounts as a down payment?
6. Are my expenses crazy? In NYC I feel like people told me I was cheap in Colorado I'm a big spender...

In summary, I think I'm trying to wrap my head around a sudden increase in income and a lowering of expenses. Also an environment where people seem to be buying a lot of things, cars, houses, etc. where as before everything was rented. Not sure if I need to stick to renting or start buying things.

Thanks for anyone that reads this!",finance

I initially bought my house in 2017 for $315,000 FHA at 3.25%and still have about $270,000 on the mortagage left.  I also have PMI that i want to get rid of. 

My house has increased in value since 2017 and zillow estimates my house at $450k. (Not including the vast amounts of home improvements i have made)

If I refinance is it all pluses if i want to maximize my cash out goal?  I guess it would be lower interest rate, no pmi, and more cash on hand to invest.

financialindependence,(36) Got a late start in life at 30 and more recently found FIRE. My backstory &amp; journey so far to $1 million,"Hi everyone - I’m not to my FIRE number because of cost of living but well on my way now. This subreddit along with a couple others over the last year have been an amazing help! Single, 36, HCOL area (Seattle/Bellevue). Neither of my parents were very financially savvy or really instilled that in me. In my preteen days I grew up lower class, going to the food bank with my mom regularly to eat and we lived in an extended families basement. Later went to live with my dad and his new wife and was more lower-middle class. 

I got a “late start” in life by graduating with my Bachelors and getting my career/corporate job going at the age of 30. Worked retail for 10+ years before that and was more focused on living in the moment until I was in car accident at 24 that made me re-think what I was doing. Socializing, partying, drugs (not hardcore), spending what I made (which wasn’t much) and saving just a little to a basic savings account. I was on disability from work for ~1 year and physical/occupational therapy for ~2 until I started my program at 26. My outlook changed drastically and I really wanted more out of life and to create goals and have ambitions.

By crazy advice from a friend, I took the majority of money I had saved in my bank account (almost $10k) and put it into Amazon stock during my 1st year of school. I ended up getting a full scholarship during my 1st year as well but continued working my retail job to pay for living and avoid taking loans.

Got a paid internship my senior year making more than my retail job which was awesome. $20 an hour! Secured another internship for the 2nd part of the year making similar. This company offered me a full time job at the end just months before graduation. Started at $48k + $5k bonus. After graduating and working almost 1 year, I was tired of commuting from Federal Way to Seattle/Bellevue. I also noticed the housing market was really picking up and read how that was a great investment vehicle. 

End of 2015, I cashed out my Amazon stock which provided me a down payment on my 1st condo thanks to it growing 500%+ over those years. Purchased that in downtown Bellevue and from then to now the property has doubled in value and less than 10 years left to be paid off. I was promoted 2x within the initial 3 years at my 1st company which helped me to save more and push money to my 401k which I had never had.

In 2018 I had saved up enough and did a little more investing in single tech stocks to purchase a bigger home in Bellevue. Ended up getting a new construction townhome during the time of bidding frenzies in late 2018. From then to now the property has gone up in value 35%+ and that’s being conservative based on my neighbor that just sold. Moved to another company beginning of 2019 and took a 80% increase in pay from my last position which has really put me in a better spot to keep saving. I don’t work in big tech and am not a software engineer :) I have been renting out my downtown condo since purchasing my townhome and plan to keep that until at least 2023. It is located 2 blocks from an incoming light rail station at that time as well as a 1 million square foot Amazon building one block away full of tech workers that will highly likely increase costs in the area.

As of late 2019 since not being in a relationship I have rented out 2 of the bedrooms in my townhome which has been great as a temporary extra couple $thousand per month in income to save/apply toward mortgage.

Total net worth now = ~$1.03 million

- $730k net real estate equity (rental condo + primary).

- $273k liquid investments (stock, savings, cash).  
             - $112k of this is in retirement (mostly 401k as I just started an IRA late 2020 and max out).",finance

I work for a consulting firm in a somewhat niche field as a full time, W2 employee.

For the majority of the time, we get a assigned to a client, do the very specific tasks they hired our company to do, and move on to the next client. We're usually play the role of SME and help the client do something they simply have no capability of. (Think engineering consulting or architectural designing)

My current client and assignment is a little bit different though. It is a staff augmentation sort of contract. The client already has a team to do the stuff that we do, but they are just short staffed. I'm assigned to the client's team pretty much 100%, report to the client's chain of command, and when/if the client decide to end remote work, I would be working out of the client's office. I check in with my company supervisor once a week, mostly to log my time sheet.

Recently, the client started to post hiring ads for multiple openings of the exact same position, at the same office, with the same team. My client side supervisor was encouraging ""everyone interested"" in the position to apply during our weekly team meeting where I was the only external member (everyone else is internal and has either that position or the ones above it)

CEO of Food For Life Global says, “Happy to report that the Milk and Butter community of investors have now fed 442,968 children in need via Food for Life Global.” 
https://ffl.org/user/milktoken/

We have our live video [AMA](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken) tonight!

Our last donation of nearly $70k went to helping feed those in need. $34,772 went to “Action Against Hunger” and $34,336 went to “Food For Life Global”. Our donation to [FFLG](https://twitter.com/fflglobal/status/1396473562249236481?s=21) fed 137,344 children during a market dip, which continues to grow! While the value of crypto may be lower in this bearish market, the values of Milk and Butter LLC remain high!

News from this week:

• Over 40k $Milk holders and 7k $Butter holders

• Now listed on “Action Against Hunger’s” [website.](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/about/partners)

• We donated over 16k to Binance Charity, Food For Life Global, and Action Against Hunger 

• Currently in the process of forming a relationship with an independent marketing firm to assist us in the marketing of the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Working with a brand specialist for a yet to be announced product.

Milk and Butter tokens, for those that haven’t heard, are companion tokens in the Binance Smart Chain with an emphasis on charity giving. Milk is an RFI token that can be staked to generate Butter, which is used to power community voting for their favorite charities on a weekly basis. Those that merely wish to vote may purchase Butter tokens on the open market as well, which also drives rewards for those that stake Milk! 
https://www.milktoken.net/voting.html

5% of all Butter transactions are guaranteed to go to a charity wallet. In addition, Butter can be used to suggest new charities.
https://www.milktoken.net/suggest.html

$455k has been donated to charity so far, at a very low market cap. We made crypto history when Butter became the first BEP-20 token to partner with a major food charity: Food For Life Global  https://ffl.org/20077/cryptocurrency-butter-token/

The liquidity for both the Milk and Butter tokens is locked away until 2022, at which point both will be relocked. Our Market cap is still low with a solid base, we're building our community for healthy growth, and we’ll continue to develop this project with many exciting use cases plus a full array of features to be rolled out as development completes.

Each week the Milk and Butter token team hosts AMAs with the Developer on Twitch where the community can ask any questions they may have. Occasionally, we have guests, such as when the CEO of “Food For Life Global” joined us and explained the amazing genesis of “Food for Life Global” and took viewer questions. Our AMA’s stream every Sunday at 3am UTC [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/milkbuttertoken)

Roadmap: 
• Gamification of the tokens

• Expanding our number of partnerships

• The voting and staking processes will continue to be refined to make the experience as easy and accessible as possible.

• Planned instructional content to help those new to crypto learn about the space and how to purchase and use the Milk and Butter tokens.

• Additional exchange listings


Accomplishments so far: 
• Code built from the ground up to develop both tokens.

• Unique staking and voting systems implemented.

financialindependence,Military Couple: 3 years from FIRE Goal (Update),"It's been a year so it’s time for an update post as FIRE continues to get closer.  I’ve met my initial goal net worth goal (originally $2m, currently at $2.47m).  Now we just need to wait 3 more years until we’re retirement eligible from the military.

You can read previous annual updates here by clicking this [link and then continuing to follow the previous links.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hu77r8/military_couple_4_years_from_fire_goal_update/)  I’ve been working towards FIRE for about 15 years and have been making progress updates on reddit for 5 years. 

For this year update, I shifted towards a focus on retirement projections instead of just saving.  This really put a focus on trying to figure out what we want in retirement to answer the question as to whether all this planning will work out.  The goal we’ve had is simple:  maintain the same quality of life we’ve been enjoying, without having to go to work.  The methodology I used was to look at our 2020 spending (slightly off due to COVID-19), then, consider whether each of our current expenses would remain in retirement, and if so, whether it would go up or down.  I wanted to be conservative with my estimates, so we estimated on the high side if there was any doubt.

**Current Ages:**

* Me: 40yrs
* Wife: 38yrs
* Kid 1: 8yrs
* Kid 2: 5yrs

**Income:**

* Me: $143k
* Wife: $138k
* Rental Income: $30k (net)  No major changes to our 2 rental houses.  Most of this income goes directly back to principal payments on the mortgage.  After management fees they only cashflow a couple hundred bucks each month.
* Dividends: $5.6k

**Savings:**   We max out our tax advantaged savings accounts (TSP and Roth IRAs).  We’re still eligible for Roth IRAs due to $58k our income being non-taxable housing/subsistence allowances and by maxing our traditional ($39k) TSP contributions and taking the standard deduction.  We’re adding approx $128k/yr to various savings/retirement accounts.  Pretty much all saving stops after we FIRE.

**Current balances:**

* TSPs (gov’t 401k): $1.078m
* Roth IRAs: $365k
* Taxable brokerage account: $383k
* Emergency fund/Cash on hand: $40k
* Coverdell Education Savings Accounts: $56k

**Life insurance:** No changes.

**Expenses:** [Annual 2020 Expense breakdown.](https://i.imgur.com/kuNNROq.jpg)

* Fixed expenses: $8,341.61/mo    (This is lower than last year since I excluded mortgage expenses for our rental properties).
* Fixed savings: $10,661.60/mo

[**Historical Actual Net Worth and Debt:**](https://i.imgur.com/els7ozw.jpg)  

**Current Net Worth:  $2.47m**

* 2012: +$130k
* 2013: +$194k
* 2014: +$110k
* 2015: +$39k
* 2016: +$177k
* 2017: +$247k
* 2018: +$102k
* 2019: +$367k
* 2020: +$418k
* 2021: +$284k  (year to date)

**Current Total Debt: $397k**

* Rental House 1:  31k @ 3.25%
* Rental House 2: 355k @ 3%
* Car 1: 14k @ 2.75%
* Car 2: 27k @ 1.9%  (A storm damaged our second car so we decided to pick up a new one as a replacement). Car 1 purchase price was \~$60k, Car 2 purchase price was \~$50k

**Retirement plan:**

Military pensions are equal to 2.5% \* yrs of service \* high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $56.8k each. That is in today’s money and since this is tied to inflation it’d be slightly higher and would continue to grow each year in retirement since increases are based on the employment cost index and then in retirement it's tied to the CPI.

**Assumptions:** 

* 3.25% safe withdrawal rate.  We’d draw primarily from our taxable account first, then Roth IRA principle, and also set up a 72(t) distribution from our TSP funds which would allow us to pull in $30-35k/yr based on the current federal mid-term rate prior to age 59.5
* My Military Retirement: $56,810.04 
* Spouse Military Retirement: $56,810.04
* Retirement/Taxable Account Distributions:  $69,958.24

Retirement income (pre-tax): $183,578.32/yr. I estimate we’d pay $31k in taxes (most places we’re looking at don’t tax military retirement income). 

**Retirement income (post-tax): $152,370.01/yr**

We plan to sell both rental houses prior to retirement and net $534k in equity after fees/commissions.   I’m using valuations from last year, not the inflated COVID-19 prices which may or may not last.  The idea here was that we kept these houses a hedge against a housing bubble.. which seems to be working perfectly.

**Retirement house purchase scenario:** 

* Price:  $700k 
* Equity rolled over from rental houses: $535K 
* Cash out: $150k 
* Mortgage: $315k @ 3%, 30 yr (no hurry to pay this off if the rates are going to be super low) 
* Payment w/taxes and insurance: $2,553.50

The biggest unknown we have is still not knowing where we want to buy a house and live.  We’ve narrowed it down to a handful of states and have a house budget target of $400-700k.   I overhauled my excel spreadsheet to easily make retirement projection calculations, so I can plug in house purchase prices, interest rates, taxes, insurance, etc., how much cash out I want.  I also added projections based on my months to retirement for future contributions to our financial accounts.

I've also considered using the VA loan benefit and not put anything down if rates stay super low and just invest all that rental house equity.  One important consideration is getting the loan figured out prior to retirement.  It seems mortgage lenders aren’t as interested in lending money if you aren’t working.  My spouse will be working one year more than me and we should qualify on just that income.  Worst case scenario we just buy a house outright and don’t get a mortgage.

**Current Expenses (that carry over into retirement):**

|Home Maintenance|$12,000.00|$1,000.00|
|**Grand Total**|**$88,242.02**|**$7,353.50**|

Overall that’s $152,370.01 income and $138,171.02 expenses for a cushion of an extra $1,183.25/mo.  I'm pretty comfortable with that knowing my estimates are pretty conservative.

**Common questions:** 

* **What about the kid’s college expenses?**  Each of us transferred our GI Bill benefits to the kids.  That pays for the highest in-state public university tuition cost plus a housing allowance and books/fees stipend.  We'll continue funding the Coverdell education savings accounts for the next 3 years and then just let that money grow until they go to school. They should be able to easily afford college without needing to take on any student loans.  Any excess funds from the Coverdell ESAs can be converted to 529 and transferred to a cousin.
* **Are you taking into account social security?** We’ll both start getting social security which would be an extra $2k month in today’s dollars or $6.6k a month in future inflated dollars.  After doing the math, we’ll probably just take the money as soon as we can (age 62) even if we don’t need it since the break even point isn’t until our late 70s if we delay payments.
* **Why don’t you snag a high paying contractor job after you retire from the military and make bank for a few years?** Yes, we both have extremely marketable and in demand skills and could land high paying jobs post military.  We’d rather spend our time with the kids/extended family though.  We just don’t need that money.  If asked, I’ll just tell people that I’m a high net worth financial advisor (true except the only client is myself).
* **Why not stick around in the military a few more years?** The military pension goes off your high 3 years of earnings and adds 2.5% per year of service.  We’re planning to leave at 20 years (50%).  Yes, we could get promoted again and then stick around 3 more years to increase that base pay/high 3 calculation.  Sticking around 1 extra year would mean a 52.5% pension instead of 50% which would be an extra $300/mo.  At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether or not we need that extra income vs the stress of being in the military (potential deployments/separation/long hours/etc).  The bottom line is the military doesn’t define who we are and there are others capable of doing our jobs when we walk away.
* **What will you do to stay busy?** Kids, volunteer work, travel, extra curricular activities, go to the gym because we want to, start a garden/chickens/apiary, who knows.  I do plan to spend some time at a coffee shop telling unsolicited war stories to young people at least one day a month.
* **Why is your healthcare budget so low?** As a military retiree, we’re eligible for Tricare Select or Tricare Prime.  This is the same health coverage we currently have, but when we retire we have to pay about $600/yr for enrollment fees and minimal co payments ($20-$30 for a visit) with a catastrophic cap of $3k or $3.5k.  This includes a good prescription drug benefit, but no dental/vision coverage.  When we become eligible for medicare you automatically get swapped to medicare and Tricare For Life which is basically Tricare covering the 20% that medicare does not plus your same existing prescription drug coverage.  Basically we'll have no health care costs after age 65.

tl;dr Net worth is now $2.47m. Plan is to retire in 3 years at the age of 43 with military pensions worth $113k/yr while using a 3.5% SWR to generate an additional $70k for a combined total of $183k/yr retirement income.",finance

CryptoCurrency,DeFi crypto industry impacts the entire digital market,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have shown resilience after the sharpest dip experienced near mid-May. In the current scenario, Dogecoin and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are in a craze. However, it is also noteworthy that besides these trending cryptocurrencies, money is also being flooded on another side of the crypto industry. Many have also deemed that the sector is precarious because of its decentralized nature. Still, the entire DeFi sector is rising at a surprising pace.

WHAT DOES THE DEFI INDUSTRY OFFER?

The DeFi industry offers services like borrow, lend, and yield interest. Moreover, the dApps also allows its users to trade assets and derivatives with other ranges of services also offered by the industry. Following the current scenario, we can consider that the DeFi industry is only for individuals who seek to borrow against their crypto holdings.

HOW IS THE DECENTRALIZED FINANCE SECTOR HELPING FUEL THE CRYPTO MARKET?

To access DeFi services, there is only one way. The users are necessarily required to deposit any form of a crypto token as collateral. In the DeFi sector, the interest rates are highly attractive compared with mainstream banks. 

Moreover, automatic transactions and virtually instantaneous settlements have also attracted several users. Keeping everything automatic and on the blockchain removes several counterparty risks that users face in the current system.

Following the aforementioned facts, the interest in the industry has surged impressively. Notably, such high interest is also one of the prominent reasons behind the skyrocketing price of Ethereum.

Bitcoin,APY wallets like Celsius make owning rental property useless.,"Scenario 1: Invest 70k into a down payment in a rental property. Get tenants, insurance, set aside money for repairs, blah blah. Maybe clear $100 a month after expenses. Property gains value over time. Pay property taxes each year. Rent controls on how much I can increase rent over time. Have a mortgage attached, pay interest rates.

Scenario 2: Buy 2 Bitcoin at current spot price. Hold them in Celsius. Get 6.5% APY, about $400 a month currently. No expenses. No tenants. Bitcoin appreciates in value well beyond and faster than the real estate property. No property tax. And the 6.5% in interest scales with the value of the Bitcoin. If Bitcoin 2x in price, now that’s $800 a month. No mortgage associated. Not interest payments. 🤯🤯🤯🤯

Jesus Christ is Bitcoin and CeFi/DeFi disruptive to traditional wealth building.

I understand there is risk using a custodial wallet. There’s always risk in finance. I think it’s important to embrace CeFi and DeFi as a healthy way to grow this monetary network.",cryptocurrency

5. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

7. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

30. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit.

31. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

59. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
60. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
61. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
62. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
63. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
64. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
65. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
66. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
67. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
68. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
69. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
70. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
71. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
72. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
73. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
74. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
75. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
76. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

79. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
80. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
81. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
82. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
83. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
84. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
85. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
86. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

personalfinance,To sell our Miami duplex and invest in index funds or not,"Here are the facts:

* We bought a duplex in Miami in 2014 (towards bottom of market) for $290k with 20% down.
* **Current mortgage balance on duplex:** $232k
* **HELOC:** $120k (only used $60k so far on new house)
* **Current market value:** $800k (reasonable estimate, could go a bit higher in current market)
* **Monthly mortgage (P+I included):** $2,500
* **Monthly rental income:** $3,700 (could increase to $4,200 next year with new tenants)
* **Monthly yield (not including maintenance):** $1,200
* We lived in the duplex as our primary residence up until October 2020. We would be **exempt from capital gains tax**.

Our current home we purchased for $600k less than a year ago and is now worth around $700k. We have a 0.9% interest rate. We want to invest about $100k into remodeling it. It's over 4 miles inland from coast. We use current rent income to offset existing mortgage but we don't depend on that and both just got significant promotions.

Duplex is in a location that is high risk for sea level rise and storm surge however it's in one of the most in-demand neighborhoods. It is 1930s wood-framed so maintenance is high (less so after all the work we've put in). We put in new electric, new plumbing, re-sided with hardie board, brand new really high end kitchen and bathroom, brand new roofed 40x16 deck, all new impact windows. Still needs roof in next 5 years (estimate $9k). Finding good tenants is a lot of work in Miami. Current tenants are due to leave in September.

After HELOC (assuming we spend it all), realtor commission, we're looking at potentially **$400k net**.

We have two elementary school aged kids. No debt other than the mortgages, HELOC and two leased cars (no credit cards, no student loans, etc).

My question is, would it be better to sell and invest in index funds (or is there a better alternative?) or would it be wiser to hold on to the property? What percent yield could we reasonably expect on index funds?",finance

This last winter, I bought a 2010 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium with 200,000 miles for $6,000. I love this car, but I basically got scammed. It had the coolant leak of death, and I didn't know until the cold season was over. Now I'm looking at paying $3,200 for a new motor with belts etc. I'm unsure if I should use this as an opportunity to buy a new/used car or if I should bite the bullet and pay for all of this work. It has a new transmission as of 60,000 miles ago, and other than this huge problem, it runs amazing. I found a 2018 Subaru Forester Touring for $21,500, but it has 91,000 miles on it.

I guess I am just looking for advice. I have never financed a vehicle, so a monthly payment makes me super nervous. I make just over $65,000 annually pre-tax and expect a nice raise within the month as I move to salary, but I am only 20 and with pretty bad credit due to health-related debt and my oldest card being under 2 years (about 550 per Credit Karma). I got approved both by the dealer and Navy Fed but for stupid high interest. Are there other vehicles I should be considering?

Thanks again,

Update: Thank you everyone for the advice without being condescending for not knowing what I am doing. Unless I receive a much lower offer from another CU here, I am going to replace the engine and either drive it into the ground or until my credit is good enough for what I want, whichever comes first.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Fed printing more and more USD is a stab in the back for people in other countries that have adopted USD as their currency. That is why El Salvador is breaking free,"Some people may not realize but El Salvador's main currency is the USD. It is used there as currency for everything, from savings to expenses. 

But the main difference is that unlike USD, the Salvadorean central bank can't print more of this currency. This is fine if the supply of the USD doesnt go up. But when 22% of USD in circulation was printed in 2020 alone, and almost all of it has gone just to support USA, this is a big problem for countries that have adopted the USD based on trust but now find out this was a huge mistake. 

Salvadoreans find their savings are fast losing purchasing power, but unlike USA they dont have any stimmy checks to cash in, and their earnings and average household income isnt going up to account for the massive inflation of USD. Essentially, they are experiencing a mini-Zimbabwe like situation even though they are using USD. 


They can either go back to their own currency, or just adopt cryptocurrencies which have all the characteristics of fiat currencies except they cannot be manipulated at will (atleast the ones that have proven themselves)",cryptocurrency

This proposal does the following:

1. instantiate a new LINK pool for [PoolTogether](https://app.pooltogether.com/?tab=pools)
2. deposit 3500 POOL from the treasury into the LINK pool faucet (3500 POOL / 50 issuance per day = 70 days of juicy $POOL APR as incentive to Pool your $LINK)
3. set a reserve rate to 50% (the portion of yield that is reserved and re-fed back into the pool every week, i.e the perpetual growth mechanism to grow the Pool over the long term)
4. Send some pool to various DAO members as reward for developing this PTIP

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkiltupoocM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkiltupoocM) , 9 minute video about ""Babel Fees on Cardano"" by  Prof. Aggelos Kiayias / Whiteboard Presentation

Source: [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/)

""First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** 

**Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost for processing  the transaction.""

Source: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01161](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01161)

**Custom currencies, usually following the ERC-20 standard, are one of the most popular smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. These currencies are however second class to the primary currency Ether.** Custom tokens are not natively traded and accounted for by the Ethereum ledger; instead, part of the logic of an ERC-20 contract replicates this transfer and accounting functionality. The second class nature of custom tokens goes further,though: **transaction processing and smart contract execution fee scan only be paid in Ether — even by users who have got custom tokens worth thousands of dollars in their wallets.** 

***Cardano's approach:***

* **by introducing native custom tokens it is possible to allow custom tokens to reuse the transfer and accounting logic that is already part of the underlying ledger.** This is achieved without the need for a global registry or similar global structure via the concept of token bundles in combination with token policy scripts that control minting and burning of custom tokens. 
*  **requirements for babel fees** are summarized as follows:
   *  **(1) participants that create a babel fee transaction should be able to create a normal transaction, which will be included in the ledger exactly as is (i.e., no need for meta-transactions or specially crafted smart contract infrastructure**) and 
   * (2) the protocol should be non-interactive in the sense that a single message from the creator of a transaction to the participant paying the fee in the primary currency should suffice. In other words, **we want transaction creation and submission to be structurally the same for trans-actions with babel fees as for regular transactions**.
* Our **implementation of babel fees is based on** a novel ledger mechanism, which we call **limited liabilities. These are negative token amounts (debt if you like)** of strictly limited lifetime. **Due to the limited lifetime of liabilities, we prevent any form of inflation (of the primary currency and of custom tokens).** 
*  **Transactions paid for with babel fees simply pay their fees with primary currency obtained by way of a liability. This liability is combined with custom tokens offered to any party that is willing to cover the liability in exchange for receiving the custom tokens.** 
*  **modify the ledger rules in three ways:**
   * (1) The original UTXOma rules are defining ledger validity by adding transactions to the ledger one by one. We extend this by **including the ability to add transactions in batches; i.e.,multiple transactions at once**
   * (2) We **drop the unconditional per-transaction ban on negative values in transaction outputs** and replace it by the weaker requirement that there remain no negative values at the fringe of a batch of transactions. In other words, **liabilities are confined to occur inside a batch and are forced to be resolved internally in the batch where they are created.**
   * (3) We amend the rules about the use of policy scripts such that the script of a token 𝑇 is guaranteed to be run in every transaction that increases the supply of 𝑇 

The paper makes the following contributions:

* We introduce the **concept of limited liabilities as a combination of negative values in multi-asset token bundles with batched transaction processing** (Section 2)
* We introduce the concept of babel fees on the basis of limited liabilities as a means to **pay transaction fees in tokens other than a ledger’s primary currency** (Section 2)
* We present **formal ledger rules for an UTXO multi-asset ledger with limited liabilities** (Section 3)
* We present a **concrete spot market scheme for block producers to match babel fees** (Section 4)
* We present a solution to the knapsack problem that block producers have to solve to maximise their profit in the presence of babel fees (Section 5)

**Token bundles are, in essence, finite maps that map an asset ID to a quantity — i.e., to how many tokens of that asset are present in the bundle in question.** The asset ID itself is a pair of a hash of the policy script defining the asset’s monetary policy and a token name, but that level of detail has no relevance to the discussion at hand. 

***Other applications of limited liabilities***

While our primary motivation for proposing liabilities limited by transaction batches are babel fees, the mechanism of limited liabilities is more broadly applicable:

*  ***Swaps***
   * As discussed, we use liabilities in babel fees to form transaction outputs that represent atomic swaps — we call those swap outputs. We do this by including a liability (negative token value) together with an asset (positive token value). Whoever consumes such an output effectively swaps the tokens described by the liability for those constituting the asset 
*  ***Service payments***
   * Extending the concept of swaps from ex-changing assets to exchanging assets for information. In the Extended UTXO model, which facilitates complex smart contracts on a UTXO ledger, transaction outputs also include a data component. This can, for example, be used to communicate information from an off-chain oracle. Liabilities included with such an output can serve as payment for consuming such an output with the data. 
*  ***Indivisibility***
   * Transaction batches are different to signed trans-action groups proposed for some ledgers, such as, for example, Algorand. To create a signed transaction group, all component transactions need to be known and the group signed as a whole. If multiple component transactions are created by different parties,these parties need to cooperate to create the group transaction. The benefit of such a signed group is that it is indivisible. The transaction batches that we propose are different. 

***""Competition"" (Ethereum, Algorand and Stellar and XRP Ledger built-in DEX) comparison***

**Ethereum** 

Ethereum supports fee payment in non-primary currencies via its [Gas Station Network.](https://docs.opengsn.org/) The gas station infrastructure consists of:

* a network of nodes listening for meta-transactions (transaction-like requests to cover transaction fees), which turn these requests into complete transactions, with fees covered by the relay node, and
* an interface that contracts must implement in order for the relay nodes to use this contract’s funds to subsidize the transaction fees. 

This infrastructure consists of many moving parts working together, including smart contracts, relays, relay hubs, and communication on a network separate from the main chain network. Only GSN-enabled contracts can cover transaction fees. **Cardano's proposal does not require any changes to existing smart contracts, and does not require meta-transactions to be disseminated on a separate network, since they are already fully-formed and signed transactions. In addition, unlike the GSN, there is no further action required from the user after submitting a Babel-fee transaction. The design of the GSN allows for the possibility that an incorrect transaction is submitted by a relay node in response to a sender’s fee-coverage request.** The onus is on the sender to monitor the chain, and reques tpunitive measures to be taken against an offending relay. There are other verifications necessary to participate in GSN. **Submitting transactions with liabilities has no potential of unexpected consequences (whether they are included in the ledger or not).** *The GSN requires participating fee-covering contracts to pre-pay for the fee amounts they intend to cover. This approach involves additional maintenance, monitoring, and communication. The contract may specify the tokens it accepts in exchange for covering fees, but the extra step of posting and updating the contracts on-chain is less flexible and has more steps (including submitting potentially costly transactions) than our strategy.* Recall that in our design, we propose to automate the process of any user getting a transaction with an exchange offer, accepting or rejecting the offer based on maximizing the value they are getting by engaging in theoffer, then submitting the batch containing the swap transactions to the chain. With Babel fees, a user may use a higher-than-minimum fee or exchange bid to increase the chances of their transaction to be accepted sooner. The exchange offers made via GSN-enable smart contracts, as well as the fee amounts the contract is willing to cover,are all fixed.

**Algorand**

**Algorand** in an account-based cryptocurrency which supports custom native tokens. It provides users with a way to perform atomic transfers. An atomic transfer requires combining unsigned transactions into a single group transaction, which must then be signed by each of the participants of each of the transactions included. This **design allows users to perform, in particular, atomic swaps, which might be used to pay fees in non-primary currencies. As with our design, the transactions get included into the ledger in batches.** *Unlike the mechanism we propose, however, incomplete transactions cannot be sent off to be included in the ledger without any further involvement of the transaction author.* This interactive protocol specification ensures that batches cannot betaken apart and completed using other transactions. This may be an advantage in certain cases over a batch that is combined in a loose, easily decomposable way, but this behaviour can also be implemented in the system we have presented. Moreover, an interactive protocol for building group transaction requires additional communication, which is, in this case, reliant on off-chain communication. 

 **Stellar built-in DEX (XRP Ledger DEX works in a similar way)**

A common blockchain solution to providing swap functionality (and therefore, custom token fee payment) is a distributed exchange (DEX). **The Stellar system supports a native, ledger-implemented DEX. In the Stellar DEX, offers posted by users are stored on the ledger.A transaction may attempt an exchange of any asset for any other asset, and will fail if this exchange is not offered.** This approach requires submitting transactions to manage a user’s on-chain offers, and also requires all exchanges to be exact — which means no overpaying is possible to get one’s bid selected. A transaction may attempt to exchange assets that are not explicitly listed as offers in exchange for each other on the DEX. The DEX, in this case, is searched for a multi-step path to exchanging these assets via intermediate offers. This is not easily doable using the approach we have presented. **A DEX of this nature is susceptible to front-running. In our case,block issuers are given a permanent advantage in resolving liability transactions over non-block-issuing users. Among them, however,exactly one may issue the next block, including the liabilities they resolved.**",cryptocurrency

investing,Fidelity Fully Paid Lending vs. Interactive Brokers Stock Yield Enhancement (small DD),"Which stock lending program offers the highest lending rates? I haven't been able to find any data on this online, so I decided to try it out for myself.

Interactive brokers talks a good game: they promise 50% to give you of the interest collected, and they advertise very high borrowing rates. In my case, I was looking at RIDE: borrowing rate is currently 47%, but it was 80% when I decided to start my experiment.

I opened an IB account, and enabled SYE. I also enrolled in Fidelity's ""fully paid lending"" program. Fidelity consistently reports lower borrowing rates than IB, so I was expecting IB to be a better deal for me. Here's the outcome:

Fidelity currently gives me 17% interest on my RIDE shares. IB gives me only 10%. For some reason, IB collects only 20% interest (of which I get half), even though they list the borrowing rate as 47%. I'll be moving back to Fidelity.

EDIT: to clarify a little further, this only makes sense if you own highly shorted stocks that yield high interest rates. I own RIDE and UWMC, which to me look like low risk, high return investments courtesy of the shorts. I totally agree that shorts can keep them down for as long as they want, but  if I get 17%/year while they're doing it (plus any cap gains), I'm not going to complain.",finance

personalfinance,New graduate and future 1099 contractor applying for a mortgage,"Hello r/personalfinance!

My wife and I are looking to move within the next year and I wanted to get some feedback on the feasibility of this given out situation. 

We currently own our home, initially bought in 2017 with a 4.8% interest rate loan. Refinanced this past year to 3.2% and significantly lower PMI payments. The refinance was was only on my wife's income as I am currently in graduate school and haven't had an income of any impact over the past 2 years. I'm set to graduate this August and doubt I will have any trouble getting a job. The issue is the industry I am getting into (mental health counseling) largely uses a contractor model for their pay structures. This is the first time either my wife or I will be applying for a loan without w-2s or a set amount for each paycheck.

We aren't looking to upgrade our house, per se. We just want to move location wise. The houses  we are looking at are in the 250-300k range. Our current home has a zestimate of around 240k. We've got enough liquid assets to put together a 20% down payment on the next house, as long as it stays 300k or below. 

I guess my question boils down to what the process for a 1099 contractor applying for a mortgage looks like, particularly one that doesn't have the standard two years of employment history.

personalfinance,Does an equivalent to credit utilization exist for installment loans? Is there a disincentive to paying off the majority of an installment loan?,"I understand that the percentage of the revolving credit limit a person utilizes is reflected in their credit score. Is there a similar metric applied to amounts owed on installment loans? I'm thinking of loans for cars, tractors, RVs, boats and mortgages. I've seen it written on the internet that the magic ratio to owe on installment loans is under 30%, but elsewhere I've read that installment loans have no credit utilization equivalency. Can anyone shed some light on which of these (if either) is true?

Is it feasible to pay down 95% of the principal on a loan outright and enjoy the benefits from continuing to have the line of credit open for the duration of the loan, thus avoiding losing money in interest? Is this disincentivized in any way?

personalfinance,Where to park extra funds?,"I'm stuck in a bit of analysis paralysis, and I'm looking for some independent opinions on what I should do with my ""excess"" cash. I budget on YNAB, and I've currently got my next three months budgeted along with an extra $30k sitting in an interest earning checking account (yes, I know that I should move at least some of that to a high yield savings account). I also have the bare minimum in retirement planning taken care of between Social Security, US Government pension on a six figure salary, and 5% contribution to my TSP (401(k) for Federal workers) plus a 5% agency match. I've also got an HSA that I'm on track to maximizing this calendar year. 

I'm an avid follower of r/financialindependence and always have an eye toward trying to increase my retirement savings and optimizing my tax exposure. The thing that's holding me back is that I have a new house I bought last year that was mostly in good shape, but there are some upcoming capital projects that I want to be prepared for. Namely, I need to replace a retaining wall in my front yard (got a quote for $25k+, plan to self perform but will still need materials and equipment rentals), install a fence for my back yard, a 27 year old AC that I'm sure will quit on me any week (I'm thinking about $15k to replace with a gas/electric hybrid heat pump), and an aging roof that probably has about 5 years left (probably $10k-$15k to reroof, plus I'd like to install photovoltaics if possible). I also have a 10-going-on-11-year-old who I'd like to build a small college fund for.

So my big question is what should I do with all that extra cash that I have laying around? I know keeping it in the checking account is just one step above stuffing it in my mattress, but I'm also wary of funneling it into IRAs for my wife and I, as that will lock it up until we've retired. Of course I could always take loans to finance the capital projects, or stuff the money into a taxable brokerage and buy a mix of low cost index funds. Or would it be better to simply put it all in a HYSA and be happy with my .5% APY? I'm very open and happy to hear other suggestions. I've got a good grasp on the ""theory"" of personal finance and financial independence, but bringing it down to brass tacks is leaving me kinda stuck and feeling iffy about my ""extra"" cash.",finance

""Inflation is closely watched by cryptocurrency investors who view Bitcoin as a hedge against dollar debasement. 

But bitcoin has also traded at times in sync with risky traditional assets like stocks, and the Deutsche Bank authors warned that when inflation does eventually appear, the Fed might have to react forcefully, which could 'create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world.'

Adding to the pressures are some $2 trillion of “excess savings” that consumers have amassed over the past year, when many businesses were closed and travel mostly shut down, according to the report published Monday.

“Consumers will surely spend at least some of their savings as economies reopen,” wrote Deutsche Bank Chief Economist David Folkerts-Landau along with Peter Hooper, global head of economic research, and Jim Reid, head of thematic research.. “This raises the very real specter of consumer-driven inflation.”",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,When does Bitcoin become the World Reserve Currency; milestones to come,"Hi all,

Pondering it today, thinking about US trade, the size of US dollars held as a reserve currency, they seem linked.

I think the cumulative amount of USD used as a reserve currency is about $7 trillion. Falling off that, there's about $2.5 trillion in EUR, \~$1T in JPY, and about $1T in ""Other"" as reserves -- Source, IMF, Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) -  [https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=41175](https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=41175)

Now there's not a super strong link between how much trade is really done in a given currency but it's connected. Example, China is a major world producer and you'd think more people would hold its currency in reserve but it's not the case.

Anyway, that means to me that bitcoin could come to dominate trade and still not be the reserve currency of the world supplanting the dollar for a long time.

Still, when I think about it, it seems like there is probably some level of reserves held proportional to world trade:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/264682/worldwide-export-volume-in-the-trade-since-1950/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264682/worldwide-export-volume-in-the-trade-since-1950/)

So maybe once we have billions or trillions of dollars in trade, it will start to be more rational for countries to keep bitcoin reserves in their central banks?

Well we'll see. Anyone have some thoughts about how that rise might play out?

Seems like, to me, unexpectedly, after bitcoin flips gold's market cap circa $10-11 trillion USD, I thought the next heights to tackle would be real estate circa $100 T, but maybe it's world reserve currency that is the middle step? I am not sure.

Maybe world reserve currency will come last because central banks will fight to the bitter end.

Milestones

* June 2021 - Accepted by any bank in the world (hopefully this week) El Salvador
* June 2021? - Maybe soon Paraguay
* next, we might start going by continent - first in South America, first in North America, first in Europe, first in Asia, first in Africa, etc
* Finish doing a flip on every continent as a reserve currency
* Then flipping reserve currency status neck and neck with China at $250 billion USD in reserves
* Then flipping Japan's JPY
* then the Euro
* then the US Dollar

But what stops us? What is in our way?

If I had to mockingly come up with an easy way there, it would be to take over the leadership of a Federal Reserve member, like the St Louis Fed, then make them keep bitcoins in reserve. Then, by definition, the Federal Reserve holds bitcoins in reserve. Maybe make them a 1 of 3 multisig signatory, so they don't actually control jack squat, but they are technically a party to it. Then we get Congress to pass a law to back dollars with fractional reserve in bitcoin, make bitcoin legal tender, and work our way out of this banking cartel, like an Alien Chestburster.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for your comments :)

Here's a scene from the St Louis Fed circa 2030 when they first find out that they have bitcoin in reserve and didn't know it:

personalfinance,Should I accept a Direct Subsidized loan for my last year of college even though I could probably get by without it?,"I was offered about $5300 of direct subsidized loan for college (unsure of interest rate yet). I've gotten through school so far without any loans. Am I understanding correctly that the interest is paid while I'm still in college? So the balance shouldn't increase until the government isn't paying interest anymore?

Here's why I'm considering it: 

I have enough in savings that I could probably get by for the next year, but it's very tight as I've recently had a few ""emergencies"" to cover (sewer line replacement on home and my car was totaled by uninsured driver). If another emergency like that happens, I won't have enough money to cover it AND pay the rest of my schooling plus CPA exam fees. 

My idea is to take it out and let it sit in my discover savings account, not to be touched unless absolutely necessary. The moment I graduate, if I haven't touched it, it gets paid off. If I have, I'm set to start full time at the firm I'm currently interning for about 6 months post graduation (taking the time between to pass CPA). I could pay off what I used rather quickly with the increase in pay. 

If taking out this loan will cost me very little, I feel like it's worth it to have an actual emergency fund and peace of mind to get through this last year of school. 

Is there a catch that I'm missing? What else should I be cautious about?",finance

personalfinance,Should I payoff my loans now or keep my savings for a house?,"**Disclaimer:**

I really did search for answers to this question in this sub but all of the posts I saw were for people in very different situations with different loans, different interest rates, etc.

**Myself:**

* Live in HCOL area
* Salary over $150k
* Credit score between 750 and 800 depending on the bureau
* Partner with similar salary/credit score

**The loans:**

* A student loan that I refinanced about 3 ago. \~$15k left @ 4.25% thru Sofi. My salary and credit score have both gone up considerably since then (as well as interest rates lowered I believe).
* An auto loan that I financed about 2.5 years ago. \~$12k left @ 3.95% Fixed thru online lender. Again, my salary has gone up considerably since then.

**My goal:**

* Buy a house in this HCOL city within the next 6-12 months.

**My options:**

1. **Pay the loans off completely**. I have enough in the market/bank to pay them both off but have not yet because my investments have had a much a better return than the 4% interest on my loans and I wanted to save for a down payment on a home. The $27k wouldn't drain my savings but every dollar is helpful in this housing market.
2. **Continue paying the minimum on the loans as-is**. I don't really have an issue with the debts hanging over my head but I wonder if lowering my debt-to-income ratio is better than the cash for a downpayment.  Also I do realize my investments wont always have the returns they've had recently but 4% isn't a horrible rate.
3. **Refinance**. I haven't really been considering this as I didn't want the credit hit for another hard check on my report for the next year or two. But I do think/wonder how low I could get those interest rates. Has anyone been able to negotiate their rate down with their current lender as an alternative to refinancing elsewhere or paying off early? I don't know if this is even possible for these loans.",finance
Bitcoin,I finally get bitcoin,A business pays to have a bank account. If a customer uses a debit card the business pays a fee to the bank.

Just locked it in at 3.375%. That is the rate I quoted originally but saving you $730.  I originally quoted it with a cost to you. So that is great.

Thanks so much. We were curious if our rate would be any lower since the national average has gone down a bit since the time we were originally quoted in March. Also is there any option to buy points? Thanks again

Banking,Is banking wrong for me? (Banking Employees),"This one is for the banking/credit union employees lurking in this sub. I'm new to this career path and I'm hoping to get some insight. 

Little history.. I've been with this credit union for about 8 months. It started out great, it was a huge breath of fresh air for me leaving the food industry. 

As it turns out, this job was a little more sales-ey than I anticipated. That being said, I have no problems hitting most of my goals... However, some of the things they ask us to do when we aren't hitting said goals annoys me. My branch is pretty small, there's only 2 reps and 2 tellers.  (I'm a rep and I still have to teller 10+ hours a week. That's 20% of my entire work week... also annoying) 

Anyway, we have a goal to get 30% debt protection on all our loan dollars closed (so you can get one huge loan that doesn't want the protection and it absolutely fucks you over for the month) .... My debt protection was at 27% at the end of May, and now my boss wants me to start doing MORE work for my loans and fill out a  ""pre plan sheet"" to help identify more ways we can ""help our members"" AKA what are the reasons they WOULD get the protection, or WHY would they say no and what can you say to overcome their objection. I hate being pushy, and I also hate making more work for myself when I have a hard time justifying it. Realistically, it probably only takes me 10-15 minutes to review our members profile and make all the judgements, then get everything written down.. Now take note of all the questions I ask, their responses and anything I may have missed.... Send them to my boss at the end of the week. 

We are now short staffed and everyone is at their limit (and then some) for their work load. Every rep is booked out solid for days, no one can get in for appointments and there's a 30-45 minute wait if you call the help center. But please... make more work for me when I'm only 3% short of my goal. Part of me thinks that the other rep I work with has a lower % than I do, and he's just making both of us do it to remain equal... but still. Not helping me get my shit done any faster. I could be using this time to help the call center team, or get back to the guy who called me 5 times while I was opening an IRA for someone else.

I'm new to banking and new to a corporate work environment, can anyone tell me if my frustrations are out of line? I know my boss is only breathing down my back because his boss is breathing down his back but.... you wonder why the turn over is so high? 

If you read the whole thing, thanks for sticking around. I'd appreciate any tips to help me change my thinking to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.",finance

Do we pay off my car ($346 payment, 7.14%, $10900 balance) his car ($325 payment, 3.25%, $13500 balance) or save up for the deposit of an apartment in Michigan and a cushion. I also have about $900 in medical debt but i have an interest free payment plan and currently pay $100 a month. I can go as low as $25.

personalfinance,Taking advantage of car 'equity'- help please,"I know, I know, there's no such thing as equity in a car....except maybe this year? I feel like I have an opportunity here and I'm itching to act on it, but I don't want to make a bad decision, help me get my head on straight with this. 

I have a 2016(.5) Mazda CX5 AWD Touring (mid-level trim) with just about 35k miles on it. No accidents and well-cared for, but I did need to replace the breaks, two rotors (rust thanks to sitting in the driveway due to Covid wfh), and the windshield. I've also had a wheel bearing replaced under warranty. I'm coming up on needing new tires (I know, it's like wanting to buy a new house because of a leaky sink).

I bought out my lease, and have just under $12k left on the payments. Payments are about $250/month and I just refinanced to 2.5% interest.

I happened to check KBB for funsies and...the car is appraised at $20k for trade-in and 22k private sale! That's almost twice what I still owe and I feel like this is an opportunity I should really take seriously.

My thought is that I can either sell or trade in the car, pay off the remainder of the loan, and then repeat the lease/buy out a new CX5 model (or maybe another car? We'll see.)

Benefits- new car with new safety features I don't have now, new warranty (which already came in handy), and some extra cash to pay down my mortgage or my husband's debts (split between CC and student loans). 

Cons- I'll have to keep a car payment for longer, interest rates may not be as favorable when/if I decide to buy out the lease in 3 years. BUT by that time I will have paid off a home improvement loan ($250/mo, 0%, 3 years left) and will be able to take on a higher car payment.

What am I missing here? I don't care about getting a new car for the sake of getting a new car, but I do care about safety and reliability. It seems like a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see back a car for close to it's original value after 5 years of ownership.

Edit to add: my debt/income ratio is very good. Only other debt is a mortgage (@2.75%) and the 0% home improvement loan. Husband and I are recently married and our finances are separate for the forseeable future.

investing,Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation,"Using CNBC as I'm not seeing a better source at the moment.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/deutsche-bank-warns-of-global-time-bomb-coming-due-to-rising-inflation.html

Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.

In a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.

The analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.

“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”

As part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.

In the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.

The Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.

“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this
patience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”

Most on the Street see tame inflation
To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.

Most on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.

Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.

On price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.

“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.

That will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.

Congress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.

“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”

The Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.

Then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.

“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”

The firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs.",finance
Bitcoin,Why don't these articles get more attention/upvotes here?,"This is the BEST article I’ve read regarding the El Salvador Bitcoin related news. It’s from FORBES, a mainstream media organization. It didn’t get attention here. It’s a factual, well researched and very informative article.


While other articles from MSM get upvoted when they contain misinformation, negative spin and a FUD narrative.




https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/06/07/el-salvador-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-a-milestone-in-monetary-history/?sh=37fe455e75b9


**FORBES: ""El Salvador To Make Bitcoin Legal Tender: A Milestone In Monetary History""**


&gt; On June 5, at a conference in Miami, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced that the Central American country is in the process of adopting bitcoin as legal tender: a move that would make El Salvador the first country to deem bitcoin an official national currency. Despite El Salvador’s small size, Bukele’s effort is a major milestone in monetary policy history, one with significant ramifications for the global financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; ‘Potentially helping billions around the world’ 
&gt; At the Bitcoin 2021 conference, Bukele described his legislative proposal as a way to “design a country for the future.” On Twitter, he pointed out that if 1 percent of the world’s bitcoin moved to El Salvador, it would amount to a quarter of the country’s annual economic output. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And Bukele is not engaging in wishful thinking. Each year, Salvadoran emigrants send $6 billion home in remittances, from places like the United States. Indeed, 2.2 million people of Salvadoran ancestry live in the U.S., compared with 6.5 million in El Salvador itself. Today, Salvadoran emigrés’ remittances must travel back through middlemen who take cuts as large as 20 percent. “By using bitcoin,” tweeted Bukele, “the amount received by more than a million low income families will increase in the equivalent of billions of dollars every year.”
&gt; 
&gt; 70 percent of Salvadorans lack bank accounts, Bukele noted. Because people can transmit bitcoin to relatives and businesses on their smartphones, without the need for a bank account, the move to make Bitcoin legal tender could help achieve the “moral imperative” of financial inclusion, and provide “a space where some of the leading innovators can reimagine the future of finance, potentially helping billions around the world.”
&gt; 
&gt; The political party Bukele founded, Nuevas Ideas, controls 56 seats out of 84 in El Salvador’s legislative assembly, the Asamblea Legislativa, making it likely that Bukele’s bitcoin initiative is enacted into law.
&gt; 
&gt; Why El Salvador is adopting Bitcoin 
&gt; El Salvador’s interest in adopting bitcoin as legal tender has other powerful economic rationales.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2001, after a long period of instability, El Salvador replaced the Salvadoran colón with the U.S. dollar. Indeed, dozens of countries either peg their currencies to the value of the U.S. dollar or use the greenback outright, especially those with heavy trade or tourism relationships with the U.S., such as the nations of the Caribbean Sea, and oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, this system has worked fine for El Salvador, but recently things have taken a turn for the worse. In an effort to blunt the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded the supply of circulating U.S. dollars, as measured by the M2 money stock, from $15.35 trillion in February 2020 to $20.26 trillion in May 2021. That’s an increase of 32 percent, unprecedented in modern peacetime U.S. history.
&gt; 
&gt; From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history.
&gt; From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply of U.S. dollars by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS
&gt; While the Fed’s extraordinary measures succeeded in pumping more cash into the coffers of U.S. financial institutions, the stock market, and other aspects of the U.S. economy, the same was not true for Salvadorans, whose banks did not receive infusions from the Fed, but did lose purchasing power due to U.S. monetary inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, Bukele’s proposal states that “central banks [like the U.S. Federal Reserve] are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador…in order to mitigate the negative impact of central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calculable criteria.” The supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making the digital currency immune to the types of policy changes that affect the U.S. dollar and other “fiat” currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin thought leaders are working with the Salvadoran government 
&gt; The Salvadoran marriage to Bitcoin has been two years in the making. Bitcoin entrepreneur Jack Mallers, who helped build the Lightning Network to facilitate fast, low-cost bitcoin transactions, has been working with Bukele and other Salvadorans to make bitcoin a feasible means of exchange for everyday purchases.
&gt; 
&gt; Another crypto entrepreneur, Adam Back of Blockstream, told CNBC that he “plans to contribute technologies like Liquid,” which like Lightning can speed up bitcoin transactions, “and satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world.” Satellites can help rural Salvadorans connect to the internet, and thereby to the Bitcoin network, in places where land-based connectivity is poor.
&gt; 
&gt; Mallers has been working to increase Salvadoran adoption of his smartphone app Strike, a Lightning-powered analog to Venmo or Cash App. In 2019, thanks to a anonymous donation, crypto entrepreneurs founded Bitcoin Beach, as a way to pilot in El Salvador a circular Bitcoin economy in which residents and businesses transact entirely in bitcoin, without conversions to and from U.S. dollars. 
&gt; 
&gt; In a press release, Strike stated “making bitcoin legal tender is a leapfrog moment that can help countries like El Salvador shift from a largely cash economy to an innovative, inclusive, and transparent digital economy where your bank account is your phone.” Mallers described the Salvadoran move as the “shot heard ’round the world” because it would provide “a way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation.”
&gt; 
&gt; Could El Salvador become the world capital of the Bitcoin ecosystem? 
&gt; Alongside the potential for Salvadoran emigrants to send remittances back to their home country, the move by El Salvador to make bitcoin legal tender could also attract western and Asian crypto entrepreneurs. “Crypto investors and entrepreneurs will start to move to El Salvador!” tweeted Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON. “Amazing! Packing now!”
&gt; 
&gt; Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted a GIF of Mickey Mouse hurriedly tossing clothes into a suitcase, implicitly heading to El Salvador.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2019, according to the World Bank, El Salvador ranked 115th out of 186 countries in annual gross domestic product per capita on a purchasing power parity-adjusted basis, with $9,164. A handful of crypto billionaires moving to El Salvador could transform the country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ireland was once one of the poorest countries in Europe; beginning in 1996, Ireland reduced its corporate tax rate from 40% to 12.5%, resulting in a multi-decadal economic boom as large multinationals relocated to the Emerald Isle. In 2019, Ireland’s PPP-adjusted GDP climbed to 4th in the world at $89,684, ahead of the 8th-ranked U.S. ($65,298) and even 5th-ranked Switzerland ($72,376).
&gt; 
&gt; El Salvador has more to do to replicate Ireland’s success. The Heritage Foundation ranked the country 94th out of 184 countries in its 2021 Index of Economic Freedom, dinging El Salvador’s “uneven” protection of property rights and inconsistent rule of law, noting that “three of the past four presidents have been indicted for corruption.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier this year, President Bukele’s allies in the Asamblea Legislativa voted to replace the five members of El Salvador’s highest court, the Constitutional Court, and also the country’s attorney general. Mary Anastasia O’Grady, Americas columnist at the Wall Street Journal, responded by expressing concern that “under Mr. Bukele El Salvador may be the next Latin domino to fall to authoritarianism.” The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, led by Samantha Powers, redirected funding from the Salvadoran government to civil society groups.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, if El Salvador is to become a global crypto capital, entrepreneurs who move there will need to help increase confidence in the country’s legal and economic institutions.
&gt; 
&gt; If El Salvador doesn’t improve quickly, it could face competition. Other countries may follow El Salvador’s lead in adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Most Caribbean nations peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, for example, and many, like the Cayman Islands, are already well-versed in attracting foreign capital through low tax rates and efficient financial regulation.
&gt; 
&gt; Significant implications for U.S. companies and individuals
&gt; El Salvador’s bitcoin policies will also have significant ramifications for individuals and businesses in the United States and elsewhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today, in the U.S., it’s difficult to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, like buying a cup of coffee. That’s because, in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service defined cryptocurrencies as “property for Federal income tax purposes.” As a result, if you use bitcoin at Starbucks, and you purchased that bitcoin a few years ago when its price was lower, under IRS rules you’ve triggered a taxable event for which you have to report capital gains and fill out a cumbersome form. 
&gt; 
&gt; This IRS-imposed friction makes it extremely difficult to use bitcoin for everyday payments in a legally compliant way. On the other hand, if bitcoin is legal tender in the same way that euros and British pounds are, it becomes much easier to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, because the IRS thinks differently about transactions using foreign currencies. 
&gt; 
&gt; Something similar affects large U.S. corporations and financial institutions that wish to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and their parallels abroad long predate the invention of Bitcoin. Today, GAAP regards virtual currencies like bitcoin as “indefinite-lived intangible assets.” In real-world terms, this means that if a company bought one bitcoin at $50,000, and the market price goes down to $35,000, the company must write down the $15,000 loss as an “impairment.” By contrast, if the price of bitcoin goes up to $60,000, the $10,000 appreciation cannot be logged as an unrealized gain. These GAAP accounting quirks basically mean that, from a cosmetic standpoint, owning bitcoin on corporate balance sheets is nothing but downside, even if in reality the value of a company’s bitcoin holdings appreciates substantially.
&gt; 
&gt; The transformation by El Salvador of bitcoin into legal tender, i.e, a foreign currency, makes the accounting treatment much more straightforward, enabling every corporation in America to hold bitcoin in the same way that it holds other forms of cash. Such a change could dramatically increase the utility of bitcoin for corporate treasury management.
&gt; 
&gt; Most importantly, El Salvador’s decision has ramifications for one of the greatest sources of skepticism for Bitcoin’s staying power: the theory that the U.S. will ban the digital currency if it ever becomes a true competitor to the U.S. dollar. “Bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success,” said Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, at the Consensus cryptocurrency conference in May. But banning the official national currency of another country would be an unprecedented step for the U.S., one that could, on its own, undermine the greenback’s utility as the world’s premier fiat currency. 
&gt; 
&gt; El Salvador may be the smallest country in North America. But if President Bukele’s bitcoin proposal becomes law, El Salvador could become one of the most significant monetary centers in the world.",cryptocurrency

3. ADA is the most crypto of all cryptos. George of CryptosRUs pointed out in a recent video that he couldn’t find any trace of a VC firm owning Cardano in its portfolio in his search of the categories section on CMC. This makes sense if you know Cardano. Would freedom and decentralization loving Satoshi not throw up a little in his mouth to find out that VC ownership of cryptos was a metric people would care about in 2021? The lack of VC stake in the very decentralized and freedom loving Cardano only adds to our already iron-clad claim on the mantle of the most crypto of all crypto projects. Our ecosystem never sought to attract VC money that would only centralize ownership in a smaller number of hands. This doesn’t even address the current extreme centralization of block validation in BTC and ETH.

5. Cardano saw a new challenger enter the scene with Internet Computer (ICP) debuting very high on the CoinMarketCap charts. However, a look into ICP makes one question whether they are really in the Gen. 3 Blockchain race at all given that available information indicates the blockchain runs via datacenters hosting standardized hardware and that those datacenters can only join the network with the permission of the “Network Nervous System”. You could say that the winner of the Gen. 3 Blockchain race needs to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability. If that’s true, then it’s arguable that ICP is not even competing in the decentralization leg of the race. [https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97](https://youtu.be/zHl-oVPoX88?t=97)

29. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

32. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

57. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
58. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
59. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
60. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
61. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
62. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
63. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
64. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
65. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
66. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
67. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
68. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
69. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
70. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
71. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
72. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
73. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
74. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

77. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
78. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
79. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
80. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
81. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
82. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
83. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
84. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

dogecoin,Any views on the progression of the fall?,"If i might ask as a fellow. 42 holder, I want to consider my investment in doge as a retirement account, I believe in the community and in doge, but these recent shifts  have been really messing with my head last few days. The last crypto crash was predicated on the premise of instability on account of alot of FUD, this time however, it appears that major policy shifts, and government interventions are causing a very real crash,not just on FUD. I'm in India and the Supreme Court had recently over turned a decision by the Central (Federal Government) to ban cryptocurrency, stating that their claim that cryptocurrency is used to fund terrorist activities was unfounded. Unless the Banking industries can prove their claim, the ban on crypto was arbitrary and unconstitutional. This morning, the United States Govt was able to recover 2.3 million USD paid in bitcoin as ransom which becomes fodder for the banking industry to go back to the Supreme Court. I don't think this is only FUD created by  whales. What happens in the US generally affects the movement of policies across the world. In such a situation, does it still make sense to become a long time holder when there isn't any guarantee that post the crypto collapse, the doge will rise next year again. Anyone with any insights on this, would be great to hear from you guys.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,How is binance able to afford the interest rates it pays?,"In was looking at interest rates for crypto on binance - and I see that they pay 6% for a locked 90 deposit on stable coins like Tether, BUSD, USDC. 

How is binance able to afford this?!

CryptoCurrency,8 reasons to be buying at these levels.,"1. FUD is at an ATH. We're getting bombarded on a daily basis, and it worked for a while, but...

2. [The Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) is clustering at lows not seen since March 2020, and before that in December 2018. These were both historical opportunities to buy.

3. The run up to January/February saw the price overstretch the moving average by almost unprecedented amounts, and we've now snapped back the other way. [The difference between the price and the moving average](https://imgur.com/kIaDPkU) has not been this high since (yep, you guessed it) March 2020, and before that December 2018.

4. Volume is dropping, which in a correction is very bullish as it means sellers are running out of steam. [Here](https://imgur.com/1diLKkL), I've highlighted all the lowest volume points during the corrections of the last 6 months. Notice how they're all either at or near the bottom.

5. Whales are moving crypto off exchanges at the highest rate since November, which was the start of the parabolic phase of this run: https://mobile.twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1401687781689135111

6. Interest rates are still at 0%.

7. Inflation is [thought by the powers that be to be persistent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-06/yellen-says-higher-interest-rates-would-be-plus-for-u-s-fed), which is great for the long term outlook of crypto in general.

8. The [stock to flow model](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) is showing that BTC is oversold by levels equalling the most extreme in its history (May 2012, July 2017).

Taken together, these signs are insanely bullish. It's very likely that if we're not exactly at the bottom, then we're very close to it. You should be buying as much as possible at these levels.

Edit: just realised I mentioned the volume point twice, so this is now only 7 reasons to be buying at these levels. Still mega-bullish, but 1/8th less so, I guess. Unless someone can suggest another reason I can add...

Stop lying and fooling people, FBI &amp; Media!","According to media reporters, FBI claims that it can get access to bitcoin stored anywhere. That is just impossible, unless somehow they have developed ways to crack SHA256 and brute force wallet private keys. In which case, BTC is the least of everyone's worries and state/nuclear secrets could be under risk.

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

&gt; I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

&gt; If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",cryptocurrency

Basically I just want advice on the best way to pay for this car. (I have an emergency fund and I'm paying the down with some money I've put aside.

I haven’t been making payments because of the CARES Act and I will be enrolling in grad school soon, so they’ll end up going into deferment anyway. I do plan on making payments when they’re in deferment, I just didn’t know if it was worth it to consolidate since they won’t be garnering interest anyway.

She’s contributing 6% to her 401(k) to get the company match but that is all shes putting at retirement right now due to her loans.

Right now due to forbearance since all of her loans our government loans, Her balance is sitting right around $72,000. About half of it our parent plus loans with interest rates of 7-8%. The other half are loans in her name which have interest rates from 4 to 5%. The good news is from working over the past year she has been able to save up about $40-$41,000 in her savings right now to throw at the loans once forbearance ends. She is leaving yourself about a $5000 E fund in her checking account also but that’s with taking the $40,000 out of it. 

Right now the plan is to pay off all of the high interest loans right away in September when the no interest stops. Should her plan to be to keep paying off the other loans as quick as possible? She just moved in and now that we’re splitting rent and some expenses she will probably be able to have a bout 3K left over each month To throw at her student loans if she wants to throw it all at them. 

Sidenote I plan on proposing soon and we will probably have a wedding sometime later next year if I had to guess. So that will be an expense that we have to throw in there but I am Engineer as well and make about $72,000 currently with no debt and about $23,000 in my savings right now.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto drops. How did the feds get some Bitcoin back? I say it’s easy when you just take it back from your other wallet. Thoughts?,[removed],cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,What's BTC worth? - is a hard question. What does BTC cost? - is a better question,"After BTC accounts started paying a 9% interest rate, I started wondering who is paying it. That is a monster interest rate. It's an important question because I believe in the no free lunch theory of economics.

We can debate all day what BTC is worth. You can argue about using market price or why it should be worth something else. It's not a productive question. Asking what BTC costs is a better question. It costs about $7000 worth of electricity to mine one. An Antminer costs around $20000. Using an Antminer, it will take you about 3-5 years to use up $7000 worth of electricity. In that 3-5 years, you have to hope that a new piece of hardware doesn't come out which makes your Antminer obsolete.

When BTC was at $60000, a free lunch situation appears. Why pay $60k for something that you can create for about $27k? Eventually, this all made sense. MARA and RIOT, which are corporate mining operations, decided to eat this free lunch on the billion dollar scale. MARA bought 100,000 Antminers. That's 2 billion dollars worth of Antminers. The bought everything available and are waiting for delivery on remaining units. No one else is going to be able to buy any in significant quantities for a while.

The only problem? BTC price changes every day. If it could take 3-5 years to find one on each miner, what if BTC price drops below the break even price of $27k? Even if it went to $30k, the risk is large for a barely profitable operation. But what if they could lock in the selling price of BTC, so that they could guarantee that their investment would pay off? Having BTC in those interest paying accounts allow someone else to short BTC.

It all comes together now. The corporate miners are the ones shorting BTC. They locked in their selling price at $60k. Minus electricity and equipment of $27k, we're at $33k profit. 3 years of interest at 9% on $60k gives an upper bound of $16,200. That's how much they pay to short BTC for 3 years if the price stays at $60k. Less if BTC price goes down. That still leaves about $14k locked in guaranteed profit on approximately a $27k investment. The people offered to pay  you interest are the same ones who are going to short BTC against you. They are not naked short. They are locking in a selling price in the anticipation of their own production. This happens the same way when farmers sell futures on their crops. They can lock in their selling price before growing the crops. Although it took me a while to figure out, one should always beware when a free lunch looks too good. Make sure you're on the correct side of the free lunch.

Will BTC go to the moon? Maybe. But when the price of a good goes insanely higher than the cost of production, some big guys will come in and make more. There should be a ceiling on BTC price of around $60k for a few years. The cost of production is sticky, and the market price of a commodity is pressured into moving towards marginal cost. It will last until the next round of hardware changes the difficulty and raises the cost of production.

Lemme know what you guys think.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Anyone had luck finding information on student loan interest rates for fedloan servicing?,"I'm trying to set up an excel spreadsheet to plan my student loan payoff based on some other life goals. The problem is I cannot figure out what my standard interest rate is on my student loans - obviously this information used to be in the fedloan servicing portal but now they are set to 0%.

My first thought was to look for old PDF statements that had the interest rates specified. The portal doesn't show historic billing statements (I'm not sure why - it used to but they have disappeared, I'm guessing it shows only a certain period of time worth). The only account-related letters I have are last year's recertification for my IDR plan, but they show 0% on those PDFs as well.

So naturally my next step was to reach out to their customer support and ask. The first time I spoke with them they said there is no way to find the interest rates on the website and they didn't have access to that information and that I should wait until September when the numbers revert.

I spoke with someone again and they said they could have me sent an email with my interest rates, It never came so I called again - this time I was told they don't do that and again told ""wait until September.""

Anyone aware of a way I'm missing to find that info? While technically I obviously can just wait until September, I just finished paying off CC debt and am eager to tackle my student loan debt next, but want to pay it off intelligently...

personalfinance,Recommendations on how to tackle parents' credit card debt,"Just found out last week that my parents (mostly my father) has racked up close to $30k in credit card/cash advancement.

It was COVID hard times + trips to the hospital + bad financial decisions that ultimately led up to this point.

Before this point, my family was not really the one to discuss finances and everyone had their unspoken assigned bills, with my father burdening the majority of the bills. He's a self-employed contractor and his income has dropped significantly with the start of COVID.

Add on top of that, he had to make a trip to the ER and follow ups for his health.

And he bought a truck last year, thinking COVID will blow over and his income will go back to what it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I had just moved out of the house last April after getting married and that made keeping an eye on the family more difficult and it got to this point.

I finally got a chance to sit everyone down this past weekend to really have a talk and we brought to light how much my dad had accumulated onto his credit cards for all of the hospital bills, car payments, bills, etc.

My mom's limited income comes in and basically all goes back out in groceries and feeding my father and brother with whatever she has left she has been helping my father slowly pay the bills.

My brother has covered the last few months of rent as well as my dad's income is roughly 1/3 of what he used to make.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of negotiating with the hospital for the medical bill but he had already paid it off and now the balance sits on the cards.

My dad has brought up the idea of a loan consolidation but I heard that that method is not guaranteed and will take a big toll on his credit score as well.

My wife and I have about $10k we can spare to make a dent in the overall amount but what other options do we have in approaching this situation? Are personal loans a viable option to maybe get all of the 4 credit card balances in one place and possibly get a lower interest rate?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  
Thank you all for the great suggestions!

Had the conversation with my dad and went through the process of finding out the loan payoff amount left on the car as well as look at some buyers and we are hoping that we can at least break even on the car. We plan to get that taken care of tomorrow.

My brother has been contributing towards the rent before but in the mean time while my father looks for another job, has agreed to take over a larger chunk of the rent to relieve some of the pressure from my parents, at least while he is living there as he has no plans of moving out anytime soon.

The use of credit cards to pay for all of the various spendings was a terrible idea and my dad is aware. My brother and I will make efforts to break the habits of the lack of communication within the family to help my parents look into the different options of consolidation or potential loans to slowly clear up the balances.

My wife and I do have a bit saved up other than the $10k that I mentioned in the original post but as many of you have suggested, we may hold onto that for the time being and look for other avenues where they can figure things out for themselves first.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still open to any sort of advice or suggestions regarding other options maybe not mentioned in the comments!

Thanks again!",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""There’s been class warfare going on for the last 20 years, and my class has won.”","Here is an in-depth look at how the billionaires (and millionaires) game the US tax codes. This report looks at personal taxes of US billionaires, not their companies. Warren Buffet has a personal tax rate of 0.10% on his ""reported"" income of $125 mill. Yet middle class Americans wealth grew at roughly the same rate as the taxes they paid. If you're not rich - you're paying more in taxes than rich people. The rich are also not audited nearly as much as middle-class/low-income Americans due to the long drawn out legal battles that ensue. 

We need to stop praising these people who are screwing over the average person, not paying their fair share of taxes, and subsequently causing tax rates to increase. This is open knowledge that these people, and their companies, pay little to no taxes - yet not a damn thing has been done, or is in the process of being done to stop this. This is something that voters on the on the left and right should be able to unite on.   
Plus how many of these people's companies get, or have gotten, federal handouts $$? Socialism is ok when it's for the rich. 

The government is suffocating the average American taxpayer and it's only going to get worse. "" In the here and now, the ultrawealthy use an array of techniques that aren’t available to those of lesser means to get around the tax system. ""

Remember the couple who is suing the IRS for taxing the creation of their staked coins? How is the government going to tax coins created by staking if this following quote is the reason they are giving for not being able to tax the rich - because they don't sell their assets. 

 ""Since then, the concept that income comes only from proceeds — when gains are “realized” — has been the bedrock of the U.S. tax system. Wages are taxed. Cash dividends are taxed. Gains from selling assets are taxed. But if a taxpayer hasn’t sold anything, there is no income and therefore no tax.""

CryptoCurrency,Discussion: The future of Crypto (Singe or multi-chain),"There seem to be various narratives in terms of how people see the future of crypto and decentralization in general. I've gone down this rabbit hole, and am not 100% certain on where I stand. I'll try to summarize what I've learned (from both sides) as best as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The BTC maxi narrative** 

Avid Bitcoin supporters seem to be of the opinion that over time, almost all the other chains will disappear, and everyone will use Bitcoin as the base-layer, with L2 and L3 applications. This is in part because they believe that it's the most decentralized base-layer in existence, and less centralized solutions can be built on top (with faster transaction speeds, for those applications that need it).

Some argue that if this doesn't happen, the only alternative is a world where people will willingly choose centralized solutions (for better UX), and this could undo everything this decentralization movement worked towards. A good example would be BSC and BNB. With Bitcoin as the base layer, it's less of a problem if L2 and L3 solutions are less decentralized because the L1 will always be. 

Another argument is that in this kind of system, you wouldn't be obligated to use different tokens/coins for every single dApp/platform (some dApps wouldn't need tokens/coins at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

**The multi-chain narrative**

If this ends up being our future, we'd be looking at various chains with interoperability. Each chain will dominate in different industries/sectors and or parts of the world and will become interoperable with other chains (so you won't be locked into a specific ecosystem). They'll be valued according to actual use cases and capabilities. 

This seems like a more realistic outcome to me, as I simply do not see different industries, developers and nations agree on using Bitcoin as the base-layer. Some might want more data stored in L1, others might want to use a specific coding language, and some L1s might be sufficient for specific use cases, to the point where L2/L3s aren't even necessary at all (Bitcoin maxis claims that L1s can never be scalable). Also, regardless of whether Bitcoin will have unlimited capabilities in terms of L2/L3 layers, not every government and or organization/application will want to use a base-layer with limited data storage. This might prove problematic from an auditing perspective. 

Plus, I think that **a world with multiple chains that are interoperable is by definition more decentralized than a world where we only have one**. This is why Bitcoin developers should absolutely consider agreeing to BTC interoperability with other chains, something they've scoffed at in the past.

personalfinance,Can Someone Educate me why World Stok Index Fund makes sense?,"I have been investing in the US-based index funds (SP500 or Total Market). Some people have suggested to invest in the world stock index funds... but my question is why?

Some says for diversification, but VTWAX is made up of 60% North America, 17% Europe, 12% Pacific and 11% Emerging Markets.. and when the US stock market tanks then the rest of the world also drops too, or even more. Expense ratio is also typically higher for world stock index funds than that of SP500 or total market index funds. The world economy gest affected by the US economy.

When the US fights inflation and starts tapering, which I believe they will have to eventually, then the world economy typically gets more affected by it than the US. A few examples that I learned is the 80s when Latin America went into a recession after Volcker raised interest rates. Asia (Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea) went into a recession when interest rates went up in mid-90s. After a financial crisis, the US suffered significantly too, but also Southern Europe (e.g. Greece) and other European countries (Spain, Portugal, etc) also suffered greatly. During pandemic, inflation fears are big in Brazil and Turkey, etc.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Consolidation Loan?,"So while I can be financially illiterate to percentages and whatnot, I was usually financially stable. Till the last 18 months. Thanks to no job from the pandemic and some personal events, I find myself at around 80% of my total credit usage. Payments are Sisyphean, as my interest rate on my main credit card tends to almost completely equal the minimum payment I can make. My credit score still hovers in between good and excellent, but I'm worried I'm in a hole here.  


Of course I'm getting mail regarding consolidation loans, and from what I can tell, with my current credit score, I could be paying about the same if not a little less, but I'd be out of the cycle of paying off credit interest. I'm not incredibly versed in this world, though, so what are your experiences/suggestions as to whether this is a viable idea or not?",finance
stocks,Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation,"Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.

In a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.

The analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.

**Deutsche Bank says**

“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”

As part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.

In the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.

The Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.

“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this  
patience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”

## To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.

Most on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.

Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.

On price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.

“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.

That will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.

Congress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.

“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”

The Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.

Then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.

“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”

The firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs.

personalfinance,My credit score dropped from 760 to 660 in less than a year. How can I raise it back up?,"Hello,

I bought a pre-owned car three years ago and had been steadily making payments. For reasons I'd rather not share I missed two car payments in a row last summer and those payments went to collection. I also missed car insurance payments twice in a row and that went to collections. I paid the late relatively quickly on the car but I was unaware that I balance in collections on my car insurance until recently. That is still being processed and (and according to my ""car insurance lady"") should be cleared in a month or two.

I had the money to make the payments at the time but I am going to chock it up to laziness and depression. 

Recently I had to take out a $500 personal to make my car payment but I got a great paying job now and I am in a much better place mentally/emotionally. I am absolutely committed to never missing a payment on anything for the rest of my life. I got spanked and never want to experience this again. 

Also, I had a $1500 balance with the IRS that went into collections but I paid that off 1.5 years ago.

Currently I have a $30K school loan, a $10K car loan, $650 overdraft protection (can this affect my credit if I miss a payment on my overdraft protection?), and a $500 personal loan. 

This great paying job is going to require me to move and pay about $3500 put of pocket before I get my relocation allowance/regular paycheck. I'm working a retail job at the moment and have been living pay to paycheck to I'll need a personal loan/credit card to finance this move (car fixes, rent and other expenses).

Any advice on getting back up to 760? I'd love to have a 20% down payment on a home soon and the area near the new job is much more affordable than where I currently am living. Will my interest rates/mortgage be that much worse with a 660 credit score than a 760? 

Any advice on how to raise my credit? Should I take out a credit card to finance this move or a personal loan instead? I take criticism well. Thank you.",finance

According to current macroeconomic statistics the European Union economy is slowly recovering from the crisis but there are still obstacles to reaching predictable values.

So I'm in the market for a car, and want to get your opinion on how to approach buying a vehicle.

I don't anticipate using this car for more than a few years, so my thinking was that I should buy brand new, rather than used, with an eye towards selling later on and recouping much of what I had paid.

Is this the best approach for my situation? Would I save more money buying new and selling later, or buying used and selling later?

Also, I have plenty of money saved up in the bank and can afford to buy the whole thing with cash. I know dealers are likely to offer me a deal if I include financing, so how should I approach this? When does the trade off between low interest rate financing vs. all cash become worth it?

And a corollary: Is it possible to get financing in order to take advantage of any possible sticker-price incentives that come with such financing, and then pay the loan off immediately? Does this confer any particular benefits? I've heard of that happening before, but now sure how feasible that is.

Does it make any sense to take a student loan so that I can continue to save/invest for a home/car/retirement and rent close to the school? I know debt for most people is something you avoid at all costs but i feel like i would be in a better position at the end of the masters financially.

Related, are federal unsubsidized loans always the first ones to take?

If variable rates go up, i have savings/investments I can use to pay off the loans quickly.

Bitcoin,Is this how inflation works or am I just a crazy bitcoiner?,"The fed prints money

The fed lends the money to the banks for a fee

Banks have shareholders who get paid in dividends

Banks lend that money out to customers for a fee

Customers buy things with that money

When they spend that money they have to buy from a business that uses a bank. If they do not eventually someone else will. 

That business pays a fee. 

That business adds the cost of the fees the bank charges in to its prices. 

So the customer is paying for the businesses bank account. 

The fed also buys assets like mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds. 

The bank charges the Fed a fee. Even if they did it for free the fee would be charged to the other customers.

The bank takes those fees to pay it’s costs of operation and debts to the federal reserve. 

Let’s not forget the bonuses!

Whatever is left over goes to shareholders in the form of dividends. 

Politicians are shareholders in the banks. 

Politicians voted to print more money to get everyone spending money. So the fed had to print more money and lend it out charging EVEN more fees causing prices to go up which means the people have to pay more! The more we spend the more fees get collected, the more the banks can afford to pay their shareholders and the more their earnings/share goes up. 

Now you have money you want to “save.” You give it to the bank. Because of fractional reserve banking they get to spend 90% of your money. The more they spend, the more fees they collect, the more dividends their shareholders get. When the pandemic hit and they started printing money they told the banks they could spend 100% of your money however they wanted. So EVEN MORE SPENDING, EVEN MORE FEES, EVEN MORE DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. Don’t forget a lot of politicians are invested in banks! Either directly or indirectly through ETFs and/or hedge funds or other means. 

Politicians vote to lend money or just give money to other countries. 
They lend them dollars. 
You need to use the same bank technology to spend those dollars in other countries. 
The bank gets a fee. Those dollars eventually end up with the bank and in their shareholders pockets in the form of dividends and earnings/share. Remember politicians are shareholders in banks! 

Now when a bank lends out money they charge a fee because of “risk.” 
Unless I’m wrong they take on 0 risk because if you have it in your bank account they still get to use it to spend and collect more fees. If you spend it they collect a fee. And who you spent it with will spend it for a fee or put it in their bank account and the cycle continues. 
And all those fees go in to share holders pockets. Politicians are shareholders in the banks 


Bitcoin eliminates the federal reserve and the need for banks. Less fees, cheaper prices, less politicians getting rich by printing money

Scenario: I have a close friend who makes roughly 70k a year. They bought a house a year ago with their sister and pay half the mortgage, roughly 1500 after utilities and expenses.

The principle from a year ago has grown from roughly 10k to 14k, they also use the same card to pay their monthly expenses. 

I’m looking into credit card balance transfers to see if we can lower the interest they are paying on the card, or suggesting they look into personal loans at local credit unions with lower interest rates. Anyone have any advice on either of these or any alternate suggestions.

Is it just me, or is this clause overly general and could enable the bank to just decide to hold all of a (potentially large) deposit, indefinitely? Or does the ""Subject to Applicable Law"" ensure that my money would be safe and must eventually be disbursed to my account or returned to its source?",finance
Bitcoin,Question about Bitcoin the remaining Bitcoin not in “circulation”,"So, how exactly is Bitcoin “made” when being paid to the miners? I assume some of it is paid via a network fee but some has to be brand new coins from somewhere. Are they stored in a wallet somewhere and dispersed as needed according to an algorithm or is it created by the node as the block is solved somehow? The reason I’m asking is because I know the most recent “FBI hacks Bitcoin” news article had me thinking about the feasibility of the remaining noncirculating supply of Bitcoin being released to miners, being hacked in some way. Like maybe if it was in a wallet? Similar to how the Fed did it I guess. Prob a stupid question, but couldn’t find much on YouTube.",cryptocurrency
business,Starting a Business,"What should my business structure be if I want to start and online retail shop? We are thinking about an LLC,  but we are not sure what to do when registering the business at the state level and federally. What else should we consider?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,The market behavior is commanded by Bitcoin,"Apparently, let’s be honest, the fear sentiment has been stronger and the hope sentiment has weakened in recent weeks. Most of us have been victims of News and Tweets manipulation. However, the truth is there is no evident reason to fear cryptos: among many positive properties they brought to the redefinition of money, the fact they have a limited supply (Bitcoin cannot mathematically have more than 21M coins, Nano 133M coins, etc) gives any holder an advantage over USD increasingly inflationary behavior. Like Gold, it’s value has increased over the years but we often don’t realize that much of its price increase comes from inflation. $100 USD in 1920 is roughly $1 USD in 2020 while 1 Oz of Gold in 1920 is exactly 1 Oz of Gold in 2020. And 1 Bitcoin in 2009 is exactly 1 Bitcoin in 2021. 1 Nano in 2015 is exactly 1 Nano in 2021. 

So why the market seems to have turned bearish?

If your observation window is only the last 2 weeks, then is bearish. But if your observation window is the last 6, 7 or 8 years, then is very bullish. If you compare to the Gold price charts, you can see how similar they are: the printed money out of thin air from the Fed is fueling the Gold market and is fueling the crypto market.

Currently, virtually all coins you can see on CMC have a trading pair with Bitcoin and not necessarily with an AltCoin including your favorite AltCoin. Actually, even if your favorite AltCoin is one on the top, let’s say Cardano or ChainLink, the number of existing trading pairs and the number of Exchanges listing your AltCoin is a mere fraction of Bitcoin’s.

And… Bitcoin has about half of the total market cap.

So, from this we can conclude that the crypto market went south in recent weeks because of Bitcoin that dragged all AltCoins and not because of your favorite AltCoin has been victim of some kind of FUD. 

The crypto market big swings will be mitigated if more AltCoins are listed in Exchanges and offering more trading pairs thus reducing the gap to Bitcoin. And then your favorite AltCoin will have a chance to shine and not be dragged down everytime Bitcoin goes down.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"After googling it, CFTC boss says DeFi is a ‘bad idea’ and probably illegal","Commissioner Dan M. Berkovitz of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) believes DeFi derivatives platforms may contravene the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

Speaking as part of a June 8 keynote address dubbed “Climate Change and Decentralized Finance: New Challenges for the CFTC,” Berkovitz notes that:

“Not only do I think that unlicensed DeFi markets for derivative instruments are a bad idea, but I also do not see how they are legal under the CEA.”
Berkovitz noted that the “CEA requires futures contracts to be traded on a designated contract market (DCM) licensed and regulated by the CFTC,” however he asserts that no DeFi platforms are registered as DCMs or SEFs.

During the keynote, the commissioner emphasized the need for regulators to become familiar with DeFi derivatives and other applications amid the booming growth of the sector.

He referenced the huge amount of liquidity pumped into the market over the past twelve months, noting that now that “you’re talking real money” there needs be stringent regulation in place to protect DeFi consumers:

“Given the explosive growth of this sector, federal regulators should become familiar with this new technology and its potential uses and be prepared to protect the public against misuse.”
Interestingly, Berkovitz references a Wikipedia definition of DeFi, and notes that his research was based in part on a Google search. ""If you type “DeFi” into Google search, a top link is to a CoinDesk article, 'What is DeFi?';"" he said.""[It's] an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries.”",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Trying to close my debt with the IRS,"I currently owe about $2K for underpaid taxes in 2017 after making an accident with educational expenses on my taxes for that year. Long story short, this remaining balance is mostly interest at a stupidly high rate and I've made the bad decision to try and ignore it due to terrible anxiety after discovering the error in late 2019. I just paid about $700 on top of this debt from my 2020 taxes.  


I just want to remove this debt from my life. Although it would effect my budget for the next couple months, I would be OK with just paying off the debt in whole but I don't agree with the amount of interest due. I started getting charged interest on my error as of January 1, 2018 but I was not notified of this error until late 2019. So, I'm looking for tips or tricks on how to communicate with the IRS so that I can efficiently just pay this off at a minimal cost.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: In 2017, I underpaid on my taxes by around $1400 due to a now admitted error. I didn't discover this error until winter 2019 after I moved and the IRS mailed me for the first time about it. At this point in my life, I was unable to afford the amount due and interest rate was compiling exponentially. I tried several attempts to contact the IRS by phone but was always eventually defeated and never got to talk to anyone. This only compiled toward my anxiety and at some point after COVID hit the US, I just gave up because it was taking too much time away from my work. Now that I can afford to pay the debt in whole, I'm just so frustrated that I don't know what to do.",finance

20. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become.

21. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

25. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
26. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

49. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
50. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
51. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
52. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
53. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
54. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
55. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
56. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
57. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
58. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
59. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
60. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
61. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
62. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
63. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
64. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
65. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
66. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

69. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
70. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
71. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
72. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
73. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
74. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
75. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

Bitcoin,Interest vs Cold Storage,"Opinion/Pros &amp; Cons

For those who have a substantial ($1000&lt;) amount of Bitcoin, what have you done with it?

I’ve recently jumped into crypto on an exchange and purchased some. On Voyager, they offer 6.25% interest on your Bitcoin and leaving it on the exchange keeps it liquid AND you earn interest. However, you are vulnerable to hacks. 

Is it worth keeping your crypto in an exchange earning interest or would your best bet be to move it t cold storage to ensure 100% safety and not make money off your crypto investment?

Also, Voyager is backed by FDIC? Isn’t your money safe if backed by the fed?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"US Expat that forgot about the foreign earned income exclusion rules, freaking out","So I made a big big mistake. Havent seen anyone since 2019 friends/family in the USA. I live alone in a box basically abroad in canada and been stuck with no face-to-face interactions since. So I thought it'd finally be a nice trip to come get vaccinated and see friends/family.

Well, I forgot about the 330 day physical test rule. I had it in my head it was something more reasonable and today it hit me like a brick that I should do some math. Well it's been 25-30 odd days I've been in the country and I was hoping to wait a bit longer to see how the COVID border restrictions let up but they keep being coy and mum about it. Hell, I think I'm going to bust the dates just waiting on a COVID test result! They don't care about vaccines at the border I have to do this all prior.

Now I'm freaking out and of course, because I thought the Bona Fide Resident test was something I could rely on if that was ever a problem, according to [H&amp;RBlock](https://www.hrblock.com/expat-tax-preparation/resource-center/filing/status/bona-fide-residence/) I can't rely on that either. My work visa is temporary, it has an end date and I renew that end date every 2 years with my work place until I can establish permanent residency.

So I'm boned here? I'm going to get double taxed on my income and there's nothing I can do?

I'm going to try to get a COVID test in the AM and call up the border, get there ASAP once I have results. Hell I may start driving before I even get them just to be safe. I feel like I'm fleeing my own country here because of the boogeyman.

Worse is I have to cancel all my plans to visit family again for a short wedding stay and the end of year holidays. I really screwed up... I feel sick.

EDIT: At least on the Canada side, I'm reading this:

&gt; For example, Canada has a tax treaty with the United States (U.S.). Individuals who are considered residents of both Canada and the U.S. will be considered residents for tax purposes in the country in which they have established the strongest ties. If they have stronger ties to the U.S., they will be deemed non-residents in Canada for tax purposes and their salary and remuneration will not qualify for federal or provincial/territorial film and media tax credits.

&gt; A work permit indicates a temporary stay in Canada, but is not conclusive for determining residency for tax purposes. The residency status of each individual is reviewed independently, on an annual basis, and is based on the facts and information made available to the CRA at the time of an audit.

Is there perhaps some kind of special stipulation with Canada here I can fall under?

EDIT2:

&gt; There is also the Foreign Tax Credit provision which gives you a dollar tax credit for every dollar of tax you paid in Canada.  Under this procedure, which is favored by many expats, if you pay more tax say in Canada than you owe the U.S., you can carry the excess tax credits forward for future use.

https://www.expattaxcpas.com/canada/u-s-canada-tax-treaty-expats-living-canada-need-know/

https://brighttax.com/blog/us-foreign-tax-credit-expats-ultimate-guide/

So as long as I pay Canadian taxes on my income, I can count what I pay them against what I would have to pay the USA correct? So even if the USA tries to double tax me, I can deduct what I paid canada which ends up being a lot for a year. So I shouldnt be panicking? I think I used this method when I first moved to Canada as an expat but at the time it was handled by a H&amp;R Block person and it kind of went over my head.  Since then I try to do my taxes by hand now and I've always just done the Foreign Income Exclusion because I've always met requirements but this sounds very familiar to me.",finance

personalfinance,Can someone please explain the logic of putting money down to finance a car?,"Per my understanding unless its going to get you a better interest rate OR if your credit wont allow you to finance without a DP, then I don’t see the point of putting down anything?

Ive read the below but I still don’t understand

**1. “The larger the down payment, the lower your monthly payment will be..”**

a. I don’t understand this, its **your** money. Of course monthly payments will be lower because **you're** paying more of **your** money up front. If you put down 6k then yes, your monthly payment is lower but I don’t see how this helps you at all? If anything keep that down payment for yourself, and earn interest on it. Most returns are in the 5-6% range and most car loans are at 3-4% interest expense so you still will net gain.

**2. “Cars depreciate fast. If you make no down payment, you loan may be under water. If your car gets totaled insurance companies won’t pay what you owe on the car, so youll have to pay the difference between the book value and the amount of the loan owed”**

a. OK….who cares? Once again its **your** money. If I total my car and only get $10K and my loan is $14K then ill owe $4K out of my pocket. If I had made a $4K down payment then I would owe nothing (that’s IF I get into an accident and total my car) but either way, you pay the same, whether you pay it up front or not? So I still don’t see how this helps you at all?

Going into the home search i wanted to take advantage of the current lowered interest rates.  I signed the contract to buy the home from the builder even though i cant lock in those interest rates until the home is ready for inspection and preapprovals are only good for 60 days. The contract i signed with the realtors/builders/titlecompany included the prequalification form with the lender. 

Im assuming im not tied down that lender since i didnt really sign anything with them and that the realtor/builder just wanted assurance i would be good for the home. Correct?

1. The conditions that started the bull run have not changed (0% interest rates, QA).

2.The main bull run due to the halving cycle is only just scheduled to get going now.

dogecoin,Profit calculations - you’re probably missing out on a lot of money by doing this,"You may be losing an enormous amount of money because of this one common misunderstanding. 

For easy math let’s say two Doge believers in the US each invest $5,000 when Doge was at 0.25 and sold at 0.50. That’s a 100% return on investment (ROI), gross profit of $5,000

Doge #1: sold within a year. They paid their normal income tax on the profit. Let’s say that is 32% (US Fed rate ‘20-‘21). 32% of $5,000 is $1,600. The net profit is $3,400. 

Doge #2: Sold 366 days after purchase (1 year plus 1 day). That becomes long term capital gains which is, based on your portfolio income, probably taxed at 20%. 20% of $5,000 is $1000. The net profit is $4000.

In this scenario there is a 12% hit to your net profit if you take gains within one year. 

Just be aware. Obviously no one times the market perfectly. Buy when you believe is a good time to buy (and only with money you’re ok to lose) and sell when you believe is a good time to sell. You’re an adult, it’s your money, you should do with it what you want. There are times I sell within a year. There are times when I’ll intentionally wait it out. It’s entirely situational.

CryptoCurrency,Analysis: Which Countries are working on their own Cryptocurrency?,"Just like any new technology, cryptocurrencies have an adoption curve. In the case of Bitcoin, the innovators were [buying BTC](https://www.exodus.com/bitcoin-wallet) at $5 when nobody had ever heard of blockchain.  

In this post, our own Sam Klemens dives into crypto adoption at the federal level and how countries around the world are beginning to embrace cryptocurrencies.

The early adopters are the next class of people to embrace a technology. We’re somewhere in this stage of the adoption cycle now, as tens of millions of new people are getting involved with crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

[The technology adoption curve, from hackernoon ](https://preview.redd.it/cwwqsdg0d9471.jpg?width=1427&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5160f269096d14cefef1a5dbcc8035c0dad412)

It’s not just investors though, even governments are taking an interest in crypto and blockchain technology. Although we’ll cover many topics, this article focuses primarily on countries who are either adopting crypto or planning on creating their own government-backed CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies).

# Blockchain Innovation Hubs

It can be interesting to look at cryptocurrency by country, to see where some of the best blockchain innovation hubs in the world are located.

First up is Malta, which is often referred to as [Blockchain Island](https://internationalfinance.com/how-malta-became-the-blockchain-island/). Malta is one of the world’s most successful crypto innovation hubs because of their friendly regulatory atmosphere. Crypto is fully legal in Malta and firms based here can build their business in compliance with the law.

Binance is based in Malta, as is Tron and hundreds of other cryptocurrency projects.

Portugal is another crypto country that has very friendly regulations for cryptocurrency investors and startups. In 2016 Portugal [updated their laws](https://jeangalea.com/portugal-crypto-bitcoin/) to classify crypto as a type of currency. Under this tax code investors [don’t have to pay taxes](https://www.portugalhomes.com/news/article/170/cryptocurrency-is-tax-free-in-portugal) on capital gains from cryptocurrencies.

Getting rid of crypto taxes is a smart move by Portugal. This next bull market in crypto will create a new class of crypto millionaires who may be willing to move to a different country to pay less in taxes.

The more wealthy individuals there are living somewhere, the better that country is going to do economically. The Portuguese government understands how their tax policies can convince the crypto elite to relocate to Portugal and all of the benefits that can create for the country.

Singapore is also friendly to the crypto industry. Recently, the Singapore bank DBS [announced their plans](https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/dbs_digital_exchange) to create a digital asset exchange platform. This exchange will only be available to large institutions and accredited investors at first, but it could open up to the general public later on.

The bank of Singapore [has stated](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-gold-cryptocurrency-singapore-b1793313.html#:~:text=Bitcoin%20and%20other%20digital%20cryptocurrencies,to%20the%20Bank%20of%20Singapore.) that Bitcoin could replace gold as the preferred store of value in the coming years. Although there is no official announcement to support this idea, some cryptocurrency commentators have speculated that Singapore could be one of the first crypto countries to add BTC to its central bank’s balance sheet.

Regardless of whether that happens, Singapore is one of the world’s most crypto friendly countries.

### Which countries are creating their own CBDC?

Even though most of the important innovation is happening in the private sector, governments are also using blockchain to create their own Central Bank Digital Currencies. Here are some of the crypto countries that are in the process of creating a CBDC.

* China
* Sweden
* The Bahamas
* Canada
* [The United States](https://www.coindesk.com/fed-chairman-powell-we-will-engage-the-public-on-the-digital-dollar-this-year?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;utm_term=Money%20Reimagined)
* The EU
* Thailand
* Japan

Additionally, in a historic move, El Salvador has [passed a law](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1402507224916836352) that officially recognizes BTC as legal tender in the country. El Salvador will also [grant citizenship](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1402491886657490944) to anyone who invests at least 3 BTC into the nation’s economy. Since El Salvador’s move, [Paraguay](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/06/08/paraguay-politician-promises-big-bitcoin-announcement/) and [Panama](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/bitcoin/panama-may-join-el-salvador-and-paraguay-in-bitcoin-adoption) have announced that they are considering similar moves with BTC.

Eventually, most countries will have a CBDC, although it may take ten or twenty years to reach that point.

# The Most Popular Crypto Countries

Switzerland might be the best country to start a cryptocurrency project in. America has Silicon Valley but Switzerland has Zug, a city that’s often called [Crypto Valley](https://cryptovalley.swiss/).

One of the key advantages of building a crypto startup in Switzerland is regulatory clarity. Startups can create a product within a clearly defined legal framework. Why is this so important?

Clearly defined cryptocurrency laws are important because it allows a crypto startup to build out its product without worrying about breaking the law. Ripple is a great example of why this is so important.  

Ripple is not a company that’s trying to subvert financial laws. Rather, their product is used by heavily regulated banks and Ripple has always done their best to conform to all financial regulations inside the United States. Even though Ripple always tried to work with regulators, at the end of 2020 the SEC hit Ripple [with a massive lawsuit](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338).

What’s so aggravating, from Ripple’s perspective, is that it wasn’t at all clear that they were breaking any rules. The regulatory framework for crypto in the United States is so outdated and opaque that it gives regulators a lot of room to interpret the law as they see fit.

Good crypto countries provide clear legal frameworks and regulations so that startups and other crypto firms can operate in full conformity with regulations. This is something that Switzerland has done and it’s the reason why so many crypto firms are based there.

### Which countries hold the most Bitcoins?

When you look at cryptocurrency by country, no nation anywhere in the world has come out with an explicit statement saying that they’re buying Bitcoin and holding it as a reserve asset, similar to gold.

Nonetheless, we know that a few countries around the world are very likely holding at least a small amount of BTC. Unfortunately, none of the countries with the most Bitcoin are on friendly terms with the United States.

We know that the Venezuelan government has some Bitcoin since they accept BTC as a payment for certain government services. It’s unclear how much Bitcoin the country has.

Iran is also probably holding some Bitcoin. The Iranian government has taken over a few Bitcoin mining farms and it seems likely that they’re holding some of the BTC from these operations.  

North Korea almost definitely has some Bitcoin as well. The North Korean government directly sponsors and enables some of the [most successful crypto hackers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/17/north-korea-hack-cryptocurrency-us-charges) in the world, and some or all of those proceeds get funneled back to the government.

China also has some Bitcoin [that they seized](https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-authorities-have-seized-a-massive-4-billion-in-crypto-from-plustoken-scam) from the PlusToken scam operators. It’s unclear whether China will keep that Bitcoin or auction it off.

### Will cryptocurrencies ever take over the world?

Cryptocurrencies will become a normal part of life, just as the internet is part of all our lives now.

In some instances the use case will be explicit, like buying Bitcoin to protect against inflation. In other instances people will use crypto services without even realizing that they’re interfacing with a blockchain.

Smart contracts in particular are going to revolutionize accounting, contract enforcement, international payments and so much more. Once the technology is ready, billions of dollars are going to flow through smart contracts on a daily basis.

While we can say that cryptocurrencies are going to take over the world, it’s still not clear which coins will win in the long run. How many cryptocurrencies exist today? There are several hundred viable projects. So far it seems like Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the big winners, but that can change. Maybe a cryptocurrency that’s not even invented yet ends up dominating the world. Only time will tell.

### How many countries have Bitcoin ATMs?

Dozens of countries have at least one Bitcoin ATM. A cryptocurrency by country list of every place with a Bitcoin ATM is [available here](https://coinatmradar.com/countries/). Presented below are the top 5 countries, measured by the number of Bitcoin ATMs they have.

1. The United States
2. Canada
3. The United Kingdom
4. Austria
5. Spain

# Crypto Countries with their own Currencies

There are a lot of reasons that governments want to create their own Central Bank Digital Currencies.

First, a CBDC would allow the government to send instant payments to its citizens. This system’s advantage must be quite apparent after what happened with the stimulus check debacle in the United States.

It took the US government *months* to send money to everyone using an outdated financial tool. With a CBDC the government could send every American a stimulus payment in just seconds.

Second, a CBDC would enable faster payments all over the country. Whether you’re paying your friend at a bar or buying a car, payments would clear instantly. No more depositing your paycheck and waiting a day for it to clear.

Third, from the perspective of a data-hungry government, CBDCs are a blessing. A government can surveil every transaction that takes place with their digital money. The government can also freeze accounts and even reverse transactions. None of that is possible with cash.

The question today isn’t whether we will or won’t move into a cashless society, but whether people choose to use decentralised cryptocurrencies, or passively accept that centralised cryptocurrencies become the norm.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s electricity consumption / environmental impact is a bad objection, but everyone (not just BTC) needs a solution. [OC; Effort post]","*TL;DR: While the electricity consumption objection is often fallacious, there is a non-fallacious counterpart. We can and should address the environmental impact of activities directly and indirectly caused by Bitcoin. But solutions are not a prerequisite for Bitcoin’s wider adoption, nor should be taken seriously as such – that is a red herring.*

The argument against bitcoin for electricity consumption has fallacious and non-fallacious versions.

Here is a common argument pattern:

* Bitcoin enthusiast says, “Bitcoin solves problems X, Y, and Z for commerce and monetary policy. It should be adopted over other currencies.”
* Non-bitcoiner critic responds, “but Bitcoin uses such an incredible amount of electricity,” *without addressing how well it solves X, Y, or Z or admitting that Bitcoin solves real problems.*

On the face of it, this would be simply raising a *different* problem to solve, Problem E (whether the high electricity consumption problem or the environmental impact problem; I will lump them together as Problem E). We can grant this. Yet even if problem E is one we *can* solve and *should* be solved, it isn’t obvious how this is relevant to BTC. Insofar as it is irrelevant, it tends toward a fallacy in reasoning.

Among the different forms of the Problem E objection, there is a non-fallacious argument form. It brings up how some other viable cryptocurrency competes with BTC, in that it solves all the same monetary problems BTC solves, but *also* reduces or removes problem E while BTC does not (as much). Point taken as far as that goes (and I shall return to this below). However, there are many different fallacious versions as well. One fallacious version suggests that Bitcoin shouldn’t be adopted unless the electricity problem is solved. In other words, a prerequisite to bitcoin adoption is solving the renewable energy conundrum. An even more fallacious version of this objection suggests that *Bitcoin* should solve it or reduce it, by design, lest there is some immoral or irresponsible activity going on with BTC.

First, Bitcoin was not intended to solve Problem E. It is not its stated aim. But insofar as miners recognize this as a problem to be solved *in general*, individuals have a personal responsibility to reduce their own environmental impact where it is reasonable and appropriate to do so. It should be noted that disproportionately, Bitcoin mining relies on more renewable resources than many other currencies. So, if someone suggests that BTC does not solve problem E, that isn’t a failure of BTC or its mining community. It is a concern felt and addressed in part by the same community, even if it does not threaten the viability of their investment. \[The former point is simply analytic and straightforward. But the latter is an empirical question about the commonality practices of miners, and whether BTC miners are environmentally-conscious is contingent. I myself have a very small mining rig and I live just outside Niagara Falls region, where much of the power is generated by renewable power sources, such as the Niagara Power system.\]

The second point: Bitcoin should not be expected to solve problem E. On the one hand, it is not unique to Bitcoin to solve it, since all currencies face this issue. On the other hand, Bitcoin has no special relationship with electricity to generate a special obligation above the other currencies.

In the first case, every economic exchange with a monetary instrument intervening relies on resources to be spent (gold, mining and minting gold coin; greenbacks, printing ink on cotton; debit card, plastics, metals, and electronic infrastructure; etc.). In the modern market, the exchanges are increasingly becoming more and more electronic-based, whether charging a debit card at Target, NFC chips to swipe via Square, or buying on Amazon via PayPal. These all require electricity, and the consumption is very large when taken in aggregate. Rather than considering electricity as a bug or problem, Bitcoin takes this as a cue to creatively reuse the existing electronic infrastructure to solve other problems, as a way of making electronic exchanges more common and enhance their capabilities.

In the second case, Bitcoin’s electrical consumption is essential to its use, and in that sense, it is special in its relationship to electricity. But that does not entail that it inherits a special obligation to reduce its electricity use or promote renewable resources simply on that basis. Instead that would be on the miners, and it is in their interest to mine with efficient technology to reduce electricity waste. Insofar as miners have an interest in finding ways to reduce electricity waste, BTC blockchain remains stable while the environmental impact lessens. And so, if this were a good objection against BTC, then currencies that BTC competes with, including and especially fiat currencies, have just as much of a burden to reduce the byproducts of their use as well – to reduce paper, electricity, water, etc. in printing, washing, distributing, and retrieving greenbacks. In important senses, these resources are even harder to renew without waste than electricity is. Furthermore, BTC’s environmental impact is indirect. It does not contribute to smog; it does not affect the Ozone layer; it has no CO2 output. It is very different from a Hummer or diesel-powered truck. The burden does not belong to BTC in a special way; and if we were consistent in this standard, then the objection loses its particular force. I see no similar calls for eliminating waste in greenbacks, though there are some reforms called for eliminating the copper penny (since it costs more to make than it is worth in use). By analogy, it is clear to me that electric, self-driving cars should be the future of transportation, but it is by no means electric car companies’ responsibility to solve the problem of finding new electrical sources, when it already solves the bigger and more pressing problem of using fossil fuels. Society bears the burden of finding electricity sources as an environmentally-friendly energy, and just as those electric car companies have an interest in making it widely available for refueling, miners have an interest in widely available electronic infrastructure.

The third point: any environmental impact due to electrical consumption is a real problem to be addressed, but this a problem with generating renewable energy, not how it is spent. There are two sides of this. The first side is that there is a general problem with generating energy in creative and sustainable ways. The second side is that we spend electricity on countless other activities that we find valuable even though we know the cost, and if we are consistent in attacking BTC, then we should attack those activities too. The first side is very straightforward, so I won’t spend much time on it: as a society we need to rethink how we acquire electricity. Public fear and ignorance concerning nuclear power prevents us from powering cities and even states with an abundant resource. We are seeing more and more wind farms and watermills, and we need to reduce their negative impacts where we can. But this is a general problem for society to solve, not for Bitcoin in particular. The second side is that we should be consistent with our objection. If the sheer fact that some activity consumes a lot of energy is a major flaw, then we would need to apply this not only to currencies that use electricity (as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.), but also the activities that are not currencies such as watching football or YouTube or porn sites, all of which consume massive amounts of electricity when taken in aggregate. And yet there is no call to take down the NFL or FIFA or YouTube or Pornhub on the bases of their electrical uses, either in the production or distribution or consumption. Yet is Bitcoin mining causing a rise in electrical costs? Or is Bitcoin mining demanding even nearly as much as these others? Is it causing a bottleneck in access to sustainable energy? If Bitcoin mining causes a bottleneck in resources to electricity, then other larger offenders should be addressed first. If wider adoption changes this story, then that would be where the objection is relevant, but it is by no means a bar for entry in the first place.

The fourth point: Bitcoin should be assessed by its merits and demerits compared to its competitors. Bitcoin has two main competition categories – fiat currencies and crypto currencies. For the former, BTC does not do worse. We could expand on all the benefits of BTC over fiat currencies (many of which are inflationary, guided by corrupt government practices, etc.). We could also extol BTC for the practical problems that BTC solves relative to the US dollar as it is used in the current monetary system, such as allowing cheap, verifiable, and anonymous wire transfers (in competition with Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) without the use of a custodial bank account (in competition with JP Morgan-Chase, Wells Fargo, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC, CapitalOne, etc.; as well MasterCard, Visa, American Express, NetSpend, Green Dot, Rushcard, etc.) for which overdrafts are a predatory practice (charging for double-spending with hefty fines) and maintenance/inactivity fees are insult to injury (an account that has little use is penalized by taking away its funds in regular intervals until all funds are gone). BTC is not yet infected by any such nonsense while it gives control back to the owners. Pardon the slight tangent. All of these involve electricity consumption, but BTC does better on these other metrics, and so *ceteris paribus* we have an argument in favor of BTC rather than a single defeater, problem E.

Lastly, the only place where this objection has non-fallacious application is in distinction with other cryptocurrencies. Here we can focus on BTC’s relationship to its competitors in crypto. It is important that Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) design, rather than some other like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I have my own reservations about PoS as a monetary design, but it is clear to me that Cardano, which is PoS, demonstrates that decentralized finance can use significantly less electricity. Some reports are that it can use 99.5% less electricity than its PoW counterparts. Ethereum’s community plans to follow a similar model, to replace its PoW model with PoS, in order to improve efficiency (claiming the same percentage reduction), despite the material harm it will bring to its miners. (I say ‘harm’ in terms of comparative account of harm, where benefit and access to goods are removed or reduced compared to when there is no such intervention.) There are likewise dozens of other cryptocurrencies that were started with PoS by design like Cardano, but unlike Cardano are very early in development or extremely risky as an asset.

Let’s grant all of this. Let’s grant that PoS is more efficient in electricity, and let’s grant that it sufficiently solves problem E with respect to the burden any cryptocurrency might shoulder. The question in part is whether these other cryptocurrencies are as viable for use, unified by a philosophical front, and solve the same problems as BTC intended to solve. In Cardano’s case, there is much to recommend it, but it lacks a unified philosophical position to generate principles down the road and remain future-proof. Ethereum is clearly a viable competitor, given its known practical uses and token-layer benefits (these all speak to its staying power). It will likely win a lot of market share when it eventually moves to PoS in the years to come (I say this tongue-in-cheek, since ETH has scheduled upgrades with repeated delays). But it comes with monetary and philosophical problems (non-deflationary monetary policy, for one) and the aforementioned harms to its own investors (the mining community). Smaller PoS currencies might merit some airtime, but I will remain brief. Moreover, I need not mention other PoW currencies like LiteCoin and Bitcoin Cash (since they have no advantages, or *nearly* no advantages, over BTC).

History as it is, BTC has much wider perceived value and demonstrated use cases across the globe. If this situation is going to change, then two things can happen: 

1. BTC can lose its perceived value in favor of a different currency that is otherwise all-things-considered better than BTC at solving the problems BTC intended to solve. BTC is dominant and is projected to remain so. But this is contingent. Some competition might beat out BTC in some unknown future. If a currency can mimic BTC in design in every regard except being less energy-demanding, BTC would be competing solely based on brand/name recognition. Brand is valuable, but can be dethroned or at least mocked (as happens in commercial chains).
2. BTC can adopt a different model for blockchain verification that is less energy-demanding (e.g., PoS or some other). I hear from many in the community that this is an avenue that will not even be considered. Not only the miners will not allow it, but it also falls within some larger principle for how BTC operates. For that, I am not convinced that BTC must be forever PoW. This is all new technology and a decade of evolutions to tech make some upgrades inevitable when their advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Switching away from PoW might be one of those designs we revise. While it is entirely possible that BTC will remain static in this regard, this would be at the risk of becoming the FORTRAN or Pascal of the cryptocurrency domain. It does not seem to be obvious it needs to be, however.",cryptocurrency

I found two places that made me an offer, one is basically same, the other one offers about 10% higher salary and slightly better and a bit cheaper health insurance ( basically copay is $10 cheaper and deductible is $500 less are the only differences, maybe the doctor network is different but i don't know). I was going to accept the second. When i went to talk to HR about my resignation, they offered me a 20% raise, and transfer to another team with a different manager. Doing the same things i was doing previously, no new responsibilities. At least on paper i am honestly not sure if that'll be the case. 

For what i have heard from coworkers the new manager is a better person than the one i have. But i don't know them personally. I also don't really know how the work life is in the companies that made me the offers besides a few comments on glass door and what i got out of interviewers, which all seem nice. 

The offer seems like a good reason to stay, but this has never happened to me or anyone i know before. A few things concern me. 

Does anyone here have any experience on staying at a company after being offered a raise when attempting to leave?
Did upper management or HR start treating you any different (either worse or better)? Were they more strict or picky on annual evaluations? Did they attempted to push more things onto you because of the raise? Were you let go after a short period of time?",finance
Bitcoin,Best cold storage solution?,"What's the best cold storage vault both for security and convenience? I've been using Coinbase cold storage for a few years now. Not had any issues with deposits or withdrawals, but, I don't like the 48 hour wait time for withdrawals. I don't plan on selling any time soon (talking years here) but just incase something unforeseen happens, I'd like quicker access. For buys I use Coinbase Pro for the better fee structure. I know a lot of Coinbase haters, so if that's you, no need to reply, I know you hate it already ;-)

Looked at Casa but I don't want to use a hardware wallet. Fire, theft, tech malfunction are all things that would keep me awake at night so I'm happy entrusting a custodian's cold storage facility, I just want to know what you use or think is best. Nexo looks interesting with the interest rates, but I don't think it's actually cold storage.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s electricity consumption / environmental impact is a bad objection, but everyone (not just BTC) needs a solution. [OC; Effort post]","*TL;DR: While the electricity consumption objection is often fallacious, there is a non-fallacious counterpart. We can and should address the environmental impact of activities directly and indirectly caused by Bitcoin. But solutions are not a prerequisite for Bitcoin’s wider adoption, nor should be taken seriously as such – that is a red herring. The only non-fallacious version of this objection brings into view a competing crypto that solves all the same problems as BTC, derived from appropriate monetary principles, yet demands less energy.*

The argument against bitcoin for electricity consumption has fallacious and non-fallacious versions.

Here is a common argument pattern:

* Bitcoin enthusiast says, “Bitcoin solves problems X, Y, and Z for commerce and monetary policy. It should be adopted over other currencies.”
* Non-bitcoiner critic responds, “but Bitcoin uses such an incredible amount of electricity,” *without addressing how well it solves X, Y, or Z or admitting that Bitcoin solves real problems.*

On the face of it, this would be simply raising a *different* problem to solve, Problem E (whether the high electricity consumption problem or the environmental impact problem; I will lump them together as Problem E). We can grant this. Yet even if problem E is one we *can* solve and *should* be solved, it isn’t obvious how this is relevant to BTC. Insofar as it is irrelevant, it tends toward a fallacy in reasoning.

Among the different forms of the Problem E objection, there is a non-fallacious argument form.

* It brings up how some other viable cryptocurrency competes with BTC, in that it solves all the same monetary problems BTC solves, but *also* reduces or removes problem E while BTC does not (as much). Point taken as far as that goes (and I shall return to this below).

However, there are many different fallacious versions as well.

* One fallacious version suggests that Bitcoin shouldn’t be adopted unless the electricity problem is solved. In other words, a prerequisite to bitcoin adoption is solving the renewable energy conundrum.
* An even more fallacious version of this objection suggests that *Bitcoin* should solve it or reduce it, by design, lest there is some immoral or irresponsible activity going on with BTC.

First, Bitcoin was not intended to solve Problem E. It is not its stated aim. But insofar as miners recognize this as a problem to be solved *in general*, individuals have a personal responsibility to reduce their own environmental impact where it is reasonable and appropriate to do so. It should be noted that disproportionately, Bitcoin mining relies on more renewable resources than many other currencies. So, if someone suggests that BTC does not solve problem E, that isn’t a failure of BTC or its mining community. It is a concern felt and addressed in part by the same community, even if it does not threaten the viability of their investment. \[The former point is simply analytic and straightforward. But the latter is an empirical question about the commonality practices of miners, and whether BTC miners are environmentally-conscious is contingent. I myself have a very small mining rig and I live just outside Niagara Falls region, where much of the power is generated by renewable power sources, such as the Niagara Power system.\]

The second point: Bitcoin should not be expected to solve problem E. On the one hand, it is not unique to Bitcoin to solve it, since all currencies face this issue. On the other hand, Bitcoin has no special relationship with electricity to generate a special obligation above the other currencies.

In the first case, every economic exchange with a monetary instrument intervening relies on resources to be spent (gold, mining and minting gold coin; greenbacks, printing ink on cotton; debit card, plastics, metals, and electronic infrastructure; etc.). In the modern market, the exchanges are increasingly becoming more and more electronic-based, whether charging a debit card at Target, NFC chips to swipe via Square, or buying on Amazon via PayPal. These all require electricity, and the consumption is very large when taken in aggregate. Rather than considering electricity as a bug or problem, Bitcoin takes this as a cue to creatively reuse the existing electronic infrastructure to solve other problems, as a way of making electronic exchanges more common and enhance their capabilities.

In the second case, Bitcoin’s electrical consumption is essential to its use, and in that sense, it is special in its relationship to electricity. But that does not entail that it inherits a special obligation to reduce its electricity use or promote renewable resources simply on that basis. Instead that would be on the miners, and it is in their interest to mine with efficient technology to reduce electricity waste. Insofar as miners have an interest in finding ways to reduce electricity waste, BTC blockchain remains stable while the environmental impact lessens. And so, if this were a good objection against BTC, then currencies that BTC competes with, including and especially fiat currencies, have just as much of a burden to reduce the byproducts of their use as well – to reduce paper, electricity, water, etc. in printing, washing, distributing, and retrieving greenbacks. In important senses, these resources are even harder to renew without waste than electricity is. Furthermore, BTC’s environmental impact is indirect. It does not contribute to smog; it does not affect the Ozone layer; it has no CO2 output. It is very different from a Hummer or diesel-powered truck. The burden does not belong to BTC in a special way; and if we were consistent in this standard, then the objection loses its particular force. I see no similar calls for eliminating waste in greenbacks, though there are some reforms called for eliminating the copper penny (since it costs more to make than it is worth in use). By analogy, it is clear to me that electric, self-driving cars should be the future of transportation, but it is by no means electric car companies’ responsibility to solve the problem of finding new electrical sources, when it already solves the bigger and more pressing problem of using fossil fuels. Society bears the burden of finding electricity sources as an environmentally-friendly energy, and just as those electric car companies have an interest in making it widely available for refueling, miners have an interest in widely available electronic infrastructure.

The third point: any environmental impact due to electrical consumption is a real problem to be addressed, but this a problem with generating renewable energy, not how it is spent. There are two sides of this. The first side is that there is a general problem with generating energy in creative and sustainable ways. The second side is that we spend electricity on countless other activities that we find valuable even though we know the cost, and if we are consistent in attacking BTC, then we should attack those activities too. The first side is very straightforward, so I won’t spend much time on it: as a society we need to rethink how we acquire electricity. Public fear and ignorance concerning nuclear power prevents us from powering cities and even states with an abundant resource. We are seeing more and more wind farms and watermills, and we need to reduce their negative impacts where we can. But this is a general problem for society to solve, not for Bitcoin in particular. The second side is that we should be consistent with our objection. If the sheer fact that some activity consumes a lot of energy is a major flaw, then we would need to apply this not only to currencies that use electricity (as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.), but also the activities that are not currencies such as watching football or YouTube or porn sites, all of which consume massive amounts of electricity when taken in aggregate. And yet there is no call to take down the NFL or FIFA or YouTube or P0rnhub on the bases of their electrical uses, either in the production or distribution or consumption. Yet is Bitcoin mining causing a rise in electrical costs? Or is Bitcoin mining demanding even nearly as much as these others? Is it causing a bottleneck in access to sustainable energy? If Bitcoin mining causes a bottleneck in resources to electricity, then other larger offenders should be addressed first. If wider adoption changes this story, then that would be where the objection is relevant, but it is by no means a bar for entry in the first place.

The fourth point: Bitcoin should be assessed by its merits and demerits compared to its competitors. Bitcoin has two main competition categories – fiat currencies and crypto currencies. For the former, BTC does not do worse. We could expand on all the benefits of BTC over fiat currencies (many of which are inflationary, guided by corrupt government practices, etc.). We could also extol BTC for the practical problems that BTC solves relative to the US dollar as it is used in the current monetary system, such as allowing cheap, verifiable, and anonymous wire transfers (in competition with Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) without the use of a custodial bank account (in competition with JP Morgan-Chase, Wells Fargo, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC, CapitalOne, etc.; as well MasterCard, Visa, American Express, NetSpend, Green Dot, Rushcard, etc.) for which overdrafts are a predatory practice (charging for double-spending with hefty fines) and maintenance/inactivity fees are insult to injury (an account that has little use is penalized by taking away its funds in regular intervals until all funds are gone). BTC is not yet infected by any such nonsense while it gives control back to the owners. Pardon the slight tangent. All of these involve electricity consumption, but BTC does better on these other metrics, and so *ceteris paribus* we have an argument in favor of BTC rather than a single defeater, problem E.

Lastly, the only place where this objection has non-fallacious application is in distinction with other cryptocurrencies. Here we can focus on BTC’s relationship to its competitors in crypto. It is important that Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) design, rather than some other like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I have my own reservations about PoS as a monetary design, but it is clear to me that C@rdano, which is PoS, demonstrates that decentralized finance can use significantly less electricity. Some reports are that it can use 99.5% less electricity than its PoW counterparts. muerehtE’s community plans to follow a similar model, to replace its PoW model with PoS, in order to improve efficiency (claiming the same percentage reduction), despite the material harm it will bring to its miners. (I say ‘harm’ in terms of comparative account of harm, where benefit and access to goods are removed or reduced compared to when there is no such intervention.) There are likewise dozens of other cryptocurrencies that were started with PoS by design like C@rdano, but unlike C@rdano are very early in development or extremely risky as an asset.

Let’s grant all of this. Let’s grant that PoS is more efficient in electricity, and let’s grant that it sufficiently solves problem E with respect to the burden any cryptocurrency might shoulder. The question in part is whether these other cryptocurrencies are as viable for use, unified by a philosophical front, and solve the same problems as BTC intended to solve. In C@rdano’s case, there is much to recommend it, but it lacks a unified philosophical position to generate principles down the road and remain future-proof. muerehtE is clearly a viable competitor, given its known practical uses and token-layer benefits (these all speak to its staying power). It will likely win a lot of market share when it eventually moves to PoS in the years to come (I say this tongue-in-cheek, since muerehtE has scheduled upgrades with repeated delays). But it comes with monetary and philosophical problems (non-deflationary monetary policy, for one) and the aforementioned harms to its own investors (the mining community). Smaller PoS currencies might merit some airtime, but I will remain brief. Moreover, I need not mention other PoW currencies like L!teCoin and Bitco!n Cash (since they have no advantages, or *nearly* no advantages, over BTC).

History as it is, BTC has much wider perceived value and demonstrated use cases across the globe. If this situation is going to change, then two things can happen:

1. BTC can lose its perceived value in favor of a different currency that is otherwise all-things-considered better than BTC at solving the problems BTC intended to solve. BTC is dominant and is projected to remain so. But this is contingent. Some competition might beat out BTC in some unknown future. If a currency can mimic BTC in design in every regard except being less energy-demanding, BTC would be competing solely based on brand/name recognition. Brand is valuable, but can be dethroned or at least mocked (as happens in commercial chains).
2. BTC can adopt a different model for blockchain verification that is less energy-demanding (e.g., PoS or some other). I hear from many in the community that this is an avenue that will not even be considered. Not only the miners will not allow it, but it also falls within some larger principle for how BTC operates. For that, I am not convinced that BTC must be forever PoW. This is all new technology and a decade of evolutions to tech make some upgrades inevitable when their advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Switching away from PoW might be one of those designs we revise. While it is entirely possible that BTC will remain static in this regard, this would be at the risk of becoming the FORTRAN or Pascal of the cryptocurrency domain. It does not seem to be obvious it needs to be, however.

In conclusion, Bitcoin needs to reckon with this objection insofar as competing currencies might outperform Bitcoin. That is the only way the objection sticks. Even so, electricity efficiency is still important, as is access to renewable energy. It's just not Bitcoin's problem to solve. Renderings of the objection (that suppose otherwise) fail to threaten BTC, except by bad faith rhetoric that damages brand/name recognition. Those appeals commit fallacies of relevance, and Bitcoin can and should remain unscathed.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"In defense of ""deflationary"" money","The idea that you need some price inflation to “encourage spending” and “stimulate the economy” is the propaganda being put out by the parasitic class that’s perpetuating and profiting from this MASSIVE scam. The truth is that you don't need to “encourage” people to spend money. Spending money is all that it's ultimately good for. So it's always a question of how you choose to allocate that spending across time, how much to spend today vs. tomorrow vs. next year, etc. Also consider that when you save money, you are in effect making a general investment in the overall economy. Money isn't wealth. Instead, it allows you to make a *claim* on scarce, real resources. Money is an accounting system for facilitating the exchange of those resources by serving as a credible record of value given but not yet received. When you ""just sit on money,"" the resources that you *could have* claimed immediately will instead remain available to be used by others -- whether for immediate consumption or investment. You have in effect *loaned* those real resources to the rest of society. So if we had a system with a fixed money supply, it makes sense that the purchasing power of that money should increase over time as the economy grows. In that scenario, the rate of price deflation is essentially the market-determined ""interest rate"" on a very low-risk loan that can be recalled at any time (by spending the money).

Or think about it from the opposite angle -- why an inflationary money supply doesn't make sense. Again, money is supposed to represent a credible signal of value given but not yet received. If there's an entity that can simply print new money into existence at essentially zero cost, the message carried by that new money is going to be a false one. I’m sure you can intuitively grasp how an ordinary counterfeiter is in effect stealing from others when he prints up phony hundred-dollar bills in his basement. Well the same is true of the more sophisticated counterfeiters in fancy suits who call their counterfeiting things like “open-market operations” and “quantitative easing.”",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,401K Loan or Personal/Used Car Loan?,"I'm seeking advice on whether to take a loan out on my 401k, or accept a personal/used car loan. I wanted to get a sense of whether my monthly payment/APR for a loan would be more or less than any taxes/fees associated with a 401k withdrawal, but I still don't feel experienced enough to make an educated decision. Any help or input would be greatly appreciated!

A bit about me:

* Moving this fall and actively applying for apartments (good credit score rating required)
* Considering purchasing a used 2016 Acura RDX for $13,500 (I do not currently have a car)
* Monthly income: $8,954 (gross) 
* Assets: $5,530
* CC Debt: $11,000
* Student Loans: $72,000
* Credit Score: 709

I recently changed jobs and am in the process of rolling over previous funds to my new plan:

* $4,184.22 (Roth) + $17,291.27 (Traditional) = $21,475.49

I was approved for a Private Party Auto Loan through LightStream with the following terms (I haven't accepted):

* Loan Amount: $15,000.00
* Loan Term: 36 months
* Interest Rate/APR: 7.79%
* Monthly Payment: $468.59
* Payment method: AutoPay

I'm also considering a 401k Loan. I spoke to a representative today who shared these terms:

* Loan Amount: not to exceed 50% of total ( &gt; $10,737)
* Loan Terms: borrower to choose between 1-5 years
* Interest Rate/APR: ""prime rate"" + 1% (she quoted this would be about 4-5%)
* Monthly Payment: automatic deduction each pay period
   * for ex. take out $10k to pay back in 1 year: $10,000 (loan amount) / 24 (pay periods) = $416/mo (or $208/check)
   * monthly payments are not eligible for match (4%) or essentially separate from future contributions

I started to weight out the positives and negatives:

* LightStream +/-
   * \- higher interest/monthly payment
   * \+ could help build credit
* 401K loan +/-
   * \- concerns about future security (inevitable unexpected expenses/not being able to contribute meaningfully or effectively to new plan 401k, etc.)
   * \+ lower interest/monthly payment
   * \+ paying myself back instead of third party",finance

stocks,Workiva $WK is an overlooked company with little competition in a niche market.,"Hi everyone - long time lurker but first time posting here cause I want to share with you my take on Workiva ($WK) both from an investor standpoint and someone who currently uses the software for my company's reporting needs.  I'll split this post up into 2 parts with Part 1 being the information about the company, recent earnings, etc. (i.e. a regular DD post) and Part 2 being my experience using this software.  TL;DR at the bottom.

**Part 1 -** Stock price as of typing this is $97.34

Workiva is the end-to-end platform that allows you to integrate financial data, nonfinancial data, and XBRL® tagging. Collect, assemble, and report with the same technology used by more than 3,700 organizations across 180+ countries.  Workiva is essentially specializes in handling companies different reporting, filing, audit, and/or general accounting needs (private, public, regulatory/environmental etc.).  They have a cloud based platform called WDesk that is used to centralize all of the companies financial data and funnel it into their financial statements, reports, footnotes, and other schedules automatically.  A lot of the use case for their platform comes from a companies reporting needs (10-Q/10-K) but other organizations use their platform (including my own) for internal management reporting, budget tracking, financial data analysis, automatic schedule reconciliations etc.

Here is a snapshot from their Q1 2021 10-Q.

* Increased Q1 2021 Subscription &amp; Support Revenue by 24.2% over Q1 2020
* Generated Total Q1 2021 Revenue of $104.2 Million, up 21.5% over Q1 2020
* Achieved 48% YOY Growth of Customers with Annual Contract Value Over $150K
* Expands Total Addressable Market with Launch of ESG Solution
* Raises Full-Year 2021 Revenue Guidance

Workiva also touts an impressive 95% revenue retention rate amongst existing subscribers and a roughly 6% YoY increase in subscribers in 2020.  With the low subscriber churn, subscriber growth, and low operating cost of the WDesk platform this generates great earnings growth each quarter.  Workiva also provides on-demand customer support for all subscribers for any and all questions (used it myself, they're actually great people).  Workiva generates consistent operating cash flow each quarter and is reinvesting it into growing their subscriber base, expanding the WDesk platform, and breaking into new markets.  This is a company with a clear vision and goal in mind and they have been consistently delivering.

**Part 2**

My Background - I'm a former Big 4 auditor that moved into a startup Natural Gas company exactly 1 year ago to transition into a Senior Accountant of Financial Reporting job title.  I have about 4 years experience in auditing both public and private companies and now 1 year with a speciality in FRP.

When I transitioned to my new company the first day they introduced me to this platform that I never heard of called ""WDesk"" that they used for their Quarterly and Annual financial statements.  I thought learning this new software would be tricky but it is honestly one of the most user friendly platforms I have ever used in my short career.  It is basically an excel file online that can link numbers&amp;text straight to a document for reporting.  So if you alter a number in the excel file on WDesk - the financial statements are automatically updated via the link.  When I started we essentially would download our financial data from our GL and key in the financial data manually to the excel file and then boom your report is populated.  Pretty nifty eh?

Well a lot has changed over the year that i've been here.  With the help of the Workiva team on customer support I have basically automated our entire reporting process (still room to go) so that all you need to do is download a BS or IS from the GL and import it into WDesk and all of the fields automatically populate with the correct financial information.  We started only using this for our quarterly and annual reports but now we take it a step further and use it for monthly budget vs. actual reports, monthly/quarterly management reports, monthly account reconciliations you name it.  Everything is quick and easy with this WDesk platform and it actually cut down our reporting process by a full 4 days (Which doesn't seem like a lot but that is a massive time/money save).  We are continuing to expand our WDesk capabilities everyday and as i'm speaking to you now I am currently working on building out new monthly reports.  Anytime I have a question, we have a dedicated Workiva rep that is familiar with our portfolio that assists us with any need.

Furthermore, Workiva has a function built into SAP called ""WData"" that allows companies to skip a step in downloading the financial data from the GL.  Instead, you just sync your GL with WDesk and all of the financial information you need for any specific period will automatically be populated into your spreadsheets and financial statements.  We don't use this yet since we actually just transferred to SAP from Netsuite but this will be coming down the pipeline for us.  Additionally, since we are a LNG company we also are beginning to report to the Federal Environmental Regulatory Agency (FERC) which is a whole new ball game in terms of what financial data needs to be reported, when, what format, document structure etc.  Well fuck me gentleman WDesk built out a specific platform for reporting to this specific regulatory agency and we're expanding our subscription to meet that need.  I can truely see first hand how Workiva is investing in their product and expanding the capabilities and its only been a year.

As an investor, the growth potential and management vision seems extremely promising.  They have partnered with 3/4 of the Big 4 and work with something like 70% of the top fortune 500 companies.  The Company continues to invest in their product and expand their reach in this niche market in an attempt to grab a large market share of this industry.

As a user, I absolutely love this platform.  It makes my job so easy, makes me look good, and gives me time during work to write this lmao.  My major client in my auditing days would key in everything manually every time the books were closed or their was an update which would take days.  With WDesk this takes minutes.  The platform is extremely user friendly allowing for companies to easily adopt this platform with little disruption in the day to day.  

TL;DR - Workiva is a fast growing business in a niche industry of financial reporting/accounting.  They have consistent increases in their EPS, CF, subscribers, and revenue each quarter and reinvest profits into their business model which, as a user myself, I see first hand and it makes my job so much easier.

stocks,Investing in psychedelics: a revolution in psychiatric medicine and mental healthcare,"I have for you folks today a closer look at an entirely overlooked sector on the verge of breakout. These medicines possess the potential to address a \~$100 billion mental health treatment  market,   including treatment of previously incurable disorders such as  cluster   headaches, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Traumatic Brain Injuries. How many people do you know suffer  from anxiety,   depression, and addiction? How many people do you know  who are addicted   to opiates, or popping SSRI's and benzos like candy  to deal with their   problems? There is a better way.

Anyone    who has used psychedelic substances knows of their potential.    Personally, I attribute Psilocybin with helping me to end 5 years of    poly drug abuse in 2009 after a single trip. I've been 99.9% sober for    the past 12 years. Sitting to my left is my beautiful newborn daughter    Aurora, something that I previously would have never thought possible.    Meanwhile nearly 20 of my classmates and friends are dead in the wake  of   the opioid epidemic.

Underground medical psychedelic use is exploding in popularity. Look at communities such as [r/microdosing](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/) which have sustained steady growth ([https://subredditstats.com/r/microdosing](https://subredditstats.com/r/microdosing)) and interest in the past few  years.   More studies need to be completed on microdosing in particular,  but  the  anecdotal results look promising.

I    see people comparing this industry to Cannabis, which I don't believe is accurate. The majority of the Cannabis industry is focused on    recreational use, and Cannabis is a single plant, albeit with many    active compounds. Psychedelic medicine encompasses far more molecules,    which are objectively more powerful psychoactives, and have far greater potential for medical application.

These    stocks have been battered like most growth stocks have. But in my    opinion they represent the biggest investment opportunity of this entire    generation. Not just potential for insane returns, but also the potential    to revolutionize psychiatric medicine and how we approach mental  health   as a society. These molecules have incredible characteristics  as   empathogens (empathy promoting), promoting neural plasticity ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6149016/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6149016/)) and even promoting neurogenesis (regrowth of neurons in the brain ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082376/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082376/))).

Not    only is the science elucidating innumerable anecdotal reports of their benefits,   the sector is looking at upcoming major catalysts as more and more  positive   mainstream media press rolls in, and decriminalization  efforts sweep the   nation unbeknownst to many.

* ATAI,    the world's largest psychedelics company by market cap, is set to IPO    imminently. When Compass Pathways, the 2nd largest psychedelics  company   IPO'd last year, the sector rallied tremendously in tandem.
* MAPS'    Phase III clinical trial using MDMA to treat PTSD will likely achieve    FDA approval by 2023 at the latest, and will be available to be    implemented at existing psychedelic clinic infrastructure. Their    previous Phase III trial was published in the prestigious Nature    Medicine medical journal and showed astounding results, permanently    curing 68% of the non-placebo group of their official PTSD diagnoses: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3)
* Compass    Pathways is currently running the world's largest study on Psilocybin    to date, in a Phase IIa trial for treatment resistant depression.    Results are expected before the end of 2021. It's basically a near given    that these treatments are both safe and effective (See below  studies).   Imagine knowing a clinical trial's outcome before it's even    completed...that's what we have here.
* Meanwhile, independent studies are already proving Psilocybin's efficacy for treating depression: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/219413/magic-mushroom-compound-performs-well-antidepressant/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/219413/magic-mushroom-compound-performs-well-antidepressant/)
* [https://microdose.buzz/new-hopkins-study-finds-psilocybin-4x-more-effective-than-ssri/](https://microdose.buzz/new-hopkins-study-finds-psilocybin-4x-more-effective-than-ssri/)
* Clinics    are already producing revenue via legal Ketamine therapy. How many    people do you know that are aware of this? Some which I can't name are    even producing significant revenue. These companies are building the    infrastructure now that will deliver legal MDMA and Psilocybin therapy.    And they will be doing it before people even realize it's happening,  as   with Ketamine.
* Many    psychedelic reform bills are garnering bipartisan support.   Specifically  MAPS' MDMA for PTSD treatment because it has massive   support coming  from veterans with PTSD. Republicans and Democrats alike   agree on  reducing suffering for veterans. Foundations like VETS ([https://vetsolutions.org/work/](https://vetsolutions.org/work/)) are pushing HARD for this.
* Many    of these companies have been recently financed and are sitting    comfortably on millions of dollars in cash positions. They will be able    to weather a financial downturn. And if inflation proves transitory  and   interest rates continue to remain low, growth stocks will once  again  see  massive tailwinds.

Ultimately,    science is proving what underground users already know: psychedelic    medicine is safe and effective and more often than not it works with    miraculous results. Pitch me a more noble and simultaneously lucrative    cause than this. I believe so strongly in the future of psychedelic    medicine that I'm pretty much all-in on a diversified basket of these    companies. Investing in psychedelics now will get you a front row seat    to the festivities as decriminalization efforts sweep the nation and  the   world, and research results continue to be massively positive.    Meanwhile investors are sleeping on this industry.

Love you all. Good luck and godspeed.",finance

Bitcoin,"New to reddit, Thoughts on El Salvador","Greetings All,

Very new here. I understand that I will be berated as spreading FUD. I promise I am not. I have been active in crypto for years, and truly got involved because I believe in the cypherpunk movement. (But, I am so annoyed with the hypocritical notes of retail investors who speak simultaneously of social impact and moon. With that let's get started.)  Edit: The sentence in parenthesis is important. If thats not you, then all good)

El Salvador ""dollarized"" in 2001. The goal of switching to another currency is to reduce inflation and increase FDI.  The impacts of ""dollarization"" were lackluster in El Salvador because : 1. Inflation was never a problem, 2. No FDI because of a failed education system and crime!

BTC as a legal tender in effect support similar goals, with one exception.  An appreciation in the price of BTC/USD will certainly have some benefits as it will increase reserves. At least until every other currency becomes useless and we are using a BTC standard then they will have BTC relative to other countries. Some who could afford to still purchase more btc than El salvador at cheaper prices. Resulting in a small transfer of wealth. But, I digress. In order for BTC to be truly impactful, it must bring in new investments.

So I ask very seriously, how many of you truly believe in the vision of a decentralized equitable world? If you do, you wont just go to El Salvador for a tourist vacation. You will relocate there, open a business, put your children in their school system, deal with the high homicide rates, invest in local entrepreneurs, buy El salvadorian products.

A new currency is important, its not a panacea. El Salvador faces so much corruption. Changing its money won't prevent the corruption unless the citizens finally rebelle.  El Salvador doesnt have the power of monetary policy already, BTC isnt freeing the citizens from that.  BTC is putting monetary policy of a country in the hands of whales to move the market at their will(if citizens actually convert. Few will).

No doubt, in a decade it is possible that BTC is stable, but for now it seems like we are celebrating the adoption of one type of tyrant for another. At least the USD is somewhat stable with stable inflation.  

I do hope for a decentralized future, one where we collectively care about the impact our decisions make on others.  Right now, there are too many moon boys and whales with little regard for their consequences.

In truth El Salvador and its citizens will not massively adopt BTC anytime soon. Their stable economy as a result of slow adoption should not be taken as a success of BTC.

A year of BTC tourism that increases tourism gdp for a year also shouldnt be celebrated.    

This post is not FUD. Its a hope that more people will look at crypto outside of their vacuum.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Cash out refinance even if I don't need the cash?,"I have been considering refinancing my mortgage again recently. My current interest rate is at 3.875% with a remaining balance of just over 73k. The current home estimate (according to real estate sites) is around 208k. My lender keeps sending me offers to refinance the loan at a lower rate, but when I spoke with them, the only way to get the lower rate, which at the time was 2.8%, they want me to do a cash out refinance. I am fortunate enough to not have any debt aside from my mortgage so I don’t need the cash for anything. If I went the cash out route and attained the lower interest rate, what would be the negative side of just injecting the cash back into my mortgage? 

Example: if my lender required me to take 30k cash out to get the lower interest rate, that would bring my mortgage up to 103k. If I gave the 30k back immediately, that would put me back at 73k at the lower interest rate. What I would also have to factor in is the closing costs and cost of appraisal. If that is going to add a few thousand to my mortgage, I don’t know if it is even worth refinancing.",finance

CryptoCurrency,How the FBI persuaded a worldwide criminal network to adopt ANOM and seize $148 MILLION in Cryptocurrencies?,"#Operation Trojan Shield

In 2018 the FBI arrests the head of a company called ‘Phantom Secure’ which sold “hardened encrypted devices” exclusively to criminal organisations. 

Vincent Ramos is sentenced to nine years in prison for a drug related crime. 

The FBI recruits a ‘Confidential Human Source (CHS)’ who seeks reduction in charges he was already facing and offers to develop the ‘next generation’ of encrypted communication devices, ANOM, for use in investigations.

Who then distributes to transnational criminal organisations.

Australian Federal Police joins as one of the international partners to monitor communications, and becomes a key testing ground with an initial offer of 50 devices in the country at the end of 2018.

Uptake grows based on word of mouth and reaches some 11,800 devices, with an estimated 9000 active users worldwide to more than 100 countries.

With the help of Europol, the FBI identified ""over 300 distinct TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] using Anom, including Italian organized crime, Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, and various international narcotics source, transportation, and distribution cells.

Anom devices, which were touted as being able to send secure, encrypted messages in a closed digital environment, along with the promise that their data would be wiped remotely if they fell into the hands of police.

June 2021 More than 800 suspects were arrested and more than 32 tons of drugs — cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and methamphetamines were seized along with 250 firearms, 55 luxury cars and more than $148 million in cash and cryptocurrencies. (Other reports claim only $48 million worth of cryptocurrency was seized). 

### I can find no more information about the seizure of cryptocurrencies. Any information appreciated.

business,DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM! I was scammed $10k by @ecomdelrio AKA Anthony Del Rio with Fake Amazon Automation Service! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Hey Reddit. Just so you are aware, I'm from Illinois and the person who scammed me is from California. I’m writing this message because I have unfortunately been scammed $10k from a Amazon Drop Shipping Guru by the name of Anthony Del Rio. I originally met him on Instagram which is @ecomdelrio. He was advertising his course to teach people how to dropship on Amazon as a third party seller. I was interested in what he was doing for a living and decided to buy his course called ""Steady Ecom LLC"" for a total of $997 back on July 21st, 2020.

Shortly after I completed his course, we continued to speak to each other and Anthony eventually gave me his personal phone number. At some point in early August of 2020, he promoted a service on his Instagram page called “Amazon Automation.” His Amazon Automation program he was selling was where Anthony Del Rio and his team would run my Amazon store for me for 1 year for $20k. I saw him promoting this service and I was intrigued by it. So I decided to text him and tell him that I’m going to be going through with purchasing his Amazon Automation program.

I had a very big video game collection, and I sold 90% of it to fund this guy for his Amazon Automation service. Eventually in September of 2020, we agreed to start my Amazon store at $10k so that Anthony could run my store for me. The reason why we agreed to do $10k, was because my video game collection wouldn’t reach the full $20k. So from early August to late October 2020, I worked non-stop selling my games on eBay to be able to pay him. I never wanted to sell my games, but I didn’t think I was going to get scammed by him because there isn’t fraudulent activity allowed on the website which hosted his course. I was hoping to make some money with him and eventually buy my games back in the future. 

So fast forward to October 24th, 2020. I sold 90% of my games and have finished paying this guy the $10k. I paid him in bits and pieces from August to October 2020 to reach the $10k. I used Cashapp, Venmo, and Zelle to pay him. So fast forward again to January 24th, 2021. It has marked 3 months since I last paid him, and Anthony still hasn’t helped me with anything in regards to my Amazon store. Over this 3 month period, he said on several occasions that I should have sales on my store on so and so date. Once that date came about, still no sales whatsoever on my store. I gave him my store login information and my credit card information, so he had full access to my Amazon store. 

I decided to be patient with him over this 3 month period and give him a chance to do what he was paid $10k to do. On January 24th, 2021, I requested that Anthony return my money to me. I expressed my frustration with him for not doing what he was paid $10k to do, and that was to run my store for 1 year with the Amazon Automation program he promoted. As of now on March 31st 2021, he has refunded me $1k, but he still owes me $9k. He is being very reluctant and is refusing to return anymore of my money to me. 

We have filed a police report on him on February 2nd, 2021. We have also reported him to the FBI, Federal Trade Commission, and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office. If he won’t send my money back to me, we will be filing a lawsuit against him. The amount of stress and pain he has caused to me and my family is overwhelming over the last couple months. As of a couple days ago, he has also blocked me from viewing the course information that I payed $997 for with no refund. He is nothing but a huge fraud and he has stolen $10k from me, which is highly illegal and can very well be considered a felony if convicted. He is a very irresponsible and untrustworthy person who won’t take responsibility for his actions. He is even trying to flip the story around like I’m the one at fault. It’s ridiculous. 

So my question here for Reddit. What are your opinions on my situation? He even stated himself before that it is fully refundable if I didn't make any money.

PLEASE BEWARE OF @ECOMDELRIO ON INSTAGRAM AKA ANTHONY DEL RIO! DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN A SINGLE DOLLAR IF YOU EVER STUMBLE ACROSS HIM!

He then went on to retweet a list of Latin American leaders backing crypto (inc. El Salvador, Paraguay, Panama, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia), and a statement from Anthony Pompliano declaring that ""Bitcoin is inevitable"".

Option 1: Buy apartment

Apartment cost: 500k

Downpayment: 100k

Estimated Monthly payment: 2600 (over 3 years I would be spending 93600)HOA fees would be 500/month (INCLUDED in estimated monthly 2600)Closing fees: assuming 6% of the apartment cost? 30000.

Take out loans for grad school (costing 150k over 3 years):Direct Unsubsidized Loan:Total borrowed: $615004.30% interest rateGraduate Plus Loan:Total borrowed: $885005.30% interest rate

Then in 3 years I would have spent 93600 towards interest and paying off the apartment. Idea: sell the apartment (assuming that the apartment/condo price will be stable or go up a little) and pay off a chunk of the borrowed loans?

Option 2: Rent apartment

Monthly rent: 2000 (over 3 years I would be spending about 72000 as rent)

Instead of taking out loans for grad school, I can pay out of pocket and take out what loans I need. Hypothetically, I'll say I'll pay half out of pocket and take out half as loans.

Take out some loans for grad school:Direct Unsubsidized Loan:Total borrowed: $615004.30% interest rateGraduate Plus Loan:Total borrowed: $135005.30% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if I go with Option 1, I can save the monthly rent and later sell the apartment and use it towards my loans? Would this be a better option than to spend 72000 on rent and pay for grad school out of pocket?

worldpolitics,Energy problems of the USA and Europe,"The Russian Federation is one of the richest countries in natural resources, and especially in hydrocarbons. It is also the largest supplier of oil and gas to many countries. Naturally, Washington does not like this arrangement, because Americans want to get the profits in their pockets, and not give them into the hands of another country, let alone Russia. And for the sake of this, the U.S. imposes sanctions, trying to put pressure on the political leadership of other countries to stop buying Russian hydrocarbons. For example, not so long ago one could observe a concentrated ""dancing with tambourine"" of the American side around the construction of ""Nord Stream-2"".   
The companies involved in the construction on the Russian side were put on the U.S. sanctions list. Therefore, European contractors stopped construction, and a number of companies that provided technical certification and insurance services were also on the sanctions list. The U.S. administration made an exception only for Germany, as it is trying to improve relations with it and restore its position. However, it is not giving up its claims and accusations against Russia, but is only trying to soften its policy to the German side. After all, the Nord Stream-2 project overrides U.S. plans to sell Europe its own liquefied natural gas. Separately, it is worth noting that all work related to the transportation of U.S. LNG becomes a problem for the purchasing countries. U.S. companies are more likely to sell liquefaction services than the gas itself. In addition, the U.S. LNG is currently quite expensive on the energy market, and analysts predict a further rise in its price.   
A number of major European companies have already refused to supply gas from the United States. Yes, they will pay the amounts specified in the contracts, but they are not going to unload the plants and ship it across the ocean. Even having paid for the contract but having bought gas from Russia, these companies will be better off than if they had transported it from the USA, because Russian LNG is one of the cheapest in the world energy market. We can only sympathize with those companies and those countries that will continue to buy LNG from the USA and transport it to them to the detriment of their own economy, but for the sake of political ambitions.",energy

I currently have no other debts other than above, and carry $0 Credit Card balances.

I have had credit since I was 19 years old. 

I have 4 credit cards. 

Total Credit Limit: $32k

I plan on buying a house around $260-$290k and will put down \~10%-12% in May. 

My dad was telling me that he could add me as an Authorized User on his credit card with PenFed. It has a $50k limit on it and he has had it for about \~4-5 years. **Will this be worth it and will it show on my credit? Will this help the total credit limit on my credit buraus?**

I have been at my job for 4.5 years and I have a base pay of $36k a year. I make about $60k a year in commissions. I think when working commissions, mortgage lenders use your last two years W2 averaged. Since I will be starting a new job and field of work I will have less income and job security to show for. I currently work in high end exotic car sales but have a potential job offer in the HealthCare Field. I believe starting a new job 8-11 months before applying for a mortgage is not the smartest idea.   Am I incorrect or right?

When inflation is high, prices for goods/services rise. Purchasing power per unit of currency decreases. 

Historically, M2 has grown along with the economy (see in the link). However, it has also grown along with Federal Debt to GDP during wars and recessions. 

In most recent history, M2 growth surpassed 10 percent in the crisis of 2001 and 2009, during which an expansionary monetary policy was deployed by the central bank.

In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.

stocks,Optimal Decision Making and Exit Planning,"Before I begin, I must give major credit to Daniel Kahneman. Much of the thoughts and procedures I'm going to lay out in this post is because I read his wonderful books, ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" and ""Noise.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am here to propose a procedure to make optimal stock selling decisions by eliminating common things that cause error in judgement. Part 1 of this post will be describing the common errors. Part 2 will discuss weaknesses in current methods. Part 3 will be my new proposed method.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 1: WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISTAKES?

MISTAKE 1: Making decisions out of ignorance. This one is obvious, you should not invest or bet on companies that you do not have a good understanding of. It's fine to come to Reddit to see what companies other people think are good, but you should always follow this up with your own due diligeance.

&amp;#x200B;

MISTAKE 2: Making decisions without addressing your bias. Everyone has bias, and when you own a stock you will certainly have a bias in favor of the stock. There are some reasons you might have bias against a stock such as disliking a person who owns the stock or the way a CEO speaks. Either way positive or negative bias needs to be addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

MISTAKE 3: Making decisions without addressing noise. Noise is all around us and affects us at every moment. Federal Judges give harsher sentences when the weather is hot. Students have different levels of focus in the morning vs right after lunch. You make different decisions based on how well you slept the night before or what kind of mood you are in. Even the music playing in the background has been shown to have significant effects on decision making! An optimal strategy needs to adjust for the noise in your life.

&amp;#x200B;

MISTAKE 4: Making fast decisions on emotion. Kahneman explained in ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" we all have 2 brains, the fast reactionary brain and the slow logical brain. The reactionary brain is great in an emergency reaction like moving your hand from the fire or running away from a dangerous person with a gun, but making a calculated financial decision should be left to the slow logical thinking brain.

&amp;#x200B;

MISTAKE 5: Not making a decision and leaving it up to chance or letting others make the decision for you. If you believe that you are not smart enough to make decisions on investing in stocks, then it is perfectly fine to invest in SP500 and let it sit until you retire. However, if you believe that you are smart enough to make decisions of buying and selling stocks other then indexes, then it makes no sense to make full decisions on the buying side and letting chance decide when to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2: WHAT IS WRONG WITH COMMON METHODS?

If you don't have a good idea of the current common exit strategies, you can read about them here: [https://www.investopedia.com/investing/understanding-exit-strategies/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/understanding-exit-strategies/)

&amp;#x200B;

Common Method 1: STOP LOSS ORDER

&amp;#x200B;

Stop loss order is the worst exit strategy. If a stock is trading at say $10, and you have a stop loss of $8-$9, then you should just sell it at $10! Stop loss order will never be optimal because it is, at every moment in time, less optimal than the simple, ""sell everything now."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Common Method 2: TRAILING STOP LOSS

This method is better than the simple stop loss. The goal of this strategy is not to time the very peak of a stock. That's impossible, but rather to sell just a little after the stock has reached its peak. Here are the problems: look at any stock in the real world that has had a bullish run or a sky rocketing increase. In the middle of the run, I guarentee you will find a moment where the stock dropped 5% for a few minutes at least.

&amp;#x200B;

Big money knows that stop losses are out there and very frequently go Stop Loss Hunting.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stophunting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stophunting.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

Common Method 3: TECHNICAL INDICATORS

Selling based on Technical Indicators are generally a take-proft exit strategy which is good, but there are two problems with trading on technical indicators. 

One: technical indicators are well known and established, and because of this, can be manipulated. 

Two: technical indicators are for short term trades. No one does technical indicators for a 5 year projection. 

&amp;#x200B;

All short term trades are taxed at the same rate as income tax instead of the better Long Term Capital Gains tax rate (this is assuming you are in the USA). This can result in you paying 15%-20% more on taxes for your gains.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical indicators are fine to use as part of your trading strategy, but not as the entirety of your strategy.

Common Method 4: COVERED CALLS

Selling Covered Calls is a valid strategy to earn a little extra, however, I'm always reading posts about people who are sad that their covered calls are going to be exercised. If you sell a covered call, you should always assume the shares will be called away, otherwise you are trading with Mistake 5.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 3: NEW PROPOSED METHOD

&amp;#x200B;

I have made a Google Sheets for the process bellow. It does contain my current method for a stock that I own. Anyone is free to make a copy of this google sheet, delete all the cells in green and create your own numbers based on your research for your stock.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVC5oD2A4V64kypra7keQG-SyiATXSNoxvikF2KTAJU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVC5oD2A4V64kypra7keQG-SyiATXSNoxvikF2KTAJU/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

1) First you must choose a method (or a few) to model the value of the stock. Common examples are: 

4 x Revenue

P/E ratio of 8-30 depending on the industry

Summation of total future profits discounted to present value (the Buffet Way). 

Sentiment indicators through polls or reddit/twitter activity

2) Come up with a Base Case, Bear Case and Bull Case. Model the values of the stock under each scenario. This is designed to force you to do some DD and eliminate mistake 1.

3) Next, you fill out a Trial using a probability matrix of the chances that you think the base case, bear case, and bull case actually happen.

4) Using the same matrix repeat the trial 5 times with bearish and more bullish outlooks. Instructions are on the spreadsheet. This is designed to lower your bias (mistake 2). 

5) OPTIONAL: If you have a partner OR work as a team with people who also analysis stocks AND have different views about a stock, ask them to also fill out the probibility matrix as well to lower your bias even more (mistake 2).

6) Repeat the model and trials 1-5 on different days, when in different moods, or in the morning versus the night time. This is in order to reduce noise (mistake 3). Each repeat should take you 10 minutes max.

7) Plot/write down each of the results from every trial and every different day. Then use statistics to find your Mean, Variance Pop, Stand Deviation Pop.

8) This will create a bell curve of YOUR true estimates of the price of the stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: In a world with everyone having perfect information, this model would represent the true distribution of the price of the stock. However, since you and other buyers do not have perfect information, THIS IS NOT A BELL CURVE OF THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE STOCK. However, the more you know and research the stock, the closer you would get to the actual real distribution.

9) With the distribution of YOUR estimates in front of you, create an algorithm to follow and execute your trades.

10)  WRITE THE ALGORITHM DOWN AND LOOK AT IT EVERYTIME BEFORE YOU PLAN TO SELL. Execute the algorithm to the best of your ability to minimize Mistakes 4 and 5.

11) Each day should try to take 10 minutes to get more plot points for your statistics page. Each day you can tweek your algorithm a little, BUT ONLY RUN TRIALS AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE ALGORITHM WHEN THE MARKET IS CLOSED AND YOU CANNOT TRADE!!!! This is designed to prevent you from making quick emotional decisions (Mistake 4).

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know the proposed method will take some work. Maybe it will take 30 minutes to read and understand and about 10 minutes to do each day. Imagine if this process increases your earnings/trades by just $100 a week, I would think most people would find it as time well spent.

&amp;#x200B;

Last thought is that you should probably not share the true results of your algorithm and decisions with anyone you don't personally know. Reddit is a great place to share ideas, but it is a public forum, and anyone might be reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read another long boring post by Tankre84!

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to handle windfall money,"So here is my situation. Through connections I've made in my career, I've ended up with a very high-paying short term contract position. So far I've paid off all my debt except for a ~$17k student loan (hoping for forgiveness...) and my mortgage which is ~$125k. Interest rate is 4.125%. 

I have a few months left at least left in this position, and by the end of the year I should have enough cash to pay off my mortgage. I have a friend who works in finance who tells me that paying off my mortgage with cash is the wrong move. I understand that in terms of long term income, I will make more money investing or buying real estate or doing something else with the cash.

My wife and I are likely going to have kids soon (we are late 20's). We both would prefer to have one of us stay home with the kids until they are in school. Since I make more money in my career path (engineer, ~$70k a year) it makes more sense for her to stay home and me to work. I've argued that by paying off our mortgage early, we would have a much smaller monthly financial obligation. The freedom and flexibility that would provide would not only make our lives easier and less stressful, but would allow us to give our children a better life.

So the way I see it, by using the cash to pay off my house, I'd be sacrificing long term money for short(er) term financial freedom and happiness. We have a pretty good safety net with both of our parents in case of disaster. 

Do I have the right understanding of my situation? Is there a better way I could use my cash, apart from paying off debt or investing? Any thoughts? Thanks for reading.",finance

personalfinance,(Possibly stupid) Question re: auto financing,"So my car is trying to crap out on me (VW Tiguan, do yourself a favor and never own one) again, requiring engine work again (yes, again) at 75k miles. I want to just trade it in. Thing is, it's underwater because I've been focusing on paying other debts (since it's interest rate is so much lower) - I have a second job specifically for this purpose. My best estimate at this point is about $4k underwater. I've saved $4k currently (that I was planning to dump on said other debts, but I digress), and will have about $2k - $2.5k extra in the next month, when I plan to buy/finance a new car (probably at a higher rate than my current loan is, since my debt ratio is higher than when I purchased the VW).

So, my stupid question is would it be smarter to dump money on the current car loan, or wait until I go to trade in the car?

ETA: This is my first time trading a car in, and I most-definitely have never traded in a car with a note on it.",finance
personalfinance,"Pay down my student loans, pay off my car loan, or keep saving?","I'm 32, in the US, with about $11k left on my student loans and about $13.5k left on my car loan. I have $15k in my savings. Details below.

I currently work as a contractor at a job that pays adequately but offers no benefits whatsoever. After being partially furloughed from the job I had last year and qualifying for the $600/week payments, getting a better paying job, and just...not being able to go out and do anything, I was able to save about $15k, which is more than I've ever saved in my life by about $13k--so I'm wondering what the hell to do with it.

Everything I've learned about finance is self-taught, and I am definitely not an expert, so I'm turning to you fine folk. I know the ""rule"" is always to pay down your debt first; what I'm wondering is which loan would be worth paying off sooner--or if I should keep enough in savings as an emergency fund (will do this no matter what), and split a balloon payment between the two. I know interest starts accumulating on federal student loans again at the end of September.

Thanks in advance for anybody with insight.",finance

personalfinance,Slightly Higher Interest Rate to Drop PMI?,"I don’t know if this is exactly the right sub for this, but looking for some layman’s insight here.

Wife and I have a refi on the table and feel like we’re missing the finer points.

TLDR: our rate would increase, our PMI would disappear, our principal would increase, and our total monthly payment would drop.  The lower monthly looks good on paper, but something makes this feel like a bad decision. Who has thoughts?

Details:

Estimated home value: $415k

Current Mortgage:
Type: FHA
Principle: $320,800
Rate: 3.25
PMI: $212.00
Total monthly (including escrow): $1878

Proposed Refi:
Type: Conventional
Principle: $331,00
Rate: 3.375
PMI: None
Total monthly (including escrow): $1704
Cash back to us at closing (why?): $1324

Household income and credit scores have both increased significantly since signing current mortgage.

Is there anything important that I’m missing here to make a smart decision?
Why does this somehow feel wrong?
I feel like this hinges on the implications of carrying PMI in the long term (are there other ways to remove it)

So, people will remove them from the grid, or try to launder them fast. The people who purchase the laundered crypto are going to be subject to forfeiture of their coins. The people who de-grid them will be more problematic--they will take them off the grid in those hopes that in several months they can transfer them safely.

Thus, the Feds could wind up publishing on an obscure page of the \*.gov hierarchy a list of coins subject to immediate seizure once they are located--rendering them worthless to anyone who doesn't want to purchase a coin and watch the Feds confiscate it 45 seconds later.

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency is inherently political - Both Left and Right have something to lose.,"###The idea that this is a Left/Right issue is totally unsupported in any meaningful way.

Both political parties and private institutions are threatened by decentralisation of financial institutions and the impending loss of political power.

The argument that the Right has no authoritarian inclinations is naive. They seek authority in a different way, by controlling and structuring society through the Free Markets and with the absence of unbiased oversights. For instance, Corporations want less regulatory controls so they can dispose of toxic chemicals as cheaply as possible, increasing profits for shareholders, and poisoning rivers. Any clean-up will be an ‘externality’ for which they are not held responsible. This is true of fair wages, health and safety, worker’s protection etc. In this way they maintain ‘control’.

The Left seek control in a regulatory manner, through legislation and regulation, in America’s case, both locally and nationally. How heavy handed, slow to react, and overreaching, are that which create the negative consequences, which people rightly protest. (Unpasteurised milk is illegal in the US? sometimes leading to a visit form your friendly ATF). But the difference being, between Left and Right, that (in theory at least) legislation and regulation is a democratic process, which can be contested and reiterated in a public and open manner. Private regulations can not, unless they are somehow in violation of State or Federal regulations.

Ok, so how does all this relate to the topic?

Cryptocurrency is inherently a political issue. It is about how we organise and maintain a society, run our governing institutions, our private affairs and the economic relationships we have with each other. This is the very definition of politics.

Bi-partisan politics, the ‘pick-a-side’ framework is severely unequipped to deal with the larger disruptive issues. The disruptive consequences of internet technology in general is a case in point. 5 large corporations have taken control of majority of our day to day interactions on the internet, and the governance by these corporations is largely out of the hands of legislative bodies, Left or Right. So when they decide to ban someone for ‘having the wrong opinion’ there is little that can be done; because they are private institutions.

The same is true with Cryptocurrencies, inherently apolitical, decentralised, peer-to-peer and permission less. 

BOTH SIDES ARE WORRIED.

###TLDR Cryptocurrency is a Bi-partisan issue, of which both sides have skin in the game with something to lose and for the rest of society to potentially gain. The core tenets are decentralisation, permission less engagement and peer-to-peer transactions. 

###Governments AND Corporations, Public and Private, are concerned that they will lose their power and the great unwashed will gain control.",cryptocurrency

50. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
51. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
52. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
53. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
54. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
55. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
56. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
57. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
58. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
59. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
60. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
61. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
62. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
63. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
64. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
65. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
66. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

69. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
70. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
71. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
72. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
73. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
74. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
75. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
76. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

CryptoCurrency,Central America is becoming a Decentral America,"As many of you know El Salvador has passed a resolution to make Bitcoin a legal currency, which makes it the first country to do so. According to the law, citizens will be able to use Bitcoin to do everything from paying taxes and paying off debts to buying goods and services. Massive changes indeed.

Panamanian Congressman, Gabriel Silva, commented on El Salvador's move to adopt Bitcoin as a currency on Twitter and called for Panama to do the same. 

Carlos Rejala, a Paraguayan Congressman is set to present a bill that will set favourable regulations for crypto mining and crypto exchange businesses that want to set up shop in the country and eventually following El Salvador’s footsteps.

Many of the comments here on Reddit were about how small and insignificant these three countries are when it comes to adoption but…hold right there.
*A behemoth Mexico has entered the game and it’s damn hungry.

said Hinojosa, explicitly mentioning Bitcoin in a tweet.

Bitcoin,Help with some Bitcoin implications/questions..,"Hi,

I have a few questions that I was hoping someone could answer for me

&amp;#x200B;

1. In El Salvadore, Iif internet (even the satellite connection) goes down.. will they have to resort to dollars or is there another way (other than opendime). I remember Saifedean Ammous talking about another possibility of bitcoin backed coinage at once stage but forget what it entailed
2. Ive been playing with the lightning network and its very very cool, but as far as I see, even after you create or connect to a channel then it must be funded first which is basically one normal and slow bitcoin transaction. Isn't it still going to have scaling issues for this reason? or are folks simply going to have to pre fund all the channels that they will need to interact with. I guess its a good thing in terms of impulse buying some new thing you never seen before (as iy would take you 30 mins to fund the channel :))
3. If governments go ""full BTC"", then how would they fund disaster scenarios e.g. covid, floods, earthquakes, famine etc. - or even social welfare ?  Most would have reserves but many would not. So would they just borrow BTC ? I assume the rates on those borrowings would be pretty high since a default means those BTC are never getting paid back ? I guess it opens up some sort of credit default market for BTC ?
4. I realize price volatility right now will probably be noise as price goes up but in the meantime whats the opinion on merchants in El Salvadore having to price things in BTC and the implications for the volatility ? i.e. dealign with a 'loss' after receiving payment in BTC only for the BTCUSD rate to drop. I am going to assume that most will accept fiat in a fixed USD price and quickly convert to BTC and just hodl. What does this mean for the USD though.. it kind of gives it a new use of life.. i.e. something used very temporarily but something not really used for long store of value perhaps nothing longer than weeks/months
5. Will a satoshi be a small enough unit as time goes forward ?

thanks",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance a loan in this situation?,"I would really appreciate any advice on mortgage refinance options for us. I recently called our lender regarding dropping our PMI and it will be dropped next month saving us approx $62 per month.

Thinking about our mortgage got us thinking about refinancing.

Right now we owe **24 years, 1 month** (289 mo) on an existing mortgage with a rate of **3.875**. Our interest and principal payment is **$647.75**. We've been paying extra on the principal so our current balance is lower than it would have been with normal payments -  **$115,515.06**. Like I mentioned our PMI is dropping off our loan next month.

We plan to be in our existing home for decades though we absolutely can't predict the future. My husband is 50 and we would want a house paid off before he retires, hence making extra payments on the principal. Currently I'm disabled and as much as I would like that isn't likely to change. Another factor is we bought our home at a fantastic time. It appraised initially at $147,000 and based on sales for similar homes in our neighborhood we could easily sell it for $260,000 at least.  (Not something we are considering presently.)

The original thought to refinance was for a 25 year loan, but that would be adding 11 months of payments on to the loan. We could reduce that by paying down the principal but I don't know if adding the 11 months is a smart choice.  The other option that we are seriously considering is for a 20 year mortgage with a lower interest rate. This would automatically drop four years of payments off our loan. It would only save us $6 a month on payments so the break even isn't great in the short term but would save us considerable interest payments in the long term.

Here at some options presented for both scenarios.

**20 year**

|Rate|Total Cost (Closing &amp; Points)|New Monthly Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2.75|1736.25|634.33|
|2.875|858.75|641.58|
|3.0|273.75|648.88|

**25 year**

|Rate|Total Cost (Closing &amp; Points)|New Monthly Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2.75|2,175|539.73|
|2.875|1297.5|547.25|
|3.0|712.50|554.83|

With just a break even analysis the 25 year option is the scenario to go with but we would be adding **11 months** to our mortgage and would be paying for more interest in the long term.  We would likely end up paying that down much quicker as again our goal is to have a house paid off before retirement. With the 20 year option we would automatically be dropping 4 years off our loan but the break even analysis is abysmal. But it would be amazing to own our home outright sooner and pay less in the long run (if we stay in this home for decades like we hope to.)  Is the breakeven analysis really the end all determination with a refinance?

Greatly appreciate any advice.

Some other factors for the big picture.  Our mortgage is our only debt right now. (We pay off credit card use and we don't even have a car payment right now.) We presently have an emergency fund of about 6 months. But we are considering things like replacing our windows to eliminate utility bills.   Me being disabled is expensive and creates a lot more financial risk to our situation.  Our emergency fund feels less secure considering we may end up with additional medical expenses.  There are many treatments/aids that would improve my quality of life and decrease my suffering to keep our expenses lower and our finances more secure.",finance

## Ransomware backup provider Exagrid pays $2.6m to ransomware attackers

The ransom was paid in bitcoin on May 13. Accession to the ransomware attacker’s demands was made more embarrassing when the backup appliance supplier – which makes a big play of its strengths against ransomware – accidentally deleted the decryption tool and had to ask for it again. The ransomware group, Conti, who had lurked inside the Exagrid network for over a month, revealed they had over 800 gigabytes of personal data of clients and employees, commercial contracts, NDA forms, financial data, tax returns and source code. The initial ransom demanded was $7,480,000 but was negotiated down to $2.6 million.

## FBI subpoenas info on readers of news story on slain agents

The subpoenas demanded that U.S. newspaper giant Gannett provide agents with information to track down readers of a USA Today story about a suspect in a child pornography case who fatally shot two FBI agents in February. The subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting. It seeks the IP addresses — which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer, the company or organization it belongs to, and where it was registered — along with mobile phone identification information of the readers.

## US recovers millions in cryptocurrency paid to Colonial Pipeline ransomware hackers

This follows the attack which prompted the shutdown of the key East Coast pipeline last month. The Justice Department is expected on Monday to announce details of the operation led by the FBI with the cooperation of the Colonial Pipeline operator, people briefed on the matter said. Though paying the ransom to restore operations, behind the scenes, the company had taken steps to notify the FBI and followed instructions that helped investigators track the payment to a cryptocurrency wallet used by the hackers, believed to be based in Russia. CNN earlier reported that federal agencies are adept at tracing currency used to pay ransomware groups, but its ability to effectively do so “situationally dependent” and relies a great deal on how the ransomware organizations manage their operational network.

PhishLabs identified 47% more phishing sites in Q1 of 2021 than there were in Q1 of 2020. This trend is continuing as Q2 attacks are also up significantly year-over-year. Social media, especially messaging apps, topped the list for the first time, suggesting that threat actors are increasingly drawn to the massive reach and often careless user attitudes toward the security of their social media accounts. Accounts used for single sign-on (SSO) were also heavily targeted in Q1, accounting for 40% of overall phishing volume.

## Survey finds many workers don’t know emergency procedures

Key findings revealed only 28% of traveling and remote workers are involved with safety drills. A third of respondents said they were unsure of emergency plans related to active shooter, cyberattacks/system outages and workplace violence. Finally, survey results showed that email and in-person alerting were the most common communication methods utilized by employers, even though respondents in the 30-44 and 45-60 age groups say their preferred method of communication is mass text message.

Now that I have more money and am trying to get on top of my finances (and have read several posts about fraud) I ran a a credit report on TransUnion which stated in addition to the nelnet loans I was aware of, there is also a federal loan from the year after I left college to the total  $40,000+. While there is interest collecting the status is ""ok"". -&gt; it is under ""satisfactory accounts"" for a payment having been made (of zero dollars).

personalfinance,Help! Do you recognize this US Savings Bond gift slip and know when it may have been from?,"I recently received all the gifted US Bonds I was gifted while growing up, and among them was a confirmation slip that had no corresponding bond. The bond was either lost or never received in the mail.

It's titled ""The Great American Investment"" and [looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/AEXTYRj).

I'll have to submit the paperwork to have the Federal Reserve search for record of the missing bond, but I worry I may not have enough of the necessary information. I don't have the bond's serial number, nor do I have any clue when it was bought. The website seems to say that in absence of the serial number you'll need a pretty tight purchase date range, but I have neither.

I'm hoping someone here might be able to help identify when this specific slip design was used, so I can start to narrow down the possible years it was gifted to me. There obviously would have a specific year they began using it, and they may have later sunsetted it in a specific year. Perhaps the design evolved over the years too, which could provide a helpful clue. All I know is that this could have been gifted to me no earlier than 1990 and no later than 2009, when the gifter passed away.

The good news: I do have the SSN of the gifter and the denomination of the bond, and imagine those will help the Federal Reserve find the record tremendously. Still, 19 years is a long time range during which it may have been gifted to me and I worry that will be a big an obstacle to them finding it.

personalfinance,What should we do with student loan balance refund?,"My (26M) wife (27F) is going back to school to get her degree to become a school administrator. She's going part time while continuing to work in a public school and is planning to apply for PSLF when eligible. Her institution has reached out about disbursing leftover funds from her aid package for her first semester, around $4500, and I'm wondering what the best course of action is for that money. I anticipate she'll receive somewhere around that amount each semester through Fall 2022. 

Some facts about us:

* Household income is roughly 100k, split evenly between each of us
* I have 50k in student loans, she has 100k already. All are federal. Planning to pay mine off and have hers forgiven through PSLF since she'll be working in public schools long term.
* Have approximately $30k in cash savings for emergency fund and saving up for inevitable expenses like replacing older vehicles and hopefully an eventual down payment on a house.
* Retirement/investment accounts are at around $40k, making sure to get employer match and contribute a bit extra when able.
* Budget is comfortable - we're expecting an increase in living expenses because our landlord is planning to sell our home, but we should be able to absorb that fairly easily.

So what's the best course of action for that money? I know we can return it and her loans will be lower, but since she's doing PSLF, I'm wondering if we wouldn't be better off adding it to our savings or maybe using it to pay down my loan balance if payments go back into effect later this year.",finance
economy,Inflation is heading to 10-20% soon.....,"Consumer prices for May accelerated at their fastest pace in nearly 13 years as inflation pressures continued to build in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department reported Thursday.  


The consumer price index, which represents a basket including food, energy, groceries, housing costs and sales across a spectrum of goods, rose 5% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a gain of 4.7%.  


The reading represented the biggest CPI gain since the 5.3% increase in August 2008, just before the worst of the financial crisis sent the U.S. spiraling into the worst recession it had seen since the Great Depression.

  
Used cars and truck prices continued their climb higher, rising 7.3% on the month and 29.7% for the past 12 months. However, the energy index was about flat for the month despite the huge run-up in gasoline prices this year, while the food index repeated its April rise of 0.4%.  


The gasoline index is up 56.2% over the past year, part of an overall 28.5% increase in energy during the period. Food prices have remained comparatively tame, up 2.2% for the 12-month period.

investing,Any buy and hold levered ETF strategy?,"I’m aware of the classic reason why it’s thought ill-advised to buy and hold levered ETFs: “Multiplying daily vs. total returns may sound like a subtle difference, but it's one that leads to wildly different math. For starters, even a non-leveraged fund that falls 10% in one day can't make it back up with a simple 10% increase the following day. A $100 share that falls 10% in one day is worth $90 at the end of the day. But if its price goes up 10% on the second day, that’s a 10% increase from $90, putting the price at $99. There’s an erosion that occurs with a daily reset, and when a fund is leveraged, that erosion is magnified.”

But came across this alternative perspective: 

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769806

A particular portfolio of 40 percent TQQQ, 20 percent TMF, 40 percent TLT with monthly rebalancing proposed by us in the 2017 paper as a leveraged ETF alternative to classical stocks/bonds portfolios performed well in 2018 and through the Coronavirus crisis up to January 15, 2021. 

New to bond investments and would love to hear any thoughts. It would seem this strategy worked because the Fed intervened but what about when interest rates eventually rise?

Per another post: “If you have an equity heavy portfolio (like most people) TLT is probably the best bond fund for diversification during a stock market crisis. But don't think of it as low risk. It's just a different risk from your equity allocation and one that hopefully offsets the equity risk during a crisis. If you want safety and low absolute risk level look at shorter duration bond funds.”

personalfinance,Mortgage when spouse has bad credit,"My spouse and I are considering homeownership in the next year or so. I have good credit (consistently &gt;760 Equifax FICO score) and a newish job paying $43000 base salary plus a few hours of overtime a week and an annual bonus. My spouse has bad credit (~600 FICO score last I heard, primarily due to a federal student loan going to collections, which we are strategizing about but probably won't be resolved soon enough to affect our mortgage eligibility on our desired timeline) and makes $38000 a year, with a raise to $40000 just negotiated by the union. 

My spouse's debts are the student loans of  ~$23000 (which went to collections before our marriage) and a credit card that is almost all paid off. My debts are a car loan with $21000 left, another car loan that will be paid off by the end of the year, and credit cards that I pay off in full every month.

My Job starts in a week and I'm getting down to the wire.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am already in so much debt, I am wary of taking on more, yet I need a reliable ride. If I do take on a car payment at a lower interest rate, should I prioritize paying student loans and paying monthly payments on the car? Or should I pay over the monthly payment to get rid of that loan as soon as possible and then just work on student loans? My monthly expenses are currently fairly minimal other than loans (rent $750, no streaming services, eat out 2-3 times a week, internet $30).

personalfinance,Emergency fund - savings account vs. high dividend stock/fund?,"For savings in an emergency fund, is it better to keep it safe in a traditional savings account (with its low interest rates), or drop it into a stock or mutual fund that seems stable and pays high dividends?

personalfinance,Thinking about using an Ally Money Market account instead of Ally Checking + Ally Savings,"I'm currently using an Ally Checking account as a sort of ""gateway"" account where credit card transactions, bills, etc. are debited from the checking account while my Ally Savings account is the primary savings fund

But now since they're ""temporarily"" waiving the excessive transactions fee and I think Reg D is suspended(?) is there any reason to separate the two? I move the money out of the checking into the savings for the higher interest rate so there's really not much in the checking at any given moment

A money market account would match the savings account's interest rate and let me write checks/ACH debit/ATM transactions

Are there any downsides to using a single MMA as my primary bank account? The benefits I see are:

- higher interest rate
- no need to maintain and watch 2 account balances and move money between them as needed

Potential downsides - am I missing any?
- less protection? since I'd be exposing my primary account number when paying bills and what not, if their systems are compromised an unauthorized ACH transaction could empty out the account?

Bitcoin being the first strictly capped supply gives it maybe a stronger chance of being affected by this, but won't any deflationary currency appreciate regardless of adoption if the value of USD goes down?

personalfinance,Quarterly estimated tax after capital gain,"I have seen this topic discussed here several times but in each case the situation is slightly different.

I have a 9-5 job with tax withheld from my paycheck. In the Arp-Jun quarter I realized some gain from selling stocks. The IRS docs seem to suggest that I must pay quarterly estimated tax by 6/15 if I meet both conditions:

1) You’ll owe at least $1,000 in federal income taxes this year, even after accounting for your withholding and refundable credits -and-

2) Your withholding and refundable credits will cover less than 90% of your tax liability for this year or 100% of your liability last year, whichever is smaller. (The threshold is 110% if your adjusted gross income last year was more than $150,000 for married couples filing jointly or $75,000 for singles.)

I'd definitely meet 1). Because of the stock sale, my tax liability in 2021 will be larger than 2020. Is it correct understanding that if I adjust my W4 to withhold tax in 2021 that is &gt; 110% of 2020 liability (our AGI would require 110%), I do -NOT- need to pay estimated tax?

personalfinance,Points or Refinance In A Year Or So,"I'm getting a jumbo loan, they locked the rate of 3.625% and they're offering me a rate of 3.5% with $2,587.71 in points. That saves $72.51/mo, and should start paying off in about 3 years.

I was kind of disappointed by the rate. Last fall I had been quoted a rate of 2.7% for a conventional loan, and I'm seeing rates online advertised closer to 2.4%. I was told by my loan officer that conventional and jumbo rates were basically tracking the same, but it looks like there's nearly a whole percentage point difference between the two.

When I asked about the rate difference, the loan officer said:

&gt;As we move further away from the pandemic more investors will get back into the jumbo market which should drive rates down even more. but that depends on the overall market at that time.  If regular rates are low traditionally so are jumbos.

I'm thinking that I should pass on the points today, and try to refinance in maybe a year or so from now. I think he's probably right. The FED has said that they're going to keep rates ""near zero though 2023"", too. However I have heard people in the media raise concerns about raising inflation.

The main reason to buy points today, would be as insurance against rates rising in the near future. But, since I'm not particularly impressed with the rates today, in this period of historical rates, I'm tempted to go without. What would you do?",finance

investing,What makes the price of gold go up? Inflation?,"Dollar inflation in March was 2.6% over the past 12 months. The target of the Federal Reserve, let me remind you, is 2%. If in Russia 0.6% inflation is nothing at all, then in the USA it is a serious target excess. It should be noted that the low base effect had a greater impact. A global coronavirus outbreak began in March last year and prices fell. However, given that most of the acceleration occurred at the beginning of this year, it can be stated that inflationary pressures are already there today.  


So, gold rose 0.7%. This may seem logical, because gold is a perceived inflation hedge. In a longer-term perspective, it is. Food, clothing... it costs (in gold) +/- the same as it did 100 years ago. But if you think short-term, then the gold pricing is not so simple.  


Look at this graph. ([https://sun9-60.userapi.com/impg/N9Quvez3rhDcB1JhnklE3lDpzKoOfhKUjA-hYA/GhFaWOePy28.jpg?size=1200x675&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=0c17f0fcdb9a701618f09caedec2c5b0&amp;type=album](https://sun9-60.userapi.com/impg/N9Quvez3rhDcB1JhnklE3lDpzKoOfhKUjA-hYA/GhFaWOePy28.jpg?size=1200x675&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=0c17f0fcdb9a701618f09caedec2c5b0&amp;type=album)) The graph illustrates a strong inverse correlation between gold and 10-year Treasury yield. What is real profit? It's the profit of a company or investment after adjusting for inflation. It is calculated simply by subtracting the inflation rate from the gross profit margin. So what does that mean for us?  


As long as the market believes that the inflation jump is temporary, the nominal yield of long bonds will not rise. Investors will not sell them. This is very good for gold. Inflation is rising, but nominal yields are not. Real profit is falling. But if the market believes that the inflation jump is not temporary? Bonds will be dumped, nominal yields will rise faster than inflation itself, and gold will fall.  


In general, if the market underestimates inflation (does not sell bonds), then it is good if gold is a part of your investment portfolio, if, on the contrary, it overestimates (resells long bonds), then it is better not to have gold.  


Why is there such a correlation between bond yield and gold price dynamics at all? It's simple. Gold is a perpetual zero coupon bond. What do you think?",finance

investment,$CLNE is more than a hype stock,"[CLNE](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE) presents a promising future and attractive opportunity for investors given the energy transition the world is undergoing. With CLNE’S established brand and reputation in the renewable gas industry, I believe they are well-positioned to serve the growing demands for RNG. 

Company Overview

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.

RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.

2020 Financial Results

**Revenue:** CLNE’s 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&amp;M services. Despite 2020’s bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.

**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they’ll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that’ll help with seeing shareholder returns.

**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE’s lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company’s ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (

Recent Developments

**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon’s action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.

**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M.  This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.

**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron’s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.

Investment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG

The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it’s used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:

* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord
* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years
* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050

Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.

Final Thoughts

With [CLNE](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE) being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport

personalfinance,Loan company messed up my mortgage,"I applied for a home loan and began house shopping in November. I was initially pre-approved for a conventional loan for $200k at 5% down (all I asked for at the time) and made an offer on a house which was not accepted. Over the next month and a half I found a few more houses and ask for gradually increasing pre-approvals. When I came upon the house that I settled one, it was recommended to go with an FHA loan, and I complete the purchase in January with a $282k loan with 5% down.

Back when doing the initial application, there was a question about federal debts in default. I answered yes, as I had about 5k in student loans in default and they were not priority since the interest was postponed and my rent lease was ending soon. The rep said something to the effect of that's not what it meant and I believe changed the answer to no.

Fast forward to the month after closing, they call saying there is a problem with FHA because of the student loans, and after some back and forth with the collection agency they sent me $1500 to help pay the agreed payoff amount, which was about $4100, so I paid off the loans.

Yesterday they called back and said that since it wasn't cleared beforehand the loan cannot be insured by FHA and I have to refinance. They have already sold the loan to a new bank / servicer, whom I've made the last two payments to. My credit score has tanked in the mean time because I wasn't in getting a mortgage mode and opened two new cards and loaded some balances on a couple cards with 0% interest to spread the load of all the work I've been doing to the house.

I don't think there is any way I can get a refinance at the same rate (2.75%). Any advice?",finance

I have already maxed out my retirement accounts.  I don’t want to put money into taxable account because market is already all time high.  I looked into Real estate but it’s a crazily overpriced market right now.  I don’t want to pay down mortgage as I already locked in rock bottom Interest rate.  I want to keep my cash liquid in case an investment opportunity comes up, but I want it to keep even with inflation.  I’m sure many are in a similar situation.  Any thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Any way to get a short term loan (3-5 days) to cover business credit card?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a bit of a predicament. I purchased a pallet of product on my Amex Gold card. The shipment has all been sold, and usually the buyer (a medium size distribution company) pays out well before my card balance is due. This payout process has been delayed, with the expected payout now being 3-5 days after my Amex balance is due. I don't have enough cash on hand to front paying off the card (it is around $35k). is there a way to get a loan with this short of duration, while also being this high, from any lenders/credit unions?

Worst comes to worst I believe Amex will let me pay it late with a hefty interest rate (\~14.2%) but ideally, I could get a loan for a much lower rate.",finance
personalfinance,Could I get some advice on what how you would invest and budget the investments?,"I've been wondering for a while on what I should do in regards to money I am making. I currently have about $22k in the bank, $2500 in a stock account, and about $3000 in a Roth. I make around $1800 every paycheck(although that doesn't count federal taxes). I still have around $8000 in student loans and 10k on a new car loan.  I'll admit there is a strong urge of mine to either pay off the loans completely or take the money and just invest it. 

Ultimately I don't really know what I should be investing in or doing with what money I have. I would like to have a house and not pay rent. I also would like to be able to access any money relatively easy in case I get fired and need it. I'm not great at my job so I will likely need to look for something soon anyway. I don't really know, how would you go about choosing how much to invest and what to invest in.",finance

We live in an area where home prices have soared in the last couple years. I realize it’s not guaranteed to keep increasing like this and we likely won’t actually move for 2-3 years. Also if the better idea is to start a separate savings what is the best account type to save that money in?

17. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit.

18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

My husband and I have a combined income of $110k, no debts other than our mortgage, about 4k in an emergency fund and are reasonably frugal. We bought our first home a couple of years ago and after cash flowing some renovations and the crazy housing market, our equity has more than tripled to about $250k. House is worth $630k ish. Our interest rate is 2.6%.  
We have two young children and I would like to reduce my work to stay home with them more (they're not in school yet). We also need to purchase a new car (the 2001 sedan isn't cutting it).

Would it be wise to:

Finance our next car (25k AUD) through our equity

Drawdown a further $10k to pad out our emergency fund since our combined income will reduce to 80k. (Emergency fund is offsetting the mortgage as it is).

And should we invest some equity? Or just focus on paying the rest down while rates are low?

stocks,Inflation is actually in the norm for the decade,"There is a lot of talk about inflation and how it is supposedly spiking and very high. The May 2021 CPI reported yesterday shows a 5% jump YoY in all categories with an apparently HUGE jump of 28.5 % YoY when looking at energy.

However it seems that most people, and the media, are forgetting that 1 year ago, May 2020 was when the whole economy was depressed due to the lockdowns.  For energy in particular, in May 2020 the oil futures unprecedently went negative! 

The apparent YoY spike is actually due to a base effect, or that the denominator of your calculation is smaller than usual.  You can take a look at the 20-year monthly CPI increase here: [https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)

For all categories, in May 2020 the CPI YoY increase was 0.1% . To smooth over the Covid crash, we can look at the CPI increase between May 2021 and May 2019. Mathematically this is the geometric average and it comes out to what you'd expect: 2.5%  . As you can see on the graph, the 2.5% YoY is actually quite average for the period of 2016-2019. This means that the current value of the CPI is roughly what we would have got had there been no covid and the usual inflation growth.

For energy, which apparently had the huge spike, the case is even stronger that this is simply a base effect, indicating the economy is returning to normal. The YoY increase on May 2020 was -18.9%. If you take the geometric average: square root( 0.811 \* 1.285) you get an average increase of ONLY 2% . I say only, because the average CPI increase over the last year has been as high as 8-9%. So 2% increase is actually close to nothing.

So what is the take away? Inflation fears are overblown and the Fed is right to say that this is a temporary effect. We are returning to normal, it just seems much more because we've been locked down for a year and prices were depressed due to the lockdown. In particular, I would load up on tech/growth stocks which took a hit due to rising inflation. The numbers simply don't point to the fears that we will enter a new era of high inflation.

Tldr; inflation is not real, buy growth stocks.",finance

""First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO  in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can  contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** 

**Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can  be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature  that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the  account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter  case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it  takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may  affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost  for processing  the transaction.""

**Exploring a new mechanism to help make  fees fair, stable, and more predictable over time: stablefees and the  decentralized reserve system -&gt;** IOG blog: [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/06/10/stablefees-and-the-decentralized-reserve-system/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/06/10/stablefees-and-the-decentralized-reserve-system/)

The  core idea behind Stablefees is to have a base price for  transactions  through pegging to a basket of commodities or currencies.  Stablefees  includes a native ""decentralized reserve"" contract that  issues and  manages a stablecoin pegged to the basket. A comparison in  the fiat  world might be the International Monetary Fund’s[ SDR](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR),   (established in 1969) and valued based on a basket of five   currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese   yen, and the British pound sterling. The stablecoin --- let’s call it   ""Basket Equivalent Coin"" (BEC) --- is the currency used for paying   transaction fees (and all other real world pricing needs of the   platform, e.g., SPO costs).

In  this system, ada will play a dual  role: Reserve asset of the  decentralized reserve, and reward currency  for staking. It will also be  the fall-back currency in extreme scenarios  where the reserve contract  is in a liquidity crunch.

The  centerpiece of this mechanism is an on-chain oracle that  determines the  price of the basket in ada. SPOs can implement this  oracle in a  decentralized manner. The reserve can offer extra rewards to  all oracle  contributors from the fees collected during BEC/DEC ( decentralized  equity coins )  issuances.

The Stablefees mechanism can be considered a natural extension of [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/)   \---spot conversion of BECs into ada by the decentralized reserve. Both   mechanisms complement (and are compatible with) each other. Babel fees   can be deployed together with Stablefees with just one change: Using   BECs to cover Babel fee liabilities, instead of ada. This also means   that fees will always be payable in ada (via a Babel fee liability   convertible in ada on the spot).

Our  team is currently researching the granular details of the  Stablefees  mechanism. Once this research is complete, Stablefees can be  integrated  into Cardano to offer fair and predictable transaction  pricing.  Moreover, the price oracle and the global BEC (and regional  variants,  if included) will undoubtedly find uses beyond paying  transaction fees,  expanding the capabilities of decentralized  applications in the  Cardano ecosystem.

**Custom  currencies, usually following the ERC-20 standard, are one of the most  popular smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. These  currencies are however second class to the primary currency Ether.**  Custom tokens are not natively traded and accounted for by the Ethereum  ledger; instead, part of the logic of an ERC-20 contract replicates  this transfer and accounting functionality. The second class nature of  custom tokens goes further,though: **transaction  processing and smart contract execution fee scan only be paid in Ether —  even by users who have got custom tokens worth thousands of dollars in  their wallets.**

***Cardano's approach:***

* **by  introducing native custom tokens it is possible to allow custom tokens  to reuse the transfer and accounting logic that is already part of the  underlying ledger.** This is achieved without the need for a  global registry or similar global structure via the concept of token  bundles in combination with token policy scripts that control minting  and burning of custom tokens.
* **requirements for babel fees** are summarized as follows:  

   * **(1)  participants that create a babel fee transaction should be able to  create a normal transaction, which will be included in the ledger  exactly as is (i.e., no need for meta-transactions or specially crafted  smart contract infrastructure**) and
   * (2)  the protocol should be non-interactive in the sense that a single  message from the creator of a transaction to the participant paying the  fee in the primary currency should suffice. In other words, **we  want transaction creation and submission to be structurally the same  for trans-actions with babel fees as for regular transactions**.
* Our **implementation of babel fees is based on** a novel ledger mechanism, which we call **limited liabilities. These are negative token amounts (debt if you like)** of strictly limited lifetime. **Due to the limited lifetime of liabilities, we prevent any form of inflation (of the primary currency and of custom tokens).**
* **Transactions  paid for with babel fees simply pay their fees with primary currency  obtained by way of a liability. This liability is combined with custom  tokens offered to any party that is willing to cover the liability in  exchange for receiving the custom tokens.**
* **modify the ledger rules in three ways:**  

   * (1) The original UTXOma rules are defining ledger validity by adding transactions to the ledger one by one. We extend this by **including the ability to add transactions in batches; i.e.,multiple transactions at once**
   * (2) We **drop the unconditional per-transaction ban on negative values in transaction outputs**  and replace it by the weaker requirement that there remain no negative  values at the fringe of a batch of transactions. In other words, **liabilities are confined to occur inside a batch and are forced to be resolved internally in the batch where they are created.**
   * (3)  We amend the rules about the use of policy scripts such that the script  of a token 𝑇 is guaranteed to be run in every transaction that  increases the supply of 𝑇

The paper makes the following contributions:

* We introduce the **concept  of limited liabilities as a combination of negative values in  multi-asset token bundles with batched transaction processing** (Section 2)
* We introduce the concept of babel fees on the basis of limited liabilities as a means to **pay transaction fees in tokens other than a ledger’s primary currency** (Section 2)
* We present **formal ledger rules for an UTXO multi-asset ledger with limited liabilities** (Section 3)
* We present a **concrete spot market scheme for block producers to match babel fees** (Section 4)
* We  present a solution to the knapsack problem that block producers have to  solve to maximise their profit in the presence of babel fees (Section  5)

**Token  bundles are, in essence, finite maps that map an asset ID to a quantity  — i.e., to how many tokens of that asset are present in the bundle in  question.** The asset ID itself is a pair of a hash of the policy  script defining the asset’s monetary policy and a token name, but that  level of detail has no relevance to the discussion at hand.

***Other applications of limited liabilities***

While  our primary motivation for proposing liabilities limited by transaction  batches are babel fees, the mechanism of limited liabilities is more  broadly applicable:

* ***Swaps***  

   * As  discussed, we use liabilities in babel fees to form transaction outputs  that represent atomic swaps — we call those swap outputs. We do this by  including a liability (negative token value) together with an asset  (positive token value). Whoever consumes such an output effectively  swaps the tokens described by the liability for those constituting the  asset
* ***Service payments***  

   * Extending  the concept of swaps from ex-changing assets to exchanging assets for  information. In the Extended UTXO model, which facilitates complex smart  contracts on a UTXO ledger, transaction outputs also include a data  component. This can, for example, be used to communicate information  from an off-chain oracle. Liabilities included with such an output can  serve as payment for consuming such an output with the data.
* ***Indivisibility***  

   * Transaction  batches are different to signed trans-action groups proposed for some  ledgers, such as, for example, Algorand. To create a signed transaction  group, all component transactions need to be known and the group signed  as a whole. If multiple component transactions are created by different  parties,these parties need to cooperate to create the group transaction.  The benefit of such a signed group is that it is indivisible. The  transaction batches that we propose are different.

Cardano's ***""Competition"" (Ethereum, Algorand and Stellar and XRP Ledger built-in DEX) comparison***

**Ethereum**

Ethereum supports fee payment in non-primary currencies via its [Gas Station Network.](https://docs.opengsn.org/) The gas station infrastructure consists of:

* a  network of nodes listening for meta-transactions (transaction-like  requests to cover transaction fees), which turn these requests into  complete transactions, with fees covered by the relay node, and
* an  interface that contracts must implement in order for the relay nodes to  use this contract’s funds to subsidize the transaction fees.

This  infrastructure consists of many moving parts working together,  including smart contracts, relays, relay hubs, and communication on a  network separate from the main chain network. Only GSN-enabled contracts  can cover transaction fees. **Cardano's  proposal does not require any changes to existing smart contracts, and  does not require meta-transactions to be disseminated on a separate  network, since they are already fully-formed and signed transactions. In  addition, unlike the GSN, there is no further action required from the  user after submitting a Babel-fee transaction. The design of the GSN  allows for the possibility that an incorrect transaction is submitted by  a relay node in response to a sender’s fee-coverage request.**  The onus is on the sender to monitor the chain, and reques tpunitive  measures to be taken against an offending relay. There are other  verifications necessary to participate in GSN. **Submitting  transactions with liabilities has no potential of unexpected  consequences (whether they are included in the ledger or not).** *The  GSN requires participating fee-covering contracts to pre-pay for the  fee amounts they intend to cover. This approach involves additional  maintenance, monitoring, and communication. The contract may specify the  tokens it accepts in exchange for covering fees, but the extra step of  posting and updating the contracts on-chain is less flexible and has  more steps (including submitting potentially costly transactions) than  our strategy.* Recall that in our design, we propose to automate the  process of any user getting a transaction with an exchange offer,  accepting or rejecting the offer based on maximizing the value they are  getting by engaging in theoffer, then submitting the batch containing  the swap transactions to the chain. With Babel fees, a user may use a  higher-than-minimum fee or exchange bid to increase the chances of their  transaction to be accepted sooner. The exchange offers made via  GSN-enable smart contracts, as well as the fee amounts the contract is  willing to cover,are all fixed.

**Algorand**

**Algorand**  in an account-based cryptocurrency which supports custom native tokens.  It provides users with a way to perform atomic transfers. An atomic  transfer requires combining unsigned transactions into a single group  transaction, which must then be signed by each of the participants of  each of the transactions included. This **design  allows users to perform, in particular, atomic swaps, which might be  used to pay fees in non-primary currencies. As with our design, the  transactions get included into the ledger in batches.** *Unlike  the mechanism we propose, however, incomplete transactions cannot be  sent off to be included in the ledger without any further involvement of  the transaction author.* This interactive protocol specification  ensures that batches cannot betaken apart and completed using other  transactions. This may be an advantage in certain cases over a batch  that is combined in a loose, easily decomposable way, but this behaviour  can also be implemented in the system we have presented. Moreover, an  interactive protocol for building group transaction requires additional  communication, which is, in this case, reliant on off-chain  communication.

**Stellar built-in DEX (XRP Ledger DEX works in a similar way)**

A  common blockchain solution to providing swap functionality (and  therefore, custom token fee payment) is a distributed exchange (DEX). **The  Stellar system supports a native, ledger-implemented DEX. In the  Stellar DEX, offers posted by users are stored on the ledger.A  transaction may attempt an exchange of any asset for any other asset,  and will fail if this exchange is not offered.** This approach  requires submitting transactions to manage a user’s on-chain offers, and  also requires all exchanges to be exact — which means no overpaying is  possible to get one’s bid selected. A transaction may attempt to  exchange assets that are not explicitly listed as offers in exchange for  each other on the DEX. The DEX, in this case, is searched for a  multi-step path to exchanging these assets via intermediate offers. This  is not easily doable using the approach we have presented. **A  DEX of this nature is susceptible to front-running. In our case,block  issuers are given a permanent advantage in resolving liability  transactions over non-block-issuing users. Among them, however,exactly  one may issue the next block, including the liabilities they resolved.**",cryptocurrency

cybersecurity,How can i prevent phishing from domain spoofed external mails with a Security Email Gateway?,"Hi,

first of all im new into cybersecurity &amp; im new in this sub.

Our company is facing high throughput of phishing mails from \*outlook.com &amp; \*hotmail.com. Our Security Email Gateway is a FortiMail which normally works fine. I saw a lot of help through google but they always affect the internal domain address spoofing. Like ""Oh an important email from my Boss Mr. X"" \*click\* (The gateway will compare the email header with the name of the boss) but this doesn't fit on external senders.

I also cant blacklist these 2 domains because there also come serious mails from them sometimes.

Greylisting also didn't work, a phishing mail was send 15min later again. Maybe greylisting is also kinda outdated.

The full phishing addresses look like examplename1993@\*. Addresses are changing, IPs are changing and content also. Its really annoying and just a matter of time when a co-worker \*clicks\* and enters credentials.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: They also look like a real address from outlook.com but IP-addresses always located at China/South Korea. There must be a way to stop this, but i cant find an option where i can block domain+country ):

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe some guys of you can give me advice. Greetings.

Additional info: 80% of the phishing mails go to inactive accounts (reject), how ever... other 20% addressing active accounts.",technology

eGLD,Essential Tools For Advancing Finance: Flash Loans Come To Elrond DeFi Via Equalizer,"Loans are essential tools in any financial system. They contribute to the growth of the global economy by enabling businesses and entrepreneurs to capitalize on opportunities. This results in the creation of jobs, assets, and revenue, which further create new opportunities, in a positive feedback loop.

However, accessing loans is a complex process that requires collateralization, lengthy verification procedures, and results in generally large interest rates, with a large portion of the loans defaulting and ending up in debt collection procedures.

Decentralized Finance products based on blockchain smart contracts have enabled the creation of a new type of loan, called “flash loan”, which is an improvement over traditional loans as they do not require collateral nor do they run the risk of defaulting.

Flash loans are either granted and paid back with interest or not granted at all. They are called “flash” because the entire process of granting and paying back the loan is executed in the single unit of time required to produce a blockchain block. The most well-known use cases for flash loans are arbitrage, collateral swapping, liquidations, and portfolio rebalancing.

We are excited to announce that flash loans are coming to Elrond DeFi via Equalizer, who are building a dedicated flash loan platform!

Through the integration of our mainnet into their flash loans marketplace, Lenders will be able to contribute eGold and other assets issued on the Elrond Network into liquidity pools, and Borrowers will be able to take out flash loans for capitalizing on opportunities on the Maiar Exchange and other DeFi platforms deployed on our blockchain.

“Flash Loans have been capturing the attention of the DeFi space because they enable complex financial systems to quickly converge to a market optimum, while also acting as a correction mechanism for high-risk experimental products. A DeFi system correctly designed to accommodate this innovative tool has transformational potential for global finance. We look forward to seeing Equalizer go live on our mainnet."" said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond Network CEO.

“We are excited about the opportunity to work with Elrond’s WebAssembly Virtual Machine for deploying our logic in a high speed and low-cost DeFi ecosystem. Features such as the 30% royalties for Smart Contracts and inexpensive token transfers will create a cost/benefit dynamic that we believe will be very appealing to our userbase” said Iulian Nita, Equalizer Project Lead.

The collaboration is important for Elrond because it gives participants in our DeFi ecosystem access to Flash Loans, arguably one of the most innovative tools that are made possible by blockchain finance, which will greatly enhance the opportunities for market actors and result in an overall healthier DeFi landscape.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to take out a student loan to graduate earlier?,"Hello, I am 23 going on 24, and I have been in college since I was 17 with 1 gap year. I just finished community college for free, and now I am enrolled in university for next semester studying electrical engineering. I currently work full time at $23/hr in a very high cost of living area. My biggest expense is rent at $1650/month. During covid I’ve been able to work and go to school full time because classes were all online, but now I will have to attend in person classes Monday through Friday if I want to graduate within two years (standard amount of time after transferring). I want to graduate asap so I can get a job in my desired field. Starting salary for EE in my area is in the 6-figure range—more than twice what I make now. I’ve applied for student loans and I was offered a $40000 loan at about 10% interest rate with a five or ten year repayment plan. I don’t have a cosigner so I’m all on my own. I thought I would get a better rate with a credit score of 723 but I guess not. 

So my question is, is it a good idea to take out a loan so I can graduate quicker and land a much higher paying job than what I have now, or is it better to go to school only two days a week, and keep my current job, but ultimately drag out my education for 5-6 more years?

personalfinance,how do I fill out w4 for summer job when I have a living stipend part of the year from my schooling?,"So I just started my summer job and I received a paycheck this morning covering my first shift. when I looked at it I realized that no federal taxes were taken out. I probably will make around $7000 this summer including tips, so if that was my only job during the year I wouldn’t actually owe federal taxes (because I would make less than my $12,400 single filing exempt status thing correct?). But the problem is is that I also get paid a living stipend from my graduate school which I receive a w2 from come tax season. 

My stipend gets paid out starting at the end of August through the beginning of June. I do not get paid during the summer months at all as i’m not taking any classes. My stipend is $23,500 for that time, before taxes. Federal taxes do get taken out of that paycheck. 

When I went to fill out the w4 for this summer job it asked for jobs that I currently am getting paid for, and because i’m not getting paid right now from my school I didn’t include it (that must be wrong). So now I don’t have federal taxes being withheld from this summer job. 

How would I fill out the w4 form for this job correctly when I receive a stipend from my school only during the typical fall and spring semesters? it asked how much I pay in taxes each quarter, I believe, on the form, but I don’t know how to answer that because i’m not being paid year round so each quarter will essentially have different amounts. 

I just need to know how to fill out this form so that I get the proper federal income taxes withheld from my paycheck so I don’t end up owing money during tax season next year. any help or article links is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Questions on feasibility of buying the property I am currently renting,"I can't seem to find good advice googling, so thought I'd ask here:

I currently live in a single bedroom rental unit in a 3 unit (5 bedroom total) house next to a major college campus. I have a good deal currently, but my house is up for sale and I fear my rent will go up significantly in the future once it sells. The house is posted for $600k (which is reasonable for the market it is in).

I haven't been actively looking for a house to own, but last year I did apply and was approved for a $300k mortgage as there was a house I was potentially interested in. I'm guessing that this 300k would be close to the maximum I'd get approved for on my own.

If I were interested in buying the rental property I currently live in, would this be feasible given that 4/5ths of the property already has tenants paying and I have no fear in being able to fill vacancies? Do banks take this into consideration when approving mortgages for owner-occupied multi-unit dwellings, or would it be no different than applying for a $600k single family home for myself? Are there specific financing options or stipulations for someone in my position that I should be aware of?

And lastly: if it would be possible to get a mortgage to own this property and I'd end up paying about the same or a little more than I pay now per month in rent, does it generally make sense to do so? I have a secure job that does not require commuting and my only other set monthly payment is to a small outstanding student loan with a low interest rate.",finance

I sat on doing my taxes because we had unemployment benefits and I wanted to wait till they figured out the whole -$10k issue, plus I was over the limit for the last stimulus so there was no rush. I completed and paid my taxes in full on May 15th, and watched my bank account and they money left my account on the 19th. 

Fast forward and the IRS sends a CP14 notice, the summary of which reads:

Total Penalties (see pages 3): $108.92  
Payments and Credits: $19,600.00

I go to page 3 and it says the Penalty is failure to pay proper estimated tax, IR Code 6654. The Description says When you don't pay enough taxes due for the year with your quarterly estimated tax payments, we charge a penalty for not properly estimating  your tax. Then it has five more columns all say N/A"" Period, Days late, Interest Rate, Interest Factor, Amount Due. 

I don't do quarterly estimated taxes. 

The CP14 when I look up online says to call the number on the upper righthand of the paperwork, but there is no phone number listed, not even a space for it. The only phone numbers anywhere on the paperwork is if you need more help, and I already checked online and that is a legit IRS phone number for general help. The return mailing address is a legit CP14 payment address. 

I have no reason to suspect this is not a legit notice from the IRS. My TIN number is correct, my tax liability and payments are correct. I thought it might be due to filing on May 15th, but I double checked the IRS publication and it says no penalties if paid in full by May 17th; then thought maybe there is a glitch in the system with the date change, but I don't see any other posts about other people receiving a similar notice.

CryptoCurrency,"Keep your Crypto wallet Secure - ""Not your keys, not your Crypto""","**Private keys**, or a string of letters and numbers similar to a password, are used to unlock access to a holder’s cryptocurrency. It is extremely important that private keys remain undisclosed.  The only way that funds can be moved is if you have a private key, and that’s why securing private keys is so important.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, nearly $82 million was reported lost to crypto scams during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. That is more than 10 times the amount from the same period the year before, the FTC reported.

To protect your crypto from hackers or any outside threat, it’s important to understand the type of wallet options available and how to secure your private keys. If you decide to buy cryptocurrency, you can use a non-custodial wallet or a custodial wallet to store your funds. It’s a choice that’s dependent on your personal preferences, both with pros and cons.

**Non-custodial wallet**

* You’re fully responsible for remembering your private keys and maintaining security measures to protect your funds.
* If you forget your private keys, which is common, you will be unable to access your cryptocurrency ⁠— no exceptions.
* It’s important to use a trusted hardware provider and secure your hardware wallet in a safe place 
*  You’re responsible for making sure you employ backup mechanisms like cold wallets, including hardware wallets, which are physical devices that store your keys offline.
*  Most bitcoin wallets require one private key to gain access and move cryptocurrency, but with multisig, multiple keys are required. Each key is held on a different device, typically a mix of your phone and offline hardware wallets, that are stored in different locations.

**Custodial wallet**

* Third-party, such as exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken or Gemini, is in control of your private keys.
* If you buy cryptocurrency through an exchange, you are given a sort of “IOU” for the cryptocurrency, while the exchange owns the private keys and holds the cryptocurrency in their wallet.
* If you buy bitcoin on a particular exchange, then that exchange owes you bitcoin until you decide to withdraw it
* With a custodial wallet, a hacker wouldn’t need your private keys to move funds from your account, since the exchange owns the keys, not you. That eliminates one wall of protection to your funds

**How to protect your wallet**

Though there are many different scams, a common one is sim swapping.

When you sign up with an exchange, you set a username and password and can add two-factor authentication, or two FA, to protect your account. If a hacker is able to get your login information, they’d also need to pass the two FA to gain access to your account. To do this, they’ll call your phone company and convince them to transfer your phone number to theirs.

* Enable two-factor authentication if you are using non-custodial wallets
* Use authenticator Apps for the 2FA instead of the SMS 2FA.
* Your seed phrase should also be kept completely private and in a secure location offline.
* Remain skeptical when receiving outside messages regarding your crypto wallet.
* No one on the internet is going to send you back double what you send to them.

Already we are seeing stiff resistance from the international central bank authorities with countries like Turkey completely prohibiting bitcoin to China where strict regulations bar its citizens from transacting in crypto, but mining activities are still allowed.

The IMF was designed to guarantee the stability of the world's monetary systems after WWII to prevent the worldwide economic depressions in the 1930s. The IMF was supposed to prevent unilateral decision-making that could cause currency devaluation. They failed their mission in 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. The US dollar has experienced an 85% inflation since then. The move by the US influenced other currencies to move to a ""floating standard"" model that is the value of the currency is determined by current market forces.

Currently El Salvador is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF. The IMF's rhetoric has caused concern with international bankers who've raised their interest rates on El Salvador's debits.

I work from home so I have only put about 12k miles since I bought it and it's a solid vehicle, But I need a truck because I live in the country and often work on projects that I need to haul things in the bed so I don't really want to get rid of it even though I would make some money on it.  My predicament is 1. Should I refinance for a better rate at 60 months cause it's only 5 months long and I would be able to pay it off faster. B should I just work harder to pay it off at the current rate and term? or C. Should I sell and buy a newer but still used truck as my wife wants something with a larger back seat? Other suguestions welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Will student loans keep me living in poverty?,"I’m going into a Mental Health Counseling MA program with $32k undergrad student debt and $57k parent plus loan debt I agreed to pay for my parents. At the end of this program, I’ll have racked up another about $20k in student loan debt. When all is said and done, I’ll have about $110,000 in federal student loan debt and salary prospects look to be $45,000-$60,000 starting off. 

I’m wondering if it’ll be worth it? I mean I’m not going in Counseling for the money, but rather the prospect that in 3-5ish years after graduation, I’ll be fully licensed and can move into private practice and create my own schedule, no boss, and just have deep conversations with people to better themselves all day. My BA in English so far has proved to only be useful in getting me jobs that require a a bachelors degree. I need more education to make myself more marketable and get a higher paying job. So I think of the $20k grad loan debt as not too shabby for guaranteed higher paying job and more autonomy in the future. Am I making the right choice or am I just racking up debt that’ll hurt me more in the future? 

I’m a first gen college graduate so even though I have all this debt, I’ve at least pulled myself out of poverty but I feel like I’ll be living like I’m still in poverty when it comes time to start making my $600-$900/mo student loan payments in a few years when I make about $3,000-$4,000/mo.",finance

energy,How exactly does the transition from grey to green hydrogen happen?,"Hydrogen is a polarizing topic on this sub but from what I remember, there is at least some consensus that grey hydrogen needs to be phased out and replaced with renewable green hydrogen. So then how is this to happen?

Right now, the biggest conventional uses for hydrogen is in oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production and in the production of direct-reduced iron. In all the processes mentioned, hydrogen gas is created on-site using fossil fuels and gets used on-site.

Oil refining is a dead end since oil is to also be phased out. The focus, then, would be on the production of ammonia, methanol and steel. How would existing plants producing ammonia, methanol and steel make the switch? Is it really as simple as connecting a new inlet into reactors that get fed with hydrogen? Can existing reactors for the end-products be kept or will those need to be replaced? Most importantly of all, where would these existing plants get their green hydrogen? Will they have to commission the construction of electrolyzers powered by the grid? Do they have to find a supplier that can build a new hydrogen pipeline that will transport the green hydrogen from a distant source? If that's the case, a contract needs to be signed to lock in the investment for the new pipeline. Chemical and steel plants tend to be large and pipelines can transport hydrogen cheaply as long as the volumes are large. Or is the government to first retrofit the existing natural gas pipelines (I'm thinking the high-pressure transmission gas grid) into 100% hydrogen pipelines before industries can start to supply their hydrogen externally? What needs to happen before existing industrial plants can ditch grey hydrogen for green hydrogen?

personalfinance,What should I do with 10000 euros,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a decision to make and I am not sure which path is the best.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my situation, I recently bought an apartment with a credit from back of 59000 euros ( about 5% interest rate).  ( I will take the credit at the end of the year). Beside this I have an other apartment that I own let's say 75% and I have to pay a 3rd party an other 12000 to 20000 euros, not sure exactly how much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 10000 euros now that could go to any of these and I am not sure what would be better. 

1. For the first one if I put them there of course I will have to take less credit 49000, but when I will have to pay my second apartment the 25% I will have to take an other credit to do so( about 10% interest rate). 
2. For the second apartment, if I keep the money for it, it could be years until I will have to pay them back ( It's my grandmother apartment and she will leave there and only after she will pass away, hopefully not soon I will have to pay that 25% left). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have a decision to make, put the money into my credit and pay 49000 euros of credit with 5% interest rate 

Keep the money and use them when needed for my second apartment so I don't have to take a credit them with a interest rate of 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

For the second apartment there always the possibility to buy now, but that has to be discussed with the 3rd party and they might not agree.

CryptoCurrency,"People FUD a lot about the Fed ""printing money"" but the M2 money supply has grown far less than the entire crypto space and is typically similar to the rate at which Eth is mined. Stay rational with your investments and don't solely listen to pro-crypto arguments.","Probably not a popular sentiment here but I'm trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. In the past year, the M2 money supply (which isn't even really quite all the USD there is) has gone from just under [$18T to just over $20T](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm). $2.3T has been ""printed"" in the past 12 months. It's a 12.8% increase. 

But around 8M new Eth are created each year. There was a supply of about 108M a year ago. That's a 7.4% increase but that remains pretty constant when the USD rate is typically far lower than what it has been the past ~1.5 years. Typically it takes [over 10 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) for the M2 money supply to double, which is about the same as what Eth is on track for. And the total supply for Eth is not capped like bitcoin, meaning that Eth could do what the Fed did at some point if the system demanded it. 

This isn't a pro-USD or anti-crypto argument. I'm just trying to bring some context to the arguments often presented here. The supply of USD is not wildly out of control. It's still in line with the US GDP. There was a significant increase in the money supply due to a one-time deadly pandemic which kind of halted the entire economy. The sky isn't actually falling for fiat. 

I just don't want people throwing their entire life savings into crypto because of what is essentially a lot of anti-fiat misinfo being thrown around here and not really being fact checked. The US government has a very large interest in keeping the value of the dollar stable, and isn't going to let hyperinflation ruin the economy. The USD Is inflationary on purpose, but they have a fairly decent grasp on the rate of inflation. Eth is also inflationary, as are many cryptos. And **most importantly, the crypto space in general is actually experiencing a massive amount of inflation due to all the new coins being introduced.** The value of Eth and Btc is constantly being diluted by hard forks and new coins being introduced. So just be aware of your assumptions. 

Be careful and considerate about what you believe, and the one-sided arguments people share on a subreddit biased towards crypto. Crypto isn't necessarily going to outperform other currencies or securities for the rest of time. Bitcoin may or may not be a good inflation hedge, due to being deflationary. But it's even more dependent on market psychology. Ethereum is fantastic technology but that doesn't necessarily mean that its market cap is going to go up by 50% every year, or even that the market cap will keep up with the number of new coins being mined each year. And the number of new coins may drop off or it may increase - it isn't set in stone like bitcoin, and even if it were there is a constant supply of new cryptos being introduced that in practical terms also dilute the value to some degree. 

Stay rational, don't bet the entire farm on crypto.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,Something I think is important for us all to remember about Doge as a movement:,"First, I've been lurking for about 2 months and finally decided to make an account so I can participate here! I know new accounts are sometimes viewed as fishy so I want to get that out of the way.

But what I want to say is that we should all keep in mind that Dogecoin isn't a way to make money, it IS money! I know everyone's probably seen that meme here dozens of times but we should all take it to heart and make that part of our message when we talk to family, friends, and really anyone about Dogecoin. I know it's easy to look at it as an investment considering that it will continue to increase in value as Doge gets upgraded and becomes more viable as a currency, but I see people both here and everywhere online who are sitting on stashes of Doge and hoping to make big $ by selling it in the future at a high price.

That's fine, everyone is free to do whatever they want. If you want to convert Doge back into dollars or euros or whatever you use, then you can do that if you so please, but I think it'd be better for us to hope and work for a future where Doge is a completely viable *alternative* to fiat. Instead of cashing out once Doge hits the moon (wherever that is), we just *use it.* I get that for the time being there are a lot of things you still can't use Doge for, so it makes total sense to sell the appropriate amount in those situations. Let's hope we can make a future where we don't have to do that though, because crypto is a superior alternative to fiat in pretty much every way- the biggest thing it's missing is widespread adoption.

I just want to make a point that if all we're looking to do here with Doge is to take it to the ""moon"" and sell, it will never be the good it really can be. Additionally, as Billy has mentioned before, that just means that the people buying in at higher prices are gonna want to take it higher because now they want to get rich too. If you want to get rich with crypto, I think it'd be better to diversify and look at other cryptos that function more like investments in that they are tokens for networks and not purely for payments.

Doge can be and should be more than a way to get rich- it should be a spearhead for a move to a decentralized system. Screw the feds, the banks, the elite, and so on. Nobody can just manufacture trillions of Doge to ""stimulate"" the economy and we don't need the banks to make crypto work... we don't need systems made by the ruling class of the world. How's freeing the world from government-issued currencies for Doing Only Good Everyday? Pretty great, I'd say!

I get wanting to be rich- I'm 19 from a poor family with parents that have always worked basically all day, everyday for all my life. I'm only in college because I busted my butt in school and got a full-ride scholarship (not that college is the only way to succeed), because otherwise it'd be off to wage-slaving because I wouldn't be able to go to trade school or something similar either. I'm fortunate enough to live in the US where even poor is rich compared to many places in the world, but I want to enjoy luxuries in my life and not have to worry about making enough money to simply put a roof over my head.

However, I am not depending on Doge to reach ludicrous prices to get me that life. Smart decisions, investments and hard work now will get me that later. Of course, I won't be mad if Doge does become some $2,000-per-coin currency and it takes me to great wealth, but I will be sad that such a scenario would basically indicate Doge's failure as a legitimate currency and the duty to create a decentralized currency that actually gets used for everyday life would have to fall on another crypto. Let's be honest- nobody is going to *use* something that valuable as a currency, and I know a lot of people here understand that because we trash ""bitcoin as a currency"" because nobody is gonna pay .000042069 bitcoin for their groceries (in addition to it's shortcomings in handling large volumes of transactions effectively). Nobody is gonna pay like that with Doge either.

What we should hope for is Doge to someday be fairly stable and at a reasonable value. It won't make us all rich but it will make it legitimate as a currency and the world will be better because of it. I'm not in Doge because I want to make millions of dollars, I'm in Doge because I want to stop using dollars someday. Not selling now, and I'm never gonna sell no matter how valuable it gets. I'm gonna spend it instead. I encourage everyone to do likewise!

If you read this all, thanks. I'm done now :)

# **Markets await the Fed’s meeting before making the next big move in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/markets-await-the-feds-meeting-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could trade sideways as investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the week ahead. Although the central bank is not expected to take any action, it could make tweaks to its forecasts for interest rates and inflation that market pros say could be market moving.
*****
&gt; Stocks meandered Friday and the S&amp;P 500 finished at a new high, garnering a 0.4% gain for the week.
*****
&gt; “Markets have to get past Wednesday before anyone makes huge bets,” said Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3Live.com. “It’s really that the Street’s looking at the next big obstacle — which is the Fed.”
*****
&gt; The market is attuned to any discussion about the central bank’s bond-buying program. The program was initiated during the pandemic to provide liquidity to the markets and keep interest rates low. The Fed is widely expected to acknowledge it will start tapering back on that so-called quantitative easing program later this year.
*****
&gt; Once the central bank signals it will cut back on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, it is basically signaling a major shift in its policy from easing to tightening. The Fed is expected to signal a taper well before it takes any action, and its own forecast for interest rates does not show any increases through 2023.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell briefs journalists after the central bank issues its statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. He is expected to sound dovish and assure markets the Fed’s policy will remain easy .
*****
&gt; “Let’s say for some reason Powell intimates tapering could happen late this year, not just talk about it but do it,” said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “That would spook the market, or if we get a big increase in inflation projections that would get the markets a little spooked.”
*****
&gt; # Economic calendar
&gt; There are a few economic reports worth watching, particularly Tuesday’s retail sales for May and the producer price index — a look at producer level inflation.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will also release its industrial production index data, which measures production and capacity in manufacturing, mining and other industries, on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “Essentially, I think nominal retail sales might be strong,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. “I just think the only thing that thing the market cares about right now is employment because that’s the only thing that can move the needle on the Fed.”
*****
&gt; The markets this past week shrugged off a super hot consumer inflation reading for May, reported Thursday. Economists said the 5% jump in the consumer price index appears to be a temporary reaction to the reopening economy, supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand. But they also said it will take a few more reports to make sure it is not more persistent than the Fed currently expects.
*****
&gt; The central bank has said it expects inflation to be high for a short period before falling back down, closer to 2%. The Fed will likely raise its forecast of 2.2% for this year, given the jump in recent inflation readings.
*****
&gt; It also predicts that core inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will be at 2% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo’s Schumacher said he is closely watching that inflation forecast, particularly for 2023. According to the Fed’s interest rate forecast, that is also the first time a group of central bank officials see the potential for an increase in the fed funds target rate.
*****
&gt; So if inflation is higher in their view, the outlook for interest rates could be as well. That could move forward the forecast for the first rate hike, now forecast by a majority of the Fed in 2024.
*****
&gt; “If that number goes up a tenth, that’s a non-event. If it goes up 0.3, it’s a lot in terms of the way the Fed looks at the world,” Schumacher said. The Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target for a period of time before it acts.
*****
&gt; Markowska of Jefferies doubts the Fed rate forecast will shift. The forecast is presented in a so-called “dot plot” with anonymous entries from central bank officials.
*****
&gt; She noted in March, Federal Open Market Committee participants were split 11 to 7 against a 2023 hike, which means three officials would have to change their mind in order to move the median forecast.
*****
&gt; “My base case is it won’t move,” she said. “I just feel like there hasn’t been enough definitive change in the data to really change the Fed’s forecast. Having said that, you just need three people to change their mind. Even if that median forecast goes up, Powell is just going to downplay it during the press conference.”
*****
&gt; She pointed to the disappointing May employment report, which showed 559,000 jobs were added, 100,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; # Watch bonds
&gt; Stocks finished the past week mixed, with the Dow down 0.8% at 34,479, and the S&amp;P 500 eking out a gain of 0.4% to finish the week at a record 4,247. The Nasdaq, boosted by tech, gained nearly 1.9% to reach 14,069. Meanwhile the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed the other indices, increasing by 2.2% for the week and landing at 2,335.
*****
&gt; REITs were the best performing major sector for the week, up 2%, followed by the health care sector’s 1.9% gain. Consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.6%. Tech climbed 1.4%, helped by a decline in interest rates.
*****
&gt; But the financial sector lost 2.4% as interest rates fell, and it was the worst performing sector this week. Financials fell with other cyclicals, like materials, off 2% for the week and industrials off 1.7%.
*****
&gt; Meme stocks remained in the headlines and continued to trade with a high level of volatility. GameStop hit a high of $344.66 Tuesday and dropped as low as $206.13 Friday before closing at $233.34 per share.
*****
&gt; Besides the wild ride by meme stocks in the past week, the market to watch was Treasurys, as yields took a surprising slide. There was a fairly dramatic move in the rate of the benchmark 10-year, watched most closely by investors, as it influences mortgages and other important lending rates.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield dipped under 1.43% on Friday. Yields move opposite price, so the move downward represented a buying surge.
*****
&gt; “I feel like this entire move in Treasurys is technical and has nothing to do with fundamentals,” said Jefferies’ Markowska. She said institutions are finding super low yields in Treasury bills and the overnight rates markets. “There’s just an excess of cash that is spilling out to the longer maturities,” she said. “People are still very short.”
*****
&gt; Markowska said the weaker than expected May jobs report spurred buying that forced some short investors, who bet on higher yields, to cover those positions as rates fell.
*****
&gt; The fall in the 10-year yield, which hit a high of 1.75% in late March, has been a positive for stocks. It also has drawn some stock investors to tech and growth sectors, which had fallen out of favor.
*****
&gt; “Most people in the market will tell you yields will rise significantly at some point. The question is when,” said Schumacher. Many forecasters expect the 10-year yield to reach 2% by the end of the year.
*****
&gt; Finally, investors will also be watching headlines from President Joe Biden’s trip to the U.K. and Europe, where he is attending the G-7 and a meeting with NATO allies. He will hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in Geneva.

&gt; # Advance/Decline Lines Support New Highs

&gt; One of our favorite charts to get a quick read on the overall health of the market is a simple comparison of DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 performance to cumulative advance/decline lines. From late October’s low through mid-February all four indexes moved nicely higher essentially in unison. Advance/decline lines were also all trending higher. It was in mid-February that NASDAQ turned briskly lower. Its advance/decline line also turned lower.

&gt; When NASDAQ turned and its advance/decline began trending lower, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 essentially went nowhere and traded in a range. Bullishly, it appears NASDAQ’s advance/decline line appears to have bottomed in mid-May and is on the verge of eclipsing its peak from February. Broad participation across all the major indexes is a bullish sign and is generally indicative of a healthy move higher is underway. S&amp;P 500 closed at a new all-time high today. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are closing in on their respective all-time highs.

&gt; In the near-term, new all-times are likely. However, June is the last month of NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” and historically soon after the start of the second half of the year, around mid-July, markets have stalled out and tended to slip into a sideways to lower trend. Inflation trends and the Fed are two possible catalysts that could clip the market’s wings this year. Inflation could prove to be more than just transitory and at some point, perhaps sooner than expected, the Fed will likely begin tapering asset purchases.

&gt; # Supply Chain Bottlenecks Push CPI Higher

&gt; Make that two consecutive months that CPI inflation has surprised meaningfully to the upside.

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its May inflation report this morning, June 10, revealing that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.6% month over month and 5% year over year. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.7% month over month, and 3.8% year over year. Given strong base effects from rolling off weak data from a year ago, we find the month over month data more informative. With that context, more volatile components that are heavily tied to the economic reopening had the largest effects on the monthly increases, most notably prices for used vehicles, airfare, and rental cars.

&gt; We continue to see strong evidence that supply chain bottlenecks paired with a rapid demand rebound are causing major price increases. The most visible example is in used car and truck prices, which surged 7.3% in May following a historic 10% rise in April. The supply of new vehicles is constrained in the near term because of semiconductor chip shortages, and as a result, used cars and trucks are being bid up in the secondary markets. The good news is that we expect these market imbalances to largely resolve themselves with time as supply, which has a longer ramp-up time than demand, recovers.

&gt; “The inflation outlook has rightfully been top of mind since last month’s blowout report,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Under the hood, though, we think the picture is a bit more sanguine than the headlines would suggest, and still believe inflation will be relatively well-contained over the intermediate-to-long term.”

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, owners’ equivalent rent of primary residences, a measure of rents for non-rent-controlled residences in urban areas, has bounced off depressed levels. The move thus far, though, is likely best described as returning to the pre-pandemic trend rather than threatening to break away to new heights…for now. This measure is critical for future inflation prospects, as it is one of the largest components of CPI and is considered to be less volatile than other components. Movements observed in the series are, therefore, viewed as more structural in nature and thus have the potential to be “stickier.” At the moment, we do not believe that the rent component poses an imminent threat to the broader inflation picture, and is merely displaying an increasing willingness for consumers to rent following a massive shift in preference to own brought on by COVID-19.

&gt; Market-based measures of inflation expectations have also retreated from their fever pitch last month. 10-year breakeven inflation expectations, derived from the differences in nominal and real Treasury yields, have actually fallen since last month’s CPI report, not risen. And while we are hesitant to call that the peak in inflation expectations given ongoing bottlenecks in supply chains, there was a distinct air of a “buy the rumor, sell the news” dynamic to us.

&gt; Taken altogether, we believe the Federal Reserve (Fed) will view today’s inflation data generally as confirmation of its preexisting stance that the majority of excess inflationary pressures will be transitory. In a vacuum, despite the headline inflation beat, this likely does little to change the Fed’s timetable for tapering asset purchases, and the market reaction for now looks to be confirming that view. The coming months will be telling, though, as we are now entering the “show me” phase of the inflation debate where market participants will be increasingly anxious for the Fed to prove its assertion that higher inflation will be transitory.

&gt; # A Closer Look At New Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index is flirting with new highs unlike nearly any time in history. In fact, it has now gone nine days in a row closing within 1% of an all-time high without breaking through. “There’s an old saying about not shorting a dull market. Well, lately it has been about as dull as it gets,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The catch is other times that saw long streaks without a new high, yet very close to one, actually didn’t perform as well as one might expect.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.10-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; Taking things a step further, the S&amp;P 500 has closed within 0.15% of an all-time high without closing at a new high for three straight days. In the history of the S&amp;P 500, that has only happened one other time, in September 1964. Stocks were flat three months later then and up only 2.6% six month later, so although this is only a sample size of one, a sharp move higher in the near term appears less likely.

&gt; We’ve shared this next chart before, but given we are talking about new highs it is important to point it out again. New highs usually happen in clusters that can last for a decade or more. Given this market has been making new highs since 2013, despite the 2020 bear market, history would suggest there could be several more years before this strong run is done.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; Take another look above. This year has a good amount of new highs already and it isn’t even half way over. In fact, 26 new highs over the first five months of the year is the most for any year during the first five months since 32 new highs in 1998.

&gt; Another angle on this: Should the S&amp;P 500 make a new high in June, it would make a new high every month for the first six months of the year. This rare feat last happened in 2014 and 1986 before that. The rest of the year those years added 5.0% and lost 3.5%, respectively.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is only 0.13% away from the last all-time high set back on May 7. Odds do favor another new high will eventually take place, which means this bull market continues. In the LPL Chart of the Day we show that this new bull market is already up 89% in just over a year, giving it one of the best annualized returns ever for a bull market, although bull markets do tend to have strong annualized returns early.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; What happens after stocks make new highs? Here’s a chart we shared last August. The bottom line is investors shouldn’t be scared of new highs, even though many are scared of heights.

&gt; # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

&gt; S&amp;P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

&gt; We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

&gt; # Small Business Pulse Check

&gt; While U.S. economic conditions have certainly improved, and earnings momentum for S&amp;P 500 companies has been strong, U.S. small business conditions remain somewhat less stable. Notably, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index has improved since last year (99.6 in May, up from the 90.9 low in April 2020), and according to the Federal Reserve, perhaps less than 200,000 U.S. small businesses failed due to the pandemic last year. Both figures are likely better than many had expected during the height of 2020’s economic stress. However, the aggregate economic foundation of small business in this country probably has a ways to go before it fully recovers. This may create more instability at this point in the recovery than is typically seen. The message here is that while most high-frequency economic data indeed looks good, we should remain mindful of still unstable areas of the economy that may not show up in many data sets.

&gt; Fortunately, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) provides economic and market participants with various survey results that deal with specific elements of small business operation. The NFIB not only surveys optimism, but they also compile data on hiring plans, compensation plans, capex plans, quality of labor, and sales expectations…among other items. Review of these data series indicates to us that there is still work left to do to get U.S. small businesses back on solid footing. As we can see from the LPL Chart of the Day below, business owners remain somewhat hesitant about their capital expenditure plans while hiring plans have trended more firmly with optimism. Still, other data tells us that NFIB survey respondents are cautious as to whether now is a good time to expand their business. Meanwhile, the surveys show that small business owners are indeed having a hard time finding quality labor and the cost of labor is rising, thus making job openings hard to fill.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Recent NFIB data tells us that small businesses have gotten off the floor following the pandemic punch, but the black eye on a formidable part of the U.S. economy still lingers. With post-COVID economic re-openings in full swing, we remain hopeful that small businesses will soon recover enough to add that final boost to domestic conditions,” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

&gt; While small business conditions will be something to watch carefully through 2021 and into next year, we believe pent-up consumer demand could bode well for many establishments. We are expecting a robust summer traveling season that could have consumers readily opening their wallets. This may translate into further improvements in the NFIB optimism trend, provided that business owners find a solution to their current labor struggles.

CryptoCurrency,Reminder for the vets and ideas for newbies,"Inflation running is running rampant, but, every dollar printed at the Fed is probably $0.01 per dollar created being put directly into Bitcoin or Crypto assets as a hedge from the people who are given that money. 

Bitcoin vs Gold as an industrial store of value in terms of both liquidity and transferability, it’s not close. Bitcoin is far beyond the greatest universal store of value ever created, until another Crypto sends it to 2nd.

Decentralized Internet means (the highest probability of) freedom from censorship. This digital revolution is one much larger than dollars earned, it’s about the liberty achieved along the way. Whether that be liberty from a bad government or a bad boss, the idea remains the same, the more freedom you have, the easier the Pursuit of Happiness gets.

Stake if you can! Digital assets realize compound interest just like money, so why not give yourself a better ability to be a crypto whale by staking your crypto? You’ll earn rewards in the appreciating assets themselves, so you get the opportunity to accumulate passively!

Lastly, protect your assets! Write down your keys and store them safely! You have the ability to really mess up and lose money if you lose your keys or send crypto to the wrong wallet address!

Enjoy the ride!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Receiving a small inheritance in the form of Vanguard shares and would like ideas on how to approach it,"I'm receiving my late grandmother's Vanguard shares, about $10,000 worth of Windows II (VWNAX). This is the first time I've ever received money like this and am not quite sure how to make the best of it, and would love some opinions on how best to maximize this gift within the context of my situation.

I'm 30, American, always been freelance/self-employed, though at times I've had a ""real job"" (never with benefits, though). Due to primarily being freelance, I've always required having most of my cash liquid and thus haven't been able to save for retirement as much as I'd have liked. The vast majority of my retirement savings are via a SEP IRA, though I do have a traditional IRA and Roth IRA for...reasons. I don't really touch them and focus on maximizing contributions as much as possible/reinvesting the interest in my SEP IRA.

I'm currently being forced to change careers due to a most-likely-permanent health issue. For the time being, I work part-time and get by, but just barely. Thus, saving for retirement is still hard. I have a lot of medical bills and just can't afford to put stay away, so my current strategy has been to consistently save small chunks (~$100/month) for retirement, and then put whatever's left that I can afford to lose into a brokerage account. 

I've managed to put away the following, rounded to the nearest hundred:

* Business checkings: $32,000
* Personal checkings: $$3,000
* Ally savings account: $3,500
* Vanguard brokerage account (mostly in VTSAX, plus a select few company's shares here and there): $9,000
* Vanguard SEP IRA (all in VTSAX): $4,500 
* Vanguard Traditional IRA (all in VTI): $200
* Vanguard Roth IRA: $900

I also have a tiny amount of student loan debt left, about $1,700 (almost there after 8 years!), and thankfully haven't had to touch it during the pandemic. I don't really plan to make payments on it again until I have to. I also need to replace a cracked windshield in my car (will cost about $1,000), but honestly I don't care -- it's not a high priority for me. No other big expenses/debt.

Compared to some windfalls I've seen on here, this is nothing, but again, this is the first time anything like this has happened to me. It's a massive (for me), unexpected change, and I'm incredibly thankful. It's really taking the pressure off.

I'm working to change careers to programming; I'm studying and working towards that, but have a long ways to go. In the meantime, I don't *need* these Windows II shares to survive. I was making it and have every reason to believe that I would continue to do so, though I am admittedly on the edge of a knife. The aforementioned Windsor II shares are being transferred to my brokerage account, though of course I can do whatever I want with them once they finish transferring. The concerns/goals I'm balancing are: catching up on retirement as much as I can; growing the money I have to compensate for low employment opportunities/high living expenses; *securing* the money I have in light of potential massive inflation on the horizon (I'm pretty risk-averse). Here are the options I've considered thus far:

* Contribute the cash to my retirement account(s). **Pros**: I'm very much behind of where I'd like to be in terms of retirement, and this would help catch me up a decent amount. **Cons**: I'm afraid of locking this money away, as I'm still in a very unstable situation. It seems that a better strategy would be to keep my eye on the ball towards my career change, and with it hopefully a better, more consistent salary (and perhaps even finally a job with benefits), and use this cash to buy me some runway in getting there.

* Contribute the cash to my woefully under-contributed Ally emergency savings account. **Pros**: Hooray for 5 digits of FDIC-insured money! **Cons**: These shares are a gift and therefore I'm getting them tax-free; selling the shares would kick in some taxes. Also, savings account interest rates are so low that I'm inclined to just keep it all in Vanguard. I've even considered transferring the $3.5k in my Ally account to Vanguard for this reason...

* Exchange the Windsor II shares for VTSAX (or another solid index). **Pros**: Retain the tax-free nature of this windfall, and just move to a higher-performing (yet still diversified) index. If contributed to VTSAX, my reinvesting dividens/capital gains would finally be pretty significant! **Cons**: None that I see? Unless someone has an idea of something other than VTSAX -- I'm obviously pretty heavily allocated in that direction, but then again all of my research keeps bringing me back to it. It really does seem to the be the best mix of growth, diversification, and low expense ratio.

* A mix of some sort. Maybe contribute enough to the personal IRAs' VTIs so that I can exchange for VTSAX, thusly being able to automatically reinvest the dividends/capital gains, and then keep the remaining ~$5,000 in my brokerage account? Or put a couple thousand in the SEP IRA, leave the other two IRAs alone, and keep the remaining ~$8,000 in the brokerage account?

* Any other ideas -- I'm open to whatever! Including some wider strategy changes, not just limited to the Windsor II shares windfall. What would you do in this situation?

personalfinance,I need some advice. Orphaned and starting college in the fall completely w/o assistance from family.,"As stated in the title, both of my parents have already passed away. I'm 18 currently and planning on starting college this fall. I have already made advancements towards getting enrolled and showing that I will be attending the college beginning this year (I think it's too late to step back and take a gap year). I will not be receiving financial assistance from my extended family in regards to my tuition, housing, and other costs. I have filed my FAFSA (I had to file as independent and made sure to put my EFC as zero).

My estimated cost of attendance is roughly 40,000 (I am required to live on campus so this includes housing and related costs). I qualified for $9,500 in federal student loans, $6,895 between the Pell and SEOG Grants, a $4,500 work study, and a $10,000 merit scholarship from the University itself ($26,395 minus the work study). I have applied for other scholarships but either didn't receive the award or am still waiting for results to be announced. This leaves nearly $13,000 I have to pay upfront (work study earnings will be added to my tuition as I do it, it's not an upfront payment). As I am currently completely uninsured so I'd to purchase the medical insurance plan offered to students through the University (another $3,100 per year which is added to my bill).

I'm required to be a full time student to keep the $10,000 scholarship and my work study will be 15 hours a week so I don't believe I will have the time to work while I am in school. I'm very stressed out about being able to ""make it."" I'm not sure who to reach out to or what organizations I can contact for assistance. I have a meeting with my academic advisor in a few weeks and I plan on asking them about campus resources and for their advice as well. I suppose I'm looking for some perspective from somebody outside of my school specifically. I feel a bit lost.

College is what I have dreamed about for years now and I really don't want money to be the one thing that keeps me from experiencing it.",finance

## When did Capitalism die? September 2019.

Since 1978 the Business Roundtable has regularly issued Principles of Corporate Governance. Cue Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, who also reigns as Chairman of the Business Roundtable.

For Jamie, the tension had been building for years, at least since the 2008 crisis, if not before. First, the people had even come to Occupy Wall Street. But in the end, no heads would roll after the banks oopsied, America is *not* France. And no one went to jail, this is Wall Street not The Wire, but the people still weren’t shutting up. They were, for one reason or another, mad at the unfairness of it all. And when the peasants complained, it was a king’s duty to listen.

In 2019, nothing made the peons more angry than climate change. For decades companies had been growing growing growing. Oil built the American empire. But fossil fuels had come with a catch, although neither the companies nor the consumers who were using it had to pay, and that catch is called carbon.

When two actors in a marketplace don’t have to pay a cost, but the public does, that is called a *negative externality*. It’s not so negative for CEOs and shareholders, but dire for baby seals and unborn humans. A younger generation woke up to the tragic bill Boomers would be passing on to them. The climate problem could no longer be ignored, and so stepped in the Business Roundtable, to make the people feel heard.

In September of 2019 capitalism died. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, regally committed his fellow CEOs to look beyond profit and to lead their companies for the benefit of **all** stakeholders.

# Business Roundtable Redefines the Purpose of a Corporation to Promote ‘An Economy That Serves All Americans’

What an admission of guilt! They're blatantly admitting that the economy *doesn't serve all Americans*. Corporations benefit only the interests of their shareholders, those lucky enough and privileged enough to be born in the right country to the right parents with the right skin and enough money.

Despite the headlines, Jamie and the Business Roundtable didn’t do anything to change the system. To be fair to them, they couldn’t. There is no other design for a company than a company. There is no pay more aligned than stocks.

So there was no change in incentives for JP Morgan or anyone else. Jamie Dimon is still paid in millions in stock every year. The shareholders still owned the company. The executives still make all the decisions. Nothing changed, and people were pissed about it.

Jamie Dimon can see all this happening in real time. The climate is changing; it is hotter than ever before at his Hamptons estate. He and companies all over the world are adding carbon, and they don’t have a real reason to stop. In fact, the entire design of a corporation is to be profit-maximizing. So the only thing he can do is to *ask them to stop* \- to, please, please think of the starving children.

No change meant everyone was left to trust in the benevolence of their reigning CEO. In effect, to trust executives to act *against* their own economic interests because they can’t account for the true cost of climate change on their balance sheets. What Jamie is really doing is admitting to the failure of the system of incentives itself, the system we call capitalism.

*What Jamie is really saying is capitalism is broken and you’re just going to have to trust us.*

But capitalism, as originally defined, meant that you *don’t* have to trust people to do the right thing; the right thing is supposed to be the profitable thing, the better thing for everyone. Capitalism trusts in the competitive nature of humanity and the survival instinct. It trusts that Gordon Gecko was right after all, greed is good.

In a free market, real capitalism, the weak will die, the strong will survive, and we will all be better off than before. Economist John Maynard Keynes famously predicted a society so prosperous that people would hardly have to work.

Darwin observed this natural law and called it the Theory of Evolution. Adam Smith observed this Invisible Hand at work and called it Creative Destruction.

And Jamie Dimon was saying that it’s dead.

## The Corporate Monopoly: Economic Feudalism and the Tyranny of Centralization

In the late 1700s, religious refugees confiscated enough land in America to wipe the slate clean (of Indigenous peoples) and begin a grand experiment in decentralization. Our founding fathers loved decentralization so much that they declared independence from centralization and enshrined decentralization in a protocol we call the Constitution. The protocol was simple by design: one (white, rich) person one vote. They spent years, treasure and more than a few lives so that they could use this new protocol. It was radical.

And the Old World was sure it was doomed. Monarchies from the Pharaohs to the Khans to the artist formerly known as Prince Harry had been the sure way, the only way to keep from absolute anarchy for hundreds of years. Sure, there had been some hiccups. In the 1200s the people hailed The Magna Carta, which basically said that kings couldn’t screw you over. Unsurprisingly, the rulers didn’t keep their word, because, well, they didn't have to. They had a monopoly on governance. If you were mad at your local King, where could you go? Next door lived a King just as bad and he played squash with your guy at St. Barts.

The American Revolution, and George Washington’s incredible decision to decline being King-for-life, set up an experiment in a decentralized form of governance we call democracy. And when the collective energy and insight of democracy competes against the centralized power of monarchies, democracy wins. Today, there mainly exist monarchies in name only. Monarchs are typically good for a nice wedding, a long funeral and, when things get testy, an interview with Oprah.

In the last few hundred years we've learned a couple things. Democracy good. Decentralization good.

There’s a reason that the game of Monopoly ends when someone has a monopoly. It’s not fun to play anymore. When your dad owns Park Place, Boardwalk, all the Railroads, 95% of the money and insists on being the banker too, that’s what’s called *regulatory capture*. Regulatory capture is being “too big to fail”.

Once capture occurs, the only real option is to clear the board, preferably with your dad’s head still on his shoulders, and to restart the game.

The problem with restarting, changing forms of governance, is that, well, it’s usually messy. Khans roll you up in a carpet and stomp on you when you try to take their power. Pharaohs are simpler, they bury you with them. And Monarchs would gladly keep you alive...and colonized.

In today’s world, people have more trust in businesses than they do their own governments. Corporations are our kingdoms, and CEOs our kings.

Mark Zuckerberg put the former Commander in Bleach in Facebook-jail. Jack Dorsey actually injected the Big Orange Twitter account with bleach. They unilaterally decided on a *digital death sentence*. You tell me, who is in charge here?

*All hail the age of Economic Feudalism. All hail Kingdom Capitalism.*

Competition, however, is coming. Crypto Capitalism, and creative destruction, is eyeing the top-down corporation and it’s consumer-driven business model for disruption. Kingdoms, like corporations, have all the value and decisions flow up to the top. We the people know that democracy will win out.

*Down with the King!*

## The Currency Monopoly: the US Dollar and the Inevitable Debasement

Monopoly, or its cousin Oligopoly, is bad. It’s the end-game of bad capitalism and against the nature of free competition. In fact, as your dad knows, monopolies are not fun for you, but they are profitable for him.

Governments don't only enforce a monopoly of corporate design on us, but of currency as well. Wherever you happen to be born determines the currency you are allowed to use. They’ll put your body in jail otherwise. And no one has figured out yet how to leave their bodies...and come back, at least not yet. That might be changing though.

Immigration is people opting out of one system and adopting another. People vote with their feet on how they are governed and which currencies they’d like to use. This usually entails climbing into an old rickety boat with dangerous strangers if you’re lucky, and swimming alone if you’re not.

Some people come to vote, other people come to make bread and still some others to avoid inconvenient murdering. But people all over the world are discovering that they don’t have to learn to swim to use a new currency. No, opting out is now just a click away. A migration to digital currency and digital assets is already underway. The digital New World is manifesting right now.

Why would you even want to use a digital currency anyway? Well, one word, debasement. Debasement has been going on since money has been around.

Romans used gold coins as currency. When the government ran out of money they took the gold from the people's coins and made more for themselves. This is debasement.

Mongols used paper as money, paper that represented gold. When the government ran out of paper money they just printed more paper money. This is also debasement.

As you've probably noticed, neither the Romans nor Mongols are around to argue for debasement. It worked, until it didn't. (For reference, the Romans lasted roughly 1400 years and the Mongols 162. America is currently in year 244.)

Americans use fiat currency, fiat because it's not tied to the value of anything but our confidence in the government itself. It has value by government fiat. When the government ran out of fiat they just lower interest rates and the banks ""print"" more on a computer. The government calls it quantitative easing, your bank account might call it *taxation by inflation*. This is also, you guessed it, debasement.

Inflation is your money not buying as much stuff over time. And taxation by inflation is the government buying stuff with that value. You can feel it when you see stocks reach all time highs in the middle of a pandemic that has completely shut down most jobs. Suddenly, you can't make any more money, and the money you do have buys 50% less stocks. How does that make sense?

Millennials are working more hours than ever before, but none of them expect to have more than their parents. There are more billionaires and millionaires now than ever before, but the average American can't afford a $500 expense. The markets and the economy have decoupled. That's what printing infinite money does. First it greases the wheels, and soon enough it's just all grease.

Taxation by inflation is the sneaky way the American empire taxes its subjects. Here's the SparkNotes on Empire Building: dominate a World War and at the end establish your dollar as the reserve currency of the world. Then print a lot of those dollars and give it to US banks. So now it’s not only American citizens feeding the empire, but the Mexicans and Canadians and Japanese and every country we saved or bombed since World War II.

The US government can do this because they have a monopoly on currency. Caesar and Kublai would be proud, if they weren't so dead.

Not to worry, the digital New World is only one-click away.

## The New New World is Digital.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakomoto slithered into the online New World called the internet, quietly wrote The Digital Magna Carta and stamped it Bitcoin.

This new technology, the blockchain, allows for the creation of decentralized organizations that will be funded by a new form of capitalism. Basically, it’s democratizing money and the power that goes with it. And like democracy, this model is better, faster, stronger, creates more value, is more reliable, more transparent, more scalable and shifts power and value to the people, the users. Like any revolution, it's not going to solve all of our problems, but it is certainly better than what we were doing before.

Now, every stakeholder can be a shareholder. His vision now come true, Jamie Dimon would be proud, if he weren’t so scared.

## A New Money for the New World.

Money is as old as dirt. Or as old as the price of dirt certainly. The Sumerians, who people like to describe as ancient, but who would never describe themselves that way, invented the first words to describe....money. It was a ledger. From seashells to stones, silver to gold, paper to digits, money is literally as old as recorded history and the technology has been constantly evolving since then too.

The latest innovation in money is Bitcoin. For my own sanity, I will use Bitcoin as a generic interchangeable term for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based coins and tokens. It is a bit misleading sometimes, but less jargon, although less accurate, will, I hope, increase the focus on the benefits and application instead. Let’s focus on the forest, the trees will sort themselves.

So what is Bitcoin? Is it a store of value, like gold? Is it a medium of exchange, like the dollar? Is it an asset, like a stock? Is it a network, like the internet? The short answer is yes.

There are 21 million Bitcoins and there never will be any more. Never. That's what makes it the hardest, toughest, meanest money ever to exist. Compare that to gold, the next toughest money, and gold is mined at 2% more per year with no assurances that number won't go up. Some prospector is trying to make that 2% into 3% right now. The US dollar you say, well, that’s inflated at whatever rate the Fed needs to so that the stock market goes whee!

Typically that's 3%, if you trust their measurements, but a multiple of that if you look at real asset prices. That 3% looks tiny, but it is no small thing! At 3% inflation the value of your dollar or bar of gold is cut in half in only 20 years. In 50 years it'll be worth only 20%.

But if you own one Bitcoin, you have stored the value of your money into something that will never, ever see debasement. There's no probability or trust needed, no hanging onto the exact adjectives some central banker uses or the dumb luck of some prospector in the Outback, the code itself sets a hard cap. It's the hardest of the hard caps, we're talking rock hard, we're talking eggplant emoji hard. **That’s why Bitcoin is a store of value.**

So Bitcoin is a store of value, but is it a currency? A Bitcoin can be divided into 100 millionths. These are very small units called a Satoshi. You can spend your Satoshis as official currency in El Salvador. And from lambos to pizza, you can spend Bitcoin to buy things all over the world. **That’s why Bitcoin is a currency.**

Alright, so I can buy things with Bitcoin, that much was obvious, but how is it an asset? Well if you own Bitcoin, you also own a representative share of the Bitcoin network. That value increases with use and adoption. Transaction fees and rewards create more Bitcoin so miners will process your transactions and you can mine Bitcoin if you want to too. The more people use the technology, the more value it has and the more it appreciates. **That’s why Bitcoin is an asset.**

## More Than an Investment, it's also a Disruptive Technology.

What I didn’t understand until lately is that Bitcoin is not just an investment in a combo store of value-currency-asset. It is also a technology. It is a technology that has the potential to transform the economy by creating a new user-centered business model.

OK sure, but what does that look like? Well, it could mean a greener future where a decentralized transportation network will replace Uber.

Let's build a decentralized Uber competitor together. We can call it CARS. First, the biggest difference is that CARS will not be owned or controlled by one corporation. The ownership of the platform will ebb and flow with the ownership of its coins.

The folks that own CARS coin could include network suppliers (car owners) and customers (riders) as well as the developers (CARS Inc. initially, but anyone over time) and investors (anyone with access to a crypto exchange). Importantly, CARS Inc. won't hold the majority of CARS coins, and the network will be run by a bunch of strangers with computers. Decisions will be made by all the CARS coin holders together.

How does it work? Investors can buy CARS coin to contribute to the purchase of vehicles to get the network started. Then, in order to use the service, riders will need to purchase CARS coins to pay for rides. People who own cars may need to purchase CARS coins as collateral for their car to be included in the fleet, thereby earning them ride fees paid in, you guessed it, CARS coins.

Everyone who purchases CARS coin also has a share of the CARS network, so everyone is aligned.

When a ride is given it will be paid for in CARS coin and a portion of the transaction fees will return to the network to incentivize security and other useful things like marketing and referrals. When the network expands with either more money for more cars or new riders and routes for more fees, all shareholders benefit. Because nearly all stakeholders are compelled to become shareholders, more stakeholders are benefitting than ever before.

So, when you buy $10 of CARS coin for rides, you’re *also* buying $10 of the CARS network with all the benefits, voting rights and potential rewards that come with it. It’s a more inclusive corporation that creates more value for everyone involved; blockchain has removed the giant squid sucking the value between car owners and the riders and replaced it with a protocol that sucks less.

In fact, it has made owners and riders one and the same. You own the network *and* you get rides. Without a greedy company concerned about its quarterly numbers, rides with CARS will be cheaper while everyone can have a slice of the profit and also have a say in its decisions.

CARS Inc. gave up direct control of the CARS network. In return the company has cheap access to capital and also gained the power of incentivizing all of its stakeholders to grow the network together. That's the viralest of marketing.

This system of incentives creates an entirely new way to create, run, own, make and monetize networks and markets.

## The Blockchain Business Model is Going to Win.

Some of the best, most lasting disruptions have come from similar changes in business models. It's not always clear how it will play out though. Online shopping led to drone deliveries, free digital photos led to an insurrection, and streaming led to the death of the ""burned"" CD. Bummer, dude.

The new Blockchain Business Model isn't going to win because it's better for the people, though that's a nice side effect. It's going to win because it's more competitive. It will deliver services cheaper, be adopted faster and it will out innovate it's centralized competition.

## It's Cheaper to Use and Attracts More Users Too.

Things get really cheap really fast when you can use stuff that's sitting around doing nothing, like parked cars or charging cell phones. We call that *underutilized capacity*. Who has a lot of underutilized capacity? We do.

A trustless protocol means a reduction in cost to securing a contract, meaning the average human can now contract *directly* with some other average human to rent out driving time in their car or sell some extra processing power. Every car is an Uber and every cell phone is an Amazon Web Services in its own right, just waiting to spit money at its owner.

And when users have the choice of using a network they have no ownership of and can't make any money from, and one which they do, the choice will be obvious. You go where you're paid, and the Blockchain Business Model pays for users with all the extra cash it isn't paying to corporate executives.

The blockchain unlocks two new ideas: decentralized control and trustless protocols. Decentralized control because the user has a vote. And trustless protocols because there's no middleman.

There’s a reason America has to build a very huge, very erect wall on our southern border. Democracy and decentralization attracts the most users, because users want a say in how things are run.

With Bitcoin people vote with their feet too. If Bitcoin developers propose an upgrade and not enough users implement it, then the proposal fails. Other blockchains have similar but differing strategies that get to the end result; it is the community that decides. Why is this important? It is important because people *want to have a say*. They will move heaven and earth for a say in what's going on around them. Just look at the border.

## It's Evolving Faster Than Its Competition and It Won't Stop.

Decentralization also pushes innovation to the edges, creating more of it. In this way, Bitcoin is like the internet. When someone finds a cool new use for the internet it's copied easily and distributed widely.

That’s in stark contrast to networks today that are controlled by a central authority. Once Facebook establishes dominance on social media or Google becomes the only search engine, they aren’t incentivized to continue to innovate.

What they do is they turn their monopoly into regulatory capture and use their money to buy anywhere else you might go. Why does Facebook own Instagram and Whatsapp? They're doing the very hard work of squeezing every ounce of margin they can from their users, because, well, their users have nowhere else to go. More ads, more data, more targeted content, more revenue and nowhere to go.

## Remove Evil Middlemen and Make Money Doing It.

I devoted a few paragraphs to tech mumbo jumbo here, but I realized that you probably don’t really care to hear ledger this, smart contract that, block rewards yada yada.

Simply put, blockchain will remove middlemen by using code instead. Removing middlemen and replacing them with a protocol *while still having trust* is no small thing. That's the magic of blockchain. You see, protocols are really efficient because they’re not humans, they don't need *anything*. And as protocols replace platforms, we're all going to win.

Jeff Bezos, who built a shopping platform, and Elon Musk, who built a hype platform, might both have the unstoppable urge to build gigantic, competing penises to send to space, but a software protocol doesn't feel the need to do that. At least I hope not.

It is *hard* to invent such a protocol, but it generates a LOT of value. In turn, that value can be passed back to the users. There's already the first evidence this might work. Here's a small sampling of things you could potentially get paid for, how much they pay and the crypto network doing the paying:

* Browse the internet (up to $7/month) - BAT
* Play video games (up to $5000/month) - AXIE
* Connect a router (up to $600/month) - HNT
* Own a computer (up to $150/month) - CUDOS
* Store US dollars (12% APR+) - USDC
* Secure a network (up to 5-100% APR+) - any PoS Blockchain

And this is just the start. Middlemen are so onerous, that we had to pay to do the same things we will be paid for. Read that again. We paid for stuff when it should've been paying us.

*Instead of paying for Internet Explorer, it pays you. That's Brave Browser and it exists today!* This is happening all over the internet. Suddenly cost centers turn into revenue generators. A new computer is no longer an expense, but an investment that comes with a stable income. A new phone is no longer only for the gram, but a lifeline to float above poverty.

The old business model, peer to corporation to peer, is broken, and a new one emerges, the peer to **protocol** to peer, giving the value back to the users and the network that they own.

Steam sells video games, and takes a 30% cut for doing, basically, nothing. They are a digital store that has a monopoly on users, so they can charge what they want. But a crypto video game market (UOS) can decrease that cost by 2/3 because once a protocol is set-up, there's no real overhead. They’ll even let users resell their old video games, which Steam does not allow. When video games went digital, we somehow ended up going *backwards* in terms of user rights. Not too long ago I could sell my copy of Age of Empires II back to Gamestop. Steam just laughs in my face.

And as blockchain evolves there will be even more opportunities to get utilization and value out of your time and capital, transforming the activities we do and don’t value and who gets to do it.

Yesterday it cost money to play video games, today you can get paid if you're good enough and tomorrow *anyone* can get paid to play. Our kids will be thinking *wow, our parents got screwed* as they sell the Nathrian Crusader’s Bastard Sword that just dropped for actual money they can spend anywhere on the internet.

Cell phones were once a huge expense for the world’s poor, but tomorrow they could transform the lives of a billion of the most needy; when you’re living on $2 even a few cents per day makes a huge difference, and some estimate that phones could provide up to $10 worth of compute per month.

With digital currencies you could give underprivileged folks money *directly* (which is new), or better yet you could give them the capital to invest in a Golden Goose cell phone.

If we don’t ruin it first, we could help a *lot* of people.

## Crypto Capitalism and the User Basic Income Will Save Capitalism.

Andrew Yang ran unsuccessfully for president. It was mainly unsuccessful because he didn’t win. And, like most things, he was told by the media what his definition of winning is and whether he did or did not do it.

Andrew’s presidential campaign wasn’t groundbreaking because Andrew was Asian, he was much too Asian to be a minority, but his campaign *was* successful and groundbreaking, everyone agreed, because he talked a lot about something called the Freedom Dividend. The Freedom Dividend was also known as not letting others starve and also known as eliminating poverty and also known as UBI. In an age where the average American couldn't afford an unexpected $500 expense, just giving money to the poor was seen as a radical idea.

It was so radical, in fact, that Martin Luther King Jr. got shot and died trying to get the poor a guaranteed income. Andrew Yang only died inside a little when he tried to.

UBI stands for *Universal* Basic Income. Universal because it means everyone. It’s happening in far away places like Alaska and other places with lots of oil and few concerns about the climate. But it’s probably not going to happen for everyone, no matter how hard Andrew Yang campaigns.

This is for two reasons, one, half the country thinks that it’s communism (it’s not) and, two, more importantly, because *America won’t have to*. Soon, every American, every human, can opt-in to the digital New World and receive a *User* Basic Income. User Basic Income will save capitalism. Maybe.

## Human Capitalism vs Crypto Capitalism

Andrew Yang coined the term Human Capitalism, and defined it has having three main values:

* Humanity is more important than money
* The unit of an economy is each person, not each dollar
* Markets exist to serve our common goals and values

His main point is that we need to measure something other than money to fix the system. I disagree. We're not measuring the wrong thing. *We're using the wrong money.*

# We're not measuring the wrong thing. We're using the wrong money.

Instead, I'd propose the following values for Crypto Capitalism:

* Humanity has the right to their **choice of money**
* The unit of an economy is each **user**, not each dollar
* The users should own the networks

Crypto Capitalism means users go from being *exploited* to being *incentivized*.

For too long we've been using money that's soft as tissues, and watched as the government took it from us directly via taxes and, most insidiously, indirectly via inflation. With harder internet money humanity can finally communicate to each other what they really value, without greedy governments and oppressive monopolies manipulating the prices.

The difference between a human and user is that a human opts-in to the living world and a user opts-in to the digital world. Over time, those things will overlap more and more. But, importantly, you will be *paid* for your presence in the digital world. Your online presence is your digital vote and it also happens to be the fuel for the entire system. Getting paid to *use* the system, not getting used *by* the system, that's User Basic Income. But, you have to login.

Socialists want to make sure the workers own the means of production. They're right, kind of. Kingdom Capitalism has been trying to separate the workers from their capital for hundreds of years, and pretty successfully too. That's why we have the highest level of income inequality today than ever before. Socialism has been losing for a long time.

But balancing Kingdom Capitalism shouldn’t be Socialism, we've been trying to do that for generations, but instead a new kind of capitalism, Crypto Capitalism. Even if we got Socialism, it's already broken. Remember, Socialism is ensuring the *workers* own the *means of production*. You *have to work* to be a worker. In Socialism you're not counted if you don't work. And the other part of Socialism, the means of production, is worthless in the digital realm. Copy and paste is *very* easy. Copy and paste is *very* easy. See, I just did it. Production by itself is not valuable.

With Crypto Capitalism the *users* should own the *networks*. You don't need to work, you just need to login. You're not valuable because you work. You're valuable because you engage. Because you are a user. And what we care about, what we need to own, are the networks themselves. That's where the value is. Making custom dog bowls is cool, but owning Etsy is better.

We will see a huge wave of immigrants to the digital New World soon. As soon as they realize that the centralized real-world is currently debasing and inflating away from them, there will be no other logical choice. Where else can you find hard money, real returns and digital rights? Venezuelans already know that Bitcoin is the answer.

Crypto Capitalism means that the appropriately named FAANG companies can no longer suck my data for blood money. No, it means that I can opt-out of *their* system and into *our* network. I can vote through my usage and get value from it too. It means I have rights. It means I own my digital self and the networks I invest my time in. It means no false choice between which monopoly gets to exploit my data, whether its the Apple vampire or the Google leech. It means a new definition of company, to become the company that we, collectively, keep: a digital co-op, scaled to the distant masses. And it also means access to basic services and income for billions of unbanked, unconnected and underserved.

*Only I get to suck my own data, damnit!*

## Lots of Risk, Asymmetric Rewards.

Let’s talk about risks, there are quite a few.

## Beware the Many Crypto Scams and Criminals.

I’ll begin with scams. They’ve been around for a while.

One of the first books in mass production was the bible, and the church used these prints to justify a 10% tithe on income in return for services rendered *in the afterlife*. That's right, the idea is that you pay now and you will benefit *after you die*. That sounds like a sc...nevermind. In 1907 Alexander Graham Bell called San Francisco from New York for the first time ever. The next call he received was from someone asking for his Social Security number. It’s rumored, but never proven, that a certain Nigerian prince, not Al Gore, invented email.

Scams are everywhere. In fact, scams are so ubiquitous, and have been going on for so long, that they’ve permeated and been elevated by our culture, to the point where someone who commits a scam is a *scam artist*. So will people get scammed using crypto? Yes.

But have you stopped going to church, talking on the phone, checking your email or texting your friends because of scams? No, you haven’t. The value outweighs the risks, and with enough diligence you can avoid the obvious. I mean, I couldn’t, but you could.

The majority of use is and will be legit, like every technology before it. The rest is fear-mongering.

## A Return to Corporate Tyranny is Possible.

America originally won its freedom and almost gave it away just as quickly.

Even after they fought a revolution over whether or not they could use their newly invented “voting” protocol, the habit energy of trusting, maybe even needing, central authority was too hard to shake. *We won the war, but George, will you please be king* ***forever***\*? Despite the sacrifice, they were prepared to give it all back! Back then we were one narcissist away from a return to centralization. And we *still are* today.

All because you get democracy, doesn’t mean you get to keep democracy. All because you get decentralization, doesn’t mean you get to keep decentralization. That much is clear from the January 6th insurrection.

And crypto isn’t immune to this; if the DOGE army had its way, Elon would be king of crypto, cars and the power of the sun. He might still be.

But the thing is, decentralization makes it *much harder* for would-be tyrants, especially because the status quo we currently have is *already* de facto tyranny. The company as a kingdom is already here, you just refuse to see it that way.

Democracy makes it harder, but not impossible, for fascists to rule over us. And crypto will make it harder, but not impossible, for monopolistic titans to squeeze us.

In the future you'll have your choice of decentralization. Some cryptos will be one user, one vote. Others will be one dollar, one vote. A lot will be in between. Arguably, after Citizen's United, we're already living in a world where it's one dollar, one vote. It's a pretty crappy voting protocol.

Soon, if there isn't already, there will be a lot of debate and experiments to see how all this decentralization should work. When America first began our Founding Fathers dueled each other, shot each other, murdered each other, over such debate. It's going to be messy, but probably not *that* messy.

The forces of nationalism might still prevail, there is no telling if some people would rather just descend into fascism than experience a relative loss. They can just take their ball and go home if they really want. For every graceful winner there’s a sore loser, and some lose louder than others. As light as it is today, the Dark Ages are never too far away. All because that would be a lose-lose situation, doesn’t mean it can’t happen, it just *probably* won’t.

The Kings of Capitalism aren’t going silently into the night. There is a non-zero chance that we face a North Korea-like digital crackdown or a China-like Great Firewall. Or something new we haven't experienced yet.

## Regulation, Malevolent or Simply Misguided, It Doesn't Matter.

But even in the worst case, even if Crypto Prohibition passes, there is no killing crypto. Prohibition didn’t work for alcohol or weed and it won’t work for crypto too.

In fact, Bitcoin is even harder to stop than drugs. There’s no physical thing to stop. To ban crypto you would need to ban electricity. Crypto can get around *without internet access*.

Sure, some governments can try to ban crypto, but then most digital citizens can just move to a part of the internet that isn’t regulated or that they can VPN across. China has already banned crypto five times.

## Conclusion

One of my favorite books is *Factfulness* by Hans Rosling. To sum it up, humanity has seen less violence, less death, more life right now than ever before. So if we’re not trending toward the Dark Ages, where are we going?

The Exponential Age, says Raoul Pal at Real Vision. The greatest *value redistribution* in the history of mankind he says. And he might not be wrong.

But I think it will also, probably, be the greatest *value creation* in the history of mankind.

We'll go from corporate feudalism to decentralized networks. From currency by geography to an unimaginable choice of digital moneys wherever you are. Globally accessible devices, currencies, markets, investment opportunities, services, passive income and asset-types.

Already what was once the exclusive realm of venture capitalists has been open to the common woman. Just buy a coin, and you're invested in your favorite start-up.

The next Amazon and Apple are being built today, using a business model that will crush their centralized peers. And we all have access to use and invest in them right now.

One day, blockchain networks will push themselves onto us...and we’ll love it. We’ll be faced with a deal that is too good to pass up. It'll be a deal we *can't* refuse. A free phone that makes money, a video game that pays me, web browsing that pays, a savings account that actually produces real returns. We can say no, but we won’t, and that’s the beauty of capitalism on the comeback, riding the blockchain.

## So what is this? It’s Bitcoin. And It's Happening.

Michael Saylor calls Bitcoin digital iron. Iron is a commodity we use in *every single* building since it was invented. And that's his point, the market for iron crushed the market for bricks. It wasn’t close. Saylor says iron is the best material to build with, and Bitcoin is the best money to build with, there's no other choice. I love it, digital iron conveys Bitcoin's hardness, utility and ubiquity but the analogy is limited to the constraints of physics. Iron is not easily replicable, hard to work with, never evolves and slow to move.

Raoul Pal calls it the Exponential Age, an accurate but vague description.

Andreas Antonopoulos calls Bitcoin the Internet of Money. A similar Cambrian explosion is happening similar to the internet 90s, but money is not the only frontier. Blockchain is not only questioning what money we should use. It is also asking uncomfortable questions about the largest most important and powerful organizational structures in our society, the centralized corporation.

Like most disruptive, transformative things, we don’t have the words to describe it today. We just don't know enough yet.

Analogies only go so far in describing a forward looking future because they are fundamentally, tragically, based on our backward looking understanding. We're like two cavemen trying to describe credit cards to each other. Even if you get it right, you're probably still wrong. Grunting only gets you so far.

If you said Blockchain is the Exponential Internet of Iron-Money, you might get close. Ug, Ug, Ug. Or, save yourself the grunting, and you can just call it Bitcoin.

We’re moving from digitizing assets to assets that are digital. From gold to digital gold. From centralized physical organizations to decentralized cyber co-ops. From paying to use to being paid to use.

When the invisible hand creatively destroys the currency and corporate monopolies, it won't feel invisible for long.

algorand,Time to back up the Brinks truck…,"Look, my DCA is around $1.05.  I was definitely later to the party than some OGs here.

But I’m an old-er bird trained in the stock market with business degrees pre-2005. It took me awhile to come around on crypto. But I’m bought in now. Many of my similarly trained friends still don’t get it.

Personally I now think of this as the curmudgeon tax. Okay, you don’t understand crypto at a glance because it doesn’t fit the models you were trained on. But IMO, you have to reconsider those models when there is so much damn interest and momentum in this space.

Sure, US Gov could attack it all. But personally, I think they see it like weed. They just want to tax it rather than have a “war on crypto”. And beyond that, the CDBCs are on the horizon. It just makes too much sense.

I could be wrong and maybe it will be the Feds/IRS, nuclear war, or identity politics that take down crypto…but frankly I think crypto thrives on centralized unrest.  Aside from that, sh*t you gotta bet big to win big. 

But here’s where I may differ from some of the young bucks buying at .90 cents/Algo and selling at 1.10 and repeating. Good for you when you make money. Personally, I just set my limit buys at .90 and keep stacking.

This isn’t about weeks and months. Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, weren’t about weeks and months of trading. Buy, hold, buy more when the story is still so nascent. Not a sure thing, but definitely worth the bet IMO.

I used to play poker and there were times I would bet big on trip Kings or similar…and lose. But I always thought to myself, “I wouldn’t have bet it differently if I had it to do over again.”

Algo will be the same for me. Maybe I win and maybe I lose, but from where I sit this is a bet worth going all in on.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Question,"Hi everyone! We're working on refinancing our mortgage and are pretty close to closing. Here's the question, then I'll give pertinent info:

Q: Should we pay our June mortgage payment with the current lender, or wait until the refinance clears, so long as closing is by the end of the month?

Info:'

\- We reside in Washington state

\- Payment was due June 1, grace period ends June 15 - late payment will then be charged for 5% of the monthly amount

\- Current mortgage includes PMI and a higher interest rate; new mortgage will be several hundred dollars less; lower interest rate, no PMI

\- Refinance loan is for the total current balance on the mortgage (as of right now, so current principal balance today = total payment that will go to the prior lender)

\- Expectation is to close new loan before end of month

\- We are okay with paying the late fee, if the choice is between a late fee OR the full monthly payment

\- After closing, new mortgage 1st payment will be due in August

\- Refinance mortgage broker recommended \*not\* paying June mortgage payment with old lender, allow the refinance to close, and be able to skip June and July payments (in a sense). I've followed that advice but as my grace period end date nears, I'm reaching out to you fine people to see what your thoughts are.

So rounding back to the top question, should I make the June payment right away? Why / why not? If not, what is the last day I should make the payment before it might become an issue?

Any help the community could provide, I truly appreciate. I want to make sure I'm making the best choice for my family. If any additional information might be helpful, please let me know and I'll add what I can.

&amp;#x200B;

::UPDATE:: Thank you to those who replied, I really appreciate your thoughts. As it seems unanimously recommended to pay the June payment, I went ahead and did that. Thank you again - you're wonderful people :)",finance

personalfinance,Can't keep up with debt. Advice?,"Hello All,

I am 25 years old and I am currently working 45 hours a week and going to school full time. I live with my girlfriend and she isn't working at the moment but is trying to look for a job. I am super stressed about debt and trying to do school at the moment as I will graduate in a year and hopefully find a better paying job. 

I am currently a manager at a retail store. I make $15/hr and work 45 hours a week. After health insurance and taxes I bring in about $2000 a month. I have $1979 in expenses with the rent, electricity, car payment, insurance, phone payment, a payday loan, 3 credit cards, and a debt I got sued for that I'm being garnished at the moment. I have about $10,500 in collections from credit cards I racked up when I was at school and couldn't afford anything and $3000 is what I owe to a university that's in collections. I didn't count the garnishment but I had $5500 more in debt before they came after me. My payday loan is at a 180% interest rate due to a car repair I had to do to be able to get to work. I have no extra and I can only pay the minimum on my credit cards and payday loan and really have no extra. I wish I never took out the payday loan by the time I pay the minimum in 2 weeks it's back up to where it was again. I have $40,000 in student loans but as soon as the deferment period wears off I'm going to be screwed. 

My parents said bankruptcy but I'm trying to do this on my own. I try to pick up extra hours but with school I am utterly exhausted. I have about 10 months of garnishment before I pay off my debt that I got sued for which accounts for $300 a month. I don't even know where to begin. It would help if my girlfriend helped me pay for things but she can't find a job.",finance
CryptoCurrency,INDIA Investigates Binance Unit's Crypto Transactions,"MUMBAI (Reuters) -India’s financial crime-fighting agency said on Friday that WazirX, one of the country's largest cryptocurrency exchanges and its directors, were under investigation for suspected violation of foreign exchange regulations.

The investigation comes at time when the Indian government is mulling whether to introduce a law that could ban cryptocurrencies.

The federal Enforcement Directorate (ED) said that the probe involved transactions worth 27.90 billion rupees ($381.93 million).

The investigation into WazirX - owned since 2019 by Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange - began when the ED was looking into a money laundering case which involved Chinese owned illegal online betting applications, it said.

During the course of the investigation it was found out that the laundered proceeds of crime worth approximately 570 million rupees had been converted into cryptocurrencies using the Binance platform, the ED said.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,25 years old at First Job - Financial Advice,"Hi everyone. After 6 years Undergrad and 2 years of Masters degree, I just have been offered a position at my university with moderate pay, substantially more than I was living on before. For the first time in my life, I will be on pay roll and with some extra cash to save. Not that I had opportunities to be an over-spender, I am still aware that I can be out of control in my other aspects of life and now I am worried that I might not manage it well. I am hoping to get familiar with how to manage my money going forward.

Facts to state, I am not a citizen in the country I am working now (It is Thailand if this matters) and I do not have plans to permanently reside here as well. My life plan for now is to work at this position for at least **3 years**, gain some practical experiences and then move to another country for a funded PhD position ideally. So, my goals here are to set a certain amount of money to be saved or invested.

I think conventionally of Saving accounts but they have very small interest rates. It means that when I leave, I can keep all the money I decided to put away with a tiny bit extra. It is safe but I am not sure if it is a good financial decision.

Seconds are funds. I do not trust in myself enough to do day trading, selecting each individual stocks to buy and such. It would be time and mentally exhausting, at least for me. So, I naturally consider mutual funds. Forgive me if I am saying all wrong since I am not really familiar with the investments at all.

Asset managements here are mostly done by banks, which I also plan to use if I am going to. My bank SCB (good and bad at the same time, depends on who you ask) has gratefully categorize the funds into four objectives: High Volatility Capital Growth, Low Volatility Capital Protection, Morningstar Rating (which is a rating company I guess) and Interesting Funds (whatever this means).

It also groups by investment policy I will just write them down here. Index Funds, Equity Funds, Mixed Funds, Alternative Funds, Foreign Investment Funds, Super Saving Funds, Long Term Equity Funds, Retirement Mutual Funds, Property/Infrastructure Funds, Term Funds, MF for PVD and Others. I am sorry if I am dumping too much informations.

To my knowledge, index funds are a subset of mutual funds except they are not actively managed by a fund manager. They follow a specific index so they will not outperform the market, but they do not lose a lot as well (?). Also they do not have to pay a cut for the fund manager.

I see specifications like Accumulation, Auto redemption, and dividends. I am not that sure about the difference between them but from what I see, most types will have dividends paid once or twice a year (June and December here).

It is my first week in personal finance so I am a little bit entry shocked. Can someone guide me what means what and where I should be beginning at this phase of my life?

***TLDR: I will have some extra cash monthly that I would save to fund myself when I leave this position in 3 years. How should I manage it effectively so that I can keep them or even grow a bit? I would love to start a habit for healthy personal finances for life.***",finance
economy,Half of pandemic unemployment assistance may have been stolen.,"'' Criminals may have stolen as much as half of the unemployment benefits the U.S. has been pumping out over the past year, some experts say.

Why it matters: Unemployment fraud during the pandemic could easily reach $400 billion, according to some estimates, and the bulk of the money likely ended in the hands of foreign crime syndicates — making this not just theft, but a matter of national security.

Catch up quick: When the pandemic hit, states weren't prepared for the unprecedented wave of unemployment claims they were about to face.

They all knew fraud was inevitable, but decided getting the money out to people who desperately needed it was more important than laboriously making sure all of them were genuine.

By the numbers: Blake Hall, CEO of ID.me, a service that tries to prevent this kind of fraud, tells Axios that America has lost more than $400 billion to fraudulent claims. As much as 50% of all unemployment monies might have been stolen, he says.

Haywood Talcove, the CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, estimates that at least 70% of the money stolen by impostors ultimately left the country, much of it ending up in the hands of criminal syndicates in China, Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere.

""These groups are definitely backed by the state,"" Talcove tells Axios.

Much of the rest of the money was stolen by street gangs domestically, who have made up a greater share of the fraudsters in recent months.  ''

18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

CryptoCurrency,Could US government confiscate our digital gold as they did 1933?,"Wiki: ""Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States."" The executive order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act in March 1933. ""

There are many strong forces in our world who missed the Bitcoin revolution. They might even looking with awe at El Salvador. I usually nt writing long post so bare with me... So America's government has taken back gold before in 1933. Can they / will they do it again? They could kindly ask us (demand) to send them our BTCs since we pay our crypto taxes, they can't confiscated our BTCs by hacking our wallets though (not yet... quantum is coming though). But if they realize that it is inevitable that BTC will be the next digital gold reserve, they want in. But how? When their decision to act on BTC , 1 BTC might be worth 500K so they can't really go on to the market and start buying. So how will they board the train?

Another risk is that MicroStrategy, and Grayscale and other institutions holding BTC might become enormously powerful in the future (read Rockefeller powerful) and that can be a threat or an asset to the the government. (Satoshi will still be a mystery figure and a very powerful man.)

Here comes the question, how can US government confiscate BTCs? Could they, in near future, make a deal with the world's biggest whales to dump the price so hard that FED can scoop it up in an agreement that btc will be US legal currency which would keep whales' fortune untouched due to the increase of btc's value? (This would of course be orchestrated in secret and just dumped on us). We know that history repeats...",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to maintain health insurance while traveling 6 months.,"Maybe not the best place for this post? IMO it relates to finances and I’m not entirely sure where else to go with the question. 
So around 2023 I plan to leave my job in January to go travel for about 6 months. When I come back I would hope to find a job within 2 months but I’m ready if that doesn’t happen.
I’m in America and I know the federal mandate was lifted in regards to maintaining health insurance but my state still requires it. According to what I read, the cheapest insurance is $150 a month.. the penalty would be $695 a month.
What I’m trying to figure out is price ranges for my options if possible because I’ve only ever had insurance through my employer and I’m not sure how the intricacies of this work. I think I can safely guess that my income will be a max of $40k that year and that’d be if I got a job basically the day I make it back from the trip which is highly unlikely.
I don’t know if they have a leeway period... like you have 6 months to get new insurance or something... 
the next question is, we won’t be staying in this state once we return. We will be moving for my BF new job as he will be a doing Travel health care. We will be moving multiple times a month for his job. I don’t know where the new job will be but what if it’s a state that doesn’t have that mandate? I mean I guess I’m still SOL bc that’s not where I was at the start of the trip... but I don’t know how that works in terms of the irs knowing where I lived for the whole year. Is that just where I file my state return?

I’m also wondering for my boyfriend because he will join me for 2-4 months in between job changes so he will also lapse coverage.

I’m overwhelmed with this topic..
Edit: sorry if the question is unclear
In a nutshell, is there a way to avoid minimize the penalties? 
Or am I missing a piece of the puzzle misunderstanding. Meaning, can I lapse coverage for 2,3,4 months and not have a penalty?
If I’m SOL, how can I minimize the insurance cost

* Between my wife (44) and my self (40) we have a combined ≈$150k in yearly gross income with very stable jobs we intend to keep for at least another 5 - 10 years.
* $140K in 401k accounts and another $36K in a 0.5% savings account (this is regarded as 6 months of emergency funds to cover all expenses in case of total loss of income).
   * I currently contribute 19% with a company match of an additional 6% which nearly maxes out my 401k contributions. I contribute ≈$2.5k annually to an HSA as well.
   * Wife contributes ≈ 20% (same 6% match) which is is only around 1/2 of the contribution limits.
* Student loans:
   * Wife has $21K in student loans (around 4-6% interest, non federal and has been paying them continually for 5+ years)
      * $400/month in payment liabilities
   * I have $29K in student loans (around 6.5% interest, all federal with payments suspended at 0% interest since middle of 2020, scheduled to start payments again in October 2021).
      * $500 - $700/month in payment liabilities
   * &amp;#x200B;
* Other debt:
   * We currently owe $285K on a home ""valued"" at $445K paying 3.25% APR on a 30 year loan. We love our home and have lived here 3 years and plan to stay another 5-10 years.
      * We put $33K down on the home back in 2018 when the sale price was $333K
   * 1 car loan with $3K remaining at 1.9%, 13 months remaining
   * 2nd car loan with $17k remaining at 1.9%, 48 months remaining
   * All credit cards paid in full each cycle

I have come to r/personalfinance for some advice. The wife and I got a late start in saving for retirement with us starting our current careers only 5 years ago. We started with 0 in savings back then and now have ≈$175k in combine retirement and cash savings (from above breakdown). So doing pretty well in catching up but we feel we are still behind our goals of retiring early before 60. As many of us homeowners can relate, our home values have appreciated significantly and we have been inundated with offers to take cash out refinance.

We refinanced our original loan in early 2020 going from 4.5% to 3.25% (no cash taken out) and saved ≈$400/mon on the monthly payment.

*Issue #1*

With nearly $100k in home value appreciation in this market since purchase, **we are considering taking out $50k in a cash out refi that would land us still under the 80% loan to value ratio to avoid PMI and the new APR would be between 2.9 and 3.125%. We would potentially use this to pay off all or some of our student loans thereby freeing up ≈1K in monthly payment liabilities and our new mortgage would be ≈$200 more per month. The alternative is to stay on track to pay off our loans in 4 years.**

Pros:

* immediately eliminate long standing student loan debt, allowing more contributions to retirement funds

Cons:

* What if home values depreciate? (only an issue if we intend to sell in the near future, which we do not expect).
* (FOMO) What if the current administration passes legislation/executive order to eliminate portions of student loan debt?
* Loss of equity in our home (only an issue if we plan to sell in the near future).
* Costs of the refi could range between $3.5 - 5.5K, but less than $1k in immediate out of pocket expense.

*Issue #2*

With our emergency liquid savings of $36k in a low yield savings account practically losing money due to inflation, **we are considering allocating 1/2 to 2/3 to a taxable investment account (mutual funds/ETF's) to make that money work for us. We haven't touched that emergency fund in years and continue to grow it for home improvements.**

Pros:

* Potentially greater investment growth

Cons:

* Reduced liquid emergency funds to 2-3 months instead of the current 5-6 months
* Potential losses due to market conditions.

So reddit, what do you think? Is is worth taking the risk of the cash-out refi to eliminate the largest and highest interest debt and folding it into a mortgage with record low APR? Should we think twice about putting a large portion of our liquid emergency funds into a taxable investment account with more earnings/growth potential?",finance

Bitcoin,APY &amp; APR,"APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I just started financing a bike and the dealership lied about my credit.,"So a little back story; I started financing a bike in February and it got wrecked in March. It got paid off a week later. Tuesday I went to another dealership and went to finance a bike (which I know financing is never advised, ignore that) but when they pulled credit it was pulling at a high APR.

My last bike was 10.99% as a first time buyer, this one was nearing 18% but I’m going to pay for a year and buy it cash but I was asking why 18%. They claimed that the loan was closed and only that same bank would take me cause no bank likes taking deals where the bike gets paid off in a month(I know that). That same day two other dealerships said the same thing, so I figured to get the bike I want I’ll have to do it. So I signed. 

Next day I get called from another dealership after I signed it and that dealership told me that the loan wasn’t closed and why that’s why I had a 18% APR.

Ignoring what I did about a high interest rate cause I’m head over heels for this bike; I can afford the payments fine but what route can I take to fix this. They blatantly lied about the loan being closed and had me sign and now are just ghosting me besides they need another form of ID and I haven’t sent it yet.

Disclaimer: I know I shouldn’t finance, I shouldn’t send credit out, there’s better ways of building credit etc.. I made from a fiscal standpoint a pretty bad decision, so be it. From where I’m at currently is there anything I can do about them lying to me, can I reach out to the bank and resign? Anything I can do?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"I coded a simple back-testing framework to help you determine how profitable your trading strategy is, here's the open source code for it","Backtesting is a way of feeding your current trading strategy to a script that applies it on historical data, in order to determine how successful it could be in the future. 

Past performance does not always guarantee future returns, but it's good practice to test your strategy (or trading algorithm) before you go ham.

The backtesting script has two parts:

* A data gatherer
* A strategy tester

The data gatherer fetches historical data from Binance, based on your parameters: candle interval, date since, coin.

This is then saved in a csv file and fed to the strategy tester.

The strategy tester then executes your strategy and displays a plot at the end of the cycle showing you all buy/sell actions as well as overall profit/loss.

I fed it a simple strategy - buy if the price is up 1% in the last minute. Sell at 10% gain or 5% loss - but you can customise these parameters yourself. This strategy broke even on DOTUSDT so you might want to try something else ;)

Happy Testing!

I live in the Bay Area where homes are expensive. I’m 33 and have never opened a home. I’m looking to “house hack” but it’s nearly impossible with this market. I also don’t intend on moving because of my job.

My annual Salary: 155k/year
Student Debt: 20k (I could pay off, but have super low interest rate)
Cash/Savings Available: 25k
Equities: 350k+
Credit Score: 740
Current Rent: 2,500

There’s a duplex I really like (3BR/2BA and 1BR/1BA) that I could see myself living in for a while. and intend on renting out the other larger unit. 

However it’s currently listed about 1.25 million which is average in the Bay Area

I have 25% of the down payment, but it’s ALL in stocks (2/3 long term capital gains and 1/3 in short term capital gains)

Using a mortgage calculator, I’m looking about $5.5k a month, which includes property tax (.65%/year) and home insurance.

Market rate for 3BR/2BA is currently $3.5k - 4.2k a month in this neighborhood.

So I’m looking to pay about 1.3k - 2k a month for the bottom unit, which is slightly less than my current rent right now.. but at least I have built some equity.

Am I missing any potential costs? It seems pretty cut and dry for me.. but I don’t know if I should account for any other monthly costs other than utilities and internet ($350/mo).

In the future I could see the value of this house going up, and if I moved, I could rent out the smaller unit and “break even” while building up equity.. 

does that make sense to do? Or am I over simplifying this?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs saving for new cars?,"Hello reddit. My spouse and I make a bit over 100k combined. I have 100k in student debt and we own both of our cars outright. Both cars currently have ~150k miles on them. 

I want to start paying my student loans more aggressively. we spent the last 5 years mostly paying minimums while we got our adult lives established, built up an emergency fund, ect.(And also because I was making half of what I am now 5 years ago).

However I am guessing we will both be needing new cars sometime in the next 5 years and I am terrified of having to make vehicle loan payments on top of a $1000/month student loan minimum payments and the strain on our budget that would cause. (we could afford it but it would be unpleasant). 

At most we could throw 1.5-2k towards student loan payments. Loans average around 5-6% interest. So I don't think we could pay off all student loans in my 5 year hypothetical timeframe. But we could make a good dent in it maybe. 

So my question is would it be better to pay student loans aggressively or to keep paying minimums for a bit while we save up for replacement vehicles when ours finally crap out? 

Also some extra info if it matters: live in the US. Max out a Roth IRA and contribute 6% to a 401k for the company match. Not having vehicles is not an option as I commute an hour to and from work and we live remote enough my spouse needs a way to get around to do basic things like grocery shopping.

EDIT: oh also loans are technically in deferment due to the pandemic until September. They are federal loans. And the mortgage is about 1.6k.",finance

Bitcoin,One of Hal Finney’s last posts on bitcointalk.org. RIP. It gives me hope. You should know him. Cypherpunks Never Die!,"Bitcoin and me ( Hal Finney )

March 19, 2013

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

It's an apprenticeship at a local shop. There's a 60-day probation period and after that probation I'll be eligible for health benefits and after one year I'll be eligible for a 401k retirement plan (not sure on company match, I'll get a packet with more info when the one year anniversary is nearing). The opportunity to work with a shop like this doing this kind of work isn't available anywhere else near me. 

I spent about three years goofing off in college and I'm about $36k in student loan debt (~$15k govt loans and ~$21k private). Govt loans are in forbearance until September and SMae grace period ends this month. Plan to apply for a hardship forbearance so I can start an EF, does this make sense? I had just transferred to a university from a local community college (did first 2yrs at com col) when COVID hit. Basically that completely screwed me up and I failed miserably in the last semester I was at university (0s in every class) because of some mental health issues. They're under control now and I'm doing much better. Will be even better when I get to work hopefully. 
EDIT: No longer in college and no plans to go back currently. 

I'm fortunate enough to have family I'm staying with and they pay the phone bill, car insurance, gas, food, etc. I wasn't always this fortunate, grew up extremely poor. I'm very grateful for the situation I'm in now though.

I have no debt other than the student loans. Car is old enough that the person that bought it new is probably dead by now, but it runs great and I work on it myself if something happens. Was given to me by a family friend when I was in high school and I've been driving it since (not without its issues, I've had to work on it a lot but it's at a point now where just about anything that can be replaced, I've replaced, and it runs like a top). New job is an easy highway commute about 15 minutes away. If I have car issues there's two other vehicles I can take if need be. 

I have two credit cards, one that I never use and a Discover card with reward points that I use and pay off immediately, never carry a balance. Credit score is 680.

I currently have $650 in my checking account and $200 cash. No savings. 

I know there's the PF Wiki with the charts and stuff, but I have a couple specific questions that I'd appreciate some advice on. 
For the first year, since I can't get a retirement plan through my employer, is there another ""thing"" I can use that's similar to a retirement? I've read some people say something about an ""IRA"" or ""Roth."" Not sure what these are exactly or if I should just hold off on retirement until a year from now when employer offers 401k. 
Should I build up an EF then hit my student loans as hard as possible? Also, should I consolidate my loans? I have 5 loans with Mohela (govt) and 3 with Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae loans average out to 8.33% fixed interest rate. I have a cosginer for these loans.

personalfinance,Can anyone help me with my car situation?,"I posted a little while ago about how I went to finance a car and after 3 weeks the dealer still hadn't finalized my deal. Well, the car dealer made a deal with my original lender (SAFCO). I still have a chance to back out, but I'm not 100% sure that I should.

Car: 2016 Honda Fit, 75,000 miles, 1 rear car accident reported. $1500 down. 

The listed price for the car was $13,000. Plus the dealer fees and GAP coverage, the car price totaled around $16,000. My interest rate is 22%. I will be paying $440 every month for 60 months. Bringing the total price to around $27,000. It's a fairly decent car, all things considered. I have contacted a local credit union and they said they will refinance the car for 16.5% instead after the deal is finalized.

My credit score is 530-580 depending on which one you check.
So I recognize that the interest rate is insane. The problem is that I still need a decent running car to get to and from work, as well as school. I live in a place without optimal public transportation. And with everyone moving to my area (Florida), all of the shitty beater cars are priced too high for what they are. I need something RELIABLE and the $1500 down payment that I used isn't really enough to get anything off the marketplace. And used cars from dealers aren't that much better as my credit is still low, so I'll still get the same rate and another hard inquiry on my credit. I'll also be paying around the same total if I get a brand new car and a reduced interest rate.  No one I know can/will cosign with me.

Should I return my car? If so, I still have to take Uber's too and from work. I work that out to $25ish a day, which is $100-$125 week. That basically works out to my car payment. 

I take home around $2400 after taxes.

personalfinance,"As a high-ney worth individual, how can I maximize my mortgage?","TLDR; I’m planning on transferring my home from my company to me personally and would like to take advantage of the low-interest rate mortgages in the market right now, but I don’t know the best way to go about it.

Background: my home is currently wholly owned by one of my LLCs, but I’d like to transfer it to myself this year to take advantage of low-interest mortgages and the primary residence tax credit (assuming I wait 2+ years to sell). The house is debt free and is valued around $1.5mm, and I would technically be a first time home buyer.

Questions: 

What should I be doing to make sure I get the best rate possible, other than calling every bank in town and disclosing my financials. 

Generally, if I go to a mortgage broker, who pays his commission? Would it not be cheaper to go straight to the bank?

Assuming I have seven figures in a bank account at the bank (operating cash for entities), would it make a large difference in the interest rate?

If I go on NerdWallet, it tells me that a bunch of banks nearby or online have rates around ~3%. Are there banks or mortgage lenders that offer cheaper rates to individuals with 8 figure net worths? What if it’s a full recourse loan?

Aside from the discount on transfer/recordation taxes, are there other advantages to an FHA loan that would make it appealing when compared to a conventional mortgage loan? Will FHA lenders still consider 3% down on a 1.6mm home if my income/financials support it?

I am the nothing that makes everything happen. You don't know me, you don't understand me; and yet still, if you want justice, I will help you find it. I am blockchain. I am encryption. I am code. Now put me to use.""* Chapter 43 - The Ministry for the Future; Kim Stanley Robinson (2020)

In this highly real-life, scientific-oriented work of fiction, Chapter 42 (the chapter preceding this \^riddle) describes Janus (Computer science) and Dick (economist) discussing their concept of the **""Carbon Coin""** to Mary Murphy, the head of the ""Ministry for the Future"" which is based in Zurich, Switzerland.

For every ton of carbon *not* burned, or sequestered for one century (benchmark time) - you are given one Carbon Coin. You can trade that coin immediately for any other currency on the currency exchanges, so one carbon coin would be worth a certain amount of other fiat currencies. The central banks would guarantee it at a certain minimum price, they would support a floor so it couldn't crash. But also, it could rise above that floor as people get a sense of its value. in the usual way of currencies in the currency exchange markets. A form of directed, targeted, quantitative easing aimed at carbon reduction.

Combined with a carbon tax, the Carbon Coin offers a carrot and stick incentive to address climate change for Governments, Corporations, and individuals in the form of a blockchain that is public AND permissioned that can be calculated and tied into the world economy effectively and in real-time.

**TLDR:** A truly brilliant, modern novel based in the very near future (late 2020's &amp; into the 2030's) where the Ministry of the Future is tasked with the near-impossible task of addressing the failures of the world (and Paris Climate Agreement) to meet its targets. The ""Carbon Coin"" is a feature similar to what the Energy Web Token (EWT) is building infrastructure for. The issues the Ministry for the Future has is getting the major central banks to back it - as they are bankers concerned with monetary policy, not fiscal policy.

A highly recommended read during this market downturn. \*I'm not affiliated in any way, I just enjoyed it immensely and learnt so much about scientific proposals addressing climate change - which is my hope that blockchain helps to solve and the main reason I am here.\*",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Where can I cosign a refinancing of an auto loan with someone without a SSN?,"Short version. My now husband is an immigrant with no SSN. He only has an ITIN. He bought a car last year and the dealer gave him a credit rate of 26%. He checked into refinancing it, but his only option seemed to be the original dealer and while they wanted to refinance it at 20%, they wanted to charge 3 thousand dollars for the honor. 

I have a credit score in the high 700s and was wondering if I co-signed the refinance agreement with him if he could get a lower interest rate. I checked out some options, but online lenders that seem to be trustworthy (e.g. DCU) only have boxes for SSNs on their loans, and no way to proceed without adding in a SSN. My own bank is Chase, and we have plenty of credit history, but they don't refinance loans.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin: Hedging against Inflation,"It’s helpful here to define inflation. In general, inflation is a general increase of services and goods in a country over a sustained period of time. That’s the Wikipedia definition, but it’s helpful here to understand why this might be the cause: inflation generally comes about because of a general decrease in the purchasing power of a fiat currency. It is termed hyperinflation if the decrease in purchasing power reaches a critical inflection point where the decrease in fiat currency value and increase in prices for goods and services happens in a very rapid period of time.

What might cause that decrease in fiat value? An increase in money supply, foreign investors pouring out of a particular currency, or even investors attacking a currency. As a consequence, goods like food and other essentials become more unaffordable for people, as wages tend to be more fixed or static than rapidly increasing factor prices. It also becomes much more expensive to operate any business that requires raw inputs.

Inflation that comes with unemployment is part of the misery index which measures the combined sum of unemployment rate and inflation rate. When inflation increases, typically the average citizen feels the pinch, especially with their savings. They are incentivized to spend more in the current moment, but they get less with each passing moment for the nominal value of the money they have. Instead of spending $1 on a loaf of bread, they have to spend $1.10 and so on.

The COVID-19 world looks something like that: there’s massive inflationary monetary policy, with aggressive expansion of the monetary supply due to monetary policy, and prices in certain key areas such as food staples keep on increasing due to supply shocks caused by lockdowns. The lockdowns have also shut down businesses that operate largely in physical spaces, leading to a mass increase in unemployment.

Bitcoin is theoretically positioned as a hedge against this scenario, deriving its value from both speculative interest as a hedge, as well as its deflationary and controlled money supply and its use as a potential primary means of exchange in a more digitally-oriented world economy. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are built around those same principles as well. The 21 million Bitcoin limit means that at a certain point, there should be less Bitcoins versus the demand for them, meaning that in terms of value, the price per unit should increase as the supply decreases.

Bitcoin is structured technologically to encourage a deflationary attitude and a relatively stable store of value that partially harkens back to the “gold standard”. In this way, the community acts as a place where investors and community participants can raise their hand against the inflationary consensus. It is in this way that we can see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies like it acting as a true and meaningful hedge against inflation — and the economics and policy thought that drive it.
Now, more than ever, inflationary hedges are important. Bitcoin might play part of this role for the 21st century, as gold did for the 20th century.

personalfinance,Help with Bonus and Car Loan,"Hey Reddit!

Allow me to clarify the title. 

In about 2 weeks I will be receiving a substantial bonus for a project I recently completed at work. The sum I’ll be receiving, even post tax, will be more money than I’ve ever had to my name at once. 

My initial idea was to put it into a CD, and let it stay there for a couple of years until the housing market quiets down, and then use it for the down payment on my first house. 

However, it later occurred to me that it will also be enough to pay off my car loan. This car loan is not the best. I still owe about 14k on the car with about 4.5 years left on the loan, and the interest rate is 16.6%. I know this is a bad loan, so for now I’d like to not discuss that and instead focus on the goal at hand. 

Should I go with my original idea, stick with my car loan as is and save the bonus for my future home? Or should I make the decision to make my life easier (about $350/month easier) for the short term? 

If I pay off my car there will still be some of my bonus left over to save, but not a whole lot. 

My third idea was this... if I paid off the car, I could turn right around and sell it and only lose a couple thousand dollars on it. The car is devaluing fairly quickly, but is still worth about 13k at a dealership according to KBB. Assuming I won’t get KBB for it, if I take this route I’ll be out more or less 4 grand, which isn’t pleasant, but long term it might be good to sell this car before the value is diminished too far. I work from home permanently and haven’t been driving that much these days- so as a replacement I was considering something like a Vespa, since the only driving I really do is either to the gym or grocery. 

Anyway, what does Reddit think? I have a good few options and would love to hear if someone has something I didn’t think of.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Investing Strategies for Different Types of Investors: Lump-Sum, Dollar-Cost Averaging, and Risk-Adjusted Dollar-Cost Averaging","**tl;dr: Strategies are either to ""set it and forget it"", ""just do it** ***✔ ,""*** **or** **""just do it (sometimes)"". Oh and, for those wondering, watching 3 min charts move to the right is not an investing strategy.**

# Lump-Sum Investing

The most simple and stress-free way to invest in anything: *set it and forget it*. This method is about gathering a lump sum and investing it at whichever price you feel is suitable.

Naturally, you’re at risk for buying something overvalued or missing out on future dips/buying opportunities. But the name of the game is that efficiency doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things.

# Dollar-cost averaging

This subreddits favorite and for a good reason: it’s an age-old strategy that almost guarantees success. With this method, you invest a fixed amount over certain time intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.). 

This method allows you to account for volatility and avoid emotional decision-making. But it’s indifferent to buying at overvalued or undervalued levels. Also, you may not be able to fully utilize compounding, staking, and other passive income benefits that come with lump-sum investing as well as being subject to fees during purchasing and/or transferring. 

# Risk-Adjusted Dollar Cost Averaging

The idea is the same as regular dollar cost averaging but only doing so under specific risk levels. In the cryptoverse, there are many ways to measure risk. You can use the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), the [Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/), or advanced metrics such as the [Stock-to-Flow Model](https://www.bybt.com/pro/i/S2F) to determine whether the crypto market is overvalued or undervalued. So, for example, using the fear and greed index, you only start DCAing during *fear* levels and stop during *greed* levels.

The caveat is that you're relying on the accuracy of these models to guide your decision-making. The metrics I've mentioned have so far stood the test of time, but it's never 100% accurate, and you might miss buying opportunities at levels you think are risky but, in hindsight, are actually discounted prices. Similar to regular dollar-cost averaging you're also not able to fully utilize some benefits of lump-sum investing while also being subject to fees. 

*But what to do with the money your income flows during risky market levels?* When you're not willing to DCA into the market because of risk, you can still be invested in crypto via a relatively risk-free asset: stablecoins. With stablecoins, you can earn interest rates that are rare in traditional finance without being subject to market volatility. Of course, you're still subject to inherent crypto risks but risk and reward are siblings: you cannot expect high rewards without some level of risk. 

# Which kind of investor are you?

**Lump sum** investors usually have...well...lump sums. People with a lump sum of initial capital they're willing to invest in the market. If you want to maximize staking, interest, and other ways to compound or just want to *set it and forget it,* then this method is for you. 

**Dollar-cost averaging** can also be utilized by people with lump sums by dividing the capital and investing thru intervals. Otherwise, it's typically for people with steady income flows who are willing to consistently invest a portion of their earnings into crypto. 

**Risk-Adjusted Dollar-cost averaging** is for people who want to find an optimal balance between stress-free methods and risk management. This is because dollar-cost averaging is often criticized for being inefficient since, as mentioned earlier, it's indifferent to overvaluation or undervaluation. The tradeoff is that it's not as easy, requires some monitoring and some research into these models.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, all three strategies are great ways for the average joe to casually navigate thru crypto investing. Ultimately, if the market continues the long-term trend upwards, either way, you're a winner for being invested in crypto.",cryptocurrency

How they recovered these assets hasn’t been officially disclosed, but it was most certainly not, as some suggested, due to “an underlying vulnerability in blockchain technology”.

Presumptions aside, it is likely the transparency of Bitcoin’s transactions on the public ledger that aided the recovery effort. The Bitcoin network remains the largest and most secure network for transferring stores of value.
 
This leads us to the monumental news of Bitcoin now officially being recognized as legal tender in El Salvador. (CoinTelegraph) It was only in 2001 that the U.S. dollar replaced the colón, their native currency since 1892. Bitcoin is now considered a currency and will not be subject to capital gains taxes for its usage.

The internet erupted when Bukele tweeted that he mandated the state-owned geothermal electrical company to develop plans to introduce Bitcoin mining powered by volcanoes and water vapor. (@nayibbukele on Twitter) This effort could harness excess geothermal energy to power Bitcoin mining and could lead El Salvador to quickly becoming a major mining competitor.

As inflation continues to rise above economist expectations, the cliche comes to mind: “Bitcoin fixes this.” 
 
Keep in mind, in order for a country to add Bitcoin as a legal tender, it will require that country to acquire Bitcoin and hold it in reserves to help process and settle transactions and taxes.

Why does this make it seem like cash is the only for of money we have? A quick search reveals that only 10% of the USD supply is in physical form. ""Digital dollars"" are not new, they've been around for a while. We use digital money every day.

Based on the research I've done, here's what I've learned about the ""Digital Dollar"": It's like a cryptocurrency, except

* It is backed 1:1 with the dollar (i.e. a stablecoin).
* It is issued by central banks.
* It runs on a digital ledger, and not necessarily a distributed one.
* It's being designed to run on Visa's and the bank's networks.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't understand how this is that different from the system that's being used right now.",cryptocurrency

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown JUN 13 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Charles recorded for the Lex Fridman Podcast. It went over five hours. This is a big deal given that Lex has 1.12 million subscribers and it’s closer to mainstream than a crypto audience.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1403498549300584448](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1403498549300584448) [https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman](https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman)
2. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi.  [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles makes the case for collaboration with Starlink in Africa. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1392916783854616577](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1392916783854616577)
2. People are starting to realize what the real value of NFTs will be. It’s not in collectibles. [https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1392939118355783682](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1392939118355783682)

4. The Cardano 360 team also dropped a video with specific mid-month Alonzo testnet updates. At the timestamp in the link below the vid lays out the various test groups and when they will participate. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1393258090703826944](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1393258090703826944) [https://youtu.be/5mPC4uLMdEw?t=532](https://youtu.be/5mPC4uLMdEw?t=532)
5. We are seeing some small pools retiring. We’ll obviously see more and more of this as time marches on. But, here’s a salute to the small pools that gave it a go! This SPO also brought us poolpeek.com which we have covered here before.

6. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)
7. This tweet by [u/TheADAApe](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheADAApe/) pretty much sums it all up. When people ask me how I knew, I’m going to point them to this post. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1393606491110662146)
8. To hear about something truly good happening in the Cardano ecosystem check out this interview with Mickey Watkins, CEO of World Mobile, on the Hotel Cardano podcast. Really good details on World Mobile's connecting the unconnected in sub-Saharan Africa! [https://youtu.be/L15bn\_b2moA](https://youtu.be/L15bn_b2moA)
9. What if these two got to talking about what Atala Prism could bring to the table for students in the city of Miami? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1393574632305868805](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1393574632305868805)
10. The saga of BTC maximalists being angry at Elon continues with Elon implying that Tesla could sell its BTC while Cardano continues just doing its thing like normal. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies)
11. Likewise, Marc Cuban tried to FUD real world use of Cardano only to be confronted with a giant infographic of use cases and partnerships along with an explanatory video just for him. [https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1393646131708665858](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1393646131708665858) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1393689887648272384](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1393689887648272384)
12. Initial Stakepool Offerings (“ISOs”) are here. Crypto is no stranger to novel means of capital formation and now the Cardano ecosystem is getting in on the action. Here is SundaeSwap’s explanation of how ISOs will work. [https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/iso-sundae-with-the-works-c5c335101ef5](https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/iso-sundae-with-the-works-c5c335101ef5)
13. ICYMI, Manuel Chakravarty reminds us all that his Cardano Summit 2020 talk is publicly available for questions on native assets. Really interesting discussion of the asset identifier just being a hash of the policy script and how that helps create a super lightweight easy to use system.

17. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit. [https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM](https://youtu.be/d8uPMZplfeM) [https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss](https://youtu.be/xbMSQUA1lss)
18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
19. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata. [https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg](https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg)
22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

44. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

64. We don’t often get to hear from the engineers behind Yoroi over at Emurgo. But, here’s a podcast with Vicente Almonacid from Emurgo. Check out 12:50 where he mentions the dApp Connector (Cardano’s Metamask Equivalent).

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

btc,The Economic Implications of Crypto Use in El Salvador,"I read up on El Salvador a bit today, and it turns out that their economy and monetary system have some interesting aspects. The first is its currency: the Salvadoran colon was officially replaced in 2001 with the US Dollar by Paco Flores. Colons are still floating around, but not many people want them (could be Gresham's Law at work?). This means that El Salvador doesn't have a central bank which can devalue their soveriegn currency anytime the economy is in a slump, as is customary in Western economies. Unsurprisingly, El Salvador has had poor economic growth since dollarization went into effect.

Dollarization also means that El Salvador suffers on the international market when the US Fed brrrrr-prints like madmen. As the USD is devalued and debased by the Fed, Salvadoran export prices drop and imports become more expensive for the citizens.  Furthermore, due to the horrendous death squad government which the CIA funded through the 1990s, 20% of Salvadorans live in the United States. These expatriates send millions of US dollars home each year.

El Salvador doesn't produce much, it's an agricultural economy. They import food. The country's infrastructure was devastated by 15 years of brutal civil war. The IMF is squeezing El Salvador hard, and they are making them beg for another billion dollar loan.

What if El Salvador could:

* De-dollarize
* Hedge against USD devaluation
* Give its citizens a chance to hold a currency that gains value
* Encourage foreign investment which isn't dollar-denominated
* Undercut extortionate remittance services like Western Union
* Bypass economic sanctions and nanny-state trade deals with the US which keep it a client state

All they really need to do is accept  cryptocurrency to accomplish ALL of these goals! We already know that the IMF is furious that El Salvador is going crypto.

The USA might have to launch a military coup in El Salvador to get that government under its control and shut down Bitcoin use. Because they need to send a very strong signal to other countries who are considering crypto adoption as well. Just yesterday, Iran was muttering about making Bitcoin legal tender!

CryptoCurrency,Distance yourself from Gains &amp; Losses of others,"This is one thing that many new investors struggle with. You want to reduce your emotions to the minimum while investing. Because there are two things you definitely don't want to do. It's **panic buying** &amp; **panic selling** - both of them are either triggered by **F**ear **O**f **M**issing **O**ut or **F**ear, **U**ncertainty &amp; **D**oubt.

While you're watching your friend or someone in the r/Cryptocurrency Subreddit making huge gains with an investment **they made way before you were considering it**, you will feel a strong desire to jump on as soon as possible, no matter in which direction the market is currently moving. The more logic &amp; rational approach is it, to have a trading-plan or at least know about the **zones of confluence** while looking at the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink etc. 
You want to buy at the lowest point possible or you want to sell at the highest point possible. Too many people get trapped in buying the top - something we can easily avoid by not following our emotions that came up with the recent gain porn we saw.

The sentiment on the market changes daily - based on the news and the price movements. You make your decisions in your own environment with your own financial view. I could use $1.000 to pay off a part of my student debt, which would result in feeling reliefed. Others throw $1.000 around since there's a lot of more money in their savings account. So don't compare your numbers to others. **The main thing is** making steady gains and **increase your own net-value**, no matter if you are making 2% profit a week or 5% profit every month. Consistency is the key - just like in many other situations in life.

I personally watch trading ideas of others on TradingView, StockTwist ... to get a perspective of others but i only rely on my own conclusion of the market. Taking financial decisions based on the opinion of others will result in being unconfident in your investment - which throws you back to the emotions. Stay rational.

CryptoCurrency,"I got another one for you guys - I coded a tool to help you find a profitable trading strategy using backtesting on historical data, as always it's open source","So you guys may have seen some of my previous posts, where I shared several open sourced crypto trading algorithms that I coded. Many of you asked if they have been backtested and how that would work. 

So I created this quick tool to help you assess the profitablity of your trading strategy of trading bot if you're using one.

Backtesting is a way of feeding your current trading strategy to a script that applies it on historical data, in order to determine how successful it could be in the future.

Past performance does not always guarantee future returns, but it's good practice to test your strategy (or trading algorithm) before you go ham.

The script downloads historical data for a coin of your choice, and at an interval of your choosing. This is then used by the script to determine how profitable a strategy can be, and whether it has the potential to beat a buy and hold.

At the end of the testing phase, the tool will generate a plot showing each trade and final balance.

Working with historical data since the start of this year, I fed it a simple strategy - buy if the price is up 1% in the last minute. Sell at 10% gain or 5% loss - but you can customise these parameters yourself. This strategy made a marginal loss on ICPUSDT, but then this is probably not the best coin to test on since it's been in decline ever since it was listed on Binance.

Here's the same strategy on NANOUSDT, seems like we're $800 in profit.

Nobody knows what the market will do but even prior we were stretching to afford someplace we'd LIKE to live here in SoCal, rather than settling on whatevers available.

It's mind boggling to think I could take a 20% pay cut leaving the area where housing is at least 50% less. On the flip side SoCal houses appreciate like a mutual fund.

I took a job where I'm underpaid based on my experience but I know the Quality of Life will never be better and I genuinely love my job. The kicker, there's basically no room for growth aside from the position being converted to Federal at the end of the contract. Not crossing my fingers but pursuing substantiation for such.

If you can and you believe in crypto make use of the low prices. 

If you don't have money to buy just don't check the price. When it goes back to a bull market it will be in every news outlet so you won't miss out! 

If you need the money you put into crypto: well you shouldn't have but now you have learned a valuable lesson! Crypto is for money that you can afford to lose! 

If you can't take the volatility just sell some... even if you believe we will go up we can go much lower before we go up (in terms of alts, not BTC)

Isn't this a swap, where the fed buys assets on a temporary basis to provide liquidity to banks (QE). 
It seems that a lot people that are referring to money printing, are referring to QE.
Looking into QE, it doesn't seem to be helicopter money:

Is it fiscal stimulus, infrastructure bills, etc?
You see this everywhere as well. Stimulus checks are from money printing, which makes sense. But then the new 6T infrastructure/stim bill is talked about and I see the first responses saying that this is just more money printing as well. 

How can this be money printing if these bills are funded by the tax payer? Money printing implies we just created it out of nothing. 

These imply that there is either a reversal of swaps, or debt to be payed off. When this ""balancing"" happens, there will likely be a large market crash, as well as high rates and maybe a recession.

With the 13,000 I should essentially pay nothing in Federal and State taxes, be able to max out the 6k on my Roth and have another 6-7k left over for the year. Since my largest expense, rent/utilities, wouldn't a be concern living with my parents, I believe I should be able to survive with the 6-7k.

Does this make sense to do? Am I missing anything in my calculation here? Any special rules about the 403b and 457b that I'm missing? I understand that the investment options in these accounts are generally limited and most 403b's only really have access to Annuities. Would it make more sense to contribute the money into a taxable account for the higher returns in equities? Perhaps save for a down payment to invest in Real Estate? Is the tax benefit of the 403/457 worth contributing that much into? Assuming I'm able to do this for like 2-3 years I should be able to have \~100k set aside for retirement by \~24.

TLDR; I'm extremely lucky and will have parents cover most of my living expenses out of college for a few years. Does maxing out a 403b and 457b make the most sense to take advantage of this situation?  Are there better strategies to employ?",finance
economy,"The ""Mars Hypothesis"" could easily control inflation","This new book is called ""The Mars Hypothesis"" and presents a hypothesis that the Federal reserve can set interest rates based on the position of the planet Mars. The books brings astrologers and economists together and formulates a system in which the FED can set interest rates according to the predicted bear market time frames derived from the positions of the Sun, Mars, and the Lunar nodes. The system is built to last all the way until the end of the year 2098 The book also takes you through the major historical components of the last 115 years and demonstrates how the system could have applied in the past. This system could allow the Fed to maintain some control over interest rates, while at the same time removing the aspect of arbitrating that many consider too overbearing",finance

personalfinance,"Help with resetting back to Zero, building savings, and generating passive income.","Good afternoon everyone. I will get down to the general nitty gritty in a moment, first I wanted to thank each of you who potentially puts in input for this, and thank you for everything you do here.

I want to reset my debt back to zero, full stop. No more credit card debt, no more loans, no more student loans..etc. Then I want to build a savings in both cash currency, stocks and bonds/ index funds, and physical silver. Finally I would like to begin generating a passive income from funds in the market, so that I can in later years not worry about having a job.

I am going to crosspost this to FIRE, but would like information from people for more immediate planning here.

I will list out income, debt (including percentage rates), and expenses. Personal living situations and other such will be at the end.

personalfinance,Should I be paying extra on my mortgage to remove PMI?,"My basic financial picture is I'm 32 years old, making around 110k/year. I have no debt other than my mortgage. I have about 100k invested in retirement accounts and about 20k invested in taxable accounts, and 15k cash on hand for monthly expenses and emergency fund. My long term financial goal is early retirement, so I try to save a lot and optimize my finances. 

I bought a house a few months ago for $300k, with a 280k loan plus 20k down payment. It's a conventional 30 year loan at 2.875%. because I had less than 20% down payment, I have a monthly PMI payment of 190$. If I wasn't paying that money for PMI, I would probably be investing it in my taxable account.

If I pay the minimum on my mortgage, I would reach 80% LTV in about 6 years, and pay almost 14k in PMI payments. I could shorten that time considerably by throwing extra money every month at my mortgage (money that I would otherwise be putting into index funds). I could also reach 80% LTV pretty quickly if I cashed out some investments.

I don't want to put more money in this mortgage than I have to because the interest rate is so low. I'm not interested in paying down my mortgage quickly just for the satisfaction of not having a mortgage. But seeing that extra $190 going to PMI every month is a bit of a thorn in my side. Does it make sense in my position to aggressively pay down this loan until I reach the 80% mark?",finance
personalfinance,Personal Loan to pay for surgery but keep money in my bank question,"So I’m wanting to ideally borrow 2500 pounds

personalfinance,Consolidating high interest rate debt.,"Hello all! I've been a lurker in this community for quite sometime. I apologize in advance if this kind of post is not warranted here.

I am in kind of a hard spot with money and had a few questions, and If there was a different way to think about this.

I was thinking about taking a 3k or 5k personal loan out on Upstart to consolidate high interest debt. I owe about 2.4k on a credit card at 20.9% interest rate, plus various other smaller balls from several clinics, therapy, etc. Those smaller bills have no interest rates of any kind, but I want to have the peace of mind that almost all of my total debt is in one place. The total amount for these small bills + Credit Card debt = about $3800

(Not sure if this matters but I do have a highish credit score. )

\*3k Loan (after the initial fee, I would get $2857) and has a 13.4% rate, w/ mo. payment of $68.87 for 5 years

\*5k Loan (after the initial fee, I would get $4789) and has a 14.82% rate, w/ mo. payment of $118.47 for 5 years

I did also just finalize a monthly budget and I have room for either monthly rate in it. the 5k loan leaves me with a a bit less wiggle room, but I def can afford it monthly.

(There is no penalty for paying it off early either)

If I take the 3k loan, I would pay off my credit card outright and just put the rest in savings and use that for the first monthly payments.

If I take out the 5k loan, I would pay off all debts and do the same thing as previously noted.

Should I bother taking a loan out at all? I would be paying less money overall over 5 years no matter which loan I take. But I do realize that I would be paying interest on things that don't already have any interest.",finance
personalfinance,Sold house and lost on the net proceeds,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently borrowed 40k from my MIL to purchase my forever home for me 29 and my wife 29. We used 20k to put down on a 400k house. The other 20 we used to pay off my truck ( I originally was going to put all 40k down on house but realized that was bad dumb with 2.87% interest). 

We just listed our previous house and after 20 viewings and only 1 offer (above asking, idk how) we accepted. We stand to net 93k best case and 83 worst case. After paying my MIL back (40k) we should have 40-50k leftover. What do we do with it??

Wife 66k student loan (advanced degree) 6% (YIKES) $700 min payment (covid has it at $0)

Myself 9.5k (undergrad) 4.38% $100 min monthly

Mortgage 380k 2.87%

Car $20,000 at 4.5%  min payment $400 month

CC less than 500

Wedding band $1200 @ 0% interest $50 month

**Current monies**

$7800 minimum monthly income between the both of us. Commission can be anywhere from $1000+ a month, really just depends so I try to not count it. 

MY original thought was I want us to save maybe 10k and invest the other 30-40 ish. I would get a rental property (not immediately but eventually) or do it in some blue chip stocks and just hold it. After finding out her interest rate was 6% my thought was yea I may can get 7% returns but erasing that 6% rate is probably best. 

She wanted to save it all and earn .000003% interest from regions..smh. She also wants to immediately pay off her band bc its just ""another pointless payment / debt."" SMH.

Do we invest? Do we pay off her loan? Do we wait for a Housing crash and hold cash or what. IF its someone elses idea shes more inclined to listen. Help me friends. If you need more info, holler!

stocks,"3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Oracle, Adobe, Kroger","While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.

Although the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  

So far, stocks investors don’t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&amp;P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.

1. Oracle
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.

The shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant’s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.


Growth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world’s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm’s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.


2. Adobe Systems
Another stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.


Adobe’s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker’s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe’s revenue growth. 

In March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.

The company introduced a version of its popular app—Illustrator—for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.

Consumers of Document Cloud products—including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software—have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.

3. Kroger
Supermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.

Kroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer’s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.

Kroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers’ lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week’s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.

“COVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,” Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March.",finance

This has the most recipients of a $Butter donation to date proving that Milk and Butter are here to stay and make a difference despite any market fluctuations. https://ffl.org/user/milktoken/

Action Against Hunger is the latest of Milk and Butter’s historic partnerships. In total, the token has raised over $455,000 since it’s launch on 4/4/21. The token works by utilizing a fee on every transaction. A portion of that fee is sent to the “Charity Wallet” where investors can then vote on which charity receives the funds. A percentage of every donation goes to Butter Token’s partners Food for Life Global and Action Against Hunger. The remainder of the funds are donated to the winning charity. Binance charity received $8,818, Food For Life Global received $5,722 and Action Against Hunger received $1,866.

CEO of Food For Life Global Paul Turner says, “Happy to report that the Milk and Butter community of investors have now fed 442,968 children in need via Food for Life Global.” The diversity in donations allows for different care and treatment for those in need. The donations to Action Against Hunger will focus on helping children facing malnutrition. The money donated covers the cost of transportation, customs, medical fees, food, etc. “There is potentially 250 people who are here today because of you all so I just wanted to say thank you,” says Aron Flasher, Managing Director of Corporate Partnerships for Action Against Hunger.

Christian Claypool, CEO of Milk and Butter LLC, says, “With every donation we make, we're continuing to provide for those in need and generate a positive social output using our product and platform.“

2. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)

6. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)

17. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit.

18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
19. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

Namely this...

 • The California Dream For All program cuts the cost of first-time homebuyers by as much as 40 percent, saving  families more than $12,000 each year 

 Investors: 

• Shares of the Fund would be sold to investors, and the revenues generated by the sale of shares are then used to partner with additional homebuyers. 

• As the value of the homes partially owned by the Fund increases, the value of the Fund also increases. 

• Investors are free to sell their shares at any time. 

• The Fund, and therefore the investors, would not receive any rent payments, so the investment is tied only to the value of the homes. Therefore, to encourage investment:  

–  The Fund would not be responsible for any costs of the property, such as maintenance, property taxes,  insurance, etc.  –

 Capital gains would be tax-free under California law, and the goal would be for the federal government to also make them tax-free (treat similarly to municipal bonds). 

(It may be the case that the “silent partner” concept can be implanted entirely through private companies and investors and without a state-sponsored. In which case the state role will be limited to establishing eligibility requirements and providing tax incentives.)

personalfinance,Is buying a house an actual good investment?,"Hello all

I am new to this subreddit, so I am sorry if I am repeating an existing thread.Growing up, I always heard buying a house was a great investment. But recently, I have seen that idea challenged more and more. The idea is that instead of paying all those interest rates, it is better to invest the money, let it simmer, and then purchase a house when you have the actual money without the need to ask for a loan and pay a mortgage.

I live in the Netherlands and compared to my home country, the housing market doesn't seem as vicious. My partner and I have made some calculations and we could end up paying a very similar rate to what we already pay in rent. It is hard for us to really determine if we should or shouldn't buy a house and invest the money instead.

Maybe someone here has experience with this decision? I would love to hear personal stories of what you have done right or wish you had done differently. :)

CryptoCurrency,What are White papers? Beginners guide.,"$13.7 billion.

That’s how much Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have raised in the first half of 2018 alone!

When you consider the fact that that’s nearly double of what ICOs raised in the entirety of 2017, you can see why they have become such a hot topic.

Before ICOs became a household name, companies in the fiat world were already doing IPOs or Initial Public Offerings. The idea is very simple. Private companies become publicly traded by selling shares of their company to the public. IPOs require a lot of due diligence, formalities, and paperwork. Because of this, several deserving companies lost out on lucrative opportunities.

This is when ICOs came in and changed everything.

(NOTE: We are NOT saying that it is a good thing that ICOs doesn’t do so much due diligence.)

Developers and entrepreneurs finally had the chance to raise millions of dollars without going through excruciating paperwork. The only thing that they had to do was to present a whitepaper.

Now, consider this for a moment.

The entire fortune and the future of the company, is revolving around the quality of this whitepaper. This is the reason why it is so important to get the whitepaper right. This single PDF, if done correctly, can fetch you millions of dollars in under 24 hours.

What is a Whitepaper?

 Crypto Whitepaper

According to wikipedia, “A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body’s philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.”
The earliest known use of the term “White Paper”  was with the British Government and the Churchill White Paper of 1922. Back then, it was considered to be a less extensive version of the blue book, both terms having been derived from the colour of the document’s cover.

Ever since then, white papers have evolved to become a business owner’s best friend. No other piece of document better explains to your investors:

What are the problems that you are looking to solve?
How will your business solve those problems?
How will your business evolve in the future?
Importance of a Whitepaper

According to some surveys done in 2009 by the Savvy B2B Marketing blog “trial software and white papers are the most utilized, along with being among the most effective, forms of content for researching IT problems and solutions”.
They also quizzed various potential investors and found out that:

77% have read at least one whitepaper in the last 6 months as compared to 68% in their 2008 survey.
84% of them rated whitepapers as moderately to extremely influential when making technology-purchasing decisions”
Eccolo Media also conducted some survey back in 2013. The survey covers a plethora of content marketing topics – including which collateral types are most frequently consumed and considered most influential – as well as the stages of the sales cycle in which they are perceived to be most persuasive.

 The Ultimate Guide to Whitepapers (Blockgeeks)

Here are some of the conclusions that they have drawn from their research:

49% of the respondents claimed to have used white papers to evaluate a tech purchase, making it the most frequently consumed content type
Whitepapers came out ahead of case studies/success stories, product brochures/data sheets, detailed tech guides, and video/multimedia files as the most influential form of content marketing
Whitepapers are the best form of content during the pre-sale phase when your target investors are unaware of the problem you are solving
Every 7 in 10 respondents said it’s important or very important to continue to receive content from the vendor after the sale has been completed. White papers are clearly the most preferred content type post-purchase, followed by case studies and tech guides.
 Crypto Whitepaper

If these statistics and numbers still haven’t convinced you, then let us take you back in time to 2008, when an anonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released their whitepaper titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. That whitepaper not only introduced us to Bitcoin, it paved the way for other cryptocurrencies and the entire ICO industry. That whitepaper acquainted us with the blockchain technology.

That single whitepaper has defined an entire era and has led us to a multi-billion dollar industry. A well-written and well thought out whitepaper can revolutionize an entire industry.

Things to do Before You Start Writing

Well, even before you start writing, there is some homework that you must take care of. As they say, the battle is won even before a single bullet is fired. Here are some things that you need to do:

Research, Research, and More Research

Every single area that your whitepaper needs to cover should be thoroughly researched. You need to pull all the information that you can over the problems that you are about to solve, and how previous attempts at solving them have failed (if applicable). You can use all these articles as citations in your whitepaper later on, which is going to increase your credibility.

You have to remember that whitepapers are all extremely data-focussed. So, in order to fill up the pages, you must have a lot of facts. A good whitepaper is one that has been supported by significant research. Go all out, do not take any half measures.

Read Other White Papers

There is a big chance that somebody else is already working in your topic or subject area already. If that’s the case then have they already released a whitepaper? If yes then you should go through them to see the approach that they are taking to see how you can improve it. Plus, you can also check out the areas where you can really showcase your project’s USP. Also, it is always a good idea to revisit the classics such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum whitepaper.

Organize Everything

So, after distilling all your research and creating all the diagrams and graphs, it can be extremely overwhelming to put everything together in one place and. So, you should organize all your information beforehand so it becomes easy to handle and structure alter.

Identify Your Audience

What kind of audience are you aiming for?

Do they belong to a certain age group? Are they located in a particular area? Which fields are they interested in? What kind of people will be attracted to your project?

Once you have an idea of the audience that you will be attracting, you should be able to adapt your language and talk to them in a particular way

How to Structure Your Whitepaper

Alright, so you have done your homework, now it is time to bring everything together and create your own whitepaper. Obviously, we understand that you may not be the best writer, however, we advise you to try and write your own whitepaper. Obviously, you may get lucky and find a great writer who picks up on all the nooks and crannies of your project. However, at the end of the day, nobody knows your product better than you.

There is no set structure to a whitepaper. A company creates a whitepaper which fulfills their needs and approach. At the end of the day, no matter what kind of structure that you are following, a great whitepaper should be able to solve any doubts that a potential investor is having by answering the following questions:

What is the main aim of this project?
Does it have a viable business model?
What are the main problems that this business is going to solve?
How is it different from its competitors? What is its USP?
How are they planning to handle their funds?
Does the project’s token have any real utility?
Does this project require a blockchain?
Who are the team members and what is their credibility?
Is there a working prototype of this project out there or is it just all theoretical right now?

Here are some general sections that a whitepaper should definitely have:

#1 Headline and Abstract

Headline and Abstract barely takes one page together. However, if you don’t nail this part, 90% of your readers are going to leave at once. We don’t need to tell you the importance of a headline. How many times have you opened an email in your inbox purely on the strength of its headline?

A good headline should instantly grab your attention and make you feel intrigued enough to know more. You don’t need to look any further than “Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system”.

An abstract is basically a Tl;Dr version of your project. More often than not, people will read your abstract to know what you have to offer. A good abstract should hook your audience enough to make them want to read your whole white paper.

#2 Introduction

After the abstract, you have the introduction. Remember that you are still walking on thin ice as of right now. It takes at least 5 pages to get your audience hooked in. Abstract and Introduction combined should be around 2 or 2.5 pages at most.

In the introduction, you must justify why you are creating your project and then briefly gloss over the current economic, political, management etc. climate which supports the need of your project. Basically:

Why is your project important?
Why is your project important at this very moment.
Nagricoin does a great job in its introduction:

“During the past seven years, 5 million USD was spent on active research and field tests to gauge Nagri’s effectiveness. Tests were conducted in more than 10 countries, including Brazil, Uruguay, Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Italy, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The research involved large private agricultural holdings, as well as state research centres and laboratories of various countries.
The results of testing showed that Nagri-HL increases the yield of different crops from 10% to 30%, depending on the geographical area of cultivation and on weather conditions. At the same time, an increase in yield was also observed with the addition of Nagri-HL to almost all known combinations of fertilizers and plant protection products.”
They successfully showcased the credibility of the product and also how it can improve one of the backbones of the current age, the agricultural industry.

#3 Problem, Solution, and Product Description

So, after the project has been introduced, you must talk about the problem that you are looking to solve and the solution that you have come up with, i.e. your product. Several projects simply showcase over-designed PDFs throwing around a bunch of problems and solutions without actually getting deep into their product.

Now remember, this is where you hook in your audience once and for all. This is the section that makes or breaks your entire business. Take your time to give a clear, technical explanation of your product and how you are planning to achieve your results. Make liberal use of graphics and diagrams to explain concepts to your readers and to provide visual relief. Hire someone to create infographics for you if you need to. Remember, you have to crush it in this section.

Obviously, there must be specific terms that you need to explain in your whitepaper to help your audience better understand your product. Or maybe there is a process integral to you business which you have to explain to your audience (like how Plasma is integral to OmiseGo). If you haven’t touched those in the intro, then you must touch upon them now.

Throughout this section, you are going to be walking a tightrope. You may be tempted to use a lot of fluffy phrases and jargon terms, however, you should limit their usage. However, at the same time, you must not undersell your product and solution as well. You need to strike that balance and hit the sweet spot. Make sure that you are using an educative tone and not a sales one.

Every single claim that you are making throughout your whitepaper should be backed up credible references.

#3 Token Economics

Next thing that you need to describe properly is the role of your token in your business. The token role should be as clearly defined as possible. The more utility your token has, the more valuable it will be. The reason behind this is two-fold.

Firstly, if you don’t have a clearly defined token, your investors are going to be more or less speculative in nature. They won’t have realistic expectations of your token, and the moment the market drops, they are going to ditch your token and make off.

This isn’t what you should want for your token.

Your token shouldn’t be a placeholder that anyone will swap for BTC or Fiat at the drop of a fly. It should be a proven commodity that people will want to hold on to in their portfolio. Clearly defining the token role will go a long way in doing that.

Because if you don’t, then chances are that your project will lose steam down the line. According to a Deloitte Insights report published in November 2017, Blockchain projects’ failure rate is as high as 92 percent, mostly due to “the lack of actual application scenarios and the quick loss of community members.”
The concept of token velocity is intertwined with why you would want people to hold on to your tokens.

Token velocity is one of the key aspects that affect the future speculative value of the tokens, however not a lot of people truly understand it. If you were to look at Token Velocity as a mathematical formula, it is as follows:

Velocity = Total Transactional Volume / Average Network Value

So, Velocity is directly proportional to the total transactional volume of a coin and is inversely proportional to the average network volume. If you flip this formula around, then you get the following:

Average Network Value = Total Transactional Volume / Velocity.

Meaning, more the token velocity, less the average network volume of the ecosystem.

Alright, so we got a lot of mathematical definitions, however, what does that mean and why are we saying that this could be the ultimate judge of ICO success.

Velocity basically is an indication of how much people respect the project’s tokens.

#4 Token Usage Guidelines

Imagine if you were to invest in an ICO, wouldn’t you want to know exactly how the company will be using your hard-earned money? That is exactly the same respect that you should extend to your investors. The thing is that the modern day investor is extremely savvy. With the sheer amount of scams that have been going on, it makes sense as to why they will be more wary about where their money is going.

As a result, you should have a detailed plan and layout as to how you are going to be spending your money. The investors should be sure that the money is going to build your product instead of facilitating your lifestyle.

Status, who raised more than $100 million in their ICO stated that pretty clearly. Here is a part of what they are planning to do with their funds: “20% of SNT created during the Contribution Period will be allocated to Status Core Dev; the founders and team, over a 24 month vesting period, with a 6 month clif. This means Founder tokens will not be immediately tradable, further aligning the Founders interests with executing upon the long term goals for the project.”
#5 Road Map

Every whitepaper should have a RoadMap which records the key events for the business and their deadlines. The section can be stylized as a chronological diagram that is more visual than text-based.

Why should a RoadMap be given?

Firstly, it gives a good idea to your investors as to how your project is going to pan out. This was they can have realistic expectations.
Secondly, it enables constant monitoring of the progress of the project. It will keep the project developers constantly accountable.
At the very least, the RoadMap should have a detailed working plan for the next 12–18 months, which should include the beta-launch.

#6 Team and Advisors

Easily one of the most important part of your whitepaper is the section where you introduce your readers to your team. A well put together team or employees and advisors can go a long way in securing heavy investment.

Let us give you the example of OmiseGO

These are the advisors that they have on-board:

Vitalik Buterin: The man behind Ethereum

Does it surprise you that they were able to raise $25 million in under 24 hours?

The team section is the most important section of any white paper. Period.

As Andrew Chapin, the co-founder of Benja, says, “Every angel investor has a story about investing in a brilliant team with a horrible idea, knowing that they would find pay-dirt after they pivoted out of the original idea. Android was an operating system for cameras before their pivot, Nokia was a wood pulp mill, and Pinterest was a shopping app before it was a social network before it started turning back into a shopping app again.”
You should make sure that you are surrounded by a great team AND you should also make sure that you are showcasing them and their talents properly in your whitepaper. Most ICOs out there don’t even have a proper blockchain engineer on their team! Having no one on your team with significant blockchain experience is a clear sign that the project is not going to go anywhere or, best case scenario, the progress is going to be extremely slow.

How to Design Your Whitepaper

Ok, so now you know how to go about writing your whitepaper, however, the presentation is just as important as well. There are several key areas where you should focus in on. (Huge shoutout to Agentestudio.)

Cover Page

Firstly, the cover page of your whitepaper needs to look sleek, neat, and professional. Nagricoin hits the nail on this one. Not only does their cover look neat, but you also instantly know what they are about.

 Crypto Whitepaper

Images For Explanation and Relief

There should be images throughout your whitepaper which:

Explains the processes that you are talking about.
Gives your readers a relief/break from the content
The Bitcoin whitepaper does this by frequently throwing in diagrams to explain how various blockchain mechanisms work.

Monetha uses plenty of graphs in the middle to back their claims:

Jazzing up your Whitepaper

Try to look for other areas where you can add some fun design element without compromising on professionalism. WePower does that brilliantly with their team page. They knew how important and closely scrutinized that page was going to be, so they just made the read more enjoyable but designing it in a cool way.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

If you are thinking of auditing your ICO whitepaper for a second opinion, then you should do these checks before you send it over. These are some extremely common mistakes that all whitepapers make which you can avoid with a simple check:

Spelling mistakes: Just don’t make these. They look extremely unprofessional. A simple Grammarly check should be enough.
All your conclusions and perceptions should be objective and not subjective.
Over-ambitious goals which are not backed up: Most whitepapers are going to make extremely far-fetched goals without any backing whatsoever. If you are claiming that you are going to do something, then you must at least show how you are going to do it. Actions speaks louder than words.
Token Dynamics: If your token doesn’t make any sense then you should go back to the drawing board and start reworking your entire model immediately.
Team: Each and every member of your team should be up to the task. Remember, an interested investor WILL check up on your team members. Make sure that you have no weak links.
Unrealistic Roadmap: “WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A MULTI-LEVEL BLOCKCHAIN AND SCALE TO MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS PER SECONDS IN TWO MONTHS!!” No..you are not.
Common Formatting Mistakes: Are you using images of different resolutions throughout your whitepaper? If the font and font size not consistent? Do you have an inconsistent layout?
Crypto Whitepaper: Conclusion

Before we conclude, we must say something here. While these guidelines are going to help you, we highly recommend that you start reading other successful ICO whitepapers as much as possible. They will teach you more than anything else. We wish you all the best and hope that you create an absolutely killer whitepaper!

Bitcoin,Interview German Newspaper - BIS - Basel Central Banker,"This Interview appeared today in the German Newspaper  ""Der Spiegel""

It is an ""automated"" translation. I found it interesting just to see the arguments of a ""Central Banker""

For me it would be interesting to have a view of this arguments from the community here

&amp;#x200B;

**About the person**

**Agustín Carstens** is a central banker through and through. From 1980, he worked for the Banco de México, and in 1999 he joined the International Monetary Fund. He later became Mexico's finance minister, then head of his home country's central bank. Since 2017, Carstens has led the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. The world's oldest international financial organization manages the foreign reserves of national central banks and plays a central role in monetary and financial policy events.

Agustín Carstens (63) is driven by the Bitcoin phenomenon. The Mexican is head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, a kind of super central bank. In an interview with SPIEGEL, Carstens makes clear how little he thinks of most cryptocurrencies - and why he nevertheless sees good opportunities for Facebook's Diem money, of all things.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview:**

SPIEGEL: Mr. Carstens, the bitcoin price has risen dramatically since the beginning of the year, but in recent weeks it has plummeted almost as much. Is a bubble bursting, as critics of cryptocurrencies believe?

Carstens: In many cases, it is enormously difficult to judge what is still normal and what is a bubble. But in this case it's simple: this is a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Why are you so sure?

Carstens: The price has risen steeply in a short time, but there was never any reason that could have explained the increase. So it's hard to believe that it's not a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Is the financial system in danger?

Carstens: No, I don't think so. Bitcoin is a speculative asset, but on the other hand it is not so widespread that it endangers the system. That applies to cryptocurrencies in general. They are bought by individual investors, but not to any significant extent by banks. However, bitcoin is an environmental disaster. And the market is easy to manipulate - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to fraud.

SPIEGEL: Explain that, please.

Carstens: These so-called coins are misleadingly called currencies, but they have no fundamental value. The current price depends heavily on who entered the market last. Individual investors can drive the price up first and then let it fall to make a profit. This ""pump and dump"" phenomenon is typical for niche markets.

SPIEGEL: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is such an individual investor who, thanks to Twitter, has proven that he has enough power to influence the bitcoin price enormously, in both directions. Does that mean Musk is a threat to the financial market?

Carstens: That's a question that the relevant authorities need to clarify.

SPIEGEL: Is the current regulation sufficient?

Carstens: We need to improve regulation. After all, the special thing about cryptocurrencies is that they have no nationality, but are at home in cyberspace, in other words, in a parallel world. Above all, we need to regulate the platforms on which cryptocurrencies are traded. And we need to make it clear, including in interviews like this one, that this is a very risky market.

""It has been shown, after all, that bitcoins have no practical use.""

SPIEGEL: Cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular. Could you eventually become a real threat to money issued by states - so-called fiat currencies - or even replace them?

Carstens: I am much more confident today than I was a few years ago that this will not happen. After all, it has been shown that Bitcoins have no practical use. Look at the example of Tesla: The company just decided to stop accepting Bitcoins when someone wants to buy one of your cars.

SPIEGEL: American chains like Starbucks and Home Depot do accept cryptocurrencies.

Carstens: Bitcoin is only good for two things - speculation and ransom payments. Cryptocurrencies are not a good store of value because they are so volatile; they are not a medium of exchange because they are hardly accepted; and they are not a threat to real currencies because they do not have the same purpose as real currencies.

SPIEGEL: But if corporations like Facebook create their own digital currencies, they could become popular very quickly.

Carstens: Facebook's Diem, initially known as Libra, is based on exciting technology and backed by the dollar. That's an important distinction from bitcoin. Facebook is not creating a new currency with it, but what are known as stable coins. And Facebook is discussing the concept with the authorities, which is something completely different.

SPIEGEL: But is the Diem possibly a Trojan horse if enough users join in and Facebook ends its peg to the dollar?

Carstens: I don't see that danger; moreover, appropriate regulatory precautions could be taken. But the Diem shows us: The next step should be for central banks to develop their own digital currencies.

SPIEGEL: Who needs something like that? People have cash, debit and credit cards, PayPal and other payment options.

Carstens: At first glance, there is no pressing need for central banks to introduce digital currencies. Cash is indeed one of mankind's best inventions. But as society becomes more digital and payment systems evolve, there should be a digital complement to cash. We need to transfer the trust people have in traditional money to the digital world. That's not easy. We have to do it well and seriously.

SPIEGEL: Could cryptocurrencies, if they become more dominant, undermine central banks' monetary policies?

Carstens: No, cryptocurrencies do not play a relevant role in the financial system today or in the foreseeable future. Therefore, they will not influence the monetary policy of central banks.

SPIEGEL: Do digital central bank currencies pose a threat to private banks? People could withdraw their savings at the push of a button and move them to the central bank in a crisis.

Carstens: No, after all, to prevent a run on bank accounts, there are a variety of regulations, monitoring by supervisory authorities, as well as state deposit insurance systems. Apart from that, central banks certainly have no interest in copying private banks and their services. A digital central bank currency accessible to the general public would, of course, also require very intensive interaction with the general public. Central banks don't have the capacity for that. For that, you will have to rely on commercial banks - just like in the current system.

SPIEGEL: Could digital central bank money make it easier for people who don't have a traditional bank account to access digital cash?

Carstens: Yes, that is an important aspect. People of all ages and social backgrounds can do something with cash. That's why we need to copy the advantages of cash for the digital era. We want every member of society to be able to use digital central bank money.

SPIEGEL: Bitcoin fans argue that a decentralized monetary system is needed to prevent monetary policy from being politically abused and interest rates and exchange rates from being manipulated, for example. What is your position on this?

Carstens: That's nonsense. Central banks have become much more transparent in recent years and decades, explaining their decisions and also regularly reporting to parliaments. Our priority is to control inflation, promote growth and thus also ensure employment. I believe that citizens understand that.

SPIEGEL: Do central banks need to hurry up and offer digital money?

Carstens: There is no advantage to being the first central bank to offer digital money. Rather, it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to make any mistakes, that we protect this digital central bank currency against hacking attacks and that we preserve data protection. The technical challenge is great.

3/3

SPIEGEL: What might the financial system with digital central bank money look like in a few years?

""We don't want to abolish cash.""

Carstens: We will have more efficient payment transactions, more people will benefit from financial innovations. Money transfers - even to far-flung corners of the world - will become much cheaper. We don't want to abolish cash. Our promise is that we will create a technologically advanced form of money that offers the same benefits and more.

SPIEGEL: Will there be corporate digital currencies alongside it, or decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?

Carstens: That's possible if they are strictly regulated. I see a future for stable coins if they are really stable, traded on platforms where there is fair competition, and if they protect consumers' data.

SPIEGEL: There are currently a lot of cryptocurrencies in circulation. Will they disappear as quickly as they emerged?

Carstens: It's nothing new in the history of money that currencies come into being and disappear again. Come to my home country, Mexico, and visit the money museum there. There you can see how many currencies there have been in our country. In the end, means of payment that are backed by a stable and independent central bank prevail. It may be that other currencies can exist as speculative investments, but not as money with all its functions.

SPIEGEL: So in the end, it's about what kind of money people trust?

Carstens: Yes, I think that's the central question.

stocks,Quick discussion around US Inflation,"Alright, let's talk a bit more about US inflation.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html)

So, they keep talking about the 10-year US bond yield as a signal that the market has ""shrugged off"" inflation concerns. Has it though? It has gone down, yes. But maybe, just maybe, it is because the Fed is doing everything they can to keep bond yields low? Up until last month, the Fed expectation was that rates would be hiked up in late 2021-mid-2022. Now, the expectation is 2023. Remember, low interest rates tend to lead to high inflation (low interest makes savings and bonds worthless). Also, actual inflation continues to beat Fed expectations every month. For April, the Fed expected 3.6%. They got 4.2%. For May, they expected 4.7%. They got 5%! They keep revising their expectations up and up and up. If inflation was a stock, I would buy it!

So, when was the last time it was this high? June to September of 2009. **12 years ago**. Inflation also steadily increased then, it did not spike. Before that? May 1991 which followed a year of sustained inflation over 5%. **30 years ago**. I know that the Fed keeps saying that we've had weird circumstances, but it's not like we've had negative inflation at any point since March 2020 so... what are you on about, Fed?

Granted, we've only had 1 month of 5% inflation. For now. However, we also have:

* $120bln that the Fed is pumping into the economy every month.
* the $500bln in its reverse repo (money that's been essentially been taken OUT of circulation).
* almost 0% interest rates, which will not be lifted until 2023 (current expectation).
* commodity prices rising across the board due to shortages.
* rising labour costs and record job vacancies because people make more money staying at home than working.
* an increasing government spending.
* the housing markets across the world at an all-time high.

Should I keep going?

Hope that gives you a good idea where we stand right now with inflation! I really want to hear your opinion on this :)",finance
cardano,Why don't I just jump in and out of a staking pool before every snapshot?,"So I'm a complete noob when it comes to staking cardano, but I wonder: 

&amp;#x200B;

When I delegate my ADA to a staking pool right before the epoch ends and remove it right after the new epoch started, I will still get the full rewards of that particular pool, right? Or are pool rewards calculated based on how long my ADA is in there? 

I'm just trying to get my head around this, because I see a potential arbitrage between borrowing/lending and staking. I could borrow tons of ADA for a low interest rate (usually below 1% p.a.), put that into a staking pool to receive the rewards right at the end of the epoch, take it out again and repay my loan. 

I'd have very low ADA price risk and get about 4% interest per year. If you leverage that  trade to the hills, it's more or less an arb.

CryptoCurrency,Italian Stock Market Watchdog Calls for Crypto Regulation,"The head of the Italian stock market regulator - Consob, Paolo Savona, believes that as long as cryptocurrencies are not regulated, they may cause concern and may bring damage to the way the market works.

That followed the statement of the head of the Dutch regulator CPB that the Netherlands must ban Bitcoin and the rest of cryptocurrencies.

“Crypto can prevent central banks from conducting monetary policy”
Paolo Savona believes that digital currencies in Italy must circulate and be utilized under proper regulation. Otherwise, they are a perfect tool for money laundering and can prevent central banks from conducting monetary policy.

He stated that without regulation, cryptocurrencies can worsen the transparency of the market, adding that this is “the basis of legality and rational choice for (market) operators”.

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/14/21","Good morning everyone! It's Monday, and I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* CRSR: Gapping up above relevant SMA's. Room for further upwards movement, but I'll wait for things to settle after open. Possible support at 36 on the daily chart.
* NVAX: Possible resistance levels at 230 and 240, I'll watch for upwards movement if it can hold over 230. 
* COIN: Key resistance level right around 230. I'll be watching for the break over 230 for an opportunity to go long.
* TSLA: Seems to be holding up over the SMA(200), SMA(20), and SMA(9), after hovering around that level the past few days of trading. Could be a sign of more upwards movement, and a move up towards the SMA(50) in the near future. Possible resistance around 635 on the daily chart. 
* ITOS: Will be interesting to observe price action around the 30 level. Could fill the gap (or at least partially fill) to the downside if it breaks below 30, if it holds up, there could be more upwards movement.

Gapping DOWN:

* UPST: Possible support around 120 on the daily chart. If it can't hold above that level, it could provide some shorting opportunities.
* MRNA: Still holding above relevant SMA (SMA(9)) at the moment. If it fails to fill the gap to the upside, it could be worth a look as a short down to 210.
* RIDE: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around the 10.00 level.
* BZ: Lots of room for downwards movement after the massive gap up on Friday. Could also see some continued momentum, so it'll be worth keeping an eye on. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit higher after we saw some strength to end last week. The Fed has signaled that it intends to ease its asset purchase program at some point in the coming future. It will be interesting to see if this has an immediate effect on the market. SPY is trading a bit over 424, and will likely set a new intraday ATH. Maybe we will see some choppiness up at these levels, but I'm optimistic we'll see more strength. DIA is trading just under 345. I'll be watching price action around 343.50, if it breaks down below it could see more downwards movement. Tech stocks are continuing their strength, and QQQ could see a push to new ATH this week (currently trading just below 342). Gold and silver are down a decent amount this morning, while crude oil is up a bit. Bitcoin is currently trading around 39,300, and seems to have flipped the bearish narrative. I'm more bullish if it can get up above 39,500 and hold up. Crypto-related stocks are up quite a bit in premarket trading, as a result. Marijuana stocks are up a bit in premarket, but nothing too significant. Still worth keeping an eye on them for potential upcoming catalysts. Meme stocks are showing some revival this mornin, and are always worth following.

I'm optimistic we'll see strength today, but stay disciplined in your trades, and let's start the week off right.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance

I'm making this post for a friend who has been having a problem with playing every game in his arsenal. On Warzone he loads the game up and is met with a connection error saying he has disconnected from the server. On battlefield he is able to get into a game and play for an unset amount of time (can be between 1-10 minutes) before being kicked and told he has disconnected from EA servers. Dead by Daylight is the exact same as battlefield and after being disconnected from servers and then has to entirely restart the game to even try playing again. 

He tried uninstalling and reinstalling battlefield which didn't change anything. He got so fed up with nothing fixing this problem he did a windows reset which wiped his NVME but left his HDD untouched for some reason, but after manually clearing the HDD and once again reinstalling battlefield it still continues to give the same problem of disconnecting him from servers. I personally have never heard of such issues spanning across every game he has tried to play. 

There is nothing online that have explanation attributed to ALL games disconnecting from server.

stocks,Is $WKHS a good buy after their dip?,"**Can Workhorse Find the Strength to Bounce Back?**

The [USPS Next generation Delivery Vehicle Project](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2021/0223-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet.htm) was recently awarded to Oshkosh Defense, which had extreme effects on the share price of [$WKHS – Workhorse.](https://utradea.com/stocks/WKHS) However, the question I wanted an answer to is did this occurrence make Workhorse an undervalued growth stock, or is Workhorse still overvalued even after their share price was massacred? This question led me to undergo this analysis to find out.

**Company Overview:** 

Workhorse is a technology company focused on renewable, and cost-effective solutions in the transportation sector (they make EV’s). Workhorse is an all-American electric delivery truck, and drone manufacturer that is constantly looking for new ways to innovate and optimize their mechanisms. Workhorse is currently working on bringing their [C-Series](https://workhorse.com/cseries.html) electric **delivery trucks** to the market to fulfill previous order request. Workhorse is an OEM trying to satisfy the requirements for their Class 2 – Class 6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck market.

Workhorse has highlighted some of the biggest benefits derive from using their vehicles, these include:

· Lower total cost-of-ownership compared to conventional gasoline/diesel vehicles (estimated to save $170k in fuel savings compared to their fossil fuel counterparts)

· Increased package deliveries per day through the use of more efficient delivery methods

· Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses

· Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.

Currently, Workhorse is selling their vehicles to their clients using the following distributors Hitachi, Ryder, and Pritchard. Furthermore, 2 of their distributors (Ryder and Pritchard) are also maintenance providers for Workhorse.

Currently, Workhorse has successfully delivered 370 electric delivery vehicles to their customers, and they are the only American OEM to reach these figures, which is quite the accomplishment. These customers consist of the following companies Alpha Baking, [FedEx](https://utradea.com/stocks/FDX), Fluid Market Inc., Pride Group Enterprises, Pritchard, [Ryder](https://utradea.com/stocks/R), [UPS](https://utradea.com/stocks/UPS), and WB Mason.

Workhorse’s Series-C delivery truck comes in 2 configurations, a 650 cubic ft., and a 1,000 cubic ft configuration. Furthermore, their Series-C vehicles include lightweight materials, 360-degree camera’s, collision avoidance, best-in-class turning radius, and their very own roof mounted [HorseFly delivery drone.](https://workhorse.com/horsefly.html) These features help to set Workhorse apart from both their electric and fossil fuel competitors, especially their roof-mounted drone.

**Investment Information:**

*USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Project:*

Last year, Workhorse was in competition to win a USPS contract to manufacture 165,000 vehicles for USPS to order and use as mail delivery vehicles. There were 4 other participants in this program, and Workhorse delivered 6 of their prototype vehicles for testing to potentially win this contract. On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Workhorse would not be obtaining this contract, but rather Oshkosh Defense.

This came as a surprise to many people and investors and WKHS share price was greatly affected by this news. However, this also created a buying opportunity for investors, as this contract was not the be all and end all of Workhorse’s business. Workhorse still manufactures their electric vehicles and has great potential in the EV Trucking space.

*HorseFly Technology:*

As I previously mentioned, Workhorse has their HorseFly drones built into their delivery vehicles. These HorseFly drones are patented, unmanned, and are incorporated into Workhorse’s delivery vehicles in order to deliver packages more efficiently.

These HorseFly drones are capable of carrying up to 10 pounds of packages (payload) and can reach maximum speeds at approximately 50 mph (80km/hr).

The HorseFly system includes an aircraft, a Ground Control Station (GCS), supports takeoff/landing, and has a cargo handling system. This system is designed to support high volumes of packages, long days of use, little maintenance is required, and the system allows Remote Pilots in Command (RPIC) allowing one pilot to control multiple drones.

Workhorse’s drones have been proven to be safe, reliable, and capable of delivering packages.

*Metron:*

Workhorse has a cloud-based, remote management system to trach vehicular performance, which they have called “Metron”. [Metron](https://workhorse.com/metron.html) collects data and signals while the truck is driving and stores this data in their database and is shared to their clients. This data will be used to map specific route parameters to better manage the battery power, which can help maximize efficiency and determine the ideal times and locations to charge their batteries.

*Partnerships:*

*Duke Energy:* 

Workhorse has entered into a partnership with [$DUK - Duke Energy](https://utradea.com/stocks/DUK) to create an innovative battery leasing program that provides customers with options and cost-competitive alternatives. Duke can also provide depot-wide electrification, battery leasing, and distributed energy resources to Workhorse’s customers. Duke and Workhorse \[partnered to make an integrated solution to help reduce the costs of converting existing fleets to quicken their adoption.

*Moog:*

Workhorse has also partnered with a company called [$MOG-A - Moog](https://utradea.com/stocks/MOG-A). This partnership is a joint venture (50%-50%) for the development of the unmanned aerial systems (UAS), (their drones). Teams from both Workhorse and Moog are working on developing these drones, their systems, and their sub-systems to improve their quality and make them the most capable UAS in the market. Their goal for these UAS is to be highly reliable, safe, and certified by the highest levels of government approval.

*Emission and Fuel Economy Standards:*

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues increasingly stringent fuel/emission standards for 2021-2027. In this document they highlight Workhorse as a “vocational vehicle” manufacturer, which makes Workhorse eligible for flexibility and incentive programs, such as the [Averaging, Braking, and Trading Program (ABT).](https://www.epa.gov/ve-certification/averaging-banking-and-trading-abt-report-template-and-guidance-locomotive-engines) This program allows fuel consumption credits to be banked, traded, or averaged. This will allow Workhorse to sell these credits to companies who have larger than mandated emissions.

*Clean Air Act:*

Workhorse has already acquired their Certificate of Conformity from the EPA. This certificate is required to be able to sell vehicles in states covered by the Clean Energy Act (ie. California).

*Intellectual Property:*

Workhorse currently has 8 existing patents, 1 of which is Canadian and covers their vehicle chassis assembly, and the other 7 are American covering vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle headers, onboard generator system, UAS package delivery system, and their drive module. Additionally, Workhorse has 19 pending patent applications.

Furthermore, Workhorse has 14 issued trademarks (US, and Internationally) and has filed for 5 more trademarks.

*Property:*

Workhorse owns 2 pieces of real estate, one of which is their 250,000 sq ft manufacturing plant in Union City, Indiana, and the other is a 45,000 sq ft administrative, manufacturing, and R&amp;D plant in Loveland, Ohio.

Furthermore, Workhorse leases 2 factories which are also located in Loveland, Ohio.

It is good to see that Workhorse has purchased these 2 factories as they will have greater control over what they chose to do and their methods of manufacturing. Also, paying off equity in these 2 factories is essentially paying down an asset.

*Financial Information:*

· **2016 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are still 102,500 shares yet to be converted from existing warrants from Workhorses 2016 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.08%

· **2017 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are 2,247,500 common shares, and 1,475,625 shares that can be converted from warrants that are yet to hit the market from Workhorse’s 2017 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be put on the market this year, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 3.02% on existing shares.

· **2019 Stock Incentive Plan:** There are also 773,115 common shares that can be converted from warrants, and 4,332,011 shares that are yet to be issued from Workhorse’s 2019 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 4.14%

· **Series B Preferred Stock:** In 2019, Workhorse offered some Series B Preferred Shares to accredited investors. Workhorse sold 1,250,000 of these shares, and each of these preferred shares can be converted into 7.41 common shares. If all of these preferred shares were converted there would be 9,262,500 common shares, however, we know that in 2019 and 2020, 1.6M shares were issued through the conversion of preferred shares. Meaning that there is a maximum of 7,662,500 common shares that can be converted. If all of the remaining preferred shares were to be converted, then it would cause a dilutionary effect of roughly 6.22%

· **2024 Convertible Notes:** Currently, there is $197.7M worth of convertible notes, which are convertible at $35.29/share. This means that there are 5,602,154 shares that can be converted from these notes. If this were to happen, existing shares would exhibit dilutionary effects of 4.55%.

· **Marathon Warrant Agreement:** In 2018, Workhorse sold Marathon Asset Management a warrant to purchase 8,053,390 shares for an exercise price of $1.25. If these warrants were to be exercised and sold, there would be dilutionary effects of 6.53%.

· **RSU and Options:** In Workhorses stock-based compensation they also offer options and restricted stock units (RSU), and as of December 2021, there are 1.97M shares available from options to be purchased at $2.10/share (exercisable over the next 1.8 years), and 1.37M shares in RSU’s (which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.7 years). If all of these options are exercised, and the RSU’s are vested then there will be dilutionary effects of 2.72%.

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Workhorse had a great year in 2020, as their net sales increased by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Workhorse’s gross loss increase by 113.35% however their surge in “other income” helped to prop up earnings (they are not making money from solely the sale of their vehicles), and their interest expense increased by 553.67%.

· **Liquidity:** Workhorse has nearly doubled their cash position YoY, from $23.9M to $46.8M. They noted that they will use some of this cash to finance projects in 2021 in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-003538/)

*Management Team:*

**Duane Hughes (CEO, President, and Director):** Mr. Hughes has 20 years of direct experience and has relationships in the automotive, advertising, and technology industries. Prior to Workhorse, he worked at Cumulus Interactive Technologies Group as their COO, and prior to this he worked as VP of sales and operations for Gannett Co. Inc.

**Robert Willison (COO):** Mr. Willison previously served as the Director of Fleet Technology for Sysco Corp. Prior to Sysco, Mr. Willison worked as the CTO of Rav Technologies.

**Steve Schrader (CFO):** Mr. Schrader has over 16 years of experience in public and private companies in a variety of industries. Prior to Workhorse Steve was the CFO of Fuyao Glass America for 4 years.

**Stephen Fleming (VP):** Mr. Fleming worked at Workhorse for 9 years as corporate/securities counsel before being promoted to VP. Previously to that, Mr.Fleming served as the managing member of Fleming PLLC, which is a boutique law firm specializing in corporate/securities law.

Although these people do not have the most extensive background in the automotive industry they have a solid background in business, finance, and technology. This is good to hear as they should be able to run this business from a management standpoint, however, where these people lack expertise in the automotive field, they can consult their board of directors who have worked for companies like GM, Piston Group, Cadillac etc. This helps to create a well-rounded management team that I believe is capable of running this business properly.

**Investment Valuation:** 

Due to Workhorse’s current financial information, I am not able to create a DCF model in order to value the company. However, I was able to undergo comparable analyses, in which I compared Workhorse’s EV/Assets, EV/Revenue and P/B multiples to their competitors. In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I took a weighted average of the comparable analyses.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing this multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $WKHS of $11.97, if this were the case the implied downside would be 22.91%.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Workhorse’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $535.36, which would imply an upside of 3347.23%. This is absurdly high and is due to $NKLA – Nikola having an EV/Revenue multiple of 153,392.

*P/B:*

By comparing Workhorse’s P/B ratio to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value per share of $14.73, which would imply a downside risk of 5.14%.

*Weighted Average Comparable:*

Since the EV/Revenue comparable implied such a large upside I gave it a weight of 6.6% (20% of equal weight (33%).) the other two results achieve in the comparable analyses are both then weighted equally at 46.7%.

By doing this I arrived at an estimated fair value per share of $15.93, which would imply that Workhorse has a potential upside of 2.58%. This essentially means that you are buying close to fair value, which helps to mitigate risk.

*Analyst Coverage:*

The average analyst price target of 7 Wall Street analysts for $WKHS – Workhorse is $15.70, which would imply an upside of 1.09%, this implies that Workhorse is an undervalued growth stock. These estimates are similar to the results I achieved in my comparable analyses.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Workhorse has had problems with their levels of dilution in the past as they have averaged 44.64% share dilution per year over the last 3 years. Furthermore, these high levels of dilution are also looking pretty likely in the future as Workhorse is yet to offer all of the shares from their 2016, 2017, and 2019 stock incentive plans, their Series B Preferred Shares, their 2024 Convertible Notes, their Warrant Agreement with Marathon Asset Management, their RSU’s, and finally their outstanding options. All of these programs, plans, and agreements will account for approximately 27.26% of future share dilution. This level of previous dilution, and the levels of expected dilution are very high, even for a high-growth, high-potential stock like Workhorse, and should worry current and potential investors alike.

· **Financial Performance:** As stated previously, Workhorse has a couple sections of their financial reports that did not look so favourable (gross loss increase, and high interest expense growth.) If Workhorse does not continue to make large sums of revenue from their “other revenue” segment, then their losses will appear bigger, and they may not report another positive year (like they did this year). This would be detrimental for the stock and scare off investors.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Workhorse increased their net sales by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt. As stated previously, this was Workhorse’s first time reporting a positive net income on their yearly statement, this could show investors that they have turned around the business, and if they continue this performance in the future, then it will solidify this belief and attract investors.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Reddit Tab](https://utradea.com/feed), Workhorse is the 4th most trending stock (in the past 24 hours) and the 9th most tending stock (in the past 48 hours) on Wall Street Bets and has an overall positive sentiment. We have seen the impact that Wall Street Bets has had on other trending stocks, so it will be interesting to see if Wall Street Bets can pump this stock for a quick return.

· **Short Squeeze Potential:** Currently, Workhorse has a short interest of 22%, which makes it a good candidate for s short squeeze. Furthermore, the short borrow rate (premium) for people/institutions to short Workhorse is at 11.91%, which can cause the shorts to have to cover quicker than usual. This stock has the potential to be squeezed, especially if Wall Street Bets takes an interest in it.

Which retirement account could I transfer my 401k balance into and still be able to withdraw money for college tuition with less penalty?

I’m currently a 23 year old who’s going to college for the first time. Starting college for Civil Engineering fall 2021. I completed my basic courses at a local community college and have 2 years left to finish the degree. Federal Student loans do not cover the entire cost of tuition and housing and at this time I’d rather not take out a private student loan. I’m completely independent and am unable to rely on anyone else financially. I have about 18k in my 401k. I have about 5k left in tuition/Housing. I’m also leaving my current employer and would be open to transfer the 401k balance into a different type of account. Any recommendations on how to approach the situation? 

Thank you for your time. Any advice is welcomed :)",finance

personalfinance,How best to save funds for a shorter term with access quickly if I need them?,"TLDR: I'm looking for some advice on whether to pay off our car, put money into the market, or what other steps we should take to position ourselves to be able to take out money quickly if needed for a down payment on a new home in 2-4 years.

So my wife and I, and our two young kids are living in our first home (been here 11 years) and while it is great, and absolutely fits our needs right now, we are hoping to buy a house with some property in about 2-4 years from now when a) the insanity that is the housing market slows down (hopefully), and b) at least one of our kids is out of daycare, freeing up some monthly spending to apply towards what will ultimately be a larger mortgage payment.

Our current home is in great shape for us to stay here longer if needed, but also I feel desirable for buyers as we resealed the entire house (caulking), new roof, new gutters, new paint, and replaced a rotted fence in 2020, and had done a new water heater in 2018, furnace and A/C unit back in 2017.  So the larger ticket items have been taken care of on the home.

Here's our financial details:

* Both of us have excellent credit (800+)
* I make upper 70's she makes lower 80's
* Mortgage payment of $1,615/mo (includes taxes, escrow etc) at 3.65% interest rate. We pay an even $1700/mo (owe $257k, house is worth around $430-460k).
* Car payment of $575/mo (owe $17,800) at 3.44%. I've been paying $1k/mo as of January 2021 to pay it off faster.
* Childcare of $2k/mo
* $10k emergency fund (just hit that) and will continue to put $500/mo into that account.
* We put all our spending each month on a credit card that offers cash back and pay it off in full at the end of each month.
* $210k in retirement between SEP-IRA (employer pays 14% of salary unmatched) and 403b I contribute to.
* No other debt

My main questions are:

* Do I continue the $1k/mo towards the car to pay it off faster and free up that monthly commitment or do I go back to paying minimums and take the difference (\~$475/mo) and put it into another type of savings account or something that plays the market?
* Same question regarding the $500/mo we are continuing to put towards our e-fund? Keep doing that to slowly grow it, or put it elsewhere?
* What type of account could I open and put money into that would give me the potential to grow it, but also the flexibility to pull it out without massive penalties/fee's if I needed the funds?

Really appreciate any feedback you all could provide.

He owes me money (had to hire junk haulers for $1200 when he left large furniture and trash in our yard on moving day and disappeared on me) so he has blocked my phone #. 

Problem is, we haven’t filed taxes yet for 2020. I had reminded him several times throughout the divorce process that we needed to get it done. I didn’t want to do it on my own because we owe, and I didn’t  want to get stuck paying in for both of us now that he has cut off contact to avoid paying me back.

I just want to be sure I’m not doing anything sketchy before I file! The thought of filing taxes for my ex-spouse doesn’t feel quite right, anyway. I’d like to get my own done, at least.

32M looking for personal financial advice.

Financials: 

Full time job: approximately 60k a year (currently) with OT opportunities and extra pay for holidays. I can make a bit more depending on OT. 

Part time jobs: approximately 15k+ this year. Could be more depending on shifts I can afford to pick up.

Savings: 5k

Debt: 

no real CC debt, maybe 1-1.5k that floats. Usually paid off every pay period but floating a bit right now.

Car: 12kish left, worth about 25k in today's market. Won't sell, non negotiable.

School: 23k, 17k, 7k, 7k, 7k. Have been paying everything through the pandemic. Interest rates are all about 6-7%


So I work for a non profit that qualifies for loan forgiveness. I have not been hitting the loans hard because I am low key hoping they get written off in 4ish more years. I do understand the vast, vast majority do not get written off but hoping new legislature changes that.

Paycheck take home is about $1500 from my full time gig, sometimes more like $1700 if I've pulled even a little OT. Anywhere from $200-$800 on my part time gig, sometimes more depending on hours and how everything works out.

Bills:

Insurance $110
School Loans $720
Rent $400
Church 10% of gross pay (non negotiable)
Phone $85
Food....who knows. This is my biggest downfall.

I usually maintain these numbers for safety, and I do have 5k in savings and almost 3k in an acorns account.

So, do I focus extra money into the car payment, or focus on loans, or focus on interesting or all 3? If so, how do you suggest this gets done?

solar,Solar Company F'ed Up Sales Proposal - Wants me to sign new contract,"Hi All,

The short version is that I was offered REC365s at Aptos prices. The system is roughly 15kW with a 16kWh LG battery for about $233 monthly. They're telling me that for those panels, it should cost about $316 monthly. We've already got a signed, completed, sales contract. They want me to consider different panels to fit the price or agree to a higher price for same panels.

&amp;#x200B;

The longer version is that Field Sales Guy (FSG) came out with a proposal with some Aptos panels. I asked him to add a battery, so he called the office and had the Sales Manager (SM) update the proposal while he was talking me through some things. Then we got to talking about the panels. The Aptos ones guaranteed approximately 84% production after 25 years. He said he had some REC360AA panels that guaranteed 92%. They were also more powerful overall. I told him I wanted to see an updated system with those panels, and we both expected it to come back at a higher price because they're better panels. He called SM and explained we wanted to change the proposal to the better panels. 

We got a call back a few minutes later with SM saying that he actually got it to be $1 cheaper per month. The price went from $234 to $233, but I think it was actually just that the original proposal rounded up the pennies. I think they were both the same $233+ price. In any case, the system looked weird because a lot of the panels were on my north facing roof, but I liked the price. Sales guy said he'd send that proposal to a design engineer to make sure the sales guy didn't screw anything up on placement and whatnot and he'd come back later in the evening after I'd had a chance to consult my wife to get the all clear. 

So the FSG comes back later in the evening. He explained something that had happened with the updated proposal. Somehow in the quoting tool whoever actually made the updates to the proposal didn't do something correctly so the price didn't update. FSG told me about how he told SM that he couldn't come back to my house with a higher price because we'd both operated under the understanding that the price was $233.

To me, that's the point the company could have pulled the plug. Nothing was signed. Sure, there would have been lost good will, but otherwise, there wasn't an executed installation contracted.

So we go through providing info for financing, get instant approval, all that good stuff. A day or two later, I get the installation contract. It's signed by me, it's signed by the installation manager.

Last week, I get a call from SM and he tells me that with their mistake, it's really hard to source the REC360AA panels at the right price. I feel like he's about to tell me that they need to ask for more money, at which point I tell him that if that's the case, I'm going back to other proposals from other vendors. He doesn't ask me for more money and states that he needs more time to source the panels, and that he feels bad because otherwise they'd have the panels already installed because they pride themselves on quick installs. We have other contractors at our home, so I tell him it's not a problem if it takes a few more weeks. I don't want crews bumping into each other.

And this morning I just got a call from FSG. He explains to me that SM or anyone at the home office won't call me, because they've never made a mistake like this and they're scared, so he is the one stuck calling me with what information he's gotten. Basically, for my system, they should have quoted me $316 monthly. It's $24,900 more over the life of the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

For what it's worth, the company is BBB A+. I don't think they're trying to screw me over and I think they made a genuine mistake. That said, I've made genuine, COSTLY (to my company) mistakes in my professional career and they are teaching moments.

Below is the system and the installation fee.

economy,"As Donald Trump celebrates his 75th birthday, a new book presents the idea that the FED can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars","A new book called ""The Mars Hypothesis"" presents a hypothesis that the Federal reserve can set interest rates based on the position of the planet Mars. The books brings astrologers and economists together and formulates a system in which the FED can set interest rates according to the predicted bear market time frames derived from the positions of the Sun, Mars, and the Lunar nodes. The system is built to last all the way until the end of the year 2098 The book also takes you through the major historical components of the last 115 years and demonstrates how the system could have applied in the past.

In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.

personalfinance,Moving to California from VA- Should I buy a car now or after I move?,"Hi all, 

I just got a job offer in Bay Area and am looking to move there in 3-4 months. My company pays for the shipment of a car as part of the relocation package. I'm still paying the loan on my current car but want to switch to a larger SUV. Most likely I will trade in/sell my current car and put some down payment on the new car and take some loan. I checked a few online prices for the car model I want and saw some good deals in my current state. The prices in CA are generally more expensive for some reason. However, I know that I will need to change my insurance/registration twice and pay for tax difference if I buy a car now and move to CA. Want to see if anyone has insights on whether I should buy a car now or after I move.

***My Options:***

1. **Ship my current car to CA (cost covered by employer). Sell it there and buy a new car in CA.**

* pros: No need to change the registration/insurance info twice.
* cons: Car price of the model I want seems more expensive in CA
* **Questions:** 
   * Will the length of residency in CA affect the car loan interest rate of my new car? 
   * Do I need to change my car registration/insurance to CA before I sell the car in CA? will the registration location affect the sales price
   * Does it matter if I don't own the title of my old car (still paying off loan)?

**2. Sell my car and buy a new car now. Ship the new car to CA (cost covered by employer).**

* pros: Good deal price for the new car and fair offer from a dealer of my old car. Only need to worry about one car's registration/insurance after moving to CA
* cons: need to do a smog test for the new car. 
* **Questions:**
   * Do I need to refinance my new car if moving to CA? will the interest rate change?
   * Can I only change my insurance info but keep my car registration in my current state? I read in other Reddit posts that you can wait for a year to change your car registration to avoid the 'use tax'. Sales tax in my current state is A LOT cheaper than CA tax

**3. Sell my current car before I move. Buy a new car in CA after I arrive.**

* pros: No need to worry about any car registration transfer/ insurance change. No need to do a smog test for my current car and worry about emission requests for my new car. 
* cons: Need to rent a car before I buy a new car. Uncertainty about how long do I need to rent a car
* **Questions**
   * Do I need a CA drivers license before I buy a car in CA?
   * will not having a CA drivers license affect the loan interest rate? 

Any insight/suggestion/past experience will be super helpful!

investing,Paul Tudor Jones says ‘go all in on the inflation trades’ if Fed keeps ignoring higher prices,"**KEY POINTS**

* **Paul Tudor Jones said he would “go all in on the inflation trades” if the Federal Reserve is nonchalant this week regarding rising consumer prices.**
* **“I’d probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold,” the billionaire hedge fund manager said.**
* **“If they course correct,” he continued, “then you’re going to get a taper tantrum.”**
* **The Fed’s two-day policy meeting is scheduled to conclude Wednesday.**

&amp;#x200B;

Billionaire hedge fund manager [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.cnbc.com/paul-tudor-jones/) told CNBC on Monday he’s paying close attention to this week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting in light of recent economic data showing [higher consumer prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/cpi-may-2021.html).

“If they treat these numbers — which were material events, they were very material — if they treat them with nonchalance, I think it’s just a green light to bet heavily on every inflation trade,” Jones said on [“Squawk Box.”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)

“If they say, ‘We’re on path, things are good,’ then I would just go all in on the inflation trades. I’d probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold,” added Jones, who called the stock market crash in 1987 and is founder and chief investment officer of [Tudor Investment](https://www.tudor.com/default.aspx#section-About).

On the other hand, Jones predicted that markets would be unsettled if the Fed comes out with a different tone Wednesday.

“If they course correct, if they say, ‘We’ve got incoming data, we’ve accomplished our mission or we’re on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,’ then you’re going to get a taper tantrum,” Jones said. “You’re going to get a sell-off in fixed income. You’re going to get a correction in stocks. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s over.”

The Fed’s two-day policy meeting is [scheduled to conclude Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/markets-await-the-feds-meeting-in-the-week-ahead.html), and Chairman Jerome Powell is set to hold a news conference after the central bank releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET.

Powell and company have maintained their highly accommodative monetary policy approach, which was instituted in response to [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). Central bankers have been steadfast [despite criticism](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html) that massive bond buying and near-zero interest rates are no longer necessary because the economic recovery is well underway and inflation data is concerning. 

Powell and other Fed officials say they believe rising prices are likely temporary as the economy reopens from all manner of pandemic-related disruptions, which in turn justifies their policy stance.

“The idea that inflation is transitory, to me ... that one just doesn’t work the way I see the world,” said Jones, who added he feels the central bank’s inflation views [put its credibility at risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-the-feds-credibility-is-at-risk-with-inflation-view.html).

In Monday’s “Squawk Box” interview, Jones also reiterated his [favorable outlook on bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-likes-bitcoin-calls-it-a-great-portfolio-diversifier-to-protect-his-wealth-over-time.html), calling it a “portfolio diversifier” and a ” story of wealth.” The longtime trader added that[ he’s grown nervous](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-says-a-stock-market-valuation-making-him-nervous.html) when considering the stock market’s valuation compared with the overall economy.

“The only thing I know for certain, I want 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities. At this point in time, I don’t know what I want to do with the other 80% until I see what the Fed is going to do,” Jones said.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I put no money down on a house, even though I have the money? (VA loan)","Hi reddit,

I am closing on a house next week and I wanted some advice. I live in SoCal so prices here are expensive. I am trying to decide what to do with my savings. I am 25 years old (single) and my life savings is $170k - I make $135k per year. I am a disabled vet so I can use a VA loan requires 0% down with no PMI (also no VA funding fee). I have enough money for 20% down, but that would use my entire savings. I have everything pre-approved and the rate is locked. I already talked to my lender and he said I need to decide in the next 48 hours what my downpayment will be so he can switch the paperwork.

**My question is: Is it better to go with less money down and invest the difference or go with the traditional 20% down?**

&amp;#x200B;

* House Price: $750k
* HOA: $0
* Insurance: $100/m (got a quote)
* Property Taxes: 1.21% ($765/m)
* Closing costs: $9k (regardless of down payment)
* PMI: $0 (regardless of down payment)
* Interest Rate: 2.5% (no points, locked)
* Its a renovated 4 bedroom, 2 bath. 1200 sq/ft house in the suburbs
* Appraisal price: $750k
* Inspection results: Nothing major, mostly cosmetic things (under $5k repairs)

I looked at an amortization calculator and if I went with less money down I will have more interest, but I could also write that off in my taxes. The difference between 0% down and 20% down is $600/m. That is a lot of money but that also leaves me with $152k in my bank that I can invest. I currently have no debt (except for this upcoming house).

I am leaning towards putting about 10% down. What do you think reddit?",finance

investing,An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPs,"Clarifications: 

1. Some people are claiming that I cherry-picked data by leveraging the last 5 years of raging bull market. I am aware that this was a particularly good time period for stocks, and have explicitly acknowledged this issue in the original post itself. This strat also works over the [life of data](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/options) (**2010-2021)** that is available to me. This 11 year period includes the 2020 flash crash, Aug'11 bear market, 2015-16 China crash/US markets selloff, 2018 crypto crash, and 2020 covid crash. 
2. Testing over 2007-2008 would have been great, and I concur with many of you that if markets stayed flat over 2 years, this strat loses substantial capital. This is also acknowledged in the original post. I'm not claiming this to be some strat with [huuuge upside and very little downside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXLV_DMKa0), just an interesting way to deploy leverage. 
3. Backtests do not guarantee future success. They only prove that a strat would have worked in the past. This is true of backtests that are statistically significant AND of those that aren't. My philosophy is that if you're going to gamble, use all the data you have to optimize your odds, and do it as scientifically as possible. I'm working towards adding a hedging component. All research will be open-sourced. If you have any constructive ideas for reducing drawdowns/ruin probability and such please DM

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tl;dr: DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets. Crazy right?

Disclaimer: This isn't financial advice. I am not a finance professional.

Who this is for: This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE, who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years, and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly. Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market *total* returns - not *risk adjusted* returns (hate that term by the way) or more correctly not *volatility adjusted* returns. If this doesn't describe you, this post won't be useful to you.

""Dollar cost average into index funds"" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up.

Then the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. ""guarantee"" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so?

I could think of 3 ways:

1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and [documented](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5934). I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk, margin requirement change risk, flash crash risk. Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate (that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for) is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They'll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method.
2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they're not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color.
3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying.  This is the subject of this post

Research methodology:

I backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s.

Investing in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs.

Leverage is set to 1. We won't be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient.

No stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that's closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194.

Why 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I'm sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I'd just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it's as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that's the least of our concerns.

Inb4 ""short term capital gain taxes"" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with ""buy and hold index"" or ""dollar cost average index"" on a pre as well as post tax basis.

Finally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we're not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that's okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done.

Backtest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun'16 to Jun'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don't have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a *sufficiently large and flexible* time period.

Results:

[https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY](https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY)

[https://ibb.co/frswZJn](https://ibb.co/frswZJn)

**Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75%**

**Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49%** (benchmark#1)

**Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57%** (benchmark#2)

Worst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2%

Sharpe ratio - 1.23

PSR - 50.4%

(We don't give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.)

My takeaway:

Unless a calamity occurs and doesn't resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I'm keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won't kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don't shit my pants and keep buying that is..

Future research:

Experiment with spreads, calendar spreads, diagonal spreads, active stock picking. Fine tuning deltas. Timing the purchases with low IV. Hedging with VIX, gold, bonds, T-bills..",finance

personalfinance,Car Loan Interest Calculation In Relation to OTD Price,"Hi folks, I'm in the market for a car purchase, and I will need to finance it.  I plan to sell my current car after the purchase of the new(er) car. 

Since I won't see the money from my old car after I have purchased the new(er) one, I can only put down a smaller downpayment. I'd like to pay off the loan rather aggressively (say, pay it off the next day just for the purpose of this post).

Here is my question: does putting down a larger downpayment lower the OTD (out-the-door) price of the car with loan financing (assuming I pay off the entire loan the day after)? Example**:**

30k sticker price, 20k loan, x% interest rate, 2000 lifetime interest, is the OTD price = 30k + 2000 + fees&amp;tax?

Or

30k sticker price, 10k loan, x% interest rate, 100 lifetime interest, OTD price = 30k+100 + fee&amp;tax?

personalfinance,Would it be sensible to use student loan savings to pay for IVF,"My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for over a year and a half. We’ve spent about $5,000 on fertility treatments thus far and we’re now facing the possibility of IVF. It would be between $22,000-$25,000. We have about $10,000 left in our HSA. And we have another $15,000 in a HYSA but it is earmarked for my student loans (~$30,000 total) once the interest rates return. We’ve been putting what we would have put towards the loan into this account since covid started. Is it reasonable to use that money for IVF even though it will mean taking longer to pay the student loans off?

Details:
Combined take home pay: $6,000/month (after taxes and putting 20% into retirement savings)
Bills: $2,500/month (mortgage, utilities, insurances, extra savings for house, monthly EF savings)
Other expenses: ~$1,000 (food, gas, entertainment, etc). 

We have no other bills. We live below our income because we thought we would have daycare to pay for by now. We have a separate fully funded EF. 

My student loans were in deferment prior to covid and will remain in deferment after because I am a PhD student. Only one loan for $10,000 is unsubsidized and will begin accruing interest at 5.25% while in deferment. The other loans are subsidized and will remain 0% until I graduate. Then they will be about 3%. I’m also not accruing anymore student loans as my PhD is paid for through my works tuition reimbursement. Those loans are from my undergrad and masters degree. 

I guess I’m having a hard time because getting pregnant is suppose to be the cheap part of having a child. And I think I’m too emotionally invested to think logically about what is the best thing to do. Part of me thinks we would be spending money just so we could spend even more money but the larger part wants to start a family with my husband and going through the months of treatment already have been awful and our best odds of success are IVF.

personalfinance,"Go aggressive and refi at 15 or 20 years, or not at all?","Hi all - I'm in later 30s and my wife is in her mid 30s, no kids yet, both of us have full time positions. My wife was actually let go from her job in airline industry bc of COVID and got her own online business off the ground and already pulling a decent amount for a business that's less than a year old, and 2 months back, was approached and hired to fill someone's maternity leave for 5 month contract, and she's doing a great job and will extend her contract and even possibly offer her a full time role. Of course last year hurt a bit, but with unemployment it wasn't too bad, so together, was pulling in over $200K before COVID, and if her position becomes permanent, could be in situation where approximate household income is around $250K. Both of us had student loans that have already been paid off years ago, my wife's car is also paid off as of last year and I just exercised purchase option for my plug in hybrid lease since used car market is crazy and the deal I had to keep my car made too much financial sense (just under $390/mo at 2.39% for 48 mo). I'm finally maxing out my 401K last year or so and had to pull back on maxing out Roth IRA contributions since I think we'll exceed the filing jointly threshold for Roth IRAs. Good problem to have, but I've reallocated that to a taxable IRA account preemptively. No major credit card debt to speak of, mostly pay it off in full, but do have a chunk that revolves month to month, at least we're not incurring interest on them. We have 10 months of emergency savings as well. Living costs are under control, about $100 a week or so for grocery and even if we do eat out, it's not always at expensive places (we do that for special occasions), we have life insurance, I always take the time and effort to shop around for auto and home insurance and share streaming service costs with extended family members to keep those costs minimal.

We live in LA near LAX and the new stadium. We bought our townhome/condo for $595K last March right before everything started shutting down, subsequent appreciation was great but of course not planned for. We had saved enough together for 20% downpayment and also due to ZIP code of the area qualified for special program at the time, so basically had a 30 year mortgage at 3.15% interest rate. PITI was 20% of our gross monthly income at the time we got the mortgage. Both of us have changed jobs in the last year. 

With the rates where they are now, I began the process of refinancing just to see where we could be. I want to be more efficient/optimal with the money we're saving at abysmal interest rates. Initially locked in at 2.0%, no points, minimal closing costs with lender credits factored in (estimated just over $1K). Put down the $500 deposit to lock rates and begin appraisal. Redfin/Zillow is kinda inflating our home price near $700K, but according to recent appraisal, it was valued around $630K. Basically it'll be $900 more than what we're paying now for PITI to go to a 15 year mortgage, or approximately $400 more to be at 2.5% for 20 year mortgage. With the size of the home, that's pretty significant savings in interest. I've done the calculations over and over, we're going to be right below 28% of gross monthly income even if she doesn't extend her contract job and just works to maintain or grow her side business. She prefers this route if we end up having a kid in the next few years since it gives her flexibility and apparently it's not that much of a time commitment that she has to stop working on this if we were to have a child. 20 year will put us right under 24% of gross monthly income which is still pretty good as well. There's also the option of refinancing the 30 year to a 2.625% so we save 0.5% but I don't like that we effectively reset the clock and will have another year or so of payments going down that route.

That said she feels a bit uneasy about how aggressive the plan is and is fine just stashing money away with current mortgage, especially given the potential expenses if we have a child and all. I think a good middle ground is to go for the 20 year mortgage so that we're still paying down the mortgage faster and benefit from interest savings and possibly invest the other $400-500 in ETF or index fund. She's more of the let's just pay extra every month as if we have a 15 or 20 year when we can without the hassle of refinancing, but I did the math on that and we will still end up paying more than $50K more in interest than if we had refinanced. If her contract work becomes a permanent gig then we're looking at making PITI 15-18%, so we're in a really good spot imo.

With the way rates are now, there's also the option of just putting the entire difference to a fund since we still have about 25-30 years before retirement so can ride recessions and economic downturns.

personalfinance,"Grandma is having issues with social security and turned to me for help, but I'm lost and don't know what to do","My grandma called me saying she got a letter from the social security admin and they're not going to be giving her as much money. She said she called and they basically told her she's out of luck but I don't really have any details on that and don't entirely trust her on what happened during the call. I asked her to send me the letters she's got and any other info. She sent me her ""new benefits for 2021"" sheet and the letter she just got:

**monthly benefit:**

2,274.50 

**deductions:**

medicare medical insurance: 217.50

medicare prescription drug plan: 19

federal tax witholding: 0

voluntary tax withholding: 0

total to receive: 2038




The letter she just got says ""We will no longer deduct money for your health plan premiums and your Medicare prescription drug plan costs from your monthly benefits"".  

and

""You will receive $2126 each month""


Her understanding was that they aren't going to be covering her health plan or medicare drugs anymore. She just got a $600 bill (not sure if it was for treatment or meds) that looks like will no longer be covered and she can't afford it. 

The letter doesn't really make sense to me so im not sure whats going on. I don't live near my Grandma to go over her house and help her so I need to do everything over the phone with her which makes it slightly harder.

personalfinance,Utilizing a physician loan vs conventional loan for first time home purchase,"Hey PF community,

I'm currently in the market for a first-time home purchase, and I have the option of using a conventional loan or a physician loan for this purchase. (I'm not a physician but I do work in healthcare and some lenders would allow me to utilize this loan for the home purchase). I do currently have enough for a 20% down payment if I was to use a conventional loan BUT the more I think about it, the more it seems like going for the physician loan would be a better option. The reason for that is because with the physician loan I would be able to put a 0-5% down payment at an interest rate that is only 0.1-0.2% higher (so somewhere around 3.1-3.2% depending on when I get the loan) and then I could invest my potential down payment money in a retirement account instead, which I would expect to earn somewhere between 5-10% interest rate along with the tax benefits that these accounts offer. 

My question is, would the r/personalfinance agree with my rationale and/or is there anything that I am missing? Behaviorally, I know myself and am confident that I would invest that money versus being very spend-happy. This would also be a first-time home purchase, so I'm not sure if I would be missing out on some potential first-time home buyer programs that I may not be eligible for by utilizing this type of loan.

Any help and advice would be appreciated! Thank you all.",finance
personalfinance,Kaiser California - Disputed coverage/bill sent to collections (USCB),"I've seen a few posts here with others dealing with Kaiser/USCB and hoping anyone with experience can shed some light. I was previously covered by Kaiser in California and received care at one of their facilities. Due to a long comedy of errors they are claiming my insurance coverage had ended and therefore the services aren't covered (an assertation I dispute). A few questions...

1. Does anyone know if Kaiser sells their debt to USCB or are they just working on behalf of Kaiser?
2. USCB has tacked on an interest charge...am I missing something on how this is not illegal under FDCPA?.....From FTC FAQs: ""may not try to collect interest, fees, or other charges on top of the amount you owe, unless the original contract or a law says they can"".....I have looked through as many Kaiser docs as I can find and I don't see anything about an underlying interest rate and would be shocked to hear of a medical provider having that.

Single income for the past year at $115k, I just graduated university and am starting a new job soon at $70k. Both of us WFH, so no childcare expenses. I have $40k student loan debt at 3.3%. We also have a $265k mortgage on a $425k home at 2.75%. We have no other debt. We have combined $175k in retirement and $3k for our newborn’s 529. We refinanced our home (for an improved interest rate) and cashed out money last year with the plan to remodel our bathroom/kitchen and complete a small addition. With current building/lumber costs and projects getting backed up in our area, we are pausing on our remodel for a bit (probably summer 2022 or 2023). Between the cash out and the savings we already had on hand, we have $110k in savings currently. $10k in a HYSA(the max allowed in that account) and the rest in a regular savings account. I’m looking for ideas for how to manage the other $100k. I’m so new to investing, I don’t even know where to start.

Basically, my reasoning was that I can easily beat 1% just by investing in the stock market. even my interest rate at my credit union gets me 1.5%, provided I jump through some hoops.

I’m not too concerned about getting fired from my job, since performance review is every 6 months and if I were to get fired, I would receive pretty much a 6 month grace period to find a new job. However, I am a high performer, so i highly doubt I’d find myself in that position. My company is known for excellent WLB, extremely low PIP rate, and generally doesn’t fire people unless they say something racist or something

Also, I do have 50K in various liquid investments and cash. I also have a 6 months emergency fund (rent + basic food plus i can just go back to live with my parents). My total compensation is around 225K.

CryptoCurrency,[DISCUSSION] Staying Private/Secure in Crypto,"As is common knowledge on this sub, if you have crypto, it's a good idea to keep it lowkey that you have crypto. This not only includes family and friends (except maybe a spouse), but also government agencies, including certain 3-letter organizations that are [very interested in learning about crypto users these days](https://decrypt.co/41411/the-irs-is-offering-you-625000-to-crack-monero).

Mind you, I'm myself a law-abiding citizen and I'm in no way advocating for anyone to do anything illegal with cryptocurrencies. However, it remains that, if anyone has any info on you or your crypto, including literally any sovereign state, then it's a security vulnerability. Case in point, just knowing that you own and use crypto would be enough to trigger an audit and/or further legal action that you'd rather not deal with and could very easily avoid by taking the necessary precautions (while, again, not doing anything illegal).

Some ways to stay secure against the Department of Dirty Tricks:

First of all, get your coins the fuck off of Coinbase; [the Federal Court has approved an IRS subpoena at Coinbase that puts thousands of users at audit risk](https://www.goldinglawyers.com/coinbase-audit-do-you-have-bitcoin-income-tax-or-reporting/). Exodus or Metamask will do if you've securely stored your BIP39 passphrase in either physical storage or store your seed phrase in an encrypted and password-protected fashion (the latter is a lot harder to do **correctly** than the former if you don't have a background in the technical side of cryptography). You can also keep your keys offline altogether with a Ledger or a Trezor depending on your threat model (Will hackers Trojan your computer and log the keystrokes to your encryption passphrase?)

Moreover, consider buying Bitcoin and other cryptos off of the Bisq DAO @ [bisq.network](https://bisq.network) in order to avoid KYC/AML. You can pay with Zelle or with a money-transfer account in, e.g., Western Union or Moneygram; there would be no evidence that you purchased cryptocurrency other than the audit trail on the account itself, and that would be a P2P transfer that could have happened for any number of reasons (as far as regulators are concerned). You would only have to justify the transfers in the case of spending more than USD$5-10K a month on the network, in which case it'd be good have an audit trail of all your crypto trades presentable. In any case, this is a lot more sensible than buying large amounts of crypto on Coinbase where your ID is associated with the amount of crypto you're holding in your account.

Finally, invest in common-sense security, including a \[preferably open-source\] password-manager like Keepass or Bitwarden (""p@ssw0rd"" is not secure!), a VPN, and cloud storage either with zero-knowledge encryption (Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive do NOT count) by default or with GPG encryption, etc., from your side. You can also consider enabling 2FA with either your phone or with a trusted hardware device like a Yubikey; if you're using an app on your phone, try to pick an open-source alternative to Google Authenticator like Aegis or andOTP.

CryptoCurrency,How do you keep yourself sane?,"There’s a healthy amount of research into the psychology of investing in stocks, which is to a larger or lesser extent applicable to crypto. 

I use some psychological tricks that work for me, to keep me sane through it all. I‘d like to share the tricks that work for me, in the hope that you will share yours.

Checking the charts multiple times a day can be tiresome and stressful. Since I can only buy coins once a week, I only ever check the charts once a week. And that is to place my buy order. If there’s any major movement in prices, I have a trusted group of investors that keep me up to date, for free! You. This subreddit. Many thanks.

Staring at red candles all day, trying to turn them green, will not work and is detrimental to your general well-being. I have heard of people who have switched the colours of their candles. So when the price drops, you get a green candle, which means go,go,go….or in this case buy…especially if you have days and days of green candles. If you get days and days of red candles (ie price going up) then this is not the time to buy. Keep your powder dry. So Red means, don’t do anything, collect fiat. Green means buy all the Satoshis.

I never talk to anyone in real life about crypto. My immediate circle are already investing, so this makes it easy for me. This way, I get to enjoy other things on my mind. Like living life. This is helped by the knowledge that in a week, I allow myself to invest in crypto. This subreddit is also great for talking about crypto until you’re fed up and need a break.

I am an advocate of “Gamification” and use this in almost every aspect of my life. I play this game where my different coins/tokens are foot soldiers in a war. If I replenish the troops in coin A, I must replenish the troops in coin B, so as to keep an even battlefield. And I determine which side is losing by which coin has the biggest discount from ATH. So if coin A drops farther from it’s ATH, I see it as “losing” and it’s troops need replenishing (DCA in adult speak). I obviously only do this for my main hodl coins. 

Anything “staked” is considered “dead” in my game. Once properly staked, I don’t even bother checking up on them. Why should I, right? They’re dead. I occasionally add to my “Vampire Army”. The “staked returns” are drops of blood. Nothing much, but it's honest work. And if you continue to bleed over time, it all adds up.

I also bought $5 worth of Shiba Inu, my only “shit coin”. I bought it to remind myself to “never sell at a loss”. Seeing this loss keeps me going. It’s currently worth nothing right now. I was not expecting a win here. Knowing that Shiba will likely never make back my losses means I will never sell any of my investments (for now). This strangely has totally eradicated any urges to time the market for a profit with my other coins. As long as Shiba is down, I ain’t selling nothing!

I also have a very unhealthy relationship with an acquaintance from a former relationship. He’s a friend of an ex who I just can’t seem to get rid of. I call him the “Klingon”. He’s the kinda guy to always one up your story, invalidate you to make himself feel better, brag about his track ready car that he   
never tracks to the track because ""I'd just beat everyone, anyway"" etc. I have largely cut him out of my life but he keeps popping up randomly through mutual-mutual friends. Anyway, I know for a fact he thinks crypto is a scam and will have nothing to do with it. I can’t wait to drive past him in my Lambo (in 10yrs) and scream out “SUCKER” at him. Really rub it in. This desire to fling my faeces at him is strong. Turns out I have a bit of a petty, vindictive streak. Hopefully I will continue on my journey of personal growth and leave this behind me. But until then, fcuk him and the hole he came from!

Just to be clear, these tricks work for me and I am not saying that these tricks would work for you. I am not suggesting anyone follow suit either.

What tricks do you use to keep yourself level and happy?  

TL:DR - my mind is dumb and this is how I trick it to keep myself happy. I'm also a bit of an asshole.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,What should start to concern the cryto world.,"News of adoption of cryptocurrencies being adopted is starting to become a trivial matter. This is positive, as it means it is breaking into mainstream and will eventually become something everyone and anyone will know about.

But with mainstream comes into play the institutional players and those have an awful track record when it comes to dealing with value.

Cryptocurrency was created to remove power and influence from the system. But that system is quick to evolve and adapt and is now taking notice of just how powerful the crypto environment can be. And they will try to manipulate it in their favor.

At this moment there is no way to distinguish a privately owned wallet from an institutional one. Yes, its volume is open for anyone to see but nobody really knows who is pulling those strings. Who really knows if a whale is an individual, a corporation or, perhaps in a near future, a bank or edge fund, triggering the markets to get quick profits from others misery?

Crypto was also created to shield individuals from government meddling, as it aimed at removing the control of money from it.

At it is, we, everyone who as gone into crypto, failed it miserably. Collectively, we allowed it to become what it was supposed to counter and made it a commodity,  ripe for speculation and manipulation, not something in contact with the real world.

Have you, the so called crypto investor, done anything tangible to bring crypto into the real world? Exchanged you work, services or products for it? Divulged it as something than can enact real change in the world?

I'll risk most haven't and don't plan on it. Many because crypto is just an asset, a value cache, to profit from, others because they are aware most crypto still have high toll gates to be moved around as ''real'' money.

In my view, DeFi is not the answer either, because it is ripe territory for scammers to operate and unless I can freely exchange and deal with any crypto currency I want with no middleman between me and the other part, taking a cut off the top, it is not DeFi. It is the system itself that has to regulate and enforce the rules, not a referee.

As it is, crypto currency and its ecosystem, is just a slightly better system than the conventional one we've been using and being used by for the last 100 years.

And unless some basic ground rules start to be laid down and enforced, not because a board or a summit sat down and agreed upon it, but because developers and supporters of crypto realize it is what it has to be done.

One person can easily run hundreds of wallets and completely dry a faucet trying to disperse a new coin. Exchanges can ask whatever they want to transfer your assets to your personal wallet on top of charging you a fee for running your orders. A massive holder of coin can trigger a market crash by signaling a large volume sell to follow up by soaking up the panic sells.

Sounds familiar?

And I'm not salty because I lost money on crypto. I haven't. I'm miffed because crypto keeps falling short of its potential and goals.",cryptocurrency

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

44. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

82. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

personalfinance,Refinancing Two Auto Loans,"Hello I've been a long time lurker on this sub, but I had some questions about refinancing auto loans. 

Background: My parents both have cars which they use daily. The cars should last a long time because they don't drive it too often or for long distances, but they do need it to go to work and run some errands. When my dad purchased these cars, he did not have the greatest credit score nor did he have any cash to make a down payment. So instead, he took out some loans (which the terms are listed below, some are estimates, others that are written in monthly statements). Frankly, my parents are doing well now, have better credit scores (especially my mom), and can afford to make bigger payments if needed!  

I feel that they should try refinancing them to get a better rate and/or a shorter payment term (even if the monthly payments are little higher) so we can pay less money/interest in the long run. We do have a good amount of money in our bank to make another down payment if necessary. I guess, my main question is do you think refinancing is viable? What kind of rates should I be looking for? I've been plugging in numbers to an online calculator and I feel that we can save a few grand if we get a good interest rate... or am I missing something? Also, please let me know if some of my numbers are wrong...

**Loan 1**:

Add on another 30-40k pound spent on accommodation, which is 60-70k S$. So in total it's **about 100k pounds for a 3 years BSc**.

The victim, who did not want to be identified, said the scammers deceived him after an online conversation in 2020. Apparently, they promised him to invest his money in a fake brokerage firm, promising to receive a significant amount of bitcoin as a profit.
The thieves tricked the man into allowing him to access his computer remotely. In this way, they used his personal information to get a loan.

Detective Sergeant David Breach said in the police report: “Reports of investment fraud have increased significantly since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, which is unsurprising when you think the vast majority of us have had to conduct nearly every aspect of our lives on a computer or mobile phone.”
In the six-month period between October 2020 and March 2021, US users reported more than $ 82 million in online cryptocurrency fraud, according to the US Federal Trade Commission.

Perhaps it is time to repeat the obvious: People who want to enter the crypto space need to know that they face a myriad of dangers and inconveniences. Because of your love to cryptocurrency, do not respond to unexpected messages from unknown senders and unreasonable promises of astronomical profits or rewards.

dogecoin,A Warning About Crypto Savings Accounts,"As crypto has grown in popularity, so have crypto savings accounts (but to a much lesser extent). The concept sounds amazing, the ability to get guaranteed double digit interest on your coins, but in reality it's much different.

First let’s talk about what a [crypto savings account](https://youtu.be/m8cKtUKLqeI) is not. The name is a bit of misnomer because it isn’t actually a savings account and shouldn’t be treated like one. They lack the regulatory protection associated with regular banks, specifically none of them are FDIC insured. Aside from the lack of FDIC protection, what are some of the other negatives associated with a Crypto Savings account? 

* Unlike traditional savings accounts, you will have to pay a fee every time you withdraw funds from you account along with a cap on the maximum amount of fund you can withdraw in a given period. While the caps are high enough that it would not affect most people, if you are placing a majority of your portfolio in crypto and need to use it for a large purchase, this could present a problem for you. 
* With the more popular coins, you interest rate will actually decrease with the more coins you have. The dollar equivalent where this threshold starts is typically around the six-figure mark which won’t affect many newer investors. But for those who are invested heavily in the crypto space this can be a substantial negative 
* For most of the crypto savings accounts, your interest will be paid back to you in the same coin that you deposited. So there if the coin you are invested in sees a significant loss in value, this could wipe out all of the interest you have earned 
* Another potential issue with crypto savings is that it requires you to transfer your private keys over to the business so they can lend out your currency. While many of the new crypto banks tout the high security, they use to protect your keys, you are still giving up control of your currency to someone else. Many of the crypto banks advertise the amount of insurance they have to protect your money, but if you go into the fine print you’ll see that the insurance only covers your money in the event of commercial theft or embezzlement. While top companies advertise the extensive fail-safes they have instituted to protect your funds through maintaining a baseline of crypto so you can withdraw at any given time along with the collateral they require to guarantee their loans, they have not yet experienced any massive string of defaults. Ideally, their systems would be able to handle such a situation, but it is still untested. 

Now for the positives that crypto savings offer, and they are definitely appealing: 

* The returns offered easily beat out anything offered by traditional banks, and you would expect them based on the increased risk you take on. 
* For the majority of platforms, the interest offered will be the highest on stable coins, with relatively lower interest on the largest cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you like to have a sizeable reserve of stable coins so you can buy into other cryptos when their value drops, this could be a great way to earn interest on your reserves in the meantime. 
* Some crypto savings accounts allow you to deposit US dollars without ever having to deal with buying and selling cryptos yourself. This is a great way for investors who want to diversify and reap some of the higher yields from crypto without having to buy and sell different cryptos on their own 
* Now is probably the highest interest rates we will see from crypto savings accounts. As crypto becomes more generally accepted and less volatile, interest rates on crypto will go down. So when does putting your money in a crypto savings account make sense?

As with anything related to crypto, because of the inherit volatility, you shouldn’t invest your entire portfolio or any money that you cannot afford to lose.  So who are crypto savings accounts best for?

* If you are new to crypto and want to dip your toe in the water without buying crypto yourself, the companies that allow you to only deal in US dollars are a great way to start reaping the higher yields immediately. 
* If you are a buy and hold investor of crypto, then putting your coins into a savings account is another way to maximize the overall return, but this still involves taking on another level of risk on top of the existing risk by being invested in crypto.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Valuable lessons that I learned from navigating the financial markets during covid crisis,"Hello guys I just like to share some of the important lessons that I learned while trading the financial markets during covid crisis as this is the first major global economic crisis that most of us here have experienced as adults. 1 year has gone by since this once in a century black swan event happened and these are some of the valuable lessons that I learned which I’m pretty sure will be useful again in the future once we encounter another crisis.

• **Risk happens fast but markets move faster** – By the time that covid restrictions to enable flattening of the curve were happening, the s&amp;p500 was already down like -35%. Markets have bottomed already by this time as markets move way faster than the risk. While most people assess and understand risk in real-time based on watching the news or reading articles, the stock market had already anticipated the risks before they become widely known. When most investors realize that it’s going to be a recession or an economic crisis, it’s too late.

The biggest gains are made at the depth of the crisis and biggest losses happens when everything seems to be rosy. The market is a future discounting mechanism and all the bad news was quickly priced-in already. It’s the economic recovery that the market will be pricing in after peak fear on the unknown has been discounted.

• **It’s a good thing for the markets when the majority’s expectations on the economy are so low** –When covid was hitting countries left and right and the first lockdowns started, almost everyone was expecting gloom and doom for the global economy and almost no one expected a V-shaped recovery. I remember most we’re calling for a U back then. But when people slowly realized that it’s not going to be the end of the world and corporate earnings after covid lockdowns were implemented started to come out? The stock market just never looked back again.

This just shows that equity markets care far less about economic outcomes in vacuums and far more about whether the outcomes exceeded expectations. We could see all the worse earnings numbers and gdp reports that we will ever see in our lifetimes, but when the expectations are just massively low, even a slightly better than expected earnings report will cause the stock market to rally. And this thing kind of happened last year when people thought that it’s going to be apocalypse.

• **Event-Driven Bear markets are vicious but lack stamina** – This is the type of bear market that we’ve experienced last year. It was a huge and fast collapse in march 2020 compared to other bear markets in the past. This one is an easier environment to trade on for active traders because of large swings and extreme volatility and recovery is much more faster too.

Other types of bear markets that we can experience are those that are:

Structural in nature (imbalances and financial bubbles, price shocks, deflation) – harder to trade because it’s more of a slow death and slow recovery.

Cyclical - regular business cycle typically happens during periods of high inflation and rising interest rates, slow death too

• **Initial Jobless Claims as a key indicator for recessions and bear markets** – Stock market bottoms almost exactly the time when initial jobless claims reach a peak. It was really confusing back in march 2020 when there was one trading session where futures are down big and suddenly reversed into green and went on a rally when the first post-covid lockdown, initial jobless claims report was given out. People had a hard time coping up with reality during that time on how the stock market can go up when the unemployment number was really terrible and millions lost their jobs. Then I read the insights of analysts on why that kind of thing happened and I realized that people thought that the unemployment numbers can’t get any worse than that anymore and jobless claims have reached a peak, the stock market was already looking ahead by years into the future and betting that the worst is over. Just like how the stock market plummeted well before anyone grasped the full damage to the job market. The market was correct too as the jobless numbers went on a steady decline after that and now we are even seeing labor shortages in USA.

• **Last but not the least, “Don’t Fight the Fed”** – probably the single most important lesson that we have witnessed, real-time throughout this crisis. Should’ve went all-in already in March 2020, without hesitations when the fed was able to throw the whole kitchen sink after they were allowed to backstop the whole corporate credit market and even junk bonds, credit spreads stopped imploding after this. Turmoil on the market was calmed down, equities went on a non-stop lockout rally while most people we’re waiting for another crash to happen again.

I remember there was even one trading session back in June 2020 where the dow was trading down like 900-1000 points throughout the day and suddenly the fed just said something on press release like they are going to add more to their corporate bond purchases, the 1000 point drop was magically erased intraday. This crisis was basically one whole playground for the fed and we saw how powerful these central banks are in creating a boom cycle for the markets.",finance

personalfinance,Upcoming surgeries for my dog. Credit card questions.,"So I recently found out that my dog not only completely tore one of his ACLs but partially tore the other as well. I was prepared for one and knew the statistic about the chances that the other would tear during recovery of the initial one. That aside, it was still a little bit of a shock to find out that they will for sure need to operate on both over 2 separate surgeries. I’ve been quoted at $4,000-4,2000 for the initial one and I imagine the second will be similar in price as it is still the same surgery. Clearly a large financial burden to bear in the span of a few months. And no, the surgery is non-negotiable- my pup is 4 years old and large so I’m not entertaining the idea of euthanizing or forgoing the surgeries. 

Now for the financial questions. My bf and I were planning on redoing our driveway this year which is roughly the cost of the surgeries, so semi-worst case scenario, we put off the driveway for a year or so and use the savings for the surgeries instead and would not have to dip into our emergency savings. Now I’m not completely opposed to this but with the rising cost of literally everything anymore, I fear that the price for the driveway will only go up the longer we wait. My other thought is to open a credit card with an introductory 0% interest rate for X number of months and pay the surgeries off over the course of that time. That is my preference but I don’t know much about credit cards. I’ve only ever had store cards-and only one is still active that I recently paid off. That was a furniture store card that periodically does 0% for X months and I just take a few months to spread out payments before the term is up. My bf recently made me an authorized user on his capital one card so I have that I suppose. My credit has always been pretty good so I’m not worried about being denied for most cards.  Credit karma states I’m around 765 but when I refinanced my vehicle last fall, the credit check came back with 801. 

What are some credit cards to look into that would give me higher lines of credit to cover both surgeries and have 0% interest for a period of time? I know Care Credit is an option but they are only 6 months no interest and I was hoping for a little more time. Absolute worst case scenario, my bf and I have separate savings we have been keeping specifically to pay toward student loans when forbearance ends (barring no loan forgiveness) but I don’t want to touch that as my bf has enough currently to pay his off completely come September. 

Am I overlooking any other options? I’d love some advise!",finance

btc,Crosspost to r/Bitcoincash,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a PR issue.

Many people, who objectively and provably know very little about Crypto, Bitcoin and Blockchain, have an incredibly low opinion of Bitcoin Cash.

Words that can too often be read on Reddit include ""scam"", ""shitcoin"" with some of the prominent players of BCH being called ""criminals"" or ""scammers"".

**This stigma needs to be shed.**

**The truth needs to be heard.**

Michael Saylor's latest [interview](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1404537688666017799) about Bitcoin helping the dollar to become an international currency should send shivers down the spine of everyone within the crypto world.

Bitcoin has not just been hijacked. It has been weaponised!

**Bitcoin Cash proponents need to work together:**

We need to differentiate ourselves from BTC as much as possible.

The colour change and new marketing is a big step in the right direction and we need to continue with this differentiation. Make it clear that Bitcoin Cash is not BTC. Distance ourselves from BTC as much as possible, and make everyone 100% clear that:

* There is a difference
* What the difference is
* What coin we support and represent

I do not think the activities on this subreddit, despite being mainly pro BCH, always help the cause.

r/BTC has 500k readers 822 are online now.

r/Bitcoincash has 84.2k readers 302 online now.

Where will people who want to learn about Bitcoin Cash go to? r/Bitcoincash

They will see how little activity it has and likely move on.

Many posts that are pro Bitcoin Cash on r/BTC do not even make it onto r/Bitcoincash.

When people discover r/BTC, they feel cheated that it is mostly negative about BTC and very pro BCH. This does not help with shedding the stigma of a ""scam"" and differentiating ourselves from BTC.

# What I propose?

Simple, and hopefully non controversial 😉

**Crosspost absolutely every single positive Bitcoin Cash (BCH) post to** r/Bitcoincash

That's it! 😊

We can keep r/btc as it is, after all the history makes sense.

Just make sure to feed r/bitcoincash with every single positive piece of news or information.

Do not post something on r/btc without crossposting on r/bitcoincash.

The end result will be a really well fed sub where many people interested in Bitcoin Cash will check out, find lots to read, and stay because of the active community, leading to a more positive relationship with BCH and everything it has to offer.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Better ideas for emergency funds?,"Hey all, we're all familiar with the idea of an emergency fund. We all want to have one, and in many cases we want to have it for 3-6 months of living expenses which is quite a lot of money for most! We typically agree it needs to be a relatively liquid cash savings that you can tap into quickly for an emergency or an ongoing hardship like extended unemployment. I think it's safe to say most people have their emergency funds in their checking or savings accounts, which at the moment are garnering some pretty awful interest rates given the potential inflation we might see. Even our coveted ""high yield"" savings accounts are down from the approx. 2% interest we were seeing previously to well under 1%.

I'm interested in hearing from the community how people approach their emergency funds and the different places people put them. For example, those comfortable with high risk might not even differentiate their ""emergency fund"" from their investments and have it in ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, or even crypto. Others might be comfortable with medium risk and have it in a less volatile but still interest bearing asset like a bond fund or bonds themselves at the price of some liquidity. And then some people will tolerate zero risk and have it in cash in their checking account or savings account or under their mattress.

Particularly for those that have found a nice balance between risk, appreciation (to offset inflation), and accessibility for emergencies, I want to hear your thoughts! Have a great day.",finance

personalfinance,I'm upside down on a 2020 Hyundai Veloster and I don't know what to do,"Edit: So after checking another resource as recommended by a comment, my Carmax offer is $17.6k. My loan balance as of right now is $16.8k. Should I sell it to Carmax and buy a cheap car with only some of my savings plus any extra money from Carmax (if the offer stays consistent)? I’ve been looking around at some private listings that don’t have sky high prices and found some decent vehicles I can afford to pay cash for. But again, not sure if this is a smart move or not. Thanks for all the advice so far!

As soon as I turned 19, I financed a base model 2020 hyundai veloster at a 23% interest rate w/ no credit and a cosigner w/ poor credit. My monthly payment was $560. I refinanced it in the beginning of 2020 w/ a 4.5% interest rate for 72 months, monthly payment is now $327. I don't know that much, but I feel like that's a fair payment and interest rate, but I'm now living paycheck to paycheck and I can barely afford to keep my car. I live with my family and boyfriend, but even doing that I'm not able to save money anymore. Family is also in a bad financial situation, bf has a $431 monthly car payment.  Bf and I cannot at all afford to pay rent anywhere, but with our expenses we're not really saving anything that would be used for rent. I've been thinking of selling my car which is valued at \~13000 last time I checked, I'm upside down \~4000. 

However, I do have money saved up. I have about 12000 right now, but I've been slowly using it up since I've been struggling financially for the last few months. Bf owes \~11400 on his car, while I owe \~17000. We've been thinking of some options, but neither of us are financially savvy and I don't know what the best option is. Here is what we've thought of so far:

1. use my savings to pay off bf's car loan. He then saves 431 each month to save up for us to use to pay off my car early. But I won't have any savings anymore, so nothing to help out if a financial emergency comes up. He also wants to sell his car after we make a huge dent in my loan/after I am able to get a cheaper used vehicle.
2. sell my car either privately or somewhere like carvana for \~13000, pay the \~4000 difference with my savings, leaving me 8000 to contribute to a used car that I would buy privately. Though that would still land me with no emergency fund leftover. 

I'm really hesitant to use all my savings since it has taken me years to save it. Bf, to be honest, is not always the best at saving money. He makes more than me on his paychecks but he has nothing saved up. That's all I've thought of so far. I know my situation is really not the worst, and I don't want to be ungrateful, but I don't know what to do. I was never taught personal finance and I've just had to learn as I go, so apologies if the answer to my situation is glaringly obvious.",finance

investing,Interest Rates as a measure of Risk,"There has been a lot said in the past few years about the interest rates, and how they are not sustainable so close to zero (or even below zero in real terms). I want to offer a different perspective - not only these rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future, but these are the normal rates for the future and a reflection of real changes in the world and not some artificial manipulation by central banks.  


To explain this, we need to go back to the basics. What is an interest rate? It's a ""future consumption discount"", in other words how much money would it take to convince a person with money to spend it in the future rather than today. For example (and to use simple values), if the rate is 10% annual, then if I had 100 dollars today, someone would have to pay me 110 dollars a year from now to lend them the money today.  


So let's examine what impacts these rates, or in other words what makes me require more or less payment a year from now to not spend the money today. There are lots of different factors, but it mainly comes down to uncertainty.... the less certain I am about the future, the more money later I would need to not spend it today. For example... if I knew the world was ending in a month, no amount of money in the world would convince me not to spend it today on something nice. On the other hand, if I knew for sure things would be great a year from now, and not only that, but there might be stuff available in a year that isn't even available today (like a new car, or phone...) it would take much less to persuade me to wait that year... perhaps I would be even ok with losing some money and still wait.  


Ok, so interest rates are measure of uncertainty, more uncertainty means higher rates and vice versa. So when we talk about historical rates we can also talk about historical uncertainty and see how it matches up. Just to provide 3 data points, let's look at 1980 (\~13% rate), 1990 (\~9% rate) and 2021 (\~1.5% rate)   


Here is the thing ... the world in 2021 is much much safer and more certain than in 1990 or 1980. In 1980 the world was one mistake and button push away from total destruction (google 1983 able archer). Most Western economies were in deep multi-year ruts. Soviets were invading Afghanistan and US was sending weapons to their opponents there.   


1990 was much saner... Berlin Wall was down, Reaganomics (and it's variants around the world) started to pull Western economies toward more growth.  Volcker's Fed shown that inflation can be defeated and controlled. But threats still remained, Germany was not yet unified, people were concerned with nuclear weapons ""lost"" in Russia etc.  


And finally we skip to 2021. Nuclear threat is no longer a serious concern. We made it through 2009 and the economists have shown that they can manage and control deflation as well as inflation. The world survived a world scale pandemic with (relatively) minor damage and in fact has proven that it can function reasonably well despite all of it. Air travel is safe. We are close to making driving perfectly safe too. The biggest international challenge is China because they copied some of our ideas. Not ideal, but nowhere near the threat that USSR was. Tech is developing so rapidly that it actually makes sense to wait a bit to get the new stuff rather than buying something that will be obsolete in couple years today.  


So from that point of view, interest rates / uncertainty near zero make sense. What about the future? Well, outside of climate change threat (and even that seem to be fairly well contained from the world perspective, even if it will hurt specific areas more than others), there doesn't seem to be all that much to worry about. So low uncertainty about future means low interest rates for as far as the eye can see. This is the new normal and it's good because it means we live in a safe sane predictable world.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

My role has recently been approved for a company car as I have to travel 25-50% of the time for my job. The way we treat it, you either take the car or opt out.

1. Taking the car. I would get a BMW X1, company covers gas, insurance, registration, maintenance, etc. I would have to pay for personal mile usage and track that if I use it for anything other than work travel or daily work commute. 
2. Opt out. If I opt out, I receive a $300 gross stipend monthly for having a car. By choosing this option, I become ineligible for requesting personal mileage reimbursements (at federal rate) but I would have access to a company pool car that can be requested and checked out. I support locations north of DC and I live in Maryland but our office is in VA so I would have to commute to and from the office to pick up the pool car each time I use it.

Complications from my perspective: I currently own a Honda CRV (fully paid off). I also rent an apartment with my girlfriend and she has her own car as well. We can't have 3 cars at the building, so one would have to go. I am a very active/outdoorsy person with a lot of multi-hundred mile road trips, hiking and camping and such. I could sell my car, but I feel like the BMW would be an awful car for the outdoors stuff as it's smaller and not right for the activity, plus the added cost of the personal mileage for those long trips would probably add up quickly. I could ask my girlfriend to sell her car and we keep mine for that purpose, but I know she likes having her own car that's hers.

Nvidia is an exception I will live with because they do just destroy every expectation set and are a leader in many of their industries. I see their PEG of 3.1 as sustainable and wanted to own them pre-split. I also sold bull put spreads because I believe the case for Nvidia is unique. 

The tech industry is flush with buying opportunities, although I wouldn't necessarily go all in on at a given time, I would put 25% on intended capitol to work and leave cash on the side to play the average as the stock moves. With the inflation and interest theme playing out, I feel there will be more buying opportunities, but I also want skin in the game. I stick to big tech and companies that can handle interest rates rising. 

I wouldn't go long on a semi ETF at this point, but I would like some money in the game.

Edit: Qualcomm should be on this list, but I do not follow them. They are great.",finance
personalfinance,How to plan financially for 12 weeks unpaid maternity leave,"I'm not pregnant yet but my husband and I are thinking about our futures and how to factor a baby into our lives, especially financially. I like to plan way in advance. Here are some stats: I'm the primary breadwinner at 84k, with my partner making 40k. I'm a W2 while he is an independent contractor (I have the opportunity to make more money as a contractor on my own time outside my 40hr per week job). I carry our health insurance and I'm eligible for FMLA, 12 weeks unpaid. Our monthly expenses consist of daily living expenses along with providing for two dogs and one cat, one car payment, a mortgage and my student loans. Besides the car payment, mortgage and student loans, we have no other debt. 

Our monthly expenses average between 6k-7k right now (1700 of this is at the moment is solely for my federal student loans. I budgeted to pay off my student loans of 109k in 4 years since I'm not eligible for PSLF. Unfortunately, according to my spreadsheet, I will need to start contributing an average of 2300 once the moratorium on federal loan interest ends in September if I still want to meet my goal of 4 years). I work in the healthcare field with a doctorate as a young professional in my late 20s (not a medical doctor).

I don't think my student loan goal payoff is going to be realistic once factoring in planning for a child.

But anyway, how much is reasonable to save up to cover 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, either specifically in my situation or just in general? Any unexpected expenses I should plan for? Should I kiss my dream of paying off my student loans early when planning for a baby?",finance

If you didn’t know the crash was due to two major things. An unexpected rising inflation report and institutional manipulation. 

The whole market is waiting for tomorrow and not just crypto but stocks to see how the FEDs will handle rising inflation. Get ready everyone and good luck!

EDIT: I anticipate that they will allow inflation to rise because at this point it’s extremely hard to reign back without tanking the economy short-term. But who knows.

personalfinance,Planning First Move-Out for me [21] and roommate [20],"**Context**


I make around $1,000 a month with my planned roommate making around $1900 a month. This situation is soon to improve, as I just accepted a federal government job paying roughly $1800 a month. I expect at the moment that I'd be working that job somewhere in late July or early August. Combined, we've saved just above $7,000 saved for the event, and plan to save $8,000 total.


From that information, I've looked online for a few apartments in our area that fit what we're looking for, and most importantly are under $900 for rent, accounting for possible utility costs on top of rent alone. So far, I have a top 5 of places that fit. We plan to move between September and November depending on availability of units at the aforementioned properties.


We both have opened credit cards, purely in hopes that by the time we apply we may have a credit score show up in their credit checks.  


**Questions**


1 - When should we start touring these properties to decide if we want to apply?


2 - When should we apply once we know a unit is available?


I imagine for people like us it'd be best to apply 1 month ahead since we're certainly on the more high-risk side of people looking for housing..",finance

stocks,The case for ULTA - a smart retail reopening play.,"Disclosure: I have a position in ULTA, opened earlier this week. Writing this DD to clarify my thoughts and present the case to you fine folks in case there's something I may have overlooked. As always, do your own research.

### Background

[ULTA] Ulta Beauty is a specialty cosmetics retailer with a large brick-and-mortar presence across the U.S. It has been growing share during the lockdown through e-commerce - in spite of most stores being closed as non-essential. With reopening, they're poised to do extremely well over the upcoming year.

### Encouraging Facts

- Cosmetics is a fantastic retail business to be in: compact items, high margins. ULTA's leading market position has led to exclusive contracts with brands, a pricing advantage, and cross-selling of multiple types of products/services. In-store salons and a customized shopping experience are their differentiator.

- in 2018, ULTA acquired two tech companies to aid in customer personalization and building their digital ecosystem. This has paid off, and they have an amazing rewards program with 30M+ members. In other words, of American women over the age of 15, more than one out of five is an ULTA rewards member. 

- Ulta also has paid membership options that give extra rewards - leading to customer loyalty in an otherwise fragmented retail space.

- Ulta is a destination store in malls, giving them a bargaining edge when it comes time to renew leases - they benefit from the tough time that mall REITs and other retailers have had.

- Recently announced partnership with Target with ~100 Ulta branches opening within Target stores - should be great in getting non-mall customer exposure.

- Financial strength: zero debt, almost a billion in cash on the balance sheet, easy access to lines of credit.

- Valuation: forward p/e of 27 is only moderately above their historical mid-20s ratio. In a market of high valuations, you're getting a growth company at a value price (PEG ratio = 0.74).

- Analyst sentiment: last week there were multiple upward price revisions. Institutional enthusiasm for the stock may be a catalyst for moves up in the near future.

### Bear Case

- Competitors: cosmetics sold by generic retailers or pharmacies like WBA, Sephora (LVMH) in malls, and Amazon is attempting to enter the attractive cosmetics market too. This may drive down margins over the long run (although I suspect that cosmetics are differentiated enough that some pricing power will remain for a superior shopping experience).

- Ulta's fantastic CEO, Mary Dillon, who led the brand's transformation over the past decade has recently retired as of June 2. She's moving to a backseat role and being replaced by Dave Kimball (who was promoted through the marketing division). Hopefully he doesn't screw up the good thing that Dillon got rolling. Some uncertainty about this transition may be why the stock hasn't gone up more already.

- First quarter results were great, is the good news all priced in? In my opinion, there's a lot of pent up demand to socialize and go to malls, which will be great for Ulta, others may disagree. 

- If there's another covid closure or big economic pullback, all of retail sector will suffer. Inflation doomsayers and interest rate bears, look away.

### Summary

Ulta is a tech-enabled retailer that is emerging stronger out of the pandemic. Their digital investments are paying off and I personally expect a great future for them.

Position: shares. Will not speculate as to time-based catalysts for options as I don't play that way. If I did, I'd get LEAPs.

If you want something riskier but along similar lines, look at LB (Victoria's Secret/Bath and Body Works) for a brand that is less smart digitally but also a winner from pent up women's shopping demand.

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi.

4. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake?

17. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become.

18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

82. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

personalfinance,Need Valuable reviews regarding HELOC Strategy,"Hi Everyone,

I am a young investor with zero experience when it comes to the real estate market. Currently, I am doing a lot of research about the Mortgage &amp; HELOC strategy. I have come across a company called [""TruthinEquity""](https://truthinequity.com/). I am curious if anyone else has found this site and could provide their experience or thoughts in general about the company's HELOC strategy.

When it seems too good to be true it usually is, but this strategy does make a lot of sense at least on paper. Yes, when following this strategy the individual must be very diligent in keeping up with the cash flow required, but if they do, I do see how it makes sense even with the variable interest rate associated with the HELOC.

Any thoughts/suggestions?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Fed explores ‘once in a century’ bid to remake the U.S. dollar : TLDR The rise of private cryptocurrencies motivated the Fed to start considering a digital dollar to be used alongside the traditional paper currency.,"[https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/12/fed-remake-us-dollar-493548?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/12/fed-remake-us-dollar-493548?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

The Federal Reserve is taking what may  be the first significant step toward launching its own virtual  currency, a move that could shake up banks, give millions of low-income  Americans access to the financial system and fortify the dollar's status  as the world’s reserve currency.

The idea of creating a fully digital  version of the U.S. dollar, which was unthinkable just a few years ago,  has gained bipartisan interest from lawmakers as diverse as Sens.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) because of its  potential benefits for consumers who don’t have bank accounts. But it’s  also sparking strong pushback from those with the most to lose: banks.

 

The Federal Reserve is taking what may  be the first significant step toward launching its own virtual  currency, a move that could shake up banks, give millions of low-income  Americans access to the financial system and fortify the dollar's status  as the world’s reserve currency.

The idea of creating a fully digital  version of the U.S. dollar, which was unthinkable just a few years ago,  has gained bipartisan interest from lawmakers as diverse as Sens.  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) because of its  potential benefits for consumers who don’t have bank accounts. But it’s  also sparking strong pushback from those with the most to lose: banks.



“The United States should not  implement a \[central bank digital currency\] simply because we can or  because others are doing so,” the American Bankers Association said in a  statement to lawmakers this week. The benefits “are theoretical,  difficult to measure, and may be elusive,” while the negative  consequences “could be severe,” the group wrote.



The explosive rise of private  cryptocurrencies in recent years motivated the Fed to start considering a  digital dollar to be used alongside the traditional paper currency. The  biggest driver of concern was a Facebook-led effort, launched in 2019,  to build a global payments network using crypto technology. Though that  effort is now much narrower, it demonstrated how the private sector  could, in theory, create a massive currency system outside government  control.

Now, central banks around the world  have begun exploring the idea of issuing their own digital currencies — a  fiat version of a cryptocurrency that would operate more like physical  cash — that would have some of the same technological benefits as other  cryptocurrencies.

That could provide unwelcome  competition for banks by giving depositors another safe place to put  their money. A person or a business could keep their digital dollars in a  virtual “wallet” and then transfer them directly to someone else  without needing to use a bank account. Even if the wallet were operated  by a bank, the firm wouldn’t be able to lend out the cash. But unlike  other crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ether, it would be directly backed  and controlled by the central bank, allowing the monetary authorities to  use it, like any other form of the dollar, in its policies to guide  interest rates.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative  are aiming next month to publish the first stage of their work to  determine whether a Fed virtual currency would work on a practical level  — an open-source license for the most basic piece of infrastructure  around creating and moving digital dollars.

But it will likely be up to Congress  to ultimately decide whether the central bank should formally pursue  such a project, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged. Lawmakers  on both sides of the aisle are intrigued, particularly as they eye  China’s efforts to build its own central bank digital currency, as well  as the global rise of cryptocurrencies, both of which could diminish the  dollar’s influence.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Democrats have especially been  skeptical about crypto assets because there are fewer consumer  protections and the currencies can be used for illicit activity. There  are also environmental concerns posed by the sheer amount of electricity  used to unlock new units of digital currencies like Bitcoin.

Warren suggested the Fed project could resolve some of those concerns.

“Legitimate digital public money could  help drive out bogus digital private money, while improving financial  inclusion, efficiency, and the safety of our financial system — if that  digital public money is well-designed and efficiently executed,” she  said at a hearing on Wednesday, which she convened as chair of the  Senate Banking Committee’s economic policy subcommittee.

Other senators highlighted the  potential for central bank digital wallets to be used to deliver  government aid more directly to people who don’t have bank accounts. A  digital dollar could also be designed to have more high-tech benefits of  some cryptocurrencies, like facilitating “smart contracts” where a  transaction is completed once certain conditions are met.

Neha Narula, who’s leading the effort  at MIT to work with the Boston Fed on a central bank digital currency,  called the project “a once-in-a-century opportunity to redesign the  dollar” in a way that supports innovation much like the internet did.

Still, there are a slew of unanswered  policy questions around how a digital dollar would be designed, such as  how people would get access to the money, or how much information the  government would be able to see about individual transactions. The  decision is also tied to a far more controversial policy supported by  Democrats like Warren and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown to give  regular Americans accounts at the Fed.

“What problem is a central bank  digital currency trying to solve? In other words, do we need one? It’s  not clear to me yet that we do,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said. “In my  view, turning the Fed into a retail bank is a terrible idea.”

And, “the fact that China is creating a  digital currency does not mean it’s inevitable that the yuan would  displace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency,” he said.

 

For their part, banks fear a  Fed-issued digital currency could make it easier for customers to pull  out large amounts of deposits and convert them to digital dollars during  a crisis — the virtual equivalent of a bank run — putting financial  stress on their institutions and making less money available to provide  credit for people, businesses and markets.

It could also potentially deprive them  of customers, something the lenders say would interfere with lawmakers’  vision of increased financial inclusion.

“While it is true that deposit  accounts are often the first step towards inclusion, the benefits of a  long-term banking relationship go well beyond a deposit account,” the  ABA said in its statement. “The same is not true of a \[central bank  digital currency\] account with the Federal Reserve, which would not grow  into a lending or investing relationship.”

The Bank Policy Institute, which  represents large banks, has also argued that many of the benefits of a  digital dollar are “mutually exclusive (because they are predicated on  different program designs) or effectively non-existent (because the  program design that produces them comes with costs that are for other  reasons unbearable).”

“The decision on whether to adopt a  central bank digital currency in the United States is appropriately a  long way off,” BPI President and CEO Greg Baer said. “There are also  complex and serious costs that will need to be considered.”

But many lawmakers think it's worth the effort to look into it.

“The Federal Reserve should continue  to explore a digital \[currency\]; nearly every other country is doing  that,” Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) said at the hearing, citing the risk  for the U.S. to lose its ability to deploy economic sanctions as  effectively with decreased usage of the dollar",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a one time per sentient species event: what does digital scarcity mean, Bitcoin's ""Je Ne Sais Quoi,"" and the first and only digital land grab","Prior to the first Bitcoin block and the absolute scarcity that the network introduced to the world, every single object or resource in the physical realm had no absolute cap of availability.  But now we have Bitcoin, the first truly scarce ""thing"" known to man. And it just happens to be digital. Yet, what does this actually mean--an absolutely scarce digital thing? 

Well in my view, it is something that can happen only once. 

Here is a hacked together logical proof replete with logical errors and random commentary:

PROOF:

1.) Absolute scarcity is not possible in the physical realm (barring extinction of living creatures and plant life of course).

2.) Therefore, absolute scarcity can only occur in the digital realm.

3.) Since absolute scarcity can only occur in the digital realm, what is it about the digital realm that allows that scarcity? With adequate security, computers have the ability to execute immutable rules.

4.) Given that all computers with adequate security can execute immutable rules, what differentiates Bitcoin from ETH, Shibacoin, Fortnite V-Bucks,  Fedcoin, or RuneScape party hats? 

5.) Bitcoin is a decentralized consensus based P2P open source network with absolute scarcity as its founding principle. All of those other digital tokens are subject to the whims of their owners with varying degrees of centralization and unpredictability. 

Still, this isn't quite satisfying, is it? After all, couldn't this sub just make a new bitcoin called ""hodlcoin"" with a 3.1 million coin limit, using exactly the same software as the bitcoin protocol. Yep! Could every sub on reddit do the same thing? Yep!  Then we would have a trillion new coins floating around with 3.1 million coin limits for each sub protocol (dibs on WSBcoin) and some of the protocols would probably even be decentralized.

So what is that extra ""je ne sais quoi"" about Bitcoin that makes it unique? Bitcoin is both a **discovery and an invention**. **Satoshi invented Bitcoin and discovered absolute scarcity in the process as a byproduct** (the potential for which always existed in the digital realm).  This is why absolute scarcity cannot be replicated. The discovery has been made.

Interestingly enough, this also aligns with what the world needs. The world only needs 1 absolutely scarce digital asset because Bitcoin can effectively store decillions of dollars of USD value **right now**. The price of a bitcoin in USD is essentially meaningless to the network. 

So then, what does all this word salad mean? Pretty simple really. This is the age of the digital land grab. Those who understand Satoshi's discovery earliest will be the landed gentry of tomorrow. Those who don't, serfs servicing the robots that replaced them for one years salary.",cryptocurrency

What are the current rates of such platforms like [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), [Youhodler](https://www.youhodler.com/), [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/), [Blockfi](https://blockfi.com/), and [Nexo](https://nexo.com/)? By the way, how safe are they?

We all believe in the future of cryptocurrency, and for me opening a crypto savings account could be a great way to diversify my investing portfolio.

CryptoCurrency,Help me prove my wife wrong!,"I have been bugging my wife for months that she should invest a small portion of her savings in crypto and she has finally relented and opened an account on Binance.

However, she still firmly believes that all these computer coins are just a worthless fad, and has given me a small amount of money to distribute and a year, while going off to the fiat banking system with the same amount of money to lock that up for a year.

Our competition is to see who can turn a profit in the next 12 months... I'm pretty sure I can just turn her money into a stable coin and beat her banks interest rate but where is the fun in that...  So this is where you guys come in.

I got a few hundred to distribute and hodl for a year...

25% ETH, 25% BTC, 20% BNB, 20% ADA, 10% ???

Any suggestions for the final coin? Something that earns a decent interest.

Update: Calm down guys, it's just a bit of fun, and friendly competition. Disposable savings, worst case scenario she says ""told you so"".... And I probably have to take her out somewhere fancy for a date night.",cryptocurrency

The system is built to last all the way until the end of the year 2098 The book also takes you through the major historical components of the last 115 years and demonstrates how the system could have applied in the past.

personalfinance,Underwater on a car that’s having transmission issues- complicated to trade in.,"UPDATE:
New car secured!
My car was valued at $3k by CarMax after I used an OBM plugin to clear the codes.
I found a 2011 Subaru Outback with a thorough Carfax service history, no accidents, 107k miles for $9900.
Bargained down to $9600, they used CarMax’s appraisal and that took me to only underwater $3500.
New loan amount total is $11,180 with 48 mo of $308 ($368 when I added extended warranty)- that’s definitely doable but I’ll be refinancing at 13-18 months/ASAP. 
However, that’s after an AGGRESSIVE down payment. I had to completely clean out my savings and part of a 401k- CapOne required $5300 down with a 504 score (a dealer last Monday ran a hard inquiry despite me saying no on Monday, dropped my score 12 points in a week). However, that didn’t change with a co-signer, so I’m happy that my name is the only one on the car. 
It’s at least a safe, reliable car that will actually last the 48 month loan term; and I’m never buying a domestic car again (I’ve had service issues with Chevrolet and Dodge as well). 

Honestly, this post’s replies helped a ton to convince me not to sink money into this pit of a car; but not return it to CapOne and have that on my credit. I think this was the best end solution under the circumstances. Thanks Reddit!

———————————

I’m unlucky enough to have purchased a 2014 Ford Focus in 2018. I’m about half way through my loan amount (CapOne) and my 10 day payoff amount is $6,499. Monthly payment $240. 
Unfortunately, last year during COVID I lost my job in the first wave of layoff’s by my industry (construction management). It took a while for unemployment to kick in and my car payment had to take a back seat to rent, those few missed payments dropped my score FAST until I had a new job later in the year.

I now make about 3 times what my income was when I got approved initially, I put $2500 down with a low 600s score. My score is now 516 from a previous 620ish (I have no other open lines of credit besides my car loan and a new credit card I got last month). 

My problem is, my Ford Focus finally had the transmission light come on. Turns out there were major recalls on my year/model, to the point of a Ford buyback settlement program starting last year. However, Ford probably won’t pay out soon enough to help, and they’re capping payments. CarMax and most dealers in my area are capping my car’s valuation at $3k. I had nothing saved for cash down on a car yet, my finances have still been recovering. I’d have to tap into my retirement for an emergency withdrawal/loan to myself or start stripping to make the money. 

The best salesperson I’ve dealt with has explained to me I should be looking for a car around $9-11k BUT below 125k miles (to get approved by a loan company), with the $3k going towards my balance on the old car, I’d still have to put $1,100.00 down minimum and that would STILL leave me with a $360ish car payment if I can get a 17% interest rate on the new loan ($120 higher than my current monthly payment). 

I don’t have co-signer options- my mom is financially insolvent, my dad has money and great credit but it comes with strings attached. Unmarried, won’t ask my partner. 

And I have to make a payment soon on my car if a dealer doesn’t buy- it’s a huge headache right now. 
Do I accept a loaner car to give me a few weeks to pull together a down payment? I’m stuck with a car I can’t safely drive (multiple mechanics have said I’ll be risking transmission failure while driving), lucky to be WFH, hands tied. 

Should I surrender the Ford to CapOne and just save my cash for a clean down payment on a new car? What will that do to my credit? Will it appear as a repo or voluntary? Will I still owe the remainder of the loan balance?

What would you guys do?",finance

investing,mREITs and the yield curve,"I've been trying to find an answer to a burning question for a long time now. Hopefully the r/investing community can help me solve it. 

&amp;#x200B;

mREITs make money by borrowing money short term and using the funds to buy higher-yield mortgage-backed securities. My question, then, if I wanted to track how profitable a mREIT may be, which maturities should I be looking at? i.e. what is the interest rate on the borrowed capital and what is the interest rate for the MBS? For clarity's sake, the link to the daily treasury yield curve has been attached [here](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).

   * based off estimated 12,000 kWh annually (it's a new home and we've only been in the home for 7 months)
* Mounted on Everest - PV Roof Mount System
* SolarEdge inverter/optimizers - 120/240V AC
* **System actual cost is $30K (8K Federal Tax Credit (26%) for a realized cost of $22K**

 **Second company:**

* 24 Silfab Solar SIL 330 watt estimated to produce approximately 10,400 kWh annually
   * based off estimated 9600 kWh (these guys used a current electric bill which showed monthly average of 800kWh/month)
   * This was an email quote. They sent the quote simply based on web Contact Form, haven't had any communication with them as of yet.
* 24 Enphase IQ7PLUS Inverters
* **System actual cost is $26K ($6500 Federal Tax Credit (26%) for realized cost of $19K**

**Questions:**

What do you all think of the panels being recommended?  
What are your thoughts on the single inverter vs the multi inverter?

This is a very exciting journey so far. Having just built our house, we feel this is a good investment but may also need to wait until we get a full years worth of energy bills in to get a better analysis of our usage. We have no idea if the 12kWh or 10kWh is accurate. Maybe that's just not much of difference to worry about?

CryptoCurrency,BTC Short Squeeze or Absolute Dumpage Coming?,"I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to the trading view chart of BTC short interest or not. If you have, then you probably already know that I am about to bring up the fact that ever since we have seen this reversal, we have seen an egregious number of shorts piling into the market. 

 As you can see here below, BTC Shorts have piled up to more than double the massive short right before the 2020 Corona crash. We haven't seen shorts like this in almost three years. I have been slowly DCA'ing again ever since the 50% drawdown. Do you guys think we will see a massive short squeeze or do the shorts know something we don't, maybe about the FOMC meeting today?

personalfinance,To Refi or not to Refi?,"My credit was less than stellar when I purchased and came in at a 3.6 interest rate with a VA loan.   My credit has improved over the year and is above 700 now. 

I am just 10 payments into the mortgage and can refinance using IRRRL to go down to 2.75 or even lower depending on how the refi is structured.  I want to avoid out of pocket costs on closing.

Is it worth it to go from 3.6 to 2.75?  

\--It lowers the payment around $150 a month

\--resets the loan to 30 years - basically erasing my first year of payments.

\--could increase the loan back to the original amount, a few thousand dollars.

My thought is to get the interest rate lower to make it easier to possibly rent out in the future.  If the mortgage is lower, the rent can be set so that I am not just making mortgage payments with the income.

In your opinion, is it a good idea and worth doing?",finance

personalfinance,"Pay house outright, or new mortgage with low interest?","Last year as interest rates dropped, my spouse and I started looking at investing in our first home.  We have been approved up to 225k, and have 20% down set aside.  Interest rates quoted were dirt cheap at approx 3.25% for someone with mediocre low 700s credit.  However with the housing bubble and the effects of the pandemic, we have been outbid a couple times on properties we are interested in.  Sometimes due to cash offers, sometimes because people were willing to bid 20-30k more than the home's value.

Where it gets even interesting now - as of the last month we are in the process of collecting a large inheritance from a passed family member - to the point that we could pay cash for our potential home if we wanted to do so.

Please help us weigh our options on whether it best to continue with the plan on borrowing the home loan when we finally find a house and investing our inheritance for a better % profit... or... paying for our home in cash, having no mortgage, and freeing up monthly income.",finance

personalfinance,Private credit fund employee co-invest,"Curious to hear your take on fund investments and confirm I'm thinking about this the right way.

My private credit fund is on the cusp of closing its next fund. Terms for employee fund investment are no fees/carry and an external leverage facility that will provide up to 65% LTV at an interest rate of roughly prime less a couple bps. 

My fund's hurdle is ~6.5% and the leverage facility interest rate would be ~3%. This seems like a no-brainer with an IRR in the low teens for a fixed income alternative, excluding the concentration risk (minimum investment size would make this about 1/4 to 1/3 of my portfolio.)

Rough math here is 2:1 leverage at an interest rate about half the fund return, for a return of roughly double the actual fund return.

personalfinance,Confused and stressed about my car loan,"I already made one post semi-about this but was vague about my finances and what is going on in life. 
I have a 2020 Hyundai Veloster with a $327 monthly payment, 4.5% interest rate, 72 months. My remaining balance is $16.8k. I pay $293 per month for insurance. I make  ~1.3k a month and I have 12k in savings. My savings have been slowly depleting as I’ve had my hours cut at work and needed to use some of my savings to help fully pay bills and such. My bills total, including groceries and gas, are ~1.1k per month. Im also currently thinking of getting a second job or some other way to bring in extra money.

I live with my parents right now, but they’re also in a bad financial situation so in the last few months I’ve had to help them cover expenses that have sprung up or bills that are past due. I honestly don’t mind helping, especially since I live there, but the continuous unexpected expenses are starting to take a toll on me. I’ve tried to talk to my mom about my car, but she insists I keep it because it is new and therefore reliable. I understand what she’s saying but it has been getting harder to keep that mindset lately because I’ve been struggling so much. My car payment and insurance is nearly half my monthly income. I know the car market is insane right now though so I’m not sure what to do, plus I’m not well versed in finances or vehicles. I don’t know if I should make a move right now. 

It is a bad idea to trade in my car for a cheaper one, if I can even find a deal like that? I’d like to have an suv, but I know chances are my car’s value won’t match that of an suv. Should I sell my car and use any profit from that and/or my savings to buy a used vehicle? Again I really don’t know if I’ll have any luck finding a used suv that I can afford and doesn’t have near 200k miles on it. I checked carvanas offer on my car, it was ~12k as of yesterday while carmax was at ~17.6k. Should I just stick it out, keep my car and try to pay a few dollars more on it monthly when I can? In that case I wouldn’t be able to move out anytime soon unless I bring in way more income than I do now, but maybe that would be a better idea since used cars aren’t much less than new now. I’ve also seen a few people say things will be like this for a a year or two. If you have any other suggestions or advices it would be much appreciated, thank you.",finance

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials signaled they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March, as the economy recovers rapidly from the effects of the pandemic and inflation heats up.

Their median projection showed they anticipate lifting their benchmark rate to 0.6% from near zero by the end of 2023. In March they had expected to hold it steady through that year.
Prompting the policy shift is a much stronger economic rebound and hotter inflation than the Fed anticipated just a few months ago.

“Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid-19 in the United States,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting. “Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.”

In updated projections released Wednesday 13 of 18 officials indicated they expect to lift short-term rates by the end of 2023, up from seven who expected that outcome in March. In March, most of them anticipated holding rates steady through 2023.

The Fed has held overnight interest rates steady since March 2020, when the effects of the pandemic caused the sharpest economic contraction in generations. The central bank also has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds since June 2020 to hold down longer-term borrowing costs, providing further support to the recovery.

The Fed reiterated that it expects to continue bond purchases until “substantial further progress” has been made in the recovery.

Fed officials want the economy to get closer to their goals of “maximum employment” and sustained, 2% inflation before reducing the bond purchases. They have said they want to fully achieve those objectives before they raise interest rates.

Since officials’ previous meeting, in April, the labor market’s progress has been somewhat slower than they had anticipated. Employers added 837,000 jobs in April and May, leaving total employment 7.6 million jobs shy of pre-pandemic levels.

Policy makers have become less confident in recent weeks the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Some 2.6 million people retired between February 2020 and April, according to estimates from the Dallas Fed. A steadily aging U.S. population suggests limited scope for reversing that trend, some economists say.

In contrast, inflation has been higher than expected. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index rose 5% in May from a year earlier.

That inflation rate, the highest since 2008, makes the Fed uncomfortable, even if officials believe it reflects mostly temporary factors that should fade later this year. They worry that if inflation exceeds 2% too much or for too long, it might lead businesses and consumers to anticipate more inflation in the future, which can become self-fulfilling. Evidence of rising inflation expectations would likely require the Fed to tighten policy sooner or more aggressively than planned to re-anchor those expectations around 2%.",finance

I put ""debt"" in parenthesis because, we have enough cash to pay my student loans off in full. I've been stockpiling the loan payment money in the emergency fund because payments/interest were frozen due to Covid.

My credit score is 768 because the account balances are too high (according to Chase's free credit score insight tool).

I'm concerned that, when I pay off my student loans, my credit score will go down when I'm trying to apply for a mortgage because of closure of old accounts and loss of credit ""mix"". All that will be left is my one credit card.

To avoid this, I was thinking--

* I will pay off all but $1 of each of my student loans (interest and payments are still frozen until September).
* Then, get pre-approved for a mortgage and interest rate.
* Then, pay off the $1 balances before the forbearance is over.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm

&gt;The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.

&gt;Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

&gt;The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.

&gt;The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.

&gt;In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

investment,A Look into $UWMC Tells Us it's Undervalued - A Company with Strong Financials and Operations,"[UWMC](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC) holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel. With their continued growth from the market outlook, I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share up. To see similar analyses to this one, give my [account](https://utradea.com/portfolio) a follow to be updated whenever I post!

# Company Overview

**United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:** [**UWMC**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC)**)** is a wholesale lender. The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks and local credit unions. The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in-house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers. It also provides training, technology, marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners.

For the last 6 years included FY2020, they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S by closed loan volume, with approximately 34% market share of the wholesale channel.

**Strategy:** Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners, independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers. By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship, they believe they’re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients.

# Market Opportunity

* Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow
   * Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U.S consumer finance market
   * In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7T and an average of $2.2T over the last 5 years
   * Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to $12.4T by the end of 2022
      * An increase from FY2020 value of $11.1T
   * Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non-bank originators
      * Since 2008, non-bank originators have grown from 32% of the loan origination volume to 79% in 2020
      * Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination
      * Non-bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share
   * Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases

# Investment Thesis I: Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues

By focusing solely on the wholesale channel, it provides UWMC with a differentiated, client-centric business model that allows for scaled, efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high-quality loans. FY2020, UWMC closed approx. 561,000 loans, with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days. With an average of 9.8 loans per month per production team member, UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3.5. At this rate, UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry, and in turn, generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders.

**Revenue:** In the 4QFY2020 alone, UWMC reported a net income of $1.37B- nearly half of their total net income in 2020. This was approx. a 700% increase YoY (2019-2020) and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity. UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength, balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty (as discussed in Risks)

# Investment Thesis II: Strong IT Infrastructure

UWMC’s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a “best-in-class client experience.” Their variety of full-service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end-to-end experience for the borrower from origination through closing. Because of this, their technology platforms give them a competitive edge, helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations. It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster-than-industry average for closing loans. As well, the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors.

# Risks

**Their financial performance is directly affected by, and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates.** A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U.S could lead to stagflation in the coming years. As interest rates rise, refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages (refinancing makes up 75% of their mortgage volume). In the mortgage loan business, higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive. These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations.

**Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U.S residential real estate market conditions.** The U.S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions. Economic conditions such as interest rates, slowed economic growth, unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrower’s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMC’s financial position. Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues- or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMC’s expenses for loans serviced.

# Valuation

Using a comps analysis, I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings. Given their recent IPO, I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV/Revenue to further value the company.

**P/S Ratio:** Using a P/S multiple of 4.27, I arrived at a fair value of $15.23 representing a 50.88% upside.

**P/E Ratio:** With the P/E ratio, I arrived at a fair value of $28.27 representing a 179% implied upside.

**Using a 50/50 weighting system, I arrive at an estimated fair value of $21.75 which would imply approx. 115% upside.**

# Final Thoughts

Given the market opportunity, strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings, I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years. By solely focusing on the wholesale channel, the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high-quality loans while also meeting the growing demand. Going forward, I hope to see increased revenues on their ER and also a changing social sentiment to help drive this stock forward (Reddit sentiment take from [here](https://utradea.com/feed))

personalfinance,How feasible is to carry two currencies concurrently?,"I recently started a part time second job remotely in which I am being paid in a currency that can either be converted to USD or kept as it is. I am still debating on whether the employer should send it through to my bank and have it automatically converted, or whether I should tell the bank ""Hey, please keep it in the original currency""... or if I should just open a second account alltogether with TransferWise. 

I'm heavily considering keeping it in the original currency in large part due to worries over inflation increasing in the States to such a point where the money I make in the foreign currency will appreciate (as it has appreciated over the last several months) to be near-equal to the value I would've made in the US over that same period.. and I'm earning less than $1000. Right now I earn $12/hr as a recent college graduate, and my hours are less than full time so I maybe clear $1500 a month. 

As a general rule, I've heard its ideal to be paid in the currency that you spend because among other things conversion fees can be terrible at traditional banks especially if you aren't transferring huge sums (normally quoted as 5 figures or higher). There is something appealing though in having that foreign currency in the event the USD does get to a point where my real wage doesn't earn me as much and I need to have that non-USD asset as a fallback.

I've been working at the first job for over a year. I live in an economically depressed state where the average wage is barely over the federal minimum. Most work around me is seasonal, customer-facing, and pays usually minimum wage. The highest hourly wage I've seen is $14/hr for jobs that would require years of experience. I've been told point-blank from people in the area including a few employers that ""yeah $14 is the best you'll likely get even with years of experience"". So in my head if I don't have access to that $500-$900 until I need it? Okay, that seems fine it's not like I'm missing much currently.

At that time and after, I will make minimum payments on my 92k with the IBR plan while also saving up for the estimated $130k forgiveness in 20 years, which will result in a tax bomb (as opposed to making more than minimum payments).

The principal for the loan would be equivalent to 110,000 SGD with an interest rate of 9.3%, which leads to about 135,000 SGD after interest. The average salary for mechanical engineers is around 45k SGD per year (according to [payscale.com](https://payscale.com)). 

Should I accept the offer for the program or not? Is it a good decision to incur a 135k SGD debt on myself before starting my professional career?

TLDR : Offered admission in a good university. Need to take a loan. Loan repayment is 135k SGD. Avg. salary in Singapore is 45k per year. Good idea or terrible mistake?",finance
personalfinance,"I'm SOL, right? Bank Denies Claim Due to Claims Being Outside of Allotted Timeframe","In 2020 I barely checked my monthly bank statements since I was in a decent spot financially. COVID hit and job-wise it's been rough so my funds stalled and then slowly depleted. I'm been fortunate that family members have looked out for me since then. Hopefully in the next couple of months my employment will look better, but still. Before I had a reality check to actually setup notifications for every transaction, I did check my statement casually - and I realized that there was a pattern from FEDEX in late March.

Small charges here and there then large ones on a monthly basis. It was like clockwork with a specific pattern. As mentioned, I hit an employment rough spot with no funds coming which made me stringent on my expenses. I then receive a notice that my checking account was below a certain point and I wondered how could that be since I had barely ordered anything in such substantial amounts to deplete it. A good majority of my spending has been from Amazon if I ordered anything. I only have used FEDEX once to ship something back in 2019. I go onto my account and searched ""FEDEX."" A litany of charges were made since early 2020. I totaled up the amount and it was a little over $4k. I called FEDEX where they said they'd refund me a few that were in their time frame window (2 months) and cancelled the PENDING charges. I asked if there was anyway to get refunded for later charges in which they said to contact my bank. I then called my bank, BoA, to open up a claim on all of the FEDEX charges that weren't refunded at the time. I asked how far I could go back for transaction claims, saying that it was only 60 days, in which the customer service rep said to up to a year. Okay, I thought I was in decent shape. I wouldn't collect every cent lost but it'll be most of it - hopefully. They then issued me a new debit card. 

A week later I check my FEDEX account to see that my new debit card has been added my account. I never entered this new information in. I called FEDEX to see what's the deal, asking if the company atomically updated the debit/credit portion of our profiles if the previous card was declined. The customer rep said they don't and suggested for me to close my active account to avoid anymore charges, so I did, and it has worked (so far).

Another week passed where I receive a notification letter from BoA saying that the entire claim was denied due to the premise of me sanctioning permission for my debit card to be used. I then go onto my FEDEX account (which was still active for a couple of days after sanctioning it to be closed), print out all of the transactions that were processed (close to 50), wrote a letter saying that I was being charged for shipping with me not knowing either the SENDER or RECIPIENT in numerous states. A month pass with a number of new notifications on each FEDEX transaction. A few of the FEDEX transactions have been refunded into my account but those that have not BoA is now using the premise since the denied claims fell out of the 60 day grace period they could not refund it.

What now? Is that it? I know that I should have been checking my bank account statements monthly with a critical eye on each transaction. I suppose this is the end of the road and I was only refunded not even 1/3rd of the 4k lost. I have read a few posts similar to mine where others have said to get a lawyer for Small Claims but I don't have the money to do that. I'm not sure if I should write to FEDEX or call their customer service to see if I can make an argument for them to refund the rest of the money.",finance

personalfinance,Canada: Student loan repayment looking for advice,"Hi there   
Okay this may be a convuluted way to describe my confusion but Ill try to be straight forward.   
I have about 60,000 student loan debt. 32k with national student loans and 28k with provincial student loans. Im just about entering repayment phase soon and want to pay off one of those loans. the National loans has frozen interest on their repayment until next year. The provincial has a interest rate of 3.450% . I currently have a contract job and have saved up enough to pay off one of those loans.   


Just looking for advice as to if its better for me to 1) pay off the national loans in lumpsum and then the provincial loans ( 327.64  per month) and then claim the tax when i file them or 2) pay off the provincial loans so that I dont accrue any interest and then pay national (which has suspended interest) monthly for the next little while.

personalfinance,(Kind of a newbie) Should I find an advisor or keep going by myself?,"I originally posted this on the financialplanning sub but I was pointed here instead:

I'm thinking about finding an advisor for a one-time consultation but I'm not sure how much they cost or how to even go about finding a trustworthy one. From searching around this sub it seems like they can charge anything from a few hundred to a thousand dollars for a consultation, and while I'm ok parting with a few hundred bucks for a solid plan in place, I'm not sure if there's anything I can do alone before going that route?

For context, my goals are to:

1. Figure out how much money I'll need to retire (I'm currently in my late 20s)
2. Create an investment plan to meet that retirement $ amount
3. Understand if there's anything I'm doing wrong with my current set up that could be optimized (winning the lottery is not an option unfortunately)

I've been working for about 4 years and have paid off all of my student loans. I have a 401k through my job where I contribute 6% of my salary, to which my company matches 75%, as well as a roth IRA that I contribute $200 to per month, and the remainder of my salary goes into a savings account (as of writing, annual percentage yield is 0.4% and I have about 70k). I've recently moved to a high COL city, so my savings per month went from about $2300 a month to about $1500. I was originally going to raise my IRA contribution to $300 a month this year but due to the move, I thought I'd keep that in savings instead.

One of my biggest questions is around maximizing retirement accounts - should I be maxing either to their federal limits? I'm hesitant because I'd like to buy a house sometime in the next 10 years and ideally mortgage as little as possible - or am I shooting myself in the foot by not investing that money? Obviously no one has a crystal ball and we can't say whether interest rates will skyrocket by then or if the stock market will nosedive at the wrong time, which is all adding to my confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on me, I'm what some would call an ""IT Professional"" when I would just say I do my job and I do my job correctly. I've been working in the field for about 6 years and have professionally only worked for two different companies.

I started out as an entry-level engineer at a local mom and pop shop and have since worked my way into a Lead Engineer position at a Fortune 500 company. After 6 years of hard work and dedication and at the ripe ""old"" (*I feel 70)* age of 25 I currently make around $98,000 a year. I have two dependents, one tiny human and the other a stay at home partner.  This past year has been quite interesting with the company I currently work for. As with most jobs we went fully remote around March 2020 but I may be back into an office in a few months. Recently quite a bit of IT personnel has been let go in favor of outsourcing to various parts of the world (mostly India) and there have been things kept ""secret"" from the folks ""in the trenches"" until the last minute. The most notable one being the outsourcing, the personnel that was let go was only given a couple weeks notice when this has been planned for over 8 months and the process started 6 months ago (other projects/""initiatives"" and things going on involving the company they outsourced to were going on and when the announcement came out it all tied together). 

While I don't necessarily fear for my job today it's something that has been in the back of my mind ever since, when am I next? There's the feeling around ""the office"" that not only I have but others I work with have as well, that is we're just a body. Up until COVID, it was actually a really awesome culture, everyone got along and we got great work done while also having fun. Now, higher ups have zero problem saying in the middle of a call to somebody ""Well if you don't like it, there's the door"". At the end of the day obviously I know the companies goal is to make money but just feeling like another body, not feeling as appreciated and you really only ever hear from higher ups when something goes wrong, rarely ever when a project or something of the like was a success really sucks and I miss what used to be. When it comes to my workload, it's not horrible but it's not super light and great either. There are times where I work the normal 40 hours a week and others I'm close to 65-70.

So with all of that being said, I decided to browse the job market and see what was out there. I had an interview with a Fortune 20 company for a Principal Engineer (like a Lead Engineer) position and I honestly thought they didn't like me afterwards. They kept asking very basic knowledge questions for my field and I just had a feeling they thought that I was either bullshitting or not knowledgeable about the area. Either way, to my surprise I got a call this afternoon that they want to offer me the job. While I'm not entirely sure of what the workload would look like, I have a good idea given it's pretty much what I'm doing today but on a larger scale.

Below I have a comparison of the two.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

||Current Position|Offered Position|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Base Pay|$98,000|$120,000|
|Bonus Percentage|Up to 8%|Up to 15%|
|PTO|3 weeks + Federal Holidays|4 weeks + Federal Holidays|
|401k|3% match|4.5% match|
|Company HSA Contribution|$0|$1000|
|Base Medical Coverage|60/40|80/20|
|Base Dental Coverage|60/40|80/20|
|Fully Remote?|No, back in office soon|Yes, fully remote|

&amp;#x200B;

While typing that table out it's really helped me compare the two positions. As with moving to any new job it's learning the ins and outs, the people, the culture, etc. Also reading Glassdoor reviews on this other company I'd say they're around 60/40 in favor of employment. It's hard for me to find comparisons for the exact position/team I'd be on so I have to base mine off of other positions in IT. So my question to you is, obviously the financial compensation is nice but would it be worth moving to a new company? All of the things this past year aside, it's not horrible where I'm at and I quite enjoy my co-workers and some of the management team. I'm well respected and folks like me for the work that I produce. Where leaving I take a chance of things going sideways. On the other hand, for all I know this could be the greatest damn company I'll ever work for, granted I don't think they're super modern and they aren't ran by some Mark Zuckerberg type. I'm always up for new opportunity and I'm weighing the pros and the cons. Help me convince myself to take the job.",finance
stocks,A note to young investors (or new investors),"As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.

Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)

In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...

After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.

What have I learned?

Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  ""YOLOing"" your rent check is never a good idea.

Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at &gt;$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.

Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.

Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.

It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.

I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D

My other options are partial claim deferral or loan modification. Partial claim deferral places an interest free second lien on my house for the amount owed. Loan modification is exactly what it sounds like. It was explained as a possibility they would add the payments I missed back to the balance, extend the maturity date of my loan, and/or change my interest rate.

I’m concerned about our ability to make payments in the future, but selling it will leave us with the same or greater payment elsewhere, in a shittier house, or homeless.

If I took out a HELOC... God I feel dumb asking... Is that done after or during refinancing?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is more than a hedge to inflation. It will be the cause of inflation.,"What is the difference between BTC and all other hedges such as precious metals, stocks and real estate?

BTC hasn't been recognized as currency by the USA, but by function it serves the same purpose of fiat. It's the only hedge against fiat that you can use like fiat. If BTC is seen as a currency, it's been deflated. Deflated to the point that it now holds a 40,000:1 ratio to the dollar. When BTC buying power goes higher, it's essentially the same thing as deflated currency.

Why is this a threat to fiat and the cause of future inflation? 

In the future, wealth will come down to whoever had access to crypto in the early stages. This will cause a new wealth divide which will further exacerbate the situation.

The majority of fiat would of been converted to crypto and marketcap will be in the 100 trillion+. This will be due to the infinite deflation of BTC and infinite inflation of fiat. Why do I use the word infinite? Because it won't stop.

Also, Microstrategy will have so much power in the future that they will be purchasing countries or loaning out BTC as the Federal Reserve does with fiat, because they need to be bailed out of their country monetary inflation.

5. We are seeing some small pools retiring. We’ll obviously see more and more of this as time marches on. But, here’s a salute to the small pools that gave it a go! This SPO also brought us poolpeek.com which we have covered here before.

6. John O’Connor on CNBCAfrica! He gave a really good explanation of how Africa with it’s already very high adoption of mobile payment wallets can leapfrog the legacy payment systems currently in use in more developed countries. He also reiterated that Cardano will expand to five countries this year and 20 next year! [https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA](https://youtu.be/RET8hIQQLUA)

17. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit.

18. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

82. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base.

I read something about SD IRA to trade BTC without tax etc. The upside is pretty obvious. But I have a few questions if anyone can help me

2. What is the company bankrupt? Should My BTC be protected by federal insuuance just as other IRA?
3. Can I transfer the BTC to my cold wallet? As people say, not your key, not your coin, even though technically these won't be my BTC anyway (these are the Roth's BTC)

Bitcoin,Suppressing Bitcoin Price,"Apologies if this has been posted here before, but I would like to hear some opinions on what would happen when government agencies work in concert with regulatory agencies to suppress the price of Bitcoin.

The way that I see it is that the Fed can and does print dollars wholesale, but with Bitcoin looking like it will rival Gold and eventually the dollar, what can stop this printing machine and the private banks which encompass the Fed from keeping the Bitcoin price in check. Given that in the past that Central Banks have admitted to having this practice with Gold, I fully expect that the same will happen to Bitcoin.

We also know that the SEC will do nothing about naked short selling, so this is also a factor which could also contribute to this keeping that price in check.

So in essence, you have large private banks which have an unlimited printing capacity and/or naked short selling which could potentially stop the growth of Bitcoin and the potential adoption globally.

I could see this price suppression occur until a relevant CBDC is issued by any global Central Bank whether it be China, USA, etc.

What is everyones thoughts with this?

Edit - the basic premise of this post is the eventual rivalry that Bitcoin presents to Central Banks. If El Salvador is a success, others will eventually follow this method. I would argue that it is a matter of time in which this starts elsewhere. Perhaps not in the official capacity, but rather something that is quietly adopted as not to incur the wrath of the US.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Republican Campaign Committee Set to Accept Crypto Donations,"The Republicans' campaign arm is to begin accepting contributions in cryptocurrency, Axios reported today. But while it will now accept crypto, the committee will swiftly convert the funds received to fiat. 


While individual political candidates have accepted crypto donations in the past, according to Axios, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is the first federal party committee to do so in a move that could test campaign finance rules.


The NRCC is a group of GOP members of Congress that aims to elect Republican candidates to the United States to the House of Representatives. This is done by giving candidates financial aid, technical assistance, and other activities.


The NRCC will reportedly employ payment processor BitPay to process the donations, which will immediately be converted into dollars before being paid into the NRCC’s account. 


By not holding the donated cryptocurrency, the NRCC will now be able to accept donations up to $10,000 from individual donors and avoid the $100 maximum-value limit per year for cryptocurrency transfers.


""We are focused on pursuing every avenue possible to further our mission of stopping Nancy Pelosi’s socialist agenda and retaking the House majority, and this innovative technology will help provide Republicans the resources we need to succeed,” Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the NRCC chairman, stated.

Is the Payer's Federal Identification Number that's shown on the IRS letter the same as the TIN or FIN that Taxslayer is requesting ?

personalfinance,Used car financing: negotiating interest rate and extended warranty,"In case everyone is not aware, financing and extended warranties are huge profit centers for car dealerships. In some cases, they sell cars at cost or perhaps even below cost, and make all their money  on the financing and warranties.

I bought a car yesterday, a 2018 Volkswagen that originally came with a 6 year/72,000 mile bumper to bumper and 6 year/72,000 mile powertrain warranty. The car has about 33 months/47,000 miles worth of factory bumper to bumper and powertrain warranty left. I clearly did not need to purchase an extended warranty at this time.

However, as usual, the ""finance manager"" at the dealership was selling me hard on an extended warranty. He even went so far as to lie about the time on the factory warranty, even with the 6 year/72,000 mile numbers displayed clearly on his computer screen. I might be dumb, but I'm not stupid. I can read. I know how to use Google and how to call the Volkswagen USA warranty hotline to verify the remaining length of the  warranty. Then he started talking about getting me a better interest rate to offset the price of the warranty. 

Then a light went on in my head. 

I verified that the dealer's warranty is fully cancelable without penalty in the first 30 days (important!), and agreed to it. I went into the dealership with a loan pre-approval from my bank at 3.74% for 60 months. I walked out with a loan at 2.14% for 72 months, more than 42% savings off the pre-approval rate. And I plan to cancel the extended warranty.

There's no way to know for sure that I wouldn't have been able to negotiate the 2.14%/72 month financing without the warranty, but prior to me agreeing to the warranty, he was offering to match the 3.74% rate and extend the term to 72 months, so I'm pretty confident I made the right move and saved a bunch of cash.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Fiat is the worst investment.,"Disclaimer: This post has a lot of numbers...


So I was watching a video from Dave Ramsay the other day (like him or hate him, he has some funny content). A son was calling after finding $500,000 in cash that his 87 year old father had saved throughout his life and stashed around his house.

For starters, let's assume that the father put aside most of this money from age of 40 until he turned 70. We can assume that by 40 his life and career would have stabilized and he would most likely be prioritizing saving for his retirement until around the age of 70.


* 40's: In 1973 a dollar had the purchasing power of $5.86 today. Inflation led to a purchasing power of only $2.70 by 1982. Let's assume 30% of his savings occurred during this decade ($150k), and we will use the purchasing power in 1978 as a median for this decade ($3.99).

* 50's: In 1983 a dollar had the purchasing power of $2.61 today. Inflation led to a purchasing power of only $1.86 by 1992. Let's assume 40% of his savings occurred during this decade ($200k), and we will use the purchasing power in 1988 as a median for this decade ($2.20).

* 60's: In 1993 a dollar had the purchasing power of $1.80 today. Inflation led to a purchasing power of only $1.45 by 2002. Let's assume 30% of his savings occurred during this decade ($150k), and we will use the purchasing power in 1998 as a median for this decade ($1.60).


Totalling these figures, the father socked away $1,278,500.00 worth of purchasing power during his working life. Yet today all those savings are only worth $500,000.00 representing a loss of $778,500 (61%) in purchasing power.


Imagine if instead the father had invested that money and averaged even an 8% gain per year compounding over 3 decades.

Investing that $500k as $16,667/mo would have given him around $22,657,000.00 at the time of his retirement, a gain of 4400%, and an increase in purchasing power 1600% over the purchasing power he invested along the way ($1,278,500).


Would you rather stack fiat and watch your purchasing power fall off a cliff as the Fed prints more bills, or invest and watch your wealth grow? I know my preference...

stocks,Paysafe (PSFE) poised to beat analysts estimates,"TLDR : See summary at bottom

With PSFE’s daily short volume often in the 40-65% range, many believe the share price is being tactically pinned down as 13F filings have steadily revealed more institutions taking large positions. Joining noted fund managers David Tepper, Aaron Cohen, Dan Loeb and Leon Cooperman, Wells Fargo’s various funds have picked up 12 million shares and Blackstone has increased their holdings by an additional 37 million shares.

Some have calculated that share lockup rules have reduced the true available float to as little as 80-85 million shares, causing the most recently reported short interest of 36 millions shares to have an outsized effect.  But shorts must be covered eventually.  A common theory, given the regular 700K-2M block trades we’ve seen, is that aggressive shorting enables large funds to accumulate before Q2 ER (which should beat estimates) and before PSFE is added to the Russell 3000 Index next month. Goldman Sachs also anticipates Paysafe’s Russell 1000 inclusion which, in light of their projected $100+ billion in market share, would likely be followed by other benchmark funds and ETFs, carving out yet even more of the available float.

Along with now priced-in fears of PE lockup expiration (more on that below), it’s clear that PSFE’s share price has also suffered from the Q1 report of YoY 5% quarterly revenue growth which, no doubt, disappointed the short-term expectations of many impatient traders invited in by constant Cramer and Steve Grasso pumps.  It's understandable that, over the last few months, PSFE has reportedly experienced a large demographic shift away from younger shareholders, indicating a transition to a steadier long-term investor base.

But that 5% number may have been misleading to some who didn’t bother to look under the hood.  Paysafe not only upgraded the low end of their 2021 revenue guidance to $1.53 billion, they beat analysts’ average estimate and they also noted that revenue growth would have been “mid to high teens” were it not for their strategic “market/channel exit to improve overall risk/reward profile.”  This was not a surprise as they explained: “adjusting for the actions we have discussed in our Analyst Day and continued risk reward optimization in our business model, our revenue growth would have been in the mid to high teens.” Based on valuation comps, such a growth rate would easily support a share price double the current level.

Paysafe’s quarterly revenue, gross profit and EBITDA numbers all came in at the upper range of their guidance along with a 63% gain in eCash revenue and 29% gain in free cash flow to over $108 million for Q1 alone.  On the day of their earnings report, initial headlines were favorable: “Paysafe beats on revenue, Reaffirms 2021 outlook” only to be suddenly overtaken by articles almost uniformly focused on the negative, offering oddly biased summaries like: “Sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $110M-$120M, which means it could fall below the Q1 level of $113.2M.”  (Obviously, given that range, it could just as well, if not more likely, rise above that number.)

Several outlets focused on an EPS miss of $0.02 despite the fact that Paysafe did not offer any EPS estimate to miss.  Even now, many platforms continue to wildly misreport their financial data.  For example, Yahoo Finance falsely reports a much more dramatic $0.37 miss, something that would naturally deter potential investors at first glance.

Intentional or not, analysts’ EPS estimates overlooked previously signaled temporary quarterly expenses associated with paying down $1.16 billion in debt and the transaction that took Paysafe public.  The company noted: “Results included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""

Take away these one-time non-recurring expenses which amount to roughly $90 million and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly earnings thereby significantly beating all analyst estimates.

Thanks to an improved credit rating, the company announced a refinancing of roughly a billion in debt at a 1.25%+ lower interest rate.  In all, their recent debt management measures will save them an estimated $92 million in annual operating costs.  Global Capital reports that their loan offers an additional 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, something they told analysts they intend to activate quickly.

Taken together, all of this will greatly enhance EBITDA and free cash flow (already $362 million in 2020) enabling them to better pursue their “active M&amp;A pipeline.”

Unless the company chooses, for strategic tax purposes, to write off some discretionary impairment expense on intangibles, they should soundly beat the current analysts’ average EPS estimate of $0.00 for Q2 and $0.02 for 2021.  Those analysts have a median price target $17.67, so consistently beating their estimates over the next three quarters will likely lead to price target upgrades (and new price catalysts along the way).

&amp;#x200B;

Note on Private Equity lockup expiration:

Blackstone bought an additional 37 million shares of Paysafe beyond their original 123 million shares.  Redditor kiedennis noted that these additional shares would theoretically secure a 50.159% controlling interest for insiders, which some think could be part of ensuring Paysafe’s M&amp;A strategy going forward.  At the very least, it protects the company from hostile takeover.  Notably, such a large purchase on top of the initial merger deal should allay fears that they’d want to sell when lockup expires in the coming weeks.  At this point it’s evident that such fears are priced in but some are still concerned so here are some further notes on the subject:

Back in 2017, Reuters reported Blackstone/CVC initially pursued Paysafe making five separate bids to take it private, increasing their bid 32% before Paysafe finally agreed. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed, Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private for $3.9 Billion. (Around $4.2 Billion in today’s dollars)

An inside source close to those negotiations said, “There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents’ age,” adding that the private equity firms “have a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.”

Blackstone’s website says its typical investment term is “upwards of 7-10 years” which dovetails with the “decade-long thesis” noted above.

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Recently Paysafe has gone public through reverse merger, paid down $1.2 billion in debt and Blackstone/CVC received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.  Adjusted for inflation, that’s only a 33% gain on a 4 year hold which tells me they’d want to stay on and benefit from Foley’s M&amp;A playbook which has steadily proven to generate 300-800% growth in as little as 5 years (This falls nicely within Blackstone’s remaining time horizon). As part of the deal, Paysafe’s 20F filing confirms that Blackstone rolled $1.23 billion into Paysafe, keeping 123 million shares. Foley says, this is part of what “created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

More recently, Blackstone’s 13F shows they now own 160 million shares indicating that they acquired an additional 37 million shares outside of the deal structure. That’s $436 million more at the current share price. As insiders on the Board of Directors, they wouldn’t take on that level of additional exposure if they didn’t see serious value here. Dan Loeb (Third Point)’s 13F indicates they also picked up more shares beyond their original PIPE investment. For the above reasons, along with the depressed share price, I highly doubt private equity would be seeking a near-term exit.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR summary:

Paysafe has put itself in a great position to beat analyst EPS estimates for Q2, Q3, Q4 and 2021 overall, leading to raised price targets and  positive price action catalysts.

Q1's one-time $90 million in expenses showed Paysafe is already poised for significant profit growth.  Recent  debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures even higher  profits going forward.

The picture gets  brighter with the introduction of fast growing revenue streams from the  US iGaming market, especially in Q3 and 4.

Fears of private  equity lockup expiry fully priced in at this point, but such fears are  unwarranted at these low levels, especially considering Blackstone’s  acquisition of another 37 million shares.

But  here's a question: Has anyone thought about cash conversion of PSFE's  outstanding warrants bringing the company as much as $600 million? The  last SEC filing says there are as many as 53.9 million warrants that  could bring the company $11.50 each upon redemption.  This would more  than double their EBITDA and go a long way towards deleveraging and/or  funding their ""active M&amp;A pipeline.""

Such a huge cash infusion gives them meaningful incentive to eventually  promote the stock price to well above $18, a 60%+ gain from current  levels.

There’s a strategy here and Foley has repeatedly shown he knows exactly how to play his  cards. Like most good things, it takes time.",finance

MachineLearning,[R] MLP Singer: Towards Rapid Parallel Korean Singing Voice Synthesis,"Hey r/MachineLearning,

I'm excited to introduce ""MLP Singer: Towards Rapid Parallel Korean Singing Voice Synthesis."" It's K-POP singer in the making (a baby step forward in that direction).


Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07886 \
Demo: https://mlpsinger.github.io \
Code: https://github.com/neosapience/mlp-singer 


**Motivation** \
Many singing voice synthesis (SVS) models use an autoregressive design in which acoustic features produced from the previous time step are fed into the model to generate the next set of mel-spectrogram frames. While AR models have their advantages, they are prone to exposure bias and can be time-consuming to train and sample. 

**Solution** \
We were inspired by [MLP-Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601), an architecture exclusively composed of multi-layer perceptrons introduced in the CV literature for efficient image classification. We experimented with the model and found that MLP-Mixer can also be used in a generative context in the audio domain. Since the Mixer block works with transposed latent features, it gains a receptive field equal to the size of the input chunk. This can be helpful for generating context-aware representations. 

**Advantages** \
MLP Singer is a non-autoregressive, parallel SVS model. Hence, its generation time is much faster than conventional AR SVS systems. We found that the inference latency of MLP Singer on a CPU is comparable to that of an AR model on GPU. MLP Singer achieved a real-time factor of around 3400 on an NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPU.

**Limitations &amp; Remedies** \
Since MLP Singer is a parallel model that generates mel-spectrograms in chunks, audible artifacts can be produced when generated chunks are sequentially put together. To mitigate this issue, we employ an overlapped batch segmentation method that gives the model more frames to look at near frame edges. Detailed explanations and experiment results can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07886).

I'm a pretty new investor, started this year, and I've had a pretty good run. I started out just buying shares but discovered option trading and have been swing trading options for the last couple of months, mostly options on big EU indexes.

This morning however, there were technical difficulties on the EU markets which caused option trading to be halted. I was holding on to put contracts because I knew that EU markets would react to the FED's talk on interest rates. I was right, markets dipped and my contracts became profitable. However, because of these technical difficulties I couldn't sell my position. When the problems were resolved 4 hours later, my puts were in the red. I had to sell them for quite a big loss, instead of just being able to cash out my profit, which was also rather substantial. 

I was wondering if anybody here knows if there is any legal requirement that forces either brokers or the organisation that handles the EU markets to compensate people who have lost money because of this. I've tried getting answers from my broker and from the Euronext stock exchange but they refuse to give me a definitive answer and tell me to file a complaint. I have no faith that this will actually do anything, so I was wondering if there are any laws or procedures for these kinds of cases. This is about a lot of money, certainly for someone of my age.

I see two easy ways to free up $1000 a month: 

Option 1: Do a cash out refinance of our house to pay off our non-mortgage debt. This would eliminate that monthly bill. We could refinance to a slightly lower rate and keep the same monthly payment, but it would add a few years to our mortgage. Basically, we'd be paying off the debt 25 years from now instead of over the next five years. 

Option 2: Stop contributing to IRAs
We both have healthy company matches for 401ks, so we'd still be saving for retirement, we'd just skip IRAs for a few years. 

Any thoughts on which route is better? Anything else I should think about?

EDIT: Our car and student loans have very low interest rates, they are all below 3.5%, total loan balance is $35k. New mortgage would be 2.75%

EDIT 2: We don't have any credit cards debt. We spend about $2000 a month on groceries, gas, eating out, home improvements, etc. We charge it on a credit card and pay it off every month.",finance

I can invest 50% of my 401k in whatever ETF/Mutual fund I want (Fidelity Brokeragelink).

I'm happy if half my account basically just treads water in inflation adjusted dollars. I can retire at 60 if that happens.

Interest rate risk has me scared to put my money in bonds. My idea is 50/50 TIP and PFFV (adjustable rate preffered ETF). My thinking is if the fed sits on their hands and doesn't touch rates inflation is likely going to really get bad. Thats the 50% tips part. The other half is in PFFV in case they do get moving on rates, that ETF should do OK.

The other 50% will stay in the S&amp;P 500.

stocks,"Exxon, Suncor, Devon today.","I make posts here about oil relatively frequently at this point. Todays price action on crude is something I expected after the fed meeting. A stronger US dollar does not help oil, but I think for the long run, the oil thesis is still very much in tact and today may be a good opportunity to average up, or buy calls for good companies.

All 3 of my oil holdings are taking big losses today, as well as my options. I took the opportunity to buy more shares of Exxon. I have not bought more suncor or Devon because I believe that I may be able to get them cheaper at some point, and I'm also happy with my overall positions and cb so far. I did also buy farther dated calls for Exxon, and I did them at a higher strike($70 1/22.) I still hold $60-65 7/16 strike calls. 

I think this is oversold and I believe this is worth holding. Most people have been in oil for a while, and I have gotten in relatively late (Feb) I still think this is going to play out well for people long oil. WTI is creeping up mid day. We also had a fantastic day for oil on Tuesday, with prices gapping up significantly. I think this is normal commodity volatility and is NOT worth panicking about. 

These companies are not at precovid highs despite the financial situation they are in. I would suggest waiting for earnings to reassure that the higher oil prices are going to mean fantastic cash flows for Exxon (and others.) The price of crude, even if it stays at current levels, will make the company be able to comfortably afford a dividend hike, which will make the shares more valuable.

I brought up the stronger dollar, and that is what I feel is really hitting the energy sector today. Commodities all around are taking a hit, this is not just oil getting hit. Inflation is very real still as well, and inflation is great for oil. I think the shakeup today is probably people taking profits (understandably so,) and repositioning. 

Commodity volatility should be expected. I have not seen it this squirrelly in a while though, but I expect that even though the graphs may look a bit fishy, this will continue playing out the way oil longs think. Best of luck to you all, stay safe out there, the market is definitely a bit strange these days.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How I accidentally created a &lt;$100k market cap coin,"**Sorry if this is not allowed, I will attempt to keep the name out of this as much as possible to attempt to show this is not a shill but my crazy experience over the last few days and how it changed my viewpoint on crypto. If you are interested in making your token, or just how the under belly of crypto works, then this is for you.**

This is a legitimate, crazy story that has changed my mind on crypto and taught me a lot about the trappings of small cryptos on the DEFI scene, specifically Harmony One's network. This is a long story.

**Where this adventure started**

Strange beginnings for a crypto, but I wanted to know how markets worked, how easy it is to manipulate a price, see how much buys and sells effect crypto. Now I am not rich by any means and didn't want to destroy someone else's project, whether it deserves it or not. So I went looking for a cheap way to build a token and deploy it onto a smart network. I first went to Harmony as it is a project I am really excited for (although this experience may not sound like a glowing reference to Harmony at points, I genuinely still believe Harmony will be a top coin in the future). 

Luckily for me, a token generator exists on the Harmony network (it is called tokenjenny, in no way affiliated). I genuinely do not remember how I found it, but it is likely due to the fact it has a tournament with Viper (what I believe will be the number 1 DEX on Harmony, but I have a small bag so I may be biased). I created a simple token based on what I would want out of a small token, a small hard cap on tokens to, no burns, no sale tax, no airdrops. Just a small token which value held itself against itself without using fancy gimmicks. This was also the best way to change prices.

After a few clicks and a wallet connect, I had all 1 million of my token in my wallet. Ridiculously easy and fee less I believe, with the only cost being the cost of sending the coins to my wallet on Harmony. And there you have it, I own a crypto.

**The self market manipulation**

In the beginning I did not have a clue what I was doing, if I am honest. I thought I did, but once you hold it in your hands and you are responsible, trust me it is different. I immediately dropped 8 ONE (about 50c at the time) against 750k of my tokens into liquidity on Viperswap and I had a live token. From there I proceeded to trade the coin in small amounts until the market cap had gone up to around $20 (this is a guess, it could have been less). I sold some more, then bought back and carried on watching how a big buy vs a small buy sent the price to different levels. And how the DEX actively worked against you buying all the liquidity at once with price impacts. This made it clear to me that this actually works. If people trade it, it will go up. This is obvious, but having full control of the market cap of your coin is again a different feeling. It felt strangely powerful and I wanted to know more.

**The dumb luck**

So I knew the only way to know more was to join a pump and dump group. I arrived at a newly started one on Telegram aimed specifically at Harmony projects. At this point the coin was still a self experiment and I introduced myself to the group awkwardly (I am a very awkward person) and started asking questions. The group were nice and quickly I learnt that I needed to burn my tokens so people trusted me. They even taught me how to do this (twist regarding this later). I decided to go for it. They were complaining about a coin that had just rugged and the owner had too much tokens, so I stacked another 200k of my token into liquidity and sent it to a burner address.

**The social experiment**

So, I decided to explain myself to the chat. My coin was an experiment to me and I decided to be honest about that. That and the fact someone could easily buy the whole supply, I said the truth, I am testing your greed as if you buy too much then you will destroy the token. I thought this would lead to someone going FU and just buying it and me being completely out of all my money, which I was ok with, my experiment would then be complete.

**What actually happened**

People bought little bits, the price rose. It started under 0.00001c which was the lowest value possible on the analytics. After a few hours it had reached 0.00001c. No more &gt; sign. Nice. I thought that would be the end. People were saying how much they liked how I put things, how I encourage selling. I woke up the next morning to it being 0.001c. I realised at this point I was in control of peoples money in a way and therefore I had to be responsible with that. I would hate to be why people lost money down to my experiment.

**Putting the work in**

I opened up a telegram and added people. The prices at certain points gets hazy at this time because it was all so surreal and a major whirlwind. They asked the obvious question, what now? What now indeed. I did not want a pump and dump, I couldn't do that to people. Don't get me wrong at some point I will sell some, but for now I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose people money. I set a price target of 1 token = $1, if not 1 token = 1 One thinking it would be unreachable. The price hit 0.01c. I promised to make a website. I looked into ways to add value. With a coin that does nothing the only value it has is the value that people put to it, so I went looking for ways to add value. It became pretty clear to me that the best use case for the token was to use it in liquidity pools. But how do you get one of those when your coin is still under $1k? I joined the token jenny tournament. A tournament where the 1st placed prize would get you an incentivised pool and a nice cash reward. The price hit 1c. I made a website and set up a tournament to create the logo, paying in my token. The website was to be revealed after the tournament. The price hit 6c. My token had a market cap of $60k in the space of a week from creation. 8 One had turned into a value of 1 million One in the space of a week. It rose to 8c.

**The dump**

I woke up the next morning and the price was 4c. Ouch. My worst fears had happened. It had battled against it but that was it, the end. Or so I thought. People asked what happened and to get people interested I went shilling. Not to pump and dump, but to get new customers. Not all the dump was people selling all, they were just taking profits, good. I had said from the beginning, you sell when you need to, no one knows your story and what that amount of money will do to you. People liked my response. It battled to 10c but dropped again.

**The copycat**

Someone released a coin called 1 billion. It was a reference to my name and advertised it as homage. It was a memecoin standard, where there were burns, tax and no proof of liquidity burn. I found it a compliment. People were annoyed that I didn't get annoyed, but I genuinely thought it would be good for my coin.

**100k Market cap**

This weekend was meant to be my wedding anniversary and nephews 1st birthday. I spent all weekend keeping people active. Growing bonds with people and advertising the competition. The competition happened and the response was immense. Immediately I added the winning logo to the website and shared the site. I expected to wake up back at 1c with the hype dying and having to talk down people wanting free crypto. I had made the mistake of paying people who did not win too as I liked their submission. Big mistake. 

I woke up with the price at 9c. As soon as I was active again it was at 14c.

**Jealousy/FUD**

So I had started noticing that certain people were saying not so nice things about my token and me. The main one being the rug pull. Easy to get rid of with proof of liquidity sent to dead address. This did not stop it. Then it was that I will print more. I showed the contract, hard cap 1 million tokens. They created a telegram group to do group research into new tokens. Fine by me, it is needed. 1st post, my token is on their watch list. I lost my rag. I didn't understand what their problem was. I should have stayed out of it, but it was other people's money in my hands. It felt personal. I managed to bat back every FUD except the fact there could be whales, I couldn't argue that, there were 2 or 3. It was inevitable. 

Then I went onto viperswap tradeable coins on Coingecko and realised my coin was the only Harmony coin with a green trust score. They soon gave up. They were the creators behind 1 Billion or in the circle. 1 Billion got rug pulled. I came out shining. The price stayed stable.

**The tournament**

We flew into second place and have stayed there since. The leading coin is probably out of reach, and they know the tournament creator and viper devs. It feels like they were meant to win. I hope I am wrong.

**The hype dies down**

So this is now getting to present day. Big buyers become smaller sellers, but still selling. We sit at a still very respectable 6 to 7c. I have plans, and will soon start approaching other DEX's for liquidity pools as I now fully understand our value in a pool. Being none deflationary nor inflationary, our value would hold a coin up very nicely. I have to learn social media marketing too, but I will get this coin on a DEX and in a pool. I have to.

**What I learnt and how it changed my view on crypto**

I genuinely thought that it would get bought immediately and I would be dumped off. I was genuinely ok with that. But I learnt that people just want a chance at a better life and crypto gives them hope. Some make it. Some don't. 1 Billion pumped and rugged so hard I had people apologising to me that they had to sell mine to cover losses there. I always said I understood and I did to a certain degree, at least enough to know it wasn't an act against my token.

The DEX market is really a shit show beneath the hood. Dodgy analytics that lose connection making people think you have rugged (I have been told this is down to Harmony One issues at the moment, which I am inclined to believe). People trying to scam as many people as possible. Harmony was a nice place, but as more comes along the more it becomes like any other. Copies of copies popping up everywhere. It is good, but I wish I could get the message out to everyone, do not dip into it with money you can't afford to lose, even money you don't want to lose. You will lose 9 out of 10 times. There are geniuses in the early days, but they are heavily outnumbered by scammers. It is a shame, but it is inevitable with full decentralisation.

Token value is set by greed rather than worth. A coin with green candles will outsell a coin with red candle any day of the week. People forget the saying sell when there is greed and buy when there is fear so quickly due to FOMO. It is terrifying and something I am going to start drilling into my kids ASAP.

Analytics are easily scuffed, especially at low level crypto. I learnt this myself but also watching other coins in the tournament. Do not fall for green candles, please.

Honesty can win, I was honest from the beginning, I will stay honest. Our little success is testament to this. It pushes me and the community to put more work in and make a genuine project. I know we will get there.

Being responsible for peoples money is scary. Never will I ever trust anyone again who outright fully enjoys this. I thought it would be fun making money for people, but genuinely it has been terrifying, dizzying and has caused so much anxiety. This is why I have to make this work going forward.

Thank you for reading this far down and not deleting it if it doesn't get deleted, I thought I would just tell my story, a story I will never forget no matter what. I couldn't it has changed me.",cryptocurrency

this is not scientific, I am not an economist, this is purely bored me fiddling around with past numbers and projecting them forward, but the results surprised me.  So I figured it was worth a post.  
\*end disclaimer\*  


TLDR my Results:  


https://preview.redd.it/1h73qoauiv571.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fcd0f9c19d8454553503260fdb079ffdc64c992

The Percent lines refer to annualized average rates of interest paid on outstanding debt.  


as you see in around 30 years time We will hit a point of insolvency where 100% of taxes raised will have to go to meet interest paid, Realistically insolvency will occur before this point as the real budgetary spending gets pressed under the increasing interest load.  


Methodology:  
 I found a chart of federal debt Increases by year as a percentage of that years GDP for the last 50 years. Source:  
[https://www.macrotrends.net/2496/national-debt-growth-by-year](https://www.macrotrends.net/2496/national-debt-growth-by-year)  


I averaged the last 50 years growth of debt and came up with 8.8002 %  


I found a chart of US GDP growth as  a percentage increase of the previous years GDP.  
source:  
[https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/gdp-growth-rate](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/gdp-growth-rate)  


I  averaged the last 50 years GDP growth and came up with:  


3.0346 % growth per year  


Next I found a chart that showed percentage of GDP received as Federal tax revenue. 

source:  
[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S)  


I averaged 50 years of data and came up with 16.9787 % of GDP received annually as tax revenue  
(a remarkably constant value actually I expected much more fluctuation)

the only remaining variable being the interest rate due on outstanding Debts. This is actually apparently very difficult to determine, as Interest on outstanding government debt depends entirely on the interest rate at the time of issuance and how much debt was issued at that rate, Because of this instead of trying to retro fit data I declared 3 annualized percentages of 1, 2, and 3  


Then I projected forward GDP growth and debt growth keeping constant the percentages until Interest due on debt intercepted taxes receivable.  


Conclusion:  
this is not scientific, does not account for inflation, and should not be used as such, however, It does give food for thought that within the next 3 decades a potential crisis is looming, should we be unable to buck the last 50 years averages (which seems unlikely in my mind) Whether this will result in a sovereign default, Or a partial writing off of debts, or Money printing to erode the value of debt, remains to be determined.  


One interesting finding is the timeline of this is VERY dependent on the annualized average interest rate of debt outstanding, leading me to believe the Fed will be hesitant to raise interest rates anytime soon, or for prolonged time periods. Which would seem to lead to a prolonged period of inflation",finance

CryptoMarkets,"I got another one for you guys - I coded a tool to help you find a profitable trading strategy using backtesting on historical data, as always it's open source","So you guys may have seen some of my previous posts, where I shared several open sourced crypto trading algorithms that I coded. Many of you asked if they have been backtested and how that would work.

So I created this quick tool to help you assess the profitablity of your trading strategy of trading bot if you're using one.

Backtesting is a way of feeding your current trading strategy to a script that applies it on historical data, in order to determine how successful it could be in the future.

Past performance does not always guarantee future returns, but it's good practice to test your strategy (or trading algorithm) before you go ham.

The script downloads historical data for a coin of your choice, and at an interval of your choosing. This is then used by the script to determine how profitable a strategy can be, and whether it has the potential to beat a buy and hold.

At the end of the testing phase, the tool will generate a plot showing each trade and final balance.

Working with historical data since the start of this year, I fed it a simple strategy - buy if the price is up 1% in the last minute. Sell at 10% gain or 5% loss - but you can customise these parameters yourself. This strategy made a marginal loss on ICPUSDT, but then this is probably not the best coin to test on since it's been in decline ever since it was listed on Binance.

Here's the same strategy on NANOUSDT, seems like we're $800 in profit.

CryptoCurrency,Do you remember when Bitcoin was the only thing that came to mind when you heard the word “Cryptocurrency”?,"Have you ever tried explaining cryptocurrency to someone or been asked questions or been met with skepticism when you mention your love affair with crypto? This space is still relatively young and most people think of Bitcoin, or more recently, Doge or Memes  when they think of cryptocurrency and they don’t understand the huge impact cryptocurrency could have on the financial system in regards to regular people controlling their own money. 

Education is the key to adoption and concepts like blockchain, mining and staking are not always easy to explain. Knowing how to answer questions and explain certain concepts in an easy to understand way is a good idea if you wave to tell someone about crypto and and argue against the myths that surround this space. I’m not advising that you try to talk someone into investing, that’s their decision, but we should try to explain that’s it’s more than just magic internet money, it’s an actual revolution in technology and money. 
___

What’s one of the first questions you hear when you start taking about cryptocurrency? What is it? Here’s how I would explain it in an easy to understand way for people that have no experience with crypto. 

Cryptocurrency is just like the money in your wallet (fiat) except it’s digital. Cryptocurrency can be divided into smaller parts like fiat and can be stored in other places. Fiat has a serial number and you have an account number at your bank. When you deposit money, your bank and a central bank know the serial number of your money, where it’s at and who owns the money and the account. You can store your cryptocurrency in a digital wallet similarly to how you store your fiat in a bank account. The difference is that your crypto wallet is not attached to your identity, there’s no central authority that knows where your money is. There’s no one to shut down your wallet or block your transactions. Conversely, if you lose your seed phrase or lose control of your wallet, there’s no one to call for help. It’s your responsibility. You are in control of your money. 

Instead of using banks and governments to keep track of the supply and process transactions, crypto is processed and stored across all of the computers in its network. Earning crypto from fees is an incentive for more computers to join the network. This increases security and means there is no single point of failure. 

NOTE: Decentralization is the backbone of cryptocurrency and a bank or government issued fiat is as centralized as it gets, so be wary of any bank issued cryptocurrency, this is not ideal for decentralization. 

___

There are still many people that only associate Bitcoin with cryptocurrency. I’m not minimizing Bitcoin but that’s what comes to mind for most people before they really understand decentralized finance. Let’s explore some ways to explain that there’s more than Bitcoin. 

There are thousands of different cryptos just like there are many types of fiat. The Dollar, Euro, Yen, Franc and many more. All forms of cryptocurrency are different and some aren’t even designed to be used as currency for everyday transactions. Broadly speaking there are two types of cryptocurrency, coins and tokens. 

Coins belong to a network that was built from the ground up. It takes a lot of time, skill and money to build a network from scratch. Coins are how payment is made to those processing transactions on the network. Bitcoin is a coin, it’s network was built from the ground up. There are actually only a few dozen coins because of the extreme difficulty involved in creating a new network. The thousands of remaining cryptocurrencys are tokens. 

Tokens are relatively easy to make and are built on top of an existing network. An NFT is an example of a token. An NFT, or non fungible token, is a digital proof of ownership. They are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what can be achieved with tokens. Another example is USDC, issued by Circle, is a token that is fully backed by US Dollars. You acquire USDC by exchanging your Dollars and you can redeem USDC for Dollars. Paxos issues a token called PaxG. Each token is backed by one Troy ounce of gold that is kept in a vault in London. You can redeem your PaxG for gold or dollars. USDC and PaxG are fully regulated and audited. The downside of tokens being so easy to create is the prevalence of scams. 

___

Are they safe? This is likely a question you’ll be asked and it’s a concern for many people. The news is full of stories of hacks, criminals, money laundering and layer upon layer of fud that’s almost always taken out of the context. Here’s my explanation. 

Not all cryptocurrencys are created equal. Some prioritize speed over security and the consequences usually play out sooner rather than later. There are always hackers and scammers looking to target crypto. This same thing happens to banks and corporations on a daily basis. When hackers succeed, security gets beefed up. The cryptos that have been around for a while are battle tested and proven due to always being under attack. Cryptocurrency is made up of computers around the world that are constantly double checking transactions and account balances. If you wanted to corrupt the network you would have to hack more than half of the computers connected to the network at the same time. That becomes basically impossible with a crypto like Bitcoin that uses millions of computers spread out all over the world. Some cryptos have fewer computers connected to a network and are more vulnerable to attack. Exchanges are much easier to hack than a wallet which is very secure. That’s why keeping your crypto in your own wallet is never a bad idea. 

The real risk with crypto is investing without a plan or investing more than you can lose. Crypto can drop 50% in a day. Only invest what you are willing to lose, this is still highly volatile asset class. 
 
___

Why are they so volatile or what gives them any value to begin with? I like to answer this with my own question. What gives the money in your wallet or your bank account any value? The US Dollar was once backed by gold, that changed and now the US Dollar, along with all government issued currency, continue to lose value. The only thing that backs fiat is the people’s trust in the government and that trust has been eroding for decades. Also, governments actively printing huge amounts of fiat, for a number of reasons, arguably to benefit themselves and the corporations that fund them at the expense of the average person, causes record levels of inflation and incentivizes spending over saving. That leads to over consumption and environmental issues that governments claim they want to stop. 

Cryptocurrencys are valuable because of what they do and what they represent. Obviously this differs from crypto to crypto. Currently, Bitcoin has value because it has an economic profile similar to gold. Bitcoin has a limited supply and only a small amount is created each day. Every four years that amount gets cut in half. If demand stays the same then this would lead to a doubling of the price every four years. However, demand has been increasing over time as more people realize how weak regular currency is and the current pandemic has raised awareness. Many investors see Bitcoin as a safe place to park capital outside of traditional investments for long time periods. 

Some cryptos have value due to the utility they provide. The Ethereum network is used to create tokens like we discussed earlier. Along with tokens, Ethereum can be used to create decentralized apps and websites that can’t be censored or shut down. All transactions on these require Ether to pay fees, this causes the demand to rise as the network gains adoption and Ethereum has serious adoption. Visa is testing payments using USDC and the European Central Bank issued bonds on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The biggest reason the prices fluctuate so much is that no one knows what these technologies are actually worth. Stocks, gold and regular currency fluctuate every day as well but crypto is so much more volatile because the technology is revolutionary. 

___

Decentralized finance makes it possible to lend, borrow, and save without an identity, credit score, or a bank. They make it possible to do business without a middle man taking a cut which could eventually make some tech giants obsolete. Crypto makes it possible for a community to pool funds and vote on how their funds should be spent which could theoretically make government issued fiat and even traditional banks obsolete. This incredible potential and volatility make many people very emotional. The slightest possibility of a crypto clamp down can crash the market and a positive rumor can lead to a massive pump. In the long term it’s easy to see that crypto is growing and it’s unlikely to stop anytime soon.

One of my favorite phrases I hear people say: I can’t hold it in my hand. It’s not real. This is where I explain hardware, or cold wallets. You can store a seed phrase on your hardware wallet that secures your crypto. Only the 24 word seed phrase that you have can access your crypto. It’s completely off the internet and in your control. You can hold that hardware wallet in your hand, put it in your pocket, clip it on a keychain or put it in a safety deposit box. Besides, most of the fiat we use is never physically in our procession either. When you get your check deposited in your bank, then pay a bill online or use a card at a store, your fiat is electronically moved. 

___

Now after convincing someone that crypto is actually legit, has value, and is here to stay, you may get asked which one should I buy? 

Before you answer this question make sure to tell them to do more research and make their own decisions according to their financial situation. Even if you’re legally covered, telling someone to invest in something that goes bust can still lead to some bad feelings. Tell them to consider their timeline and risk tolerance. Cryptos timeline seems to follow a four year cycle and the likelihood of anyone selling at the top is slim to none. Fun fact: buying and holding will give you about the same, or better, return as actively trading. There’s nothing wrong with taking profits and taking some risk off the table and realizing some gains but actively trying to time the market almost always leads to failure. 

There are varying degrees of risk in crypto. The easiest way to measure risk vs reward is to look at the market cap. This is extremely important because the price of an individual token/coin can be misleading. Market cap is calculated by the current value multiplied by the circulating supply. 

The circulating supply varies from crypto to crypto. For example, Cardano is currently around $1.47 but has a market cap of around $47 billion because there’s a supply of 32 billion ADA. Yearn Finance has a price ($37,000) that’s close to and sometimes even higher than Bitcoin, but Yearns market cap is 30 times lower than Cardano. Yearn only has a circulating supply of 36,000. It would take much less volume to push the price of Yearn up or down that it would Bitcoin or Cardano. As a rule of thumb, the smaller the market cap of a crypto relative to Bitcoin, the more room it has to grow and the more volatile it can be. The further you move down the market cap rank, the higher risk you take because it takes less capital to push down the price. 

___




In my opinion, these are all good places to start when explaining cryptocurrency to new people. These are great discussions to get new adopters interested and on the right track to exploring more and doing their own research. FUD is mainstream and we need to be the ambassadors for crypto. Please let me know if you see any mistakes here or anything I could add.

I finally have a job where I will be making *decent* money.

I guess my question is what is the best way to tackle this debt? My private loan payment will be $600 monthly it has a variable interest rate currently at 10% which I know is horrid. My other bills roughly add up to $1500 month. If I don’t work overtime I can make about $4000/month but I’m planning to work as much overtime as I can.",finance

economy,Sustainability of insane real estate appreciation vs. general economy?,"Below is a rather average ""starter"" home in an average (Phoenix) suburb (one of 500 in this 25-year-old tract subdivision), but is typical of many American cities (not all, but in quite a few markets right now). Its (estimated) value has skyrocketed 20% in just 6 months and 350% in 10 years. This is supported by comps. Over the same period, inflation and wage growth was roughly 20%.

In many markets, buyers are okay paying tens of thousands *over* appraised value to get an accepted offer because they know they'll be even in 2 months. People are buying homes like coins and stocks and just sitting on them, vacant, for months, then selling for insane profit. It seems to have fostered speculation.

***Is this sustainable?*** How will that imbalance in the economy be corrected? Or *can* it? How can home prices not fall if supply ramps up and/or interest rates go up (two things that are almost certain a year from now)? And wouldn't that be seen as a bubble in retrospect? Is this a crisis in brewing or is it economically sound and justified? Most people didn't see 2008 coming, but even the most powerful economists seem to be quiet and mostly content.

How do you see things playing out in 3-5 years?

personalfinance,Almost always periodically re-finance a mortgage?,"Am I missing something here?

So I completely agree that if you can do math and are financially disciplined, paying off a 2% - 4.5% mortgage early is a poor financial decision if you can get a 7% - 12% (for example) return on the money you would have paid it off quicker with.

What I don’t hear is the following, even though it makes even more sense to me:  Not only should you not pay your mortgage down faster (assuming you are disciplined and even moderately savvy with investing), but you should DELAY your mortgage with re-financing, sometimes even if that means taking a HIGHER interest rate.  For example, your mortgage is 3% and you have 15 years left, but can re-finance to 3.75% over 30 years,cut your monthly payment significantly, and invest all that extra money at a much greater return and let inflation eat away at the low interest debt.  

One can do computer simulations and watch your investment grow to the point you could pay off your home, if you wanted to, much quicker than by trying to pay it off sooner by putting more $ to principal, but can also see that $ grow a LOT by letting it ride and delaying the mortgage payoff further.

What am I missing here?  Is there a big hole in this theory, or is it just that most people aren’t disciplined enough to save and invest all that extra cash and not screw up on the investment side?",finance

cardano,Legitimate counterargument to proof of stake (and how to address it),"One legitimate counterargument to proof of stake protocols is that the rich are rewarded more with compounded interest than those who can't afford to stake as much, exacerbating wealth inequality and technically increasing centralization. EDIT (for clarity): Using basic arithmetic, this is what happens when everyone has the same interest rate.

How can Cardano address this? Well, what if interest rates were tied to voter participation?

* vote X number of times consecutively =&gt; higher interest rate (up to a limit)
* missing an election =&gt; slightly lower interest rate
* missing multiple consecutive elections =&gt; 0% interest rate

In either case, this is probably something best reserved for the Voltaire upgrade.

EDIT: In case it isn't blindingly obvious, mathematically speaking having the same interest across the board exponentially increases the wealth gap between the rich and poor over time.

EDIT: please read the comment chain before responding. Took a great deal of time to explain the logic, and I’d rather not have to repeat myself to multiple people with the same initial gut reaction.

I called the dealer and they said they can't do anything as PNC has it already. Is this true or can they still do something as i don't even need to make the first payment for a month and a half.

personalfinance,"Scam with Bank of America, Zelle and Chase","So I wanted to write about a scam I \*almost\* fell for recently. I haven't seen anything else out there about it. I don't consider myself gullible and these people were prepared for savvy folks.

The other day, I received a text message purporting to be from Bank of America, warning me that someone tried to send $3.5k to someone using Zelle. I was asked to respond YES if valid and NO if not. I of course have not authorized such, so I said NO.

I then received a call that appeared to be from Bank of America (it was the same number as on the website and the back of my debit card). They gave me their name and employee ID, and MOST IMPORTANTLY- THEY NEVER ASKED ME TO SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFO.

However, the $3.5k transaction didn't show up in the records on my side. It was the steps they asked me to go through that made me suspicious. They wanted me to send money to myself to ""refund"" the money that was supposedly ""stolen"".

They first told me that since Zelle is third-party, they couldn't stop the transaction directly. They then asked me to send myself two $$ transfers to get my refund- one for $2.5k and one for $1k. They also had me give them a code that came from an email- supposedly from Chase bank as they were the bank the ""stolen"" funds were sent to. I didn't give the correct code just in case, but after looking at the email details (sender etc) I don't think it came from Chase at all.

I was suspicious at this point and made a comment about how it won't let me do that because I didn't even have that much in that account. They then said that they'd do a refund for the $2.5k from their end, but I still needed to do the $1k transfer to get all my money back. I said that didn't make sense- if they could refund part from their end they should be able to do all. He couldn't give a logical answer.

At that point I hung up and called Bank of America directly. The lady said that BOA texts only come from short-text-codes and they don't call after that. If I say no, a transaction is simply denied and there's no reason to call me. (?? I'm not sure about that). She confirmed that his ID number was false and so was the procedure he tried to get me to complete.

I'm not sure how the scam would have worked exactly if I had sent those transfers. I assume they were trying to set up another Zelle account with my email address, that would have collected the money I would have thought I was sending to myself? I'm not sure. On my bank I used my phone number for zelle, not my email, but they clearly have both.

But they were good. They didn't ask for personal info, they spoofed the bank number and made up employee numbers. They were careful to be ready for savvy people who ask questions.

They didn't expect me to hang up and actually call the bank, since it looked like they were calling from the bank. While I was talking to the bank lady, they were trying to call me back. They tried a few times the next day too.

Be careful out there y'all. If anyone calls ""from your bank"", hang up and call the bank directly right away.

I did post this at r/scams but I thought I'd ask here too, thinking someone might have more insight into how his scam would work. If you know, please enlighten me. Since I don’t know how the scam works, I don’t know if I’ve covered all my bases

* Banks only text from registered short text numbers; these are almost impossible to spoof 
* If in doubt, hang up and call the bank yourself, always!!",finance

Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

21. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

22. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
23. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

46. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
47. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
48. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
49. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
50. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
51. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
52. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
53. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
54. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
55. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
56. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
57. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
58. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
59. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
60. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
61. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
62. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
63. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

66. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
67. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
68. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
69. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
70. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
71. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
72. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
73. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

82. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base.

CryptoCurrency,The £100 Project: How to avoid working until I'm 70,"Can you get rich in the world of Crypto with only a small starting pot? That's what I aim to find out and I thought I would share some of what I've learned so far. I'm sure there are plenty of similar stories out there but there is also a lot of FUD so hopefully this will help somebody on the same journey.

Following a very demotivating work review I decide to kick my ass into gear and get out of the world of work as soon as possible. A work colleague mentioned Crypto and despite being in IT for my entire career I never got my head around what was happening in this world. I did some quick reading, signed up to an exchange and bought my first coin. Right at the top of the market.

Long story short, after a brief flirtation with DOGE (I know!), trading bots (I know, I know!), day trading (I know, I know, I know!) and then DCA into a sensible set of projects I believe in, I realised I needed to accelerate my capital growth.

This then is the plan. From a starting pot of £100 I need to pay off my mortgage and get a large enough investment fund so I can work when I want to and still support my family. This put some large milestones in my path but really I wanted to see how far I could go to secure my financial future.

So what is a sensible growth rate. DeFi offers some insane interest rates but they have a lot of risk. More steady growth in things like staking would still take decades to reach my goals. I needed to be growing around 5% a week to get this done in the next 4 years which seemed very reasonable. Day trading is very high stress but swing trading over several days seemed like a good compromise.

I put in my £100 to Binance, studied a bit of basic TA and started watching for my entries. I decided to keep it to longs, no leverage and where I thought I could clear 5-10% to avoid losses to fees. No shit coins (thanks PSG and SLP), only well established coins with obvious buying signals.

So far, over two weeks I've completed 6 trades, made a profit on 5 of those and I am averaging over my target for weekly growth. I'm now sitting on stable coins waiting for BTC to settle down a little. I think this is certainly the core of a decent idea.

I've been writing down some rules as I've gone along, things I've picked up from others or that I've learned myself.

1.  DON'T GET GREEDY 
2.  Never risk more than 3% of total capital. A 6% potential loss means only 50% capital in
3.  There is no rush. Only play the good hands 
4.  Respect BitCoin, it is in charge. Don't fight the trend
5. Take your profits wherever they are, don't hunt round numbers or keep chasing higher
6. Set your stop losses. Double check they are set
7. Don't mess with leverage
8. DYOR

There are lots of future questions. How will this work when I'm dealing in thousands instead of hundreds? What is the most tax efficient way to trade? What is my exit strategy? Is this sustainable over 3-4 years? Can I trust Binance, USDT, SEC, my wallets etc etc? If you have any opinions or experience with these it would be great to hear them.

And that's it. I'm sure many people here have been on a similar journey but this is my approach. It's more of an escalator than a rocket ship but hopefully I'll get there. Make sure to leave some Lambos at the dealership for me.",cryptocurrency

I wanted to see if anyone has dealt with this situation and maybe has some suggestions.  

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a somewhat rural area on about 18ac of land.  We bought our home about 11months ago for $750k and but 20% down. Our home value is now about $1,000,000 with a loan balance of $590,000. When we bought our home we used our local bank, that does not do standard mortgages but they are easy to deal with and we got the house closed on in 25 days and they let us close even without selling our other home. Of course we are paying a higher interest rate of 4.25. I want to explore doing a re-fi but in the past when we have tried to use the typical national mortgage brokers for homes in rural areas it has been a total headache  because of the land and lack of comps etc. I want to jump on these low rates but need a little direction. Or should we just stay put at our current rate?

stocks,Futures Drop as Reflation Trade Continues Unwind: Markets Wrap,"U.S. equity futures fell, extending a bout of volatility ignited by surprise hawkishness at the Federal Reserve that may be exacerbated Friday by the mass expiration of stock options. Commodities slumped and the dollar touched a two-month high.

Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid about 0.7% as investors stepped back from trades tied to expectations for hot economic growth and inflation. The S&amp;P 500 was poised to drop for a fourth day. Treasuries erased earlier gains after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on CNBC that the central bank has started discussing scaling back the pace of pandemic bond-buying.

“Investors believe the Fed will keep inflation in check, while U.S. activity is peaking,” Barclays Plc strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note to clients. “This is driving rotation away from reflation plays and back to growth stocks.”

personalfinance,Should I refinance Student Loans over 15 years instead of 10 and invest the difference?,"My wife and I (both 22 years old) have about $120,000 in student loan debt between the two of us (I know it's a lot but I can't change it now.) Outside of a small car loan (&lt;$3k), this is our only debt. Unless something dramatic happens in the next 12 months with student loan forgiveness, I will be refinancing all of our loans with a company like SoFi or Commonbond since they refinance parent PLUS loans. Based on a couple of old quotes (a month or two ago?) from Commonbond, I could get a 10-year loan at 2.94% with payments of $1,158.59/month, or I could get a 15-year loan at 3.34% with payments of 850.80/month. Obviously, because they are old quotes the rates will be slightly different but the concept is there.

The question is, should I finance the loan over 15 years rather than 10, considering that there is such a nominal difference in interest rate, and invest the difference in our retirement accounts monthly. We are pacing to max out our HSA accounts and meet our employer matches on the 401k accounts, which totals our combined savings out at a 15% gross pay savings rate at the 10-year rate, but if we switch to the 15-year rate, we will be saving \~19-20%. I know that it is a substantial amount of debt, and do plan on paying it off faster with some side hustle cash here and there, but the way I see it, I can leverage this debt and secure a higher average rate of return on average through my investment portfolio than paying the debt off sooner, considering a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund has averaged 10% ROR since inception.

￼FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS

How Trump Changed the World
-The Washington Free Beacon
“There is no greater measure of presidential significance than a chief executive's ability to transform not just his own but also the opposing party. When it comes to the Middle East and China, the Democrats are closer to Donald Trump today than they were at the outset of his term,” American Enterprise Institute fellow Matthew Continetti writes.
 
📖 MORE: President Trump Proved the Middle East ‘Experts’ Wrong￼Coronavirus Vaccine -- We'll Get One and Here's Why We Trust the Science
-Fox News 
Operation Warp Speed, “which uses federal research dollars to supplement and accelerate private companies’ vaccine development efforts, could now be mere months away from having a COVID-19 vaccine approved and ready to save lives,” write Reps. Phil Roe, Brad Wenstrup, Andy Harris, and Larry Bucshon, who are all physicians.
 
🎬 WATCH: When a vaccine is approved, it will be distributed within 24 hours￼The Higher Wages of Growth
-The Wall Street Journal
“In case you missed it, and most of the media did, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday that the median household income in 2019 grew a whopping 6.8%—the largest annual increase on record . . .  Lower-income workers and minorities benefited from faster growth and a tighter labor market before the pandemic,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes.￼US Will Protect Citizens and Defend Sovereignty Against International Court
-Fox News
“Multilateral organizations must be held to high standards . . . The International Criminal Court, in its present form, is inherently susceptible to political bias, manipulation and corruption. It neither serves American interests, nor the interests of its member states that genuinely want justice for war criminals,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo writes.￼Education Department Opens Investigation into Princeton University After President Deems Racism 'Embedded' in the School
-Washington Examiner
The U.S. Department of Education has opened an investigation into Princeton University after school president Christopher Eisgruber wrote an open letter alleging that racism persists at Princeton. “What the [Department of Education] seeks to obtain from its investigation is what evidence Princeton used in its determination that the university is racist, including all records regarding Eisgruber's letter,” Tiana Lowe reports.

￼FIVE STORIES PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MISS

How Trump Changed the World
-The Washington Free Beacon
“There is no greater measure of presidential significance than a chief executive's ability to transform not just his own but also the opposing party. When it comes to the Middle East and China, the Democrats are closer to Donald Trump today than they were at the outset of his term,” American Enterprise Institute fellow Matthew Continetti writes.
 
📖 MORE: President Trump Proved the Middle East ‘Experts’ Wrong￼Coronavirus Vaccine -- We'll Get One and Here's Why We Trust the Science
-Fox News 
Operation Warp Speed, “which uses federal research dollars to supplement and accelerate private companies’ vaccine development efforts, could now be mere months away from having a COVID-19 vaccine approved and ready to save lives,” write Reps. Phil Roe, Brad Wenstrup, Andy Harris, and Larry Bucshon, who are all physicians.
 
🎬 WATCH: When a vaccine is approved, it will be distributed within 24 hours￼The Higher Wages of Growth
-The Wall Street Journal
“In case you missed it, and most of the media did, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday that the median household income in 2019 grew a whopping 6.8%—the largest annual increase on record . . .  Lower-income workers and minorities benefited from faster growth and a tighter labor market before the pandemic,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes.￼US Will Protect Citizens and Defend Sovereignty Against International Court
-Fox News
“Multilateral organizations must be held to high standards . . . The International Criminal Court, in its present form, is inherently susceptible to political bias, manipulation and corruption. It neither serves American interests, nor the interests of its member states that genuinely want justice for war criminals,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo writes.￼

personalfinance,"Got an IRS deposit I wasn't expecting, any ideas how to verify it?","TL;DR: Got an unexpected direct deposit from the IRS and want to make sure it's correct.

I got a deposit for about $1600 deposited into my checking account, titled ""IRS TREAS 310 TAX REF"". The weird thing is, I had already filed my taxes and got a refund back in March, so I wasn't expecting any money from the Fed. 

Talked to my bank and they confirmed it is legitimately from the IRS, not someone impersonating them.

I know they're sending extra refunds for people who paid taxes on unemployment last year, but I was employed all year so this doesn't apply. 

I've also heard about a scam where bad guys who have stolen your personal info will file an actual return in your name, then when  you get a refund, the scammers contact you pretending to be the IRS asking for their money back to correct the ""mistake"". Could this even happen since I've already filed for last year? 

I've tried calling the IRS, but of course it's impossible to talk to anyone there, and their online ""get my payment"" or ""track my refund"" tools aren't giving me any helpful info either. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can confirm the legitimacy of this money? Obviously I'm hoping it's mine, but I want to be sure before I incorporate it into my budget.

personalfinance,Seeking advice on paying for grad school!,"I am going to grad school this fall. It’s a one-year program that costs $44k for tuition, or \~$60k including total living expenses. I’m a few years out from college graduation and have saved up \~$100k, which I’ve invested in the stock market and is currently making over 20% return. I have \~$23k left of undergrad loans to pay off, but it's a subsidized loan and the interest rate is very low. I plan on deferring these payments while in grad school since interest won't accrue.

Basically, I’m not sure what the best plan is to pay for grad school. I am able to get a school loan of $20.5k at 5.28% and 1.057% in fees, and could cover the rest with a grad plus loan at 6.28% and 4.228% in fees. Both loans would begin accruing interest immediately. If I did take out loans, I would pay interest from my savings to keep it from capitalizing while in school. Of course, I could avoid paying interest at all by just paying upfront with my savings, but with the economy being strong right now I’m thinking I might be able to make more in the stock market than the interest on the loans even if the market takes a dip eventually. 

A similar reddit thread suggested paying for the first semester out of pocket and then taking the lower interest $20.5k in school loans for the second semester, so as to avoid a higher interest loan without killing off as much of the nest egg. I was leaning towards this, but honestly taking out loans for everything and just paying down interest so that I can keep getting a return on my savings also seems like an attractive option. What do you guys think?

Also, it's worth mentioning that the grad program I’m doing is a post-bac program for medical school. If all goes well and I get into medical school, I’ll be looking at 4 more years of no income and \~$150k in debt which will need to be financed by more loans.

personalfinance,"Wanted to purchase a house, tanked my credit due to missed payment","I have been in US since 2012, have been renting, and had credit score of 780+.

Last year I got married, got stuck outside US due to Covid, Lost family members to Covid, have family diagnosed with Cancer and in general had a shit year.

In midst of all that stress, one of my credit cards missed a payment (long story but basically the auto pay was coming from my non-salary bank account and it ran out of money since I was having a easier time withdrawing from it abroad). Since I wasn't home, I didn't get my payment reminder mails. Not sure what happened to my emails, it might be I just ignored them on auto-pilot.

Bitcoin,Making digital currency into tangible coins,"I've been researching into different technologies and into the function of money for most of my life and purely out of curiousity.
 
I've been imagining different possibilities in modernizing currency beyond paper in a wallet or digits on a screen by essentially combining the two in a fundamentally different way.

There is a new technology called 5D(dimension) data storage which scientists are developing in order to store terabytes of permanent data into a crystal-like structure which is viable for billions of years according to their estimates.

This technology has the ability to store massive quantities of coded information or software which is able to be read and verified as legitimate using hardware that is not exceedingly expensive or difficult to use.

If a bank were to store the entire blockchain and hashcodes of a certain transaction (I apologize ahead of time for my lack of understanding to how cryptocurrency functions) onto the physical crystal medium with a certain amount of cryptocurrency you essentially are making the money, proof of the money, and the software to protect modifications to the money on the one coin.

Throw a protective 'shield' barrier of a sort to prevent deformation or damage to the crystal and you've got yourself digital currency that is impossible to hack and/or modify while retaining complete anonymity of the owner and who spends it because the coin does not record (that's impossible without the writing device). 

The money coin would change hands anonymously since there is no record or collection of each coins creation or destruction. 

There could be if the bank requires it or the federal government mandates it but all currency that is 'printed' without tracking information is totally anonymous.

The next issue is that the idea of money is something that is valued or devalued depending on confidence of the item of value such as gold or cryptocurrency.

If people believe a gold bar is worth a car then it is. If people believe a bitcoin is worth $40,000 then it is.

How do you prevent money from being devalued due to excessive 'printing' of monies into the market? You isolate each individual money into it's own entire financial system on one ""coin"".

Essentially each coin is given a certain and definite financial value due to the code and the work associated with it's creation.

When you print a coin you cannot artificially attach a numerical value to it like fiat currency such as the US Dollar and say, ""it has this value because it's backed by our debt"". 

Using a physical 5D optical storage Bitcoin creation method would require actual work and proof of work and the entire blockchain being downloaded (laser etched) into the crystal coin as well as the information of the producer and their licensing information, date of creation, unique identifier code to eliminate duplicates, and finally the permanent numerical value of the coin which does not change according to inflation.

The physical coin contains the entire financial system (blockchain) and software verification (communications with the reading device) to allow the user(owner) of the coin to spend it.

To destroy a coin is a simple matter of laser burning the coin or physical destruction and since most crystals used for these coins are cheap and readily available it would allow the rapid creation and destruction of any amount of these coins to fit any financial circumstance such as government notes in the $500,000 range being a single coin.

I've rambled on in my mind about this and I know it's financially and physically/scientifically possible at this moment but I wanted to know what you people think since y'all are definitely smarter than me.",cryptocurrency

My husband also can't take his name off their business credit card as he is the primary. Here are the options I \*think\* we have, but both seem pretty risky. 

1) Refi the entire debt in his name and sign a separate agreement with his partner that he will continue paying his half of the debt. (Not sure this is legal)

2) Refi his half of the credit card debt and hope that his partner continues to make timely payments for the remainder of the balance.

We have one car that will be paid off next year and we didn't pay cash since the interest rate was .9% and not planning on another anytime soon. No plan for kids either, so no extra expenses coming there. Student loan payments are ~$300/month once they are unfrozen.

personalfinance,Auto Loan Refinancing,"I'm currently in the market for refinance loans on my car as I originally purchased it with poor credit and am working with an almost 10% interest rate. I've repaired my credit a lot over the years and am now over 720 and figured now would be a good time to refinance to save myself some money in the long run. Mostly I'm looking at the highest overall savings I can get. I owe around 9.5k on the loan at 9.95% interest. Most offers have been around 6% or so but I've had a few under that, as low as 3.65%, and some as high as 16%. The big things for me are saving money and finding a reputable lender.

The plan is to get a lower payment and a lower APR so that I can put more towards the principal overall and pay less month over month from interest, with the goal of paying the loan off early anyway but it will still take time. Are there certain things I need to stay away from when searching for a refinance loan? If I can get a personal loan with a lower interest rate would it be better to go with that over an auto loan?

I went ahead and took the deal to save some money and enjoy post-pandemic life before jumping back into school.

Some financial details:

Closed on my house the day after the school began soliciting deferrals. Pocketed about $22.5k after living there for two years. 

Had about $11k in a HYS account with Goldman Sachs. Total savings in the account is now about $34.5k, including the proceeds from the sale of my home. 

Was going to live with my parents for the summer before going to school, but I’m now going to do that all year. Their house is paid off, so I’m going to cover electricity and split grocery costs with them. 

I think my take-home after car payment, 401k, stock purchase plan, student loans, and some other smaller things is about $2000 a month. 

Basically, I need to know where I should park my savings. My current savings account is paying out a paltry 0.5% right now. Do I put cash in a broad market fund or something lower risk like a target retirement fund? Or just swallow the low interest rate?",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.

# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.
*****
&gt; In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.
*****
&gt; The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&amp;P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.
*****
&gt; The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That’s common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed’s policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.
*****
&gt; There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
*****
&gt; “Getting more color from others will certainly be key,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. “I’m most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They’re all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said” at the end of the Fed’s June meeting.
*****
&gt; There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,” said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.
*****
&gt; “That’s what the rest of the year is all about — inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,” he said. “In this inflation debate, it’s not just a U.S. thing, it’s a global thing.”
*****
&gt; While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.
*****
&gt; The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.
*****
&gt; Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed’s tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.
*****
&gt; The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.
*****
&gt; Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.
*****
&gt; # Value versus growth
&gt; Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. “We like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That’s a good environment for stocks,” he said.
*****
&gt; As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space — commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.
*****
&gt; Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.
*****
&gt; “We had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,” said Keon. “There’s nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it’s the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.”
*****
&gt; Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.
*****
&gt; The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week’s Friday close of 0.149%.
*****
&gt; “My guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,” said Keon. “Until you get to 2023, you’re going to get the boom we are in now, and you’re going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.”
*****
&gt; Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there’s little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there’s an upside surprise in inflation.
*****
&gt; “The market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they’re not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they’ll be risking a recession,” he said.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed’s late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.
*****
&gt; Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,” Emanuel said. “Transitory” is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.
*****
&gt; In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed’s policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.
*****
&gt; Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.

&gt; # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After

&gt; As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.

&gt; The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 – down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 – the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it’s 11 of 12 in Q3.

&gt; Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father’s Day to all the dads!

&gt; # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs

&gt; In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&amp;P 500.

&gt; As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&amp;P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth

&gt; As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.

&gt; Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.

&gt; On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.

&gt; “Three consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI’s message.”

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index’s performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.

&gt; Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.

&gt; # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere

&gt; It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.

&gt; Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.

&gt; The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**

&gt; Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.

&gt; # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile

&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.

&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of –1.14%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.

&gt; # Sentiment Shaky

&gt; Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&amp;P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**

&gt; The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment. In other words, broadly speaking, optimism has appeared to have peaked for the time being.

personalfinance,Should I sell my rental condo (originally bought as primary home)?,"I bought my condo in Atlanta, GA back in June 2010 at a price of $99,900. At the time it was an FHA loan at 30 year 5% interest rate, with only $3K for downpayment (but final closing cost basically netted to a refund of $100 or so since seller had to settle taxes, etc), plus I got the first time home buyer credit of $8,000, which was a great deal as a 25 year old.

5 years later in 2015 I refinanced to a 15 year mortgage at 3.00% to take advantage of the home value appreciation and get out paying PMI as a result. However, in early 2016, I was approached by a recruiter to fill a position out in California that I couldn't refuse, so left the condo, but decided to keep it as a rental property since there was no rental permit system imposed by HOA. The condo is apparently worth between $205K to $250K depending on if you look up Redfin or Zillow, so let's say a middle ground of $220K. I have 9 years left on the mortgage at just under $60K.

So principle + interest comes out to $629.81/mo, HOA is $370/mo, taxes and insurance comes out to about $272/mo. The person I've hired as a property manager since I live so far away costs $100/mo for management fee. She typically takes first month as finder's fee for a new tenant, and if the tenant renews, takes 50% of the first month of renewal. In the months when she does take finder's fee, there is no management fee assessed. Let's say approximately $150-210/mo when you evenly divide up finder's fee plus management fee over 12 mo period. She deals with repair costs and such and the last year's average for that was about $75/mo. Everything considered, total cost is somewhere between $1,500 to 1,550. My previous tenant terminated his lease 3 months early because he took wanted to buy his own place, but he was paying $1,425 for the last few years. Basically I was thinking, hell, he's been helping me pay for most of the cost and I can easily deal with $100-150/mo of loss in greater scheme of things. I get to deduce mortgage interest and any major loss from my taxes, though even after factoring that in, not entirely sure if it's a break even situation overall.

I've been talking to a CPA lately to optimize financial planning for both myself and my wife. CPA actually recommends selling the condo and investing the proceeds in an index fund or so. With fees, expenses and capital gains tax considered I'm looking at maybe $120-140K in net proceeds. (can't use proceeds to buy another place to avoid it, we just bought our primary home out in LA last year) Even assuming conservative 6.5% annual growth rate, that's about equivalent to $675/mo or so in interest when broken down into monthly buckets. Even if I raise rent, I'm not going to see big profit for another 9 years and by this method, not only will I likely be 'making money', as I let the net proceed grow, most likely stand to make more per month than when I'm done paying off the mortgage.

I always thought hang on to real estate and if possible buy more. I bought my second property with my wife and would think we will buy another place that will be our long term home in maybe another 7-10 years, rent current home out, and any net income from this condo offset cost, and if there still is any leftover amount, groovy, that will help shave a little off our long term home down the line. I didn't even consider selling this condo just because of the interest rate, the number of years left, and the rent basically close to covering. Didn't even think that long term growth of index fund mimicking the broader market will mean better growth of the money.

Should I really consider selling this condo?",finance

My current car is 16 years old with 181k miles on it. Still runs, could probably keep it running for another year or two, but it's showing it's age. Leaks in the rain and not worth fixing the leaks, constant check engine light, and every few months it starts to worry me.   


Used car prices -- forget it. So with inflation and the Fed talking about rising interest rates, I'm wondering if now is the time to get a zero/low interest car loan financed while I can or if I should hold out until things settle down a bit and interest rates start to go back up?

stocks,What is still selling off and shortable right now? What are you shorting?,"it would be nice to make money on the downside.

which stocks do you think have room to fall?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Commodities-related stocks, like energy names and materials shares, were down sharply Thursday afternoon. Energy was the worst-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, falling 3.5%. Materials lost 2.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Financial stocks fell on the flatter yield curve, but REITs were slightly higher. Technology stocks rose 1.2%, and health care gained 0.8%.

energy, materials, financial, all down. Probably missed a lot of the move on the sell side.

but would you bet there's still some downside to capitalize on, or are people gonna be buying the dip Monday?

X, CLF, have pulled back a lot.

lumber is a falling knife. Looks very shortable with lots of room to fall on lumber related stocks

personalfinance,Immediately refinancing after securing mortgage? How to determine if it's the right strategy.,"As you know this housing market is absolutely bananas.

We're looking for a new home to hopefully grow old in and plan on staying there for a long time (aka do not plan on moving within the next 5 years). 

In order to be more competitive we are not planning on making any offers that are contingent on our house selling. Unfortunately, this means we have a large amount of equity in our current house that we won't have access to until it sells. 

I'm wondering if there's any benefit to basically putting almost nothing down and then refinancing when our current house sells (2 to 4 months) to bring our mortgage down to a more manageable number.

The only real down sides I can see here are paying closing costs again and the probability of the interest rate increasing (very likely).

Is this just dumb? We have almost enough for 20% down and can likely hit a manageable mortgage payment, but it would require that we use our emergency fund for moving/unanticipated costs.

Any feedback/advice is appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones Explains Why Bitcoin Is So Attractive,"The year 2020 will forever be remembered as a special year in the history of Bitcoin. There will clearly be a before and after of the COVID-19 crisis. The responses of governments and central bankers to this pandemic of a magnitude not seen in decades have exposed once again the flaws in the current monetary and financial system.

Even those who had always refused to open their eyes realized that we were in the middle of great monetary inflation.

Under these conditions, it became obvious that it was up to each individual to make the best decisions to protect their money future. If you don’t do it, no one will do it for you. You cannot rely on governments and central bankers to make decisions that will preserve the fruits of your labour over the long term.

# Paul Tudor Jones was the first prominent institutional investor to take a stand in favor of Bitcoin

In the world of institutional investors, many had already been tempted by Bitcoin for several months, but one fear remained. The fear of being misperceived by the rest of the profession. Indeed, Bitcoin was still seen as a dangerous investment at the beginning of 2020 in this world.

And then, in May 2020, one man came out of the woodwork to change everything. [**The announcement made by this legendary Wall Street investor will probably remain as the tipping point for Bitcoin**](https://www.inbitcoinwetrust.net/the-bitcoin-tipping-point-did-occur-in-2020-but-it-is-not-called-covid-19-eecf6c32acae). That man’s name is Paul Tudor Jones.

In May 2020, shortly before Bitcoin’s third Halving, [**Paul Tudor Jones revealed to the world that he was opting for Bitcoin instead of gold**](https://www.inbitcoinwetrust.net/bitcoin-is-the-fastest-horse-in-the-profits-race-e66a7aa180ff) as a hedge against the great monetary inflation. This announcement set the world of institutional investors free.

For a little over a year now, many other major Wall Street investors have joined Paul Tudor Jones in his analysis: Bitcoin is a tremendous opportunity that must be seized.

At the time, Paul Tudor Jones explained that he had allocated 1% of his portfolio to Bitcoin.

# Paul Tudor Jones explains the certainty that Bitcoin gives him

Interviewed in mid-June 2021 by CNBC, Paul Tudor Jones revealed this time that he had gone from allocating about 1% to 5% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. He once again took the opportunity to explain why Bitcoin is so attractive to investors from all walks of life in these highly inflationary times.

The words used by Paul Tudor Jones to justify his attraction to Bitcoin are extremely powerful:

&gt;*“Listen, I like Bitcoin right. Bitcoin is math…I like the idea of investing in something that’s reliable, consistent, honest, and 100% certain. So Bitcoin has appealed to me because it’s a way for me to invest in certainty.”*

I get five powerful words out of this sentence by Paul Tudor Jones:

* Math
* Reliable
* Consistent
* Honest
* 100% Certain

If Paul Tudor Jones has opted for Bitcoin, it is also and above all because its programmatic monetary policy is known to all in advance and which therefore leaves no surprises. Everyone knows that a Bitcoin Halving takes place every 210,000 blocks mined.

# Bitcoin’s programmatic monetary policy makes all the difference

By 2024, the supply of new Bitcoin issued each day will be halved again no matter what. And so on every 4 years.

This inevitability of Bitcoin makes it predictable. This gives investors incredible guarantees. Paul Tudor Jones chooses Bitcoin over the erratic monetary policies of the Fed, which depend only on a handful of people who are not representative of the people.

This is a strong signal sent once again in favor of Bitcoin at a time when some are starting to doubt it as the price of Bitcoin just experienced its first crash of the year in May 2021.

While many new entrants doubt, institutional investors like Paul Tudor Jones have no doubt. For him, Bitcoin will succeed and he wants to take advantage of it. Who knows if he won’t increase his portfolio allocation to Bitcoin to 10% in the coming months.

# Many will realize in the future that allocating 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin is not enough

As Michael J. Saylor says, that would be something extremely logical:

&gt;*“If you invest 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin, you have made the decision to invest 95% of your portfolio in assets getting demonetized by bitcoin.”*

By investing only 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin, you are leaving 95% of the rest of your portfolio at the mercy of the Fed and government decisions. So it is in your best interest to go well beyond that 5%.

This is the opinion I share with all Bitcoiners, and it is nice to see that Michael J. Saylor is putting his words into action as he continues to accumulate more and more BTC with MicroStrategy.

# Final Thoughts

Getting back to Paul Tudor Jones, you may recall that when he came to Bitcoin’s defense in May 2020, its price was still under $10K. Many people imagined that Halving was already priced. Paul Tudor Jones didn’t think so, and neither did yours truly and many other Bitcoiners.

He was absolutely right, as the Bitcoin price then began a phenomenal bullish rally starting in October 2020. All you had to do to take advantage of it was to be patient. The same thing is happening now. It’s up to you to be patient and take the long view like Bitcoiners or institutional investors like Paul Tudor Jones.

***TLDR: This year will be forever remembered because of how several institutions are starting to adopt BTC.***  ***Paul Tudor Jones revealed to the world that he was opting for Bitcoin instead of gold*** ***as a hedge against the great monetary inflation. H******e had gone from allocating about 1% to 5% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. He tells people that Bitcoin is so attractive to investors from all walks of life in these highly inflationary times.

From my understanding the Fed raised inflation expectations for the year which should theoretically increase nominal yields. I suppose the Fed still is targeting 2% in the following years so maybe that is irrelevant for long dated bonds. But the big shocker is that interest rates are expected to climb earlier than anticipated and then the 10Y climbs and then sells off hard.

From Investopedia,  

&gt;""One reason the yield curve may flatten is market participants may be expecting ... the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate in the near term.""

So I guess this market behavior is normal but I just cannot see why the relationship exists.

1. The Cardano Development Update for this week is out.  [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-06-18/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-06-18/)
2. Runtime Verification (architects of K Framework which powers Cardano’s IELE &amp; KEVM) just raised $5.3MM in a round that included Cardano’s C Fund. [https://runtimeverification.com/blog/runtime-verification-raises-5-3-million-to-advance-blockchain-security](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/runtime-verification-raises-5-3-million-to-advance-blockchain-security) [https://twitter.com/RosuGrigore/status/1405917218035097600](https://twitter.com/RosuGrigore/status/1405917218035097600)
3. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano.  You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar.

5. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

2. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat!

3. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.

29. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

31. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
32. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
33. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
34. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
35. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
36. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
37. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
38. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
39. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
40. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
41. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
42. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
43. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
44. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
45. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
46. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
47. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
48. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

51. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
52. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
53. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
54. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
55. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
56. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
57. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
58. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

67. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

CryptoCurrency,"New to Crypto, but loan rates seem really reasonable....","I'm looking at various over collateralized lending and notice (maybe for now?) the rates are really reasonable. I know you need MORE money to take out a loan, but at the same time if you have ever taken out a loan against your house, your retirement fund, etc., these rates are great. 

Anyway, I just wanted to mention how great it is that I can finance or buy something at a lower interest rate than my local bank, meanwhile not having to get approve while just banking on my investment which is WAY MORE than then loan I'm taking out. 

Short term loan among a decent ""fund"" is nice. I'm surprised and thankful, that is all.

BTW, I'm up for any recommendations as to where to ""park and barrow"", it seems to me Compound is the tried and true, but I'm open to suggestions.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,House appraised for a lot more than expected during refinancing. Should I do anything about that?,"Hi PF - 

This is my first time posting here, and I know very little about money. I am 37, divorced, 1 kiddo, sig student debt (healthcare), and no real savings (kind of a late start on life given the divorce).  I have decent paychecks coming in from my job, but I’ve also been looking for a way to reduce my hours and eventually transition to private practice. 

I bought a house recently for 70k, and it just appraised for 126k. I was a student at the time, so I bought the house with the help of my parents, and now I’m refinancing for cash to pay them back and put the mortgage fully into my name. 

I have been told I can refinance up to 80% of the appraised value, so I could potentially access about 30k after I’ve settled with my parents. How can I maximize this? I don’t even know what the options are, and this is a huge amount of money to me. 

- Do I leave it alone and only take out what I need?
-	Do I take some out and put it towards fixing up the house? The house was a rental that I lived in for a couple years prior to having the opportunity to purchase, so it’s older and could use a little TLC. 
-	Do I take as much as I can and put it towards my student debt? The mortgage interest will be sig less than my student loans, but I had kind of given up on the idea of ever getting them paid off. 
-	other?

Please help me think this through!
Thanks

EDIT: My student loans (~98k) are all federally owned with an avg interest rate of 8+%. Have been on forbearance since I graduated (thanks, COVID!), and my income-driven payments that will kick in later this year are minimal.

My house was inspected and has no anticipated major structural or functional needs in the near future - improvements would be primarily aesthetic.",finance

So one good thing about this sub is the possibility we have of sharing valuable info, so others can get up to speed, and cross different sources, so we all can get better in the subject. Because of that, I'll list the major sources I had to understand this world better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for a historical perspective and Bitcoin context in the world:

&amp;#x200B;

**Michael Saylor's series, with Robert Breedlove:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvTppy1qLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvTppy1qLI) (this is the first of 9 episodes, but it's worth it);

&amp;#x200B;

**The audiobook ""The Bitcoin Standard"", Saifedean Ammous**

(I listened for free by creating a Audible account and they offered a free audiobook in the first month);

&amp;#x200B;

**""The Internet of Money"", vol. I, II and III by Andreas Antonopoulos:**

I actually bought the the 3 volumes (ebooks) because i heard him a lot on youtube and wanted to support is work. It's less than 20$ and tottaly worth it. Besides that, he also have more technical books about BTC and ETH. Here's his homepage: [https://aantonop.com/product-category/books/](https://aantonop.com/product-category/books/)

&amp;#x200B;

**LexFridman podcasts with Breedlove, Pompliano, Nic Carter, Vitalik (there's 2 already) and the last one, ADA creator, Charles Hoskinson. They're all very good and important for a broader sense of what this brave new world brings;**

&amp;#x200B;

**Also have some podcasts of maximalists, like the pomp podcast (Anthony Pompliano) or Orange Pill: A Bitcoin Podcast (Max Keiser) that can answer some specific questions.**

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i'll share with you some books that I've on my reading list, but still didn't begin:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Blockchain Revolution** (Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott);

\- **The Age of Cryptocurrency** (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey);

\- **Cryptoassets** (Chris Burniske, Jack Tatar);

\- **Digital Gold** (Nathaniel Popper);

\- **The Truth Machine** (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey);

\- **Bitcoin Billionaires** (Ben Mezrich).

\- **Blockchain Basics** (Daniel Drescher); and

\- **The Business Blockchain** (William Mougayar, Vitalik Buterin).

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think of these books, in case you already read it guys, so I know where to start and wich ones are more worthy.

CryptoCurrency,"While sideways in a bear market, it's important to remember 2008 and why the heck crypto is so very important","At times like these - it's important to revisit why this all started, and why it's still so vital. Bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis - looking back in brief, remember that:

- Banks and brokers were giving out cheap, subprime mortgage loans to people they knew would be unable to afford them, fuelling a housing bubble

- these loans were sold to and then packaged up by Wall Street as financial investments such as mortgage backed securities

- This became a market in itself, with institutions buying and selling these packaged up securities internationally,.without any real idea of what they were


In other words, no transparency


Interest rates rose, housing bubble burst, people were unable to pay back subprime loans, financial crash occured in the US and spread internationally -

Hedge funds went under

Lehman brothers went under

Major banks had to be rescued by their governments

People queued up at banks to withdraw money which wasn't there

The financial institutions that caused the whole shitshow were bailed out by the government's and the average person paid the price, through taxes, austerity and so on

Whole countries had to be bailed out 


Basically when the time was good - all the profits were privatised and in the hands of the few, yet when the shit hit the fan - all the losses were socialised, and those responsible were enriched even further while the victims were made to suffer more


This is what's crypto was all about solving

It's not about just being a speculative asset class, or fcking moonshots and animal meme tokens


It's about -

Taking out the middle man

Taking control of your own finances

Transparency of transactions taking place

Speed and efficiency of transactions

And a whole load of other good stuff


Whether things crash or rebound, bear market or bull, every so often reflect back on this. Put things in perspective. Look at all the resistance that's been put in place by the establishment, and look at how now they realise they can't prevent the coming changes so now want to be involved to control it.


Whatever happens,.if you remember 2008 or read up on it if you are too young to really remember, and you understand what crypto came to solve and improve, you'll still be here for the next year, and beyond.",cryptocurrency

We may have seen some rotation out of value today, or oils and what not, and what can continue to next week, but tech can also still have a flat or dump as well.

Lots of tech stocks like DocuSign have gone up exponentially in the last 2 weeks. They’re up like 40% and have an RSI at almost 80. I believe the increase is way too high and way too fast. A correction would actually be healthy for some growth. I’d prefer to see steady growth like 1-2% up daily, but I still have a feeling that tech will go down a little next week for the short term.

CryptoCurrency,I strongly believe we need to focus on the “why” and affirm responsible investing,"Over on r/cryptomarkets, someone shared the article below which was quite worrisome. I had commented a similar sentiment, and felt it important enough to share here.

The article solidifies that we need to spend time educating people on what blockchain technologies are, and what the purpose of them and cryptocurrencies are. Less “Look at what Musk said”, and more of why you should be holding and not considering selling whatsoever (unless you’re into the whole Meme coin thing…). CryptoCurrency has a far deeper purpose and ability, that I think is completely lost on some. In short, CryptoCurrency has the ability to pull people out of poverty, take people from the lower class to middle class, and middle class to the upper class.

This isn’t achieved by shorting or placing risky conventional investment orders. It is achieved through mass adoption, it is achieved by lowering remittance fees, improving financial inclusion, and lowering the risk of fraudulent financial activities. So while some people are focusing on buying low and selling high on a rinse and repeat cycle, others are looking for greater financial stability just so they can put food on their tables in countries with little to no opportunity, and disproportionate class separation. If people are interested, I can certainly take the time to write a thoughtful post with sources to back it up. I also have questions around this, and maybe a larger conversation would benefit us all.

It’s also very concerning that people are borrowing money to purchase crypto. While it isn’t our job to teach basic financial fundamentals, we should encourage our base to be sensible. Simple concepts like ensuring you have no credit card debt before you invest in anything should be widespread knowledge. That 15-20% credit card interest in the moderate short term will (very likely) outweigh the gains you experience in Crypto. We need less FOMO, more responsibility. It is very unlikely that you’ll drag yourself out of debt AND build wealth by making irresponsible decisions. The golden rule is, you always put your money where the highest interest rate is. That’s difficult to calculate with Crypto, but other than major loans (mortgage, car loan, student loans), you shouldn’t have any debt when investing. Both Crypto and traditional stocks are far to volatile, so never count on any investment, including Crypto, to bail you out of your short term debt. Count on it to help you build wealth. And you can’t build wealth with a maxed out credit card weighing you down. Why? Because then you’re selling off that wealth, and potential future gains, just to pay off a credit card that got maxed out on buying crypto in the first place.

You might be thinking that you don’t care what other people are doing with their money. However, this lack of knowledge and irresponsible investing won’t lead to mass adoption. It’ll just remain a fun toy to invest in, and nothing more. So ignore the billionaires, ignore the ups and downs, and know why you are in this.

Just my two cents. Invest responsibly, and realize this is a long game where someday you’ll be using Crypto to buy your groceries, not cashing out when a tweet scares you. And sleep better at night knowing that when our friends send Crypto to their family in El Salvador, Western Union isn’t crushing them with fees, they now have an appreciating asset to help get them back on their feet, and they’re less reliant on those around them.

So how about less memes, less shitposts, less “but this celebrity did this!”, and more “This is how WE are changing the world (while also building our own wealth)”. Because that is why we are in this. Crypto isn’t a get rich quick scheme, it’s a grow wealth for those left behind scheme.

investing,VXX as a buy...what does trend analysis say?,"Right now the market is teetering on a sell off and Monday will be the strongest indicator of if that is the new trend or a temporary spike in uncertainty.

A lot hinges on what the Feds say tomorrow and I am betting they will ""quiet the markets"".

They needed to temper bulls but I don't think their intention is a sell off.

My thoughts on their statement is irrelevant. We can look at VXX as a further indicator.

Banks are a long indicator while VXX is a short indicator and right now both have been moving to opposite of each other. 

Banks moved into bearish territory and now stocks at large are doing the same. But VXX is moving I to bullish territory. 

However.

Volume-trend analysis has a few maxims.

Primarily, if price moves away from the trend line on large volume it CONFIRMS the trend line.

If price moves back to the trend line on low volume it CONFIRMS the trend line.

When volume decreases and price moves away from the trend line it is sign that a trend is about to reverse.

This general rule of thumb shows that we are too early in a potential sell-off to know what to do exactly.

VXX is only one day into moving away from its trend line and it has done so at massive increase of volume.

If price follows a trend line on lower volume, it confirms a trend.

So more data will pour in Monday but the big things we are looking for is:

Do Banks move away from their trend line on lower volume than past few days? 

Does VXX move away from trend line on even higher volume or does it move back to trend line on lower volume. Either of which helps to confirm the trend. 

In which case the sell off is a brief sell off and ride it out.

But if the bank trend is confirmed. And the VXX trend shows signs of breaking. Then the sell off is likely to worsen.

And the evaluation has to take place after the Feds open their mouths.",finance

Of course if I have another $3,000 enter into my checking account, the lender requires documentation on where that $3,000 mysteriously appeared from.

I have $3,000 in scrap gold and silver I can send it and deposit the money, and the company would also issue a document stating my name, how much I sold, etc to prove the money entering the account came from the sale of an asset, likewise to having a bill of sale from selling a car. 

However, as gold continues to rise in value, I don't necessarily wish to do that, an alternative would be to borrow $3,000 from family and say the money was a gift, but most lenders want a letter on that as well.

I bought this scrap when gold was much cheaper, so I actually only have about $1,000 into the $3,000, and paying back family would have to come from income.

For my position I'm horribly under paid based on the market rate. I'm a supervisor and the last 3 people who have left from my department were 2 levels under me. They either stayed at their same title at a new company or got a single level promotion (still a level lower than me, none are supervisors) and all 3 either make what I make or more.

When this was brought up to my boss and HR, HR promised that the plan is to look at everyones pay and adjust to market value. Unfortunately now that they have given everyone retention bonuses they are no longer looking to adjust people's salaries as they have us locked in for a year.

Additionally because we are so under staffed and we are having a hard time filling postions (due to the pay) I'm working 60+ hours a week salary and I'm over it at this point. But unfortunately I have 11 months before I can leave without having to pay back the retention bonus.

I'm going to be living in California and there seems to be large tax bracket for my income, something like between 58k-300k we pay 9.3% according to the internet, so I don't think I have to consider this impact, but I may be interested in considering the impact of federal taxes... Are there any other considerations besides tax bracketing?

**What percent of my income should I put in my Roth 401k vs. my 401k?**

personalfinance,"APR, how does it work exactly?","Hello,

So very recently I made a post about how I was moving to Florida, which is still the case but I want to take care of some expenses before I go down there so I’m not lugging them around.

Currently I pay 636/month on a car loan that sits at a principal balance of 29713.31 with an interest rate of 15.56%. I’ve only had the car for five months and I rolled my old car loan into the new loan because it was a used vehicle with a 24% interest rate. My current car that I financed new is a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid which I only fill up once a month and is just overall what I think to be a great car. I contacted my local credit union and they told me if I paid 5138.31, they would give me a refinance at a 5.99% interest rate. This coming week I plan on paying 6600 on the loan and refinance by the end of the week. Obviously a lower interest rate is better and it saves me quite a bit of change (I think..). 

My new note would have my car payments be around 400-443, obviously still a bit high but not as bad as what I’m paying now. I plan on paying 2500/month (that includes the payment of 400-443) to pay it off sooner. I plan on paying it by the end of March. How much in actuality will I be paying on the car? Do I multiply the interest rate with the new balance and that’s what gets added to the loan right away? Just trying to figure this out so I know effectively what I should be paying each month for the loan to be finished in March or even sooner.. 

I look forward to hearing some insight and advice! Thanks everyone..",finance
personalfinance,New Car Lease Option,"Ok, first, I understand that PF is usually against buying new, but it's currently a very competitive used market, and I swore my next car would be an EV, further reducing the available options.

I'm looking at a Kia Niro EV, and Kia is currently running a ""special"" 36 month lease option at $219 /month + $3500 at signing for various fees, including first month.  That would mean over the 36 month lease, I would have paid $11,165, with an estimated residual of $19,537.

I have never leased a car, but I'm failing to see the downside here.  Over 3 years, the car must surely depreciate at least $11,165, so while I'm not gaining equity for that time period, I'm not really loosing anything either, right?  **What am I missing??**

For what it's worth, the 48mo financing option came out to be almost $800 per month.

Edit before it's asked: I will have no problem staying under 10,000 miles per year. I drive closer to 6000, pandemic aside. 

Edit 2: I am eligible for the $7500 federal rebate and $2500 Massachusetts rebate. That is not factored into anything above.",finance

personalfinance,Who's Credit Score to Boost.,"My wife and I are wanting to increase our credit scores by both getting credit cards so we can have a lower interest rate when we buy a house (probably in a few years). The plan is to get one card that is low/no fees and no perks and another to help get frequent flyer miles. We would then pay most things with the miles card and a few things with the low fees card so we can boost both our credit scores. The question is whose credit score should we focus on and thus be the one with the more frequently used card? I currently have a better credit score (around 700) and make less money (50k) while she has a worse score (400sor500s) and makes more (60k).

We wanted to take advantage of the low interest rates and get a slightly bigger house in the process. 

Boy were we shocked when we got over 20 offers instantaneously, well over asking price, with no one even bothering to seeing the house yet. We have now accepted a cash offer $120k over what we paid on a house that we bought only a few years ago. And only ONE day on the market. 

Obviously this got us thinking… If this is the new normal, there is no WAY we can afford a better house right now with people putting up cash offers tens of thousands over the asking price. 

What is the most frugal way to utilize this unexpected windfall towards owning a home in this area? (Sarasota, FL). Do we rent for a year, eating away about $16-20k in the hopes that prices go down a little. Or does the math usually workout that if we use this extra money towards a new house immediately, the increased price of the new house is canceled out?

[Better](https://imgur.com/a/pmst77i)


Both are offering the same interest rate so the deviations are largely due to PMI, origination fees, and lender credits. Specifically, I wanted some clarification on:

* Countour has higher origination fees than Better (which basically has none). Better is also offering lender credits. Would I be able to negotiate to get lender credits from Contour?
* Can I negotiate the PMI?
* Better is tacking the transfer tax on to the seller. Given that it is a seller's market right now, I am not sure I would be able to get the seller to pay for this. Is it customary for the seller to pay this tax?
* I'll need to get clarification from Better but it seems I have to prepay 15 months of homeowners insurance. Is this normal? Shouldn't that lower my monthly payment then?

If I remove the variables and go with the worst case estimates, it seems like I would be saving ~$4k with Better.  What do you think is the more preferable loan?",finance
investing,"Barron's: Investors are calling the Federal Reserve’s bluff. “We don’t believe you,” the futures market is effectively telling the Fed","[https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-hawkish-fed-51624052659](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-hawkish-fed-51624052659)

The Federal Open Market Committee’s latest policy communications raised more questions than answers. Perhaps the biggest one: Can the Fed ever really raise interest rates?

&amp;#x200B;

At face value, and with a big dose of relativity, this past week’s updated summary of economic projections and commentary from Chairman Jerome Powell marks a hawkish turn. Officials signaled rates could rise in 2023, earlier than previously telegraphed. And during his press conference, Powell acknowledged for the first time that inflation may turn out to be hotter and more persistent than the Fed has projected—no small change for a person who has pushed the idea of transitory inflation, says Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you take a step back, the Fed remains about as dovish as ever. When the consumer-price index is running at 5%, it’s hardly hawkish to say there is a chance price acceleration is faster and lasts longer than anticipated. It already is, and it already has.

&amp;#x200B;

 Powell, like past Fed chiefs, told investors to take the so-called dot plot of officials’ economic projections with a big grain of salt. But to the extent the dots are useful for reading the internal debate, they still show that only three members changed their view for raising rates in 2022, not enough to lift the median forecast from 0.125%. How hawkish can this all really be if, all told, the most skeptical members are thinking about raising rates by 0.5% in 2023? Moreover, the dots’ 2023 message runs counter to the Fed’s own updated economic forecasts. It still sees inflation hardly above 2% in 2022 and 2023, despite the new tolerance for above-target inflation, and it predicts a meaningful slowdown in growth after this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stocks and bonds initially sold off on Wednesday after the Fed’s policy meeting but quickly recovered. The Nasdaq Composite index, full of expensive growth stocks, closed just off a record high on Thursday and bore the lightest brunt of Friday’s selloff after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he expects the first increase in late 2022 (Bullard is a voting member next year). Still, Friday’s declines are hardly a tantrum and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was lower Friday than where it was before the Fed news. More interesting still is how the 5-year/5-year overnight indexed swap has traded.

&amp;#x200B;

The 5-year/5-year OIS captures investors’ expectations for the peak fed-funds rate in the business cycle, says Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. When long rates were selling off earlier this year, the gauge rose to about 2.40%, he says, suggesting traders assumed that the next tightening cycle would look broadly like the last one. After the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, the gauge was yielding 1.94%. At press time on Friday, it was at 1.71%—the lowest yield since early February.

&amp;#x200B;

“We don’t believe you,” the futures market is effectively telling the Fed, “and saying it loud and clear with a megaphone,” LaVorgna says.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent history has sided with the market, not policy makers, he says. He points to the long-run equilibrium funds rate, which the Fed had to keep revising lower amid a falling 5-year/5-year OIS. Once thought to be around 4%, the Fed’s long-run rate estimate is now between 2% and 3%. The high end of that range still appears far too high if the 5-year/5-year OIS is a guide.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes sense. Financial markets’ sensitivity to monetary policy has never been higher. The Fed’s balance sheet has doubled since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, now 40% of gross domestic product. By buying massive amounts of bonds, the Fed has lowered rates and used asset prices—especially stocks—as a primary tool for monetary policy. That’s through the wealth effect, or the tendency for consumers (which make up two-thirds of gross domestic product) to spend more as their assets grow. Any correction in stock prices would negatively affect economic growth and thus limit the Fed’s ability to tighten, the logic goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Less discussed: the prospect of further fiscal spending would itself make tapering bond purchases a tall order. The Fed has become such a dominant force in the bond market and would presumably need to keep buying the additional debt as the Treasury incurs it. (The Biden administration has proposed a $6 trillion budget for 2022).

&amp;#x200B;

That’s one piece of the argument that the Fed won’t be able to meaningfully tighten. Another is the debt side of the economy. If the Fed was unable to lift rates above 2.5% during the last tightening cycle, and had to cut rates in several meetings before the pandemic prompted its emergency actions early last year, why would it be able to raise now? Since then, U.S. households, businesses, and the federal government have grown only more indebted.

&amp;#x200B;

“When an economy is running a debt-to-GDP ratio at 100% or more and growth is debt-driven, it’s very hard to raise rates,” LaVorgna says. “The Fed is in a box and I don’t think it can get out of it.”

&amp;#x200B;

The upshot? Easy money is likely to be flowing well beyond 2023. For now, that would translate into continuing stock-market gains, especially in rate-sensitive areas like technology. What that means for the U.S. economy is another question, and what it means for markets longer term is yet another.

&amp;#x200B;

To LaVorgna, it probably all leads to what he calls secular stagnation. A euphemism, perhaps, for stagflation.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors worried about inflation remain no less concerned. The Fed tiptoed toward acknowledging that current policy doesn’t square with reality, but it didn’t really move the needle, says Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “I’m someone who thinks the Fed has been doing 200 miles per hour in a 50 mph speed zone. I saw Powell slow down to 175.”

&amp;#x200B;

Boockvar remains long areas that hold up best during periods of rising inflation, including energy and agriculture stocks, precious metals, and Asian and European equities. “Inflation is now a Main Street story,” he says. “I’m gritting my teeth and sticking to it.”

\-The Fed Reserve said they expect the first round of rate increases to come much earlier than expected. This is good for banks.

\-Banks are cheap compared to the rest of the market. Most investors don't understand how they make money or how to analyze them properly so they can stay undervalued for a long time.

\-Banking is an industry that Buffett has stood in for a very long time. Why? Because they're quiet businesses (ignoring the big four banks for a second and also the largest European ones) that can compound capital at steady rates and at sometimes high rates of return. Buffett has never not been invested in a bank throughout his investing career.

Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

30. Cardano 360 is tomorrow. Don’t miss it if you want to hear about all the awesome things happening with Alonzo (smart contracts), Hydra (scalability), and everything else! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338)
31. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
32. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
33. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
34. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
35. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
36. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
37. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
38. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
39. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
40. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
41. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
42. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
43. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
44. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
45. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
46. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
47. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
48. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

51. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
52. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
53. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
54. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
55. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
56. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
57. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
58. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

67. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

personalfinance,Mother want me to give HER a house deposit,"Hi everyone I would be extremely grateful for any advice as I have no idea what to do. Essentially my mother (59F) is asking me (20F) to contribute 30k for a house deposit in her name. She will contribute 20k. She assures me that if I pay that I can have one year of ‘free’ rent in the home. After that time she wants me to contribute $200 a week towards expenses (parents are divorced, only child). 

She assured me that this is the best thing for my future as I will get a house but I’m not sure if that is the case. My mother is also worried about being in the rental market any longer because rentals are in demand in this area, usually around $2000-$2400 a month. 

Firstly, my concern is that my mother won’t be able to afford the payments on her own as she has a stable job that pays $400 a week and a casual job that pays around $650 a week net. She has no other repayments but the amount she would need to pay just for the mortgage, insurance and property taxes would be around $520 a week (bearing in mind, interest rates are low at the moment) so over half of her income would be gone before she pays bills, food and other expenses. 

Secondly, I don’t want to be financially disadvantaged and she is basically requesting that I wipe my savings. I had been saving that money so I could put a deposit on a home in my late 20s, or to pay for a University degree (the degree I want is in the humanities, so potentially not very profitable) 

Thirdly, there will be a lot of issues after she retires (even though retirement care is generally reasonable). I assume that she will attempt to retire ASAP as she gets extremely defensive when I ask, in Australia retirement age is around 65. If that is the case, I assume that she will use the money in her retirement fund on the house but even if she does that and pays reduced payments she will no longer be able to pay the house around 74, if she can even keep the house for that long, there will still be 6 years on the mortgage. 
As the government pension system dictates that only 30k can be transferred every 5 years, even if the house is sold it would take a long time to me to get any money back. 

I just feel as if this is a bit of a risky move as there is a lot I could do with that money while keeping control of it. My parents are also not the best with money management, they had many mortgages in the past but always had to sell.
My mother gets extremely upset when I raise these issues and tells me I’m not looking at the big picture. I offered to pay the 30k if she would give me three years of free rent at the property, she refused, telling me that I can’t freeload. At this point I could even save money by moving out and renting a room from someone as the price would be about $200 a week and I could save the 30k. This would be the case if I moved away for university. 

I understand that it has the potential to be good but I’m not sure that I want to throw my money in as I may move away within the next few years. On the other hand it would be nice to have somewhere to come back to or at least some sort of stability if I chose to stay. 
Should I hand over the money? or would my doing so financially disadvantage me in the way I think it would?

Banking,What bank should I stay with?,"As the title says, I need help finding out what bank account I should leave open. I seem to have like 6 accounts open (literally) and I need to do some summer cleaning. I really do not know why I have so many accounts open, but I just do. Alrighty. Down below is a list of bank accounts and the approx. dates they were opened.

- Wells Fargo, Mar 2019 (first bank account)
- Chase, Oct 2019
- Bank of America, Jan 2021
- Capital One 360, Jan 2021
- Golden1 Credit Union, Mar 2021
- One Checking Account, June 2021

So, I don’t want to close my Golden1 checking account just yet because I do plan on refinancing my car with them so I’m trying to have as much as a relationship as I can, but tbh, just having $0.50 isn’t much of a relationship. I moved from WF to Chase just because at the time, I had a job that paid in physical checks and Chase was right in front of my job, and also gave me my money the next day (Saturday), if not the same day (Friday). I moved from Chase to Bank of America just because BofA did approve me for my first credit card so I wanted to move all my banking with them, but the fact that the app UI is trash, not getting immediate notifications of transactions (on debit, not credit), and the mismatch of the transactions in order (some recent transactions get pushed all the way down and etc), made me jump back to Chase since it was more streamline. Now, Capital One and One is an iffy one. Their interest rates are great and the apps are good too, but whenever I need to deposit cash (wish I do on a frequent basis) I’d have to Zelle the money to my account from my other banks (Capital One, not One). And in my area, Chase has more ATMs then any other checking account listed. So, to sum it all up. Should I close the rest of the accounts and just have Chase and One (again, interest rates at One are good and surpass Capital One in some ways), or should I stay with BofA (which at this point I’m not sure) ? Please let me know what your opinion is on this matter 😅😅 thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,How come staking stablecoins has such high interest rates?,[removed],cryptocurrency
XRP,XRP will be the first crypto will absolute regulatory clarity.,"Think about this guy's. If the US wants to keep up with other countries using CBDC  they will need a company like ripple to facilitate the exchanges between currencies.  This could never happen without regulatory clarity from the SEC. I believe that the SEC made a choice to go after ripple being the only company that they have filed against that is a mature crypto currency at 8 years old. This will not only give clarity to many other crypto it will slingshot ripple XRP back into mainstream. Whether or not they win/lose it WILL NOT MATTER! I forsee ripple being charged a fine for the amount of xrp exchanged as a security not a fine for all xrp transacted. Once they receive clarity banks and institutions in the US will be able to make decisions on adopting the ledger. As you all should know XRP is well ahead of the game and we'll involved with the fed, gov, and banks around the world. Once USA 🇺🇸 gets clarity other countries will be even more inclined to do more business with ripple because the US is the powerhouse of economic transfer of monetary goods and currency. 

CBDC are coming and they will use XRP to transfer their currencies. For me, the is a 3 year minimum hold. If this evolves into what it is meant to be, it will replace swift and become adopted by institutions globally at a substantial rate. 

BTW if it hasn't already happened this may be the last market swing to the upside for BTC.

CryptoCurrency,The biggest banks in The Netherlands about to claim negative interest rates at July 1st. THIS IS HUGE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY'S,"[https://www.abnamro.com/br/en/news/threshold-for-negative-interest-rate-down-to-150-000-euros](https://www.abnamro.com/br/en/news/threshold-for-negative-interest-rate-down-to-150-000-euros)

&gt; From 1 July 2021, ABN AMRO clients in the Netherlands with a total balance of more than 150,000 euros in their bank accounts will pay 0.5% interest on the amount above this threshold. This will apply to both private individuals and business clients. The interest on deposits under 150,000 euros will remain unchanged at 0%. 

[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/)

&gt; Rabobank has become the latest Dutch bank to charge customers if they have savings of above €100,000. The bank will now levy a rate of 0.5% on savings of over €100,000 from July 1. The change, the bank says, will impact on just 4% of its customers. ING and Volksbank have already introduced negative interest on savings above €100,000, while ABN Amro has a limit of €150,000. The move, Rabobank says, has been prompted by continuing low market interest rates.

[https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000](https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000)

&gt; ING customers with more than a hundred thousand euros in their account must pay a savings interest of 0.5% on this from 1 July. The bank will then lower the negative interest threshold from € 250,000 to € 100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;The negative interest applies to both business and private ING customers with more than € 100,000 in their accounts. ING emphasizes that the interest applies per account and not per customer. Spreading money over several (savings) accounts at the bank would thus offer another chance to escape the negative interest rate. On the other hand, there are higher costs per month for holding multiple accounts.

personalfinance,Rent out condo or sell and apply proceeds towards student loans?,"I’ve owned the condo for two years and have a 4.375% interest rate on the mortgage. Meanwhile, my husband has student loans with the same interest: 4.375% and a balance of $168k. 

If I sell the condo after owning it this short, I would walk away with roughly 15k (after having paid the 6% realtor commission and other fees). An equity calculator, if I used it correctly, showed that if I hold on to the condo, in three years (five from the purchase date) my proceeds would be $25k, assuming that the condo didn’t appreciate. 

If I rent it, what I can charge per month would be at most $150/month higher than what my monthly mortgage+hoa is. The only reason I’d consider renting it out is to continue getting equity that’s paid for by the renter.

I don’t fully understand how amortization works in terms of interest calculation. Can someone help me calculate what I would gain from paying $15k towards student loans now versus in $25k in three years? 

Thank you!

personalfinance,"My current dilemma-Refi, Move, Rent","The last 16 months or so have brought a few changes, and it's really altered my attitude.  I'm probably more than a bit depressed.  Luckily, both my wife and I are gainfully employed, making good money.  The public school system has failed at least one of my two daughters, and as a result, I've pulled both kids out of the local public school and am enrolling them into a smaller private school, which is 30 minutes away.  The older kid, who has some special needs, switched schools (grade 6) in January, and the younger kid will start in September in Grade 5.  The older kid is doing much better in the new school.  Private school is expensive.  It's about $35K/year per kid.

The younger child will most likely return to public school after 4 years, but I'm planning on the older child to be there for the duration, so that's six years for her.  Minimally $350,000 for that scenario.

So, how are we paying for it?  Both my wife and I had pension plans from former employers.  In my case, I took a lump sum of around @$230K and put it into an IRA.  My wife's former company wanted the obligation off the books, so they let her lump sum her fund, which had been placed into an IRA a few years ago.  Her share is around $90K. We also have a couple of 529s for the kids, but I can only take $10K per year, per kid for qualified pre-college expenses.  These will only last a couple of years.

This is not our retirement money, per se.  My current company has a 403b plan, and I have around $800K in it, as well as around $150K

 in a TIAA plan.  My wife is a federal employee, and between her TSP and FERS, she has about the same.  We're both currently maxing out our contributions.  I also have some crypto that I mined 5 years ago, and that's basically free money, but it's not at all guaranteed.

So for the most part, we'll be taking distributions from the IRAs and paying taxes as necessary, but that's not going to cover all of it.  The initial intent of the crypto was a hedge, and would be used to pay off the house.  The current mortgage is around $400K, which includes a HELOC.  The current rate on the primary mortgage is 3.875%.  I will probably refinance it all into a 20-30 year fixed loan.

So what's the dilemma, you're probably asking...

I'd like to move, so somewhere that is a) closer to both of our offices and the new school, and b) is in a better school district for when the younger child is ready to transition back to public school.  These places have higher property taxes, and one acre lots are not hard to find.  My wife doesn't want to move.

My wife and I have been looking at houses in the new area, and I'm quite certain my wife will never find anything we'll both agree on. My daughter has also been looking, and she wants woods, a tree house, a pool, etc... It's probably easier to build, assuming we can find suitable land.

The current house is a legal two-family.  It started out as a 1892 McMansion, and was a boarding house durring the depression, and was converted to a 4-family after WW II.  I bought the place 20 years ago, got married, had kids, and slowly improved the place and converted it to it's present state.

The house is in prime rental territory, being within a mile or so from most of the Boston subway lines, as well as convenient to Harvard, MIT, and Tufts.  Next year the Green line is expanding to our neighborhood.  Needless to say, the house has appreciated in value since I bought it.  Part of me sees us keeping this house and renting it out, probably by having somebody manage it for us.  In that case, I believe I'd get more by renting it as two units, as opposed to one.  The smaller unit can get $2K a month.  The larger unit maybe $3-3.5K, but that's just a guess. Of course, if we did that, I'd need a down payment for a new place to live, and we'd likely have a massive housepayment at the new place.  I suppose renting a new place might be feasible, as we don't have a liquid downpayment handy, unless I used crypto.

If we sold the existing house, we'd likely have a very small mortgage, if any.

We like where we live. We just don't like the leadership of the school system.  Both my wife and I are products of public schools, so this is frustrating. There are lots of restuarants, and everything is within walking distance.  Getting into Boston is easy with mass transit.  If we move, we'll be in need of driving to pretty much everywhere.  Right now, I drive to work, and to the kids school.  Both of our cars are EVs, and we'll never go back to ICE vehicles.

I'll probably work for another 10 years, and my wife wanted to retire already, but she's agreed to work at least for another 3-4 years.  Way back when, the goal was to have the house paid off before the kids started college, but with the private school bills, that's not going to happen.

Refinancing the house affects our ability to move, as the bank wont appreciate us changing our primary residence any time soon after a refi.  Qualifying for a new mortgage on a new place probably wont fly unless we can confirm rental income on the old house, and then there's the down payment.

So I'm frustrated and feeling a bit trapped.",finance

Bitcoin,"When federal digital currencies become a reality, how will that affect bitcoin?","Already we can see that China plans on making the digital yuan a near reality. They have invested in blockchain technology and they plan on getting rid of bitcoin, its main competitor. The sentiment from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is that they will only back digital coins that are issued by other central banks. Nationalists that are interested in protecting the value of their currency as well as the banking elite will always attack bitcoin. We have seen that happen in Turkey. Turkey's lira is experiencing rapid inflation so many of investors have started to put their money in bitcoin for safe keeping. Unfortunately Turkey has banned all cryptocurrencies.

China's digital yuan has the capability of tracking people's spending habits, where they send their money and potentially where they live. When you look at the future of digital currency, it may be headed towards the CCP's goals. There will be absolutely no freedom with spending habits being traced.

personalfinance,"When calculating the ""return"" on paying a debt, shouldn't you account for the additional income tax deductions as part of the return?","So it seems the standard equation goes like, you're guaranteed a return of the interest you don't have to pay, so a loan at 2% APR would guarantee a return of 2% if paid early.  So if you could make a guaranteed 3% elsewhere, say in Treasuries, it wouldn't make sense to overpay on your 2% loan since you'd be missing out on a 3% return to chase a 2% return.  Simple enough.

Some loans, however, allow for a federal income tax deduction on interest paid.  Shouldn't that be calculated into the return on overpayment?  Wouldn't that boost the return up to 25% or so, in certain cases?  For instance, if I overpaid my student loan payment by $1,000 while in forbearance and that amount went almost fully to interest, and being under the $2,500 annual limit, that $1,000 would result in not only the amount of interest saved, but also $250 less in income tax I'd have to pay, which, even adjusted for inflation until next year, is nearly a 30% return, isn't it?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Currency Staking-A ‘How To Guide’ ?,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. With the recent crypto dip, death cross, Fed and inflation, as well as basic market f**kery, I started DCA’ing into crypto earlier this year. Currently, I am looking at putting my crypto to work for me. I have seen blockfi, Celsius, Voyageur, as well as crypto.com all offer staking rewards, along with the Exodus/Yori/trust wallets. I like to think I have a more diverse crypto portfolio, and rather than constantly trading, I want to start putting it to work. If anyone has any good links, ideas, or even step by step guide on what is good, where to look, how to get started, it would be greatly appreciated. 

For instance, it would be great to learn how to use the sushi bar and stake my sushi myself, however, I am very leery about doing this, as I cannot find a guide, and don’t want to lose my hard earned cash. 

Further, I have looked at lending on AAVE, but all the research I have done has show me that a) I do not know how to even audit smart contracts and b) I am in way over my head. 

With the risk of permanent loss, I would rather know where the pros go (you guys), and then I would be able to learn more and utilize this knowledge myself.

If anyone has any advice, wants to chat, or knows of what to do, please let me know. 

Happy Father’s Day, and stay safe

CryptoCurrency,Arguably the most important information to beginners in the crypto space,"A coin’s price does not relate to its potential.

Far too many crypto beginners are gambling their savings into ElonsSafeDogCumMoon because its price is fractions of a penny. The coin developers do this on purpose to trick people into buying, because people think “it might be the next Bitcoin and go to thousands of dollars”.

In order for most of these coins to even reach a cent, they would need to have trillions of dollars invested into them. Far more than Bitcoin, the most valuable coin on the market by a decent margin, is worth. The way this works is because there are far fewer Bitcoins available for people to buy than a coin like SafeMoon.

If you are a beginner and didn’t know this, you can check the true value of a coin by looking at its market cap. It’s just the price multiplied by the amount of assets. Never FOMO into a coin because of “potential” without looking at the market cap.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Lost: How Best to Proceed,"I'm a bit lost .. looking for advice.

I finished grad school almost 2yrs ago and still have student loans (have not made any payments with the pause on fed student loans and covid and all). I feel pretty uncertain/uneasy about the state of the stock market, housing market, likelihood of impending hyperinflation and market crashes, etc. I relocated to a state/area that is not where I want to live long-term, though I could see staying put for 3-5yrs since my job is so lucrative and it's great experience for me. I'm in the SW, and the possibility of worsening droughts leading to uninhabitable conditions has been on my mind since I moved here. I can find work in pretty much any state in the US (though my income would almost certainly decrease at least a little if I were to relocate).

I feel pulled in multiple directions, and cannot make up my mind as to what would be the smartest move going forward. On one hand, I feel I should buy a house, since: a) it would be a hedge against any impending inflation, b) I currently pay more for rent that I would for a mortgage + hidden costs of homeownership, and c) I want to ultimately get into real estate as a primary method of increasing my wealth long-term (tax write-offs, rental income, stability of investment, etc.). However, I also keep reading how the housing market is back in bubble territory, how the indices are right about where they were in 2006, etc. .. which makes me hesitant to buy right now.


Numbers:

Income - ~$2x,xxx/mo+

Debt - ~$225k student loans (no credit card, auto, or other outstanding debts)

Savings - liquid ~$40k in personal accounts, ~$200k in business account

Investments - ~$85k in old 403b account, ~$6000 in ROTH IRA, ~$15k in brokerage account (stocks)


I've been working my 1099 job for barely a year, but there is a lender locally who has prequalified me for a home mortgage (up to ~$640k home loan given my income to debt ratio).

I don't see myself in the SW long-term .. I see myself relocating to a region that is more climate protected, though I would not sell the house if I do end up buying soon. I'd rent it out and pay off the mortgage as soon as I pay off my student loans.

What would you recommend here? Would you suggest NOT buying now, and just throw savings towards the fed student loan balance to pay that off asap (avg interest rate is between 6-8%)? Or would you recommend buying a house (with 3-5% down) and then start throwing money at the loans?

Appreciate any and all advice here .. I'm racking my brain trying to figure out the smartest move for me. Thank you!",finance

**Hi everyone!**

It has been a bit over two and a half years since my [100k update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9c43sq/24m_first_big_milestone_100k_nw_charts_and/). I recently turned 27 and only a few days later reached my 400k Milestone. Similar to the previous post, my intention is to keep this as a ‘journal’ of sorts to record the nuances of my mindset towards FI, work, and my ultimate life goals. Additionally, I’m always looking for advice from others as I make my way. The resources this subreddit provides are an unbelievable boon to anyone on the path to FI. It seems as though there’s always someone who has done or seen whatever it is you’re trying to do or wondering about.

**Spreadsheets and the “Boring Middle”**

I’m not sure who coined this term, but it’s definitely resonated with me after a few years of the never-ending drudgery of waking up early, pointless meetings, deadlines and the like. When starting with FI it’s nearly impossible to stop yourself from constantly checking the little changes in your net worth. Even after 4~ years of tracking my data I still find myself looking pretty frequently, but the itch has waned a good bit since the early days. This sheet has evolved and grown over the past year due to an obsessive amount of tracking. Eventually I stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7nglui/2017_yearend_review_and_pretty_charts/) by /u/FItemp34097. This helped take my tracking to new highs. I am forever in their debt!

Naturally, with it being a few more years down the road, I’ve got a lot more stats to talk about. Fortunately, I have some [charts](https://imgur.com/a/0S3OUtA) I am extremely proud of that really help answer some of the main questions you might have regarding stats. Extra info can be found in the album.

In my last post (I’m going to say this a lot… bear with me) I briefly touched on building a way to automatically grab values and pump them into my spreadsheet. I’m happy to say that I have effectively eliminated all the fun parts (in my opinion) of the *Boring Middle* by successfully automating ~95% of my monthly spreadsheet update. With a combination of the Personal Capital API, Venmo’s public API, and some automatic scraping of my employer’s Workday application, my spreadsheet updates itself on the 3rd of every month for the previous month’s data. Dividends. Expenses. Assets/Cashflow. Instantly processed and fed into the sheet. If you’re curious about this, feel free to PM me and I’d be more than happy to talk through what I did to get this working. Granted it took me the better part of 2 years to get it to where it is now, but maybe you’re on a similar path and looking for some inspiration/suggestions!

Right now, it’s relatively personalized, but I’m in the process of attempting to make a public utility such that anyone can provide their Personal Capital account and get back a similar spreadsheet of information out of it. I have a nasty habit of speaking things into existence so maybe that will become a reality another 300k from now…

**Current Lifestyle / About Me**

There aren’t too many extreme changes that I made since the last time I wrote. Despite the expectation I set for myself, I am still living with my parents at 27. Our relationship remains healthy and I’m in no immediate rush to leave. 

If you read my past post, I outlined that one of the issues I felt I had was that I was not spending enough in social contexts. I was originally worried that I was coming off as cheap. To help resolve this I did two things: I had a candid conversation with a couple of my closer friends and found out that it was all in my head for the most part. I also decided that I would try to avoid heavy limits on my spending when hanging out with friends. Granted my expenses have increased a fair bit because of this, but considering my expenses are already so low, the effect has been pretty negligible. I am keeping an eye on this to ensure I’m not going overboard. If I keep spending high without rent costs, they would likely remain high even after I move out due to habit.

This year I’m doing something vastly different from the rest. I have a friend who is a teacher that rents a shore house for the summer along with several other people. I was kindly invited this year and didn’t even hesitate with my response. It's a big change from several years ago when I know I would have had to spend a ton of time debating it internally. I knew I wanted the chance to live on my own for extended periods of time, but also to help meet some new people and make new friends. Not to mention getting to sit on the beach after work every day would do wonders for my mental health. This is definitely going to cause a spike in my expenses, but I think it will be worth the experience (and maybe help turn this SINK into a DINK? lol)

Side Note: As I’m typing this out, I’m sitting on the beach on a warm, sunny Sunday morning. Unprompted, two of my roommates started talking about how they don’t want their life to be a meaningless chain of working years leading into a standard retirement at 65. What a familiar thought! At the risk of sounding holier-than-thou (holier-than-them?), I feel so fortunate to be cognizant of my retirement plans so early on. Allowing myself to steer things towards a path of my choosing.

**Work Outlook**

Last time I mentioned feeling as if I was burning out at work. While my outlook on leaving the rat race as early as possible has not changed, my job itself has improved a good bit. My office was 4 miles from my parent’s house before, but since then the office has closed twice - once when they moved us to a new building approx. 20 miles away and then once again after selling the new office due to COVID. At this point we’ve been working remotely for more than a year, and I’m hoping to be able to convince my manager that I can continue working remotely indefinitely. Between remote work and a new manager that has allowed me to excel with autonomy, things have been solid. 

FI has been a great tool for getting me to where I am now. In particular, the Coasting chart helps encourage a wealth (pun not intended) of optimism in the ability to reach my personal FI goals given my current net worth. I frequently think to myself that if I ever really feel like I need to pull the cord and get out, I will be FI in 15 years as long as I can maintain enough income to cover expenses. The safety net it provides is such an immensely relieving psychological force. At the moment, I’m using this to try out a new role within my department that is needing to be filled because of someone leaving recently. If I like the new work and get the position, I will have moved up two role “levels” within a year, which would be amazing!

**What has Changed? What Has Not?**

I spoke a bit about my thoughts on Real Estate investment in my previous post. I think my mindset hasn’t changed much. I think I would eventually prefer to own a house at some point. I would love to be able to buy a house and have a few of my friends rent rooms from me, but it’s extremely hard to justify buying anything at a time like this. 

I wasn’t great about working out in the past. While I rode my bike and played soccer once a week for a couple seasons, I never really had any regular schedule. I still am not really there yet, but I have started taking up Indoor Rock Climbing at a local climbing gym. I was hooked immediately and try to go at least once or twice a week. The gym is rather far from my parent’s house, but over the summer, the gym is closer to the shore house so I’m hoping to take advantage of that as much as possible.

I gave blogging a try a couple years back.  I shut it down maybe about a year later, feeling as if I didn’t (and still don’t) really provide much of a unique perspective to the FI ‘scene’. Funnily enough, even this doesn't feel unique, but a decent response from last time encouraged me to write an update. It was nice to learn about how to run a website and play around with Wordpress, but running a blog felt like more of a chore to network with others than to actually write meaningful content. To that end I feel I did neither well enough. The amount of effort required to keep up with an audience was reminiscent of regular work. While I did end up performing some good thought exercises because of it, like doing the math on leveraging a mortgage, I think I was blogging for the wrong reasons, so I’m glad I stopped.

**General Investment Thoughts**

In my Roth IRA, I originally was investing in one of Vanguards Retirement Date funds at the suggestion of my brother back when I first started investing. Eventually I started thinking about the Expense Ratio differences between the Target Date Fund and the underlying funds the TDF is investing in. I found that investing in the Admiral Share funds for each of the underlying investments at the same allocation amounts was a slight improvement on the fees I would incur had I been staying in the TDF. While obviously the benefit of the TDF is the automatic Allocation shifting, I imagine that an annual checkup of the allocations of my funds is simple enough to stay on track as I get older. If you already checked out the spreadsheet, you can see how acutely aware of my allocation I already am so it’s a small enough effort to rebalance with the tools I have available  (thanks Personal Capital #ad).  Anyway, I wanted to mention this here to make sure I wasn’t oversimplifying the process and what I’m doing makes sense.

I found out that I am able to do a [Mega Backdoor Roth](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) with my employer’s 401k setup. I was nervous at first, but the process is extremely straightforward. This year we just went from being able to take 4 distributions a year to unlimited! Meaning I can immediately rollover my After-tax money every paycheck. It’s a bit of a process, but simple enough to prevent extra taxation.

Another [MadFientist tip was to frontload your 401k Contributions](https://www.madfientist.com/front-loading/). In order to do this, while retaining my max match, I contributed 50% for 6~ months and then reduced down to the max match % for the remainder of the year. I was extremely lucky that the market dove from the pandemic in the first half of the year, because I was able to take major advantage of this in a pre-tax account! (In hindsight this was a strange sentence to write..)

**What I’ve Learned**

* I’ve been furthering my finance knowledge - improving my understanding of the more important taxation rules that apply heavily to us that are trying to RE
* Further improving on my love for cooking. Trying out new things in the kitchen and expanding my ‘tool-set’
* Rock Climbing – Bouldering, Belaying, Lead Climbing
* Still learning how best to limit my spending while avoiding looking cheap
* Learning so much more for my field through my personal coding projects (Automation of Finance Sheets, An automatic sorter of PDF Files for all those pesky tax documents and the like)
* I’ve found an immense love for board games. Two of my favorites being Gloomhaven (Frosthaven already pre-purchased!) and Betrayal at the House on the Hill. I’ve been able to help friends and family find this same love as well
* Along the same lines, I’ve also started acting as a DM for my friends in a DnD campaign. We’re on hiatus while I’m at the shore, but hoping to play again soon

**What I Want to Learn**

* I want to get back into building things. I ended up putting off building the drawer I’ve wanted for a while. With lumber prices as high as they are right now, however, this might be an endeavor I take even further into the future
* I want to understand housing costs/the market better. I think I would love to have some sort of rental property at some point in my life, but pulling that trigger is really tough when you have such little experience. (Especially as someone who has lived at their parents for nearly their whole life)
* I still want to try and build a game. I need to find the motivation, but I’m sure it will strike... eventually. I found that my personal coding motivation arrives in spurts. If I force it, I won’t create what I want and it will become a chore.
* Similarly, I would want to make a board game. I'm known as the ""rules guy"" in my group so what better way to honor that title than to write some rules myself?
* I want to better understand the intricacies of an actual retirement strategy. My dad is retiring at the end of the year and I’m hoping to help assist him with his strategy, which will put me in a great position to see what a real retirement looks like financially.

**Notes to Those that Reached Out Me via DMs**

I apologize for essentially ghosting you. I rarely go on this account as it is, so I’m hoping you’re still around and are hitting your milestones for FI. I’m going to try to be more responsive this time around, especially to those reaching out about automation and questions for my spreadsheet. 

**Closing Thoughts**

I am eternally grateful that I found this community. Seeing a “way out” has kept me sane for the better part of the last few years working full time. I feel much more confident in my future after everything I’ve learned here.

As a form of “giving back”, as I had done last time, I plan to scrub my current spreadsheet and edit a link in for folks shortly after if people are interested. I had several folks asking about it last time so I figure it might end up being the same this time around. Hoping to see you all at some point in the next few milestones!",finance

personalfinance,Too Few Accounts Paid as Agreed / High Debt-to-Credit,"FICO ~825

I checked my credit reports and saw my Debt-to-Credit ratio is high so I apparently need to use more revolving credit.

Essentially my credit report is:

* Mortgage ~77% of the loan remaining
* Discover card with a $14,000 limit sitting on 5% used (paid off monthly so it varies but is always below 10%)

Total Debt-to-Credit ~70%

everything is paid on time but I pay some of my bills directly from checking instead of pushing those through the credit card.

I may buy a car within the next 12 months but if I do I'd expect to get a loan for a year or two with a very low rate. I could pay cash for the car, but I'm thinking put it on a low interest rate loan just to keep reserves higher for unplanned expenses.

So if I get another credit card I'd be using it minimally. Needs to be zero fees.

Should I 

* get a credit card and move one of my bills to it just to keep it active? If so which card?
* not get another card and be happy my credit is good?
* do something else?",finance

CEO of Food For Life Global Paul Turner says, “Happy to report that the Milk and Butter community of investors have now fed 442,968 children in need via Food for Life Global.” The diversity in donations allows for different care and treatment for those in need. The donations to Action Against Hunger will focus on helping children facing malnutrition. The money donated covers the cost of transportation, customs, medical fees, food, etc. “There is potentially 250 people who are here today because of you all so I just wanted to say thank you,” says Aron Flasher, Managing Director of Corporate Partnerships for Action Against Hunger.

Christian Claypool, CEO of Milk and Butter LLC, says, “With every donation we make, we're continuing to provide for those in need and generate a positive social output using our product and platform.“

CryptoCurrency,What is DeFi?,"I talk to several friends who have been investing in crypto some of them have been doing it for years. Imagine my surprise when they asked me ""What's DeFi?"" when I started to talk about DeFi. So this post should be able to explain DeFi.

***TLDR: At the bottom***

DeFi: what it is and how it works

The term “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services carried out on a blockchain. DeFi are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract. We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in layman’s terms.

So, for DeFi to work, it needs a decentralized infrastructure to run on. This is where the Ethereum blockchain comes into play. The Ethereum blockchain is a DIY platform for decentralized applications (DApps).

Most DeFi protocols operate on the Ethereum blockchain, although a few have migrated to other competing blockchains to enjoy greater speed and scalability.DeFi: what it is and how it works

The term “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services carried out on a blockchain. DeFi are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract. We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in layman’s terms.

## DeFi’s top applications — and notable protocols 

Now, that we know what DeFi is, let’s look at some of its notable applications.

**1. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**

Decentralized exchanges are exchanges that operate without an intermediary. They are not as popular as their centralized counterparts. 

With DEXs, users can connect directly with one another to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in a trustless environment. Assets traded under DEXs are never held in an escrow or third party wallet, as is done with centralized exchanges. Some top DEXs include Uniswap, Curve and SushiSwap. 

Centralized exchanges, on the other hand, are trading platforms operated by a central authority. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase are popular examples of centralized exchanges. They are custodial in nature. In other words, the buyers and sellers trust the central authority to keep their digital assets safe.

**2. Lending Platforms**

DeFi proponents say the decentralized lending platforms are democratizing the lending ecosystem. These platforms use smart contracts in place of intermediaries like banks — allowing borrowers and lenders to participate in an open system. Lenders can earn interest on their crypto assets by loaning them out, while borrowers can access liquidity without selling off their assets. 

With the traditional financial system, you need to offer collateral before you can access loans from the bank. This is similar to what happens in DeFi. Borrowers have to over-collateralized their loans by offering assets more valuable than the loan value. Some of the top DeFi lending platforms include Maker, Compound, and Aave.

**3. Prediction Markets**

A prediction market allows participants to make bets on the outcomes of future events. These platforms function like traditional prediction markets — but with blockchain functionality, which eliminates intermediaries. Examples of DeFi prediction markets are Augur, Gnosis and FTX. Crypto powered prediction markets flourished during the 2020 U.S. presidential elections. Augur recorded a milestone volume of over $8 million. Other platforms like Polymarket and Predictit also saw significant election volumes.

**4. Yield farming**

Yield farming is the process of locking up cryptocurrencies in exchange for a reward. It’s the hottest new term in the DeFi space. Money markets Compound and Aave are two major platforms to farm DeFi yields. Yield farmers stake popular coins like ether, dai, tether and others.

## DeFi benefits 

**1. Permissionless**

Traditional banks are expensive to run and bureaucratic in nature. They take too long to process transactions and have cut many people out of the financial system due to their stringent requirements. DeFi came to solve many of these issues. Here are some of its benefits.

DeFi opens everyone to the financial system irrespective of income, race, wealth, culture or geographic location. All a user needs is a mobile phone or computer with internet access.

There is a significant number of unbanked people globally. The World Bank estimated in 2018 that 20% of the world’s population lack access to banking services. One reason for this is that most of the unbanked lack much-needed know-your-customer (KYC) documents like state-issued I.D. cards.

Several DeFi platforms allow users to function without any of this. You can take out a Maker loan, for instance, without any identification or credit score.

**2. Interest rates for investors**

Beyond keeping your wealth like a savings account, DeFi also allows you to earn income. Platforms like Aave and Compound allow you to deposit assets and lend them out to borrowers. At an agreed-upon time, you get your interest and can plow your capital back into the system. 

Compound offers up to 4.3% interest on deposits from some tokens, while Aave is paying out as much as 5.73%. Compared to the 0.6% to 0.7% currently offered by traditional banks for savings accounts, it’s not difficult to see why some people are shifting their assets to DeFi. 

**3. Control over your own finances**

With DeFi platforms, you remain in control of your finances. While you have to deposit your funds into the platform, you decide what happens to them. Instead of trusting human intermediaries to qualify you for a loan or decide how to manage your investments, a smart contract does that.

No one can ban you from a DeFi protocol. The underlying smart contract is law, and it operates blindly. 

**4. Heightened transparency**

DeFi enables a greater level of openness and accessibility. Since most DeFi protocols are built on the blockchain — a public ledger — all activities are available to the public. Anyone can view transactions, but these accounts are not tied to anyone directly as is the case with traditional banks. Instead, accounts are pseudo-anonymous, listing only numerical addresses. Users with programming knowledge can also access most DeFi products’ source code to audit or build upon since they’re open source. Open-source codes are far more secure and of higher quality than proprietary software, thanks to community interaction.

## DeFi drawbacks and security risks 

**1. Security issues with smart contracts**

Smart contracts form the backbone of any DeFi protocol. But they are susceptible to manipulation. 

By default, smart contracts are open-source. This design allows prospective users to review them before investing in the DeFi protocol. Most DeFi protocols give their smart contracts to security firms to audit. This is where the problem begins. It’s not unusual for humans to miss flaws in these contracts, which could be exploited in the future. 

Take The DAO, for example. The digital “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” was an investor-directed venture capital fund of sorts that launched in April 2016 and grew quickly to become the biggest crowdfunding platform, managing about $120 million. However, by June that same year, hackers found a vulnerability in the smart contract and stole about a third of its funds. They moved the funds into a “child DAO,” which had the same structure as the parent protocol. Users couldn’t access their funds for weeks, making this perhaps the largest hack in crowdfunding history.

There have been several refunds since then, allowing investors with residual DAO tokens to get some compensation. However, the incident sparked an awakening in the DeFi space. Now, developers who build protocols ensure that their smart contracts go through multiple audit rounds 

**2. Data feed centralization**

Blockchain protocols can’t access off-chain data. To remedy this, many of them use oracles — third-party services that provide access to external information. Oracles serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world, relaying information to smart contracts for them to utilize. 

The major issue with oracles is creating a central point of trust into trustless and decentralized setups. This centrality provides a vulnerability for the entire smart contract. When an oracle broadcasts the wrong information, the consequences could be dire. 

Take the case of Synthetix — a DeFi asset issuance platform. On June 25, 2019, an oracle transmitted false price feed data to the platform’s smart contract. A user’s trading bot took advantage of this and inflated the user’s balance. This allowed the user to convert this balance to about 37 million Synthetic ETH (sETH) tokens (worth $70 million at the time). Synthetix confirmed that they reached out to the user, who agreed to reverse the transaction in exchange for an unspecified bug bounty. 

**3. Bad actors**

In September last year, the top crypto exchange KuCoin confirmed that it had suffered a hack that saw $150 million in bitcoin and ERC-20 tokens transferred from its hot wallets. Days after the event occurred, blockchain intelligence software Elliptic crunched the numbers and found that the exchange had actually lost about $281 million. 

The report added that the hackers had been laundering the funds through DeFi protocols Uniswap, Kyber Network and others. As Elliptic explained, many centralized exchanges had frozen the hackers’ accounts, preventing them from moving their funds. However, in DEXs, the hackers found the perfect conduits — platforms with no central authorities to freeze their funds.

We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in* ***layman's terms***\*.\*",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,State residency after marital separation for tax purposes,"This is a weird and slightly complex state income tax question, but I'm hoping that others here might be able to call out any obvious flaws in my logic, or might have other helpful suggestions.  I'll try to be clear and concise with the details.  Thank you in advance for any and all help!

\- I am currently a full-time resident of IL

\- My marriage has been struggling, and my wife and I have been considering separation.

\- One separation option has been for me to relocate to FL but still come back to visit here in IL frequently.

\- I am about to receive, within the next month, a quite significant amount of income in the form of short-term capital gains of equity in a privately held company being acquired by another company.  Both companies are based outside of IL.

\- IL allows us to file as ""married filing separately"" even if we file ""married filing jointly"" on federal, and we can declare different residency statuses from each other if we live in different states.

\- IL will require I pay income tax on any capital gains or other income that I earned while a resident of IL.

\- IL does not require I pay income tax on any capital gains or other income that I earned while a resident of another state as long as the source of that income was not from IL.

\- FL does not have any individual income taxes on income nor capital gains.

So my idea is that if I am able to very quickly establish a residence in FL before the transaction date of my equity for cash, the income will not apply to my IL state income tax, and I will save a fairly significant amount in tax savings.  More than enough to make this fiasco worth it.  

I believe that by signing a lease that begins before the transaction date, and perhaps acquiring a FL driver's license, I will have effectively established residency.  

For the record, this is all legitimate.  I fully intend to make FL my primary residence, and while I'd certainly visit family and friends in IL, I would not be living there.  I'm not trying to lie or cheat, just trying to determine if this plan has any tax/legal holes in it.

If anyone sees any flaws in this, or can confirm it should work, or maybe has other ideas based on my circumstances, I greatly appreciate your replies.  Thank you again!",finance
personalfinance,"Scared to invest in stock right now. Investment recommendation, please!","Hi, I recently sold an apartment and bought a house with a $335k loan with 2.62% interest rate. I was going to put more money in the downpayment but I was recommended to take out a larger loan since the interest is low. Therefore I ended having a large sum of cash ( over $180k) in my bank account. My original plan was to invest in stocks that could earn more than 2.62% but I am afraid to do so now because of the current uncertain economical climate. I have a child and have a 529 account with a small balance as well as my IRA account (small balance as well). For the same reason, I am afraid to put more money into these accounts. I thought of doing more crypto but it has been very volatile and I already lost over $6,000 and I don't feel like investing more in it either.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with the high possibility that the stock market could crash any moment, would you still invest rather than keeping the cash in the bank account? Are there any other options that you would recommend? I would love to hear your thoughts on this or your experience. Thanks a million in advance!",finance
Bitcoin,Inflation and it's effects?,"What should the inflation rate be for the USD and the Euro, i've been waiting for them to rise since the mass amount of money that was printed since march 2020. They've slowly started to rise the last couple months. But, all things being equal, what should the inflation rate roughly be if it the feds weren't lying?

I understand printing money is not the only deciding factor and MV=PY comes into account. Also that if every currency is inflating than it doesn't matter as much as they're competing against one another. But, bitcoin is present and has actually lowered it's inflation rate since the March covid outbreak.

I have so many questions that i would love to be helped out with, some you may not be able to answer as they are futuristic speculation.

\-Given that younger people generally are the people who have invested in bitcoin, could we see a huge shift when there are so many young people not needing to work due to retirement (Fire) being earned on the back of bitcoin ownership? What problems would this create for society?

\-If a switch from fiat currencies occurred, what would happen to the governmental control? The price would surge if governments tried to turn up and buy more btc than they already own in large amounts. (China 1% &amp; US 0.3%)

\-When will BTC become deflationary due to the fact that people are losing their keys at a certain rate, if that rate became greater than the mining rate?

\-Satoshi owns 5% of all bitcoin, would his ownership almost be like Bezos with Amazon, where even if he tried to give away to charity, etc., It would sink the price. (Assuming he is alive)

\-Historically reliable investments such as the index, are still built on energy or technology. Would they remain theoretically as reliable investments because those assets are necessary? Would they maybe just see a huge drop based on Fiat liabilities?

\-Countries such as Australia for example which are firmly seen as a first world country, four of their top 5 companies are banks. Could a huge reshuffle in national economics be disrupted? 

\-Although BTC was created to provide equal opportunities for people globally, could it have a reverse effect with people from third world countries not having a viable currency or technology to be able to access bitcoin?

I know a lot of these questions are speculative and no one really can tell the future but, i would love to know some opinions, be told i'm wrong etc and learn more.",cryptocurrency
economy,Debunking the Reverse Repo Mania,"What's a Fed reverse Repo? The simplest explanation of a Fed reverse repo is when a counterparty lends money to the Fed for 1 day. For a more detailed explanation read the wiki article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement#cite_note-NYT_WSBuzz-1

Who's doing the reverse repos with the Fed? Fed Reverse repos are being done by money market mutual funds NOT by investment banks and hedge funds. Here is the list of counterparties that are allowed to do reverse repos with the Fed: https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_counterparties#reverse-repo-counterparties

You'll notice that hedge funds and investment banks are NOT on this list. It's made up of Banks, Government agencies, and money market mutual funds.

Banks on this list are members of the Federal reserve and can earn interest from the Fed for both reserves that are required to be kept by the Fed and excess reserves. So banks don't need to use the reverse repo facility because they can earn 15bps (basis point is equal to 1/100 of a percent, 100bps=1%) interest on those deposits at the Fed, which is 10 bps higher than what the Fed is offering on a reverse repo.

Do you have any proof that the Fed is borrowing from Money Market funds?
Yes. You can see from these two charts that substantially all of the funds being lent to the Fed via reverse repos are coming from money market mutual funds. 

Total Reverse Repos with the Fed https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD#0

Reverse Repos with Money Market Funds: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL632051103Q

But wait a second. I saw Goldman Sachs on the list of banks. Aren’t they an investment bank?
Big companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley own multiple subsidiaries under one umbrella bank holding company and operate those companies separate from each other. Within this umbrella they own traditional banks that are members of the Federal Reserve. These banks are allowed to transact with the Fed, including doing reverse repos. They are not allowed to own or trade in stocks and are restricted in lending and investing opportunities. But the point is moot because if they have excess cash they wouldn’t use the reverse repo facilities because it pays 10bps less than funds on reserve with the Fed.

What’s stopping a money market mutual fund from doing a reverse repo with the Fed for the benefit of the umbrella company?
Separate accounting ensures that a money market mutual fund that’s owned and operated by a bank holding company that owns an investment bank does not have access to the funds of the investment bank. There is absolutely no benefit for anyone involved to risk their jobs and possible criminal prosecution to invest money on behalf of an investment bank to earn 5bps divided by 360 days? The stakes are so low it is not plausible. 

Why are money market funds lending to the Fed? Money market mutual funds usually lend money to investment banks, hedge funds and other financial intermediaries through a reverse repo transaction. Because they are supported by collateral, it's a safe way to earn interest on funds in the very short-term. However, these financial intermediaries are flush with cash and no longer need to borrow funds for daily securities transactions.

Additionally, most money market funds need to be fully invested at all times, as defined as 99.5% of the portfolio in investable securities and not cash. This puts them in a very difficult and unprecedented position when the markets push rates into negative territories. It means that they basically will have to pay someone else to take their cash. Luckily, we have not got that far yet, as the Fed offers to borrow money first at 0% and now at 5bps interest rate as the borrower of last resort through the reverse repo agreement.

Why do funds make their managers invest in securities instead of just holding cash? The decision to hold cash is left to the investor. If the investor decides to invest in a fund, that fund should be fully invested in the assets that it says it's going to invest in. Normally there is an opportunity cost associated in holding cash, as it does not receive much if any interest.

Does this affect anyone else besides money market mutual funds? No.

Does this lending to the Fed lead to inflation? No. Money has to be spent on something in order for it to have an effect on inflation. Whether it is consumer products, homes, stocks, bonds or anything else, a transaction has to occur for the price to be affected. Cash sitting in a money market account by definition is savings and does not affect prices. This cash being lent to the Fed actually temporarily drains the monetary system of cash, which is of itself a reduction of the money supply.

What about the interest paid to the money market mutual funds? Does this lead to inflation? No. The interest paid does increase the money supply but it is immaterial. The Fed is paying an interest rate of 5 bps. This does not mean that it is paying 5 bps. It's a rate. Much like if you were to borrow money from the bank through a simple interest loan at 10% per year with no prepayment penalties and pay it back in 1 day, you don't pay the full 10% in interest. You pay 10% interest for 1 day out of the year. So 5bps divided by 360 days is .00000139. So that is roughly $1388 in interest per $1 billion in value lent to the Fed.

Didn't something like this happen back in 2008 that foreshadowed the stock market crash? No. The exact opposite happened in 2008. Money market mutual funds stopped lending to investment banks because they lost faith in the underlying collateral due to liquidity and valuation concerns on non-government securities.

What about the collateral? Isn't there a need to do a repo with the Fed to get the collateral? This has nothing to do with the underlying collateral. The Fed has to offer up the collateral in order to soak up the excess funds. Collateral is exchanged in order to guarantee the loan, which is not an issue with the Fed.

Why is the Fed doing this? Because they don't want rates to go negative. There is a lot of cash and it needs to go somewhere. And the Fed will gladly take it back in order to keep buying bonds on the open market to keep long-term rates low and fuel the economy. The Fed wants rates to be low but not negative. Negative rates send a bad message to the public and undermine the Fed's long term goals.

What is the market for repos in the U.S.? As of 2019, about $1 trillion per day in repo lending. This of course was before the money supply increased by about 25% in 2020. So it could be much higher.

What's the limit on what the Fed is willing to borrow through reverse repos? The Fed has a limit equal to the amount of securities it has as collateral. This is approximately $8 trillion.

How much is the Fed borrowing? About $750 billion per day.

Is this a lot? Yes. Here is a chart of Fed reverse repo amounts. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD

How does this affect stock prices? It doesn't.

What if the markets crash? Did this cause it? No. It's specious reasoning to attribute cause to effect without a logical, valid and empirically-supported reason. For more info on specious reasoning watch this video by Lisa Simpson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSVqLHghLpw

CryptoCurrency,"When federal digital currencies become a reality, how will that affect bitcoin?","Already we can see that China plans on making the digital yuan a near reality. They have invested in blockchain technology and they plan on getting rid of bitcoin, its main competitor.

The sentiment from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is that they will only back digital coins that are issued by other central banks. Nationalists that are interested in protecting the value of their currency as well as the banking elite will always attack bitcoin. We have seen that happen in Turkey. Turkey's lira is experiencing rapid inflation so many of investors have started to put their money in bitcoin for safe keeping. Unfortunately Turkey has banned all cryptocurrencies.

China's digital yuan has the capability of tracking people's spending habits, where they send their money and potentially where they live. When you look at the future of digital currency, it may be headed towards the CCP's goals. There will be absolutely no freedom with spending habits being traced. This would be good for the government that is interested in stopping money laundering but it'll also introduce a new level of technological privacy invasion.

CryptoCurrency,Why DeFi Is More Than A Ponzi Scam :D,"Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",cryptocurrency

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",cryptocurrency

# Exchanges (centralized cryptocurrency purchasing platforms)

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) \- Accessible through their app or website. Coinbase is a good place to get your feet wet learning how to purchase cryptocurrency. The interface is simple and straightforward. They offer opportunities for earning free crypto. One caveat is that they charge high fees. Consider making your first purchase here, but don't linger on this specific platform unless you enjoy paying a premium to purchase. [Market orders](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/orders/overview-of-order-types-and-settings-stop-limit-market) are the only type of purchase supported by Coinbase.

[Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/oauth_redirect) \- This is the full-featured Coinbase platform. If you sign up for Coinbase then your credentials will grant you access to Coinbase Pro. Despite the Pro moniker, Coinbase Pro is free to use, with no subscription or one-time fee required. Coinbase Pro has lower purchase fees and offers a greater availability of cryptos for purchase. If your Crypto of choice isn't listed on Coinbase, check Coinbase Pro. The Pro platform also grants the ability to place [limit orders](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/orders/overview-of-order-types-and-settings-stop-limit-market), a useful feature if there is a specific price at which you wish to purchase or sell.

[Binance.us](https://Binance.us) \- Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Binance currently hosts a platform specific to the US market, i.e. [Binance.us](https://Binance.us). If you're unable to find the crypto you want to purchase on Coinbase, try Binance. You can save on fees by purchasing and holding the BNB coin.

[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)\- A US based exchange that touts 24/7 customer support and low fees. You can choose to use their platform through the Kraken Pro app or your computer browser. They have an easy to use, clean interface. Kraken supports both market and limit orders.

[FTX.US](https://FTX.US) \- Low fees, attractive UI. Web based and mobile app.

[Gemini](https://exchange.gemini.com/)\- A US based exchange licensed in New York. Gemini touts their focus on security. They have a mobile app or you can use your browser.

&amp;#x200B;

# Security

Security needs to be your number one priority. The crypto space is new and mostly unregulated. There's money to be made and plenty of bad actors who want your crypto. These are the easiest steps you can take to secure your crypto.

1. **Use a password manager** and create **secure, unique passwords** for each account.
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** but DO NOT rely on your phone for receiving 2FA codes. Bad actors can use social engineering to change the SIM card associated with your mobile phone. Use a service like google authenticator, [Authy](https://authy.com/), or [freeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/). An even better option is a physical key like the [Yubiko Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=pd:search&amp;utm_campaign=USCA_B2B_LeadGen_DuckDuckGo_SEM_Generic&amp;Brand&amp;utm_content=).
3. **Address Whitelisting.** At some point you will likely want to move your crypto from the exchange to a secure wallet. Even if you decide not to move your crypto off the exchange, address whitelisting can add an additional measure of protection. When address whitelisting is enabled, the exchange will permit withdraw of your coins ONLY to the verified addresses listed in your address book. There's often a set waiting period of 24-48 hours after adding an address to your whitelist. This allows you time to review changes to your address book if, for example, your exchange account is hacked and a bad actor attempts to add their wallet address to your address book. Whitelisting is also useful in minimizing copy/paste or transcription errors when transferring coins. Once your wallet address is whitelisted, you can perform a small transfer as a test to make sure you've entered it correctly. Hereafter you won't be required to copy/paste the address from your wallet to the exchange transaction page.
4. **Custom email headers** are useful for reducing the chance of falling victim to a phishing scam. You will select this option on the exchange security page and enter your own customized header word or phrase. This word will appear in the header of all email communications from the exchange to verify that the communication is legitimate.
5. Don't use public WiFi for anything crypto related.
6. Don't use the exchange apps to track your gains/losses.
7. Don't do anything crypto related on shared devices.
8. Write down your seed phrases and keep them secure.
9. Don't print out your seed phrases or store them on any digital device. Ever. Never ever.
10. **Never share your seed phrase or private keys** with anyone, ever, for any reason.

# 

# Staking

Staking is a method for earning passive income with coins that utilize the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The short of it is that networks want coin holders to stake their coins because it increases the security of the network. When you stake your coins, and enhance network security, you are rewarded with more coins at a (usually) variable annual percentage yield (APY), i.e. interest rate. The rough analogy is earning interest on dollars in your savings account. However, when you stake your coins your rewards are paid in crypto rather than dollars. For example, if I stake Cardano ADA, my rewards will be paid in ADA.

The method of staking, APY, cooldown period, withdraw restriction, etc. will all be determined by the respective blockchain rules. Some blockchains, like Algorand, have simple and straightforward rules. Algorand holders automatically generate staking rewards by holding ALGO in their wallet. There is no need to delegate ALGO for staking and no need to claim rewards. Rewards are granted automatically.

Other blockchains, like Cardano, have more complex staking rules. [This infographic](https://nocentralauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cardano-delegation-cycle-rewards-1024x840.jpg) explains the process far better than I can. You can see that there is a 20 day waiting period after staking before you receive your first rewards. Don't freak out when you don't see your rewards after the first week.

When in doubt, visit the official blockchain website for staking rules. Most blockchain projects also have subreddits that can be a helpful resource.

It should be noted that **Ethereum is a special case**, in terms of staking. Ethereum is a proof of work blockchain with plans to transition to proof of work blockchain (Ethereum 2.0) at a yet undetermined date. It could be late 2021 or 2022. There's no certainty. ETH holders can stake their ETH in some places, e.g. Coinbase, but you will be unable to withdraw your ETH until after the transition to PoS. This has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are earning yield on your ETH and more or less being forced to hodl, regardless of price action. Paper hands take note. The disadvantages are that your ETH will be locked up for an unknown period of time, so if you believe you may need to sell for fiat or sell to take profits, you will not want to stake. There's also the risk that the PoW -&gt; PoS transition could be unsuccessful or hit a major complication, which could cause the price of ETH to drop dramatically.

# Cryptocurrency Wallets

You have a number of options for storing your cryptocurrency. Wallets can broadly be categorized as custodial and non-custodial. Custody refers to the agent who holds and controls your **private keys**. A private key is your proof of ownership for your coins or tokens and grants you permissions to spend them.

**Custodial wallets** store your private keys on centralized servers. You do not control your keys and you do not have access to them. You rely on the custodian to keep your private keys safe and secure. The advantage of custodial wallets is that you can restore access to your account in the event of a lost password. Custodial wallets, however, are susceptible to hacker attacks. There is a risk of losing your crypto. E.g. MtGox and Blockchain.info were both hacked and users lost hundreds (thousands?) of bitcoins.

**Non-custodial wallets** store your encrypted private keys on your device. You have full control and access to your private keys. If you lose the device (e.g. phone) containing your non-custodial wallet, then you can restore your wallet and private keys using a **mnemonic seed  phrase.** The seed phrase is a string of 12-25 words that will restore your wallet when entered. Word order is important.

If you want to read more about wallets, /u/niehle recently wrote an [excellent primer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o2zhtt/a_wallet_doesnt_hold_any_coins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

# Hardware (the gold standard for security)

Hardware wallets are the gold standard for security. They are non-custodial wallets which work with multiple blockchains and allow you to restore assets with a single seed phrase. Hardware wallets connect to your device via USB or bluetooth when you want to make a deposit or withdrawal. It's important to understand that the hardware wallet doesn't actually store your coins; they reside on the blockchain. Your hardware wallet stores your private keys and your private keys are protected by a PIN, sometimes a phrase. This prevents your funds from being accessed in the event that you lose your wallet. Trezor and Ledger are the two industry leaders for hardware wallets. It is important to **always purchase hardware wallets directly from the manufacturer**. Buying from Amazon, eBay, etc can put you at risk of using a corrupted wallet.

[Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison)\- Seems to be the most popular option and offers two models: Nano S and Nano X. Coin options are more limited with the Nano S, but is a good option if you don't own many altcoins. See link for models comparison. Do note that Ledger exposed 270,000 customers' personal data to hackers in July 2020. Specifically names, emails, **home addresses**, and phone numbers were leaked. This leaves those customers highly susceptible to phishing attacks. See above for importance of custom email headers.

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/#comparison)\- Second runner up for hardware wallets. Trezor makes two models; Trezor One and Trezor Model T. Trezor has the advantage of Ledger in terms of screen size and supporting more cryptocurrencies, although they recently stated that they are not considering addition of new coins/tokens (*probably needs to be confirmed*).

# Non-Custodial Wallets

[Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/) \- A non-custodial mobile app wallet which can be linked to your Coinbase exchange account. Mentioned because this may be the easiest option for new crypto traders who get their feet wet buying with Coinbase. Supports BTC, LTC, XLM, DOGE, and all ERC-20 tokens. Does not support staking in wallet. In-app DEX support and NFT support.

[Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/)\- Offers both computer and mobile apps. Exodus can be used with your Trezor wallet, has responsive customer support (see their subreddit) and offers support for over a hundred cryptocurrencies. You are also able to stake some cryptos within the Exodus wallet, including: ADA, SOL, ALGO, VET, ATOM, etc. Also offers an in-wallet exchange, but the minimum exchange amounts and fees are high. You're paying for convenience with this feature.

[Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/) \- Supports a large number of coins and tokens. Allows staking of a large number of coins with attractive interest rates.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) \- Supports a huge number of assets. Staking available for a limited number of coins. DAPP support in-app.

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) \- A popular browser and app wallet that supports a large number of coins including all ERC-20 tokens. It is compatible for use with Ledger hardware wallets. This wallet can be bridged to the polygon network and is very popular with DeFi users. Note that the browser extension has a number of permissions that some consider risky. If you use Brave browser, you can limit this wallet extension's access to websites only when you click on the extension.

# Custodial Wallets and Services

Why would you use any of these services considering 1) they hold your private keys 2) there are myriad options for excellent non-custodial wallets? Earnings potential. For starters, proof of work coins, like bitcoin, cannot be staked so you are unable to earn interest from those in your non-custodial wallet. (I'm excluding DeFi liquidity farming here).

Many of these services earning money by lending your crypto to institutions, similar to conventional banking. You deposit an asset, like BTC, and earn interest at a variable APY. A particularly attractive option if earning interest on stablecoins like USDC, USDT, or GUSD. Very simply, stablecoins are crypto assets linked to fiat currency, e.g. the US dollar. They very best stablecoins have 1:1 backing and do not vary significantly from their matched asset. Why is this an attractive option? Many of the services listed below offer excellent interest rates on stablecoins. Where your ""high yield"" savings account may offer 0.4% on USD deposits, the services below currency offer &gt;10% APY on stablecoin deposits. Meaning if you have a liquid USD emergency fund sitting in the bank, you can move a portion to stablecoins and stop losing money to inflation.

If you want to read a comprehensive analysis of the revenue models and security for the institutions below, [see Steve Sokolowski's report here](https://prohashing.com/guides/earning-interest-on-cryptocurrencies).

[Ledn.io](https://Ledn.io) \- In terms of security, Ledn is the most attractive option for interest earnings on stablecoin and BTC. Ledn is backed by Genesis, a juggernaut in crypto lending. Ledn is transparent and undergoes proof of reserves attestations semi-annually.

[BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/)\- Probably the industry leader by name recognition. BlockFi offers more currency options than Ledn, including ETH.  They security is not as good - you may be familiar with a recent snafu where they [mistakenly deposited BTC into user accounts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-mistakenly-credits-users-with-too-much-bitcoin-in-promo-payout) and then allowed users to withdraw that BTC, which rightfully did not belong to them.

[Celsius](https://celsius.network/)\- Offers interest rates higher than many competitors and supports a large number of coins. Reportedly poor customer service, though I can't personally attest to this. Somewhat riskier business model that Ledn and BlockFi.

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/) \- Similar to Celsius in business model. Also offers attractive interest rates and supports a large number of assets.

# Portfolio Tracking and Coin Performance

As mentioned above, you don't want to open your preferred exchange app to watch the progress of your crypto purchases. Consider using one of the services below to create a portfolio for tracking your profits losses. Some of these services offer an option to connect your exchange accounts for automated portfolio tracking. I can't in good conscience recommend that. Enter your transactions manually and consider reducing every entry by an order of magnitude to obfuscate your actual holdings.

[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\- Accessible through browser or their app. An excellent resource for price tracking and coin education.

[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)\- Very similar to CoinMarketCap. Offers some coin performance metrics not available on CoinMarketCap.

[Coin Codex](https://coincodex.com/) \- Haven't used this one personally, but they do offer portfolio tracking and real time prices.

[Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/prices-all/) \- Useful if you want to do your own technical analysis.

[Prices.Org](https://Prices.Org) \- Crypto news, prices, and market insights.

CryptoCurrency,Are there any blockchain-based (or decentralized) social media sites that are worth checking out?,"I'm an artist and creative writer and I'm looking to build an online presence, but I'm frustrated and fed up with the way centralized social media is handled.

I want to move away from places with Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook etc. because I believe the future of the Web is one that is decentralized and controlled directly by the people.

I've been looking around and I've found several decentralized social media sites, but it's hard to tell which are worth investing my time into. So I figured I'd ask if anybody here has had much success with any decentralized social media sites. 

(when I say ""success"" I simply mean ""do you enjoy using that platform?"")

I know a lot of blockchain-based and decentralized social media sites have big crypto communities, which is to be expected, but ideally I want to find a place which has a varied enough audience that I can build a following based on my creative work (and not just a crypto echo chamber).

CryptoCurrency,"Goldman Sachs: ""Crypto: a new asset class?'","This is Goldman Sachs most recent 'Global Macro Research' report, which highlights crypto as a 'Top of Mind' concern...

""With cryptocurrency prices remaining extremely volatile on news about regulatory crackdowns, environmental concerns and heightened tax scrutiny even as interest in crypto assets from credible investors has been rising and legacy financial institutions—including ourselves—have been launching new crypto offerings, crypto is undoubtedly Top of Mind. We first wrote about bitcoin in 2014 and cryptos more broadly in 2018, exploring the potential and risks of the crypto ecosystem. Amid the recent volatility, here we focus on whether crypto assets can be considered an institutional asset class. 

We start by speaking with Michael Novogratz, Co-founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, which is active in crypto investing and trading, asset management, and venture financing. He argues that the mere fact that a critical mass of credible investors and institutions is now engaging with crypto assets has cemented their position as an official asset class. And, despite the price volatility, he doesn’t see the institutional interest in bitcoin, which he primarily views as a convenient store of value, waning as long as the current macro and political backdrop—in which the government has no imperative to stop spending on social issues that the Fed is largely financing— continues, and crypto remains in the adoption cycle. 

Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, agrees that institutional investors now generally appreciate that digital assets are here to stay, with investors increasingly attracted to the finite quality of assets like bitcoin—which is verifiably scarce—as a way to hedge against inflation and currency debasement, and to diversify their portfolios in the pursuit of higher risk-adjusted returns. Even though crypto assets have behaved as anything but a diversifier over the past year—selling off more than traditional assets as the COVID-19 pandemic set in—he says that their faster and stronger rebound in 2020 only reassured investors about their resiliency as an asset class. 

But what makes a crypto like bitcoin—which has no income, no practical uses and high volatility—a good store of value? Novogratz’s answer: because “the world has voted that they believe” it is. Zach Pandl, GS Co-Head of Global FX, Rates, and EM Strategy, largely agrees, arguing that bitcoin’s potential for widespread social adoption given its strong brand on top of its other properties, such as its security, privacy, transferability and the fact that it’s digital makes it a plausible store of value for future generations. And he believes that institutional investors today should treat bitcoin as a macro asset, akin to gold. 

GS commodity analyst Mikhail Sprogis and Jeff Currie, Global Head of Commodities Research, for their part, argue that cryptos can act as stores of value, but only if they have other real world uses that create value and temper price volatility. This, they say, best positions cryptos whose blockchains offer the greatest potential for such uses, like ether, to become the dominant digital store of value. More broadly, Currie contends that cryptos are a new class of asset that derive their value from the information being verified and the size and growth of their networks, but that legal challenges to their future growth loom large due to their decentralized and anonymous nature. 

And Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU’s Stern School of Business, entirely disagrees with the idea that something with no income, utility or relationship with economic fundamentals can be considered a store of value, or an asset at all. Despite the recent crypto mania, he doubts the willingness of most institutions to expose themselves to cryptos’ volatility and risks, which the volatile price action in recent days has served as a stark reminder of. 

Christian Mueller-Glissmann, GS Senior Multi-Asset Strategist, then makes the case that for an asset to add value to a portfolio, it has to offer either an attractive risk/reward or low correlations with other macro assets, and preferably both. He finds that a small allocation to bitcoin in a standard US 60/40 portfolio since 2014 would’ve led to strong outperformance, owing both to higher risk-adjusted returns for bitcoin compared to the S&amp;P 500 and US 10y bonds, as well as diversification benefits from relatively low correlations between bitcoin and other assets. But with this outperformance largely owing to only a handful of idiosyncratic bitcoin rallies, he concludes that bitcoin’s short and volatile history makes it too soon to conclude how much value it adds to a balanced portfolio. 

But beyond the debatable role of cryptos as a store of value and investible asset, does the broader crypto ecosystem provide promise for investors? Novogratz and Sonnenshein strongly believe that the answer is yes, given a myriad of potential use cases for crypto assets. In particular, Novogratz sees the three biggest developments in the crypto ecosystem—payments, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and nonfungible tokens (NFTs)—mostly being built on the Ethereum network, which suggests substantial upside for it and various DeFi applications. But Roubini contends that few successful applications of blockchain technology exist today. And he sees many potential corporate uses of it as “BINO”—Blockchain In Name Only. In short, he’s skeptical that blockchain technology will prove revolutionary because “the idea that technology can resolve the question of trust is delusional.” 

Mathew McDermott, GS Global Head of Digital Assets, then explains why GS has (re)engaged in the space—in two words: client demand—and how interest in cryptos differs between client types—from asset managers who are seeking portfolio diversification, to high-net-worth clients who are increasingly looking for exposure to broader crypto use cases, to hedge funds that are largely aiming to profit from the basis between going long the physical and short the future—an arbitrage that reflects the difficulties that still persist in accessing the market today. 

Beyond this issue of market fragmentation, we conclude with a look at some of the other main obstacles to further institutional adoption of crypto assets. Alan Cohen, previous senior policy advisor to former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and former GS Global Head of Compliance, explains how regulators are looking at crypto assets today. Michael Gronager, Co-founder and CEO of blockchain investigations firm Chainalysis, explains what is— and isn’t—included in their analysis that finds that less than 1% of all cryptocurrency activity is illicit. And Dan Guido, Cofounder and CEO of software security firm Trail of Bits, discusses the black swan technological and security scenarios that all investors in the crypto ecosystem should be aware of.""",cryptocurrency

investing,A Stock market's most popular trade faces 'perfect storm' A 'cyclical correction is now underway,"The Fed’s decision to end the easy money era of the pandemic sent shockwaves through the market and put the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its worst week since January. 

Cyclical stocks on Thursday, the day after the announcement, suffered their worst day in over a year when compared to defensive stocks as investors feared the central bank’s tapering could derail the economy. Cyclicals include sectors like industrials, energy and financials, whose performance is tied to the whims of the economy. 



A ""cyclical correction is now underway,"" wrote a team led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. 


He noted this week’s hawkish shift by the Fed is ""bad news"" and adds to the troubles that were presented by excess positioning, China tightening and fading hopes of additional fiscal stimulus in the U.S. 

The Fed on Wednesday held its benchmark interest rate near zero and maintained its bond-buying program at a pace of $120 billion per month, but moved up the forecast for its first rate hike to 2023 from 2024. More members, but not a majority, said the first rate hike could occur in 2022. The central bank also teased an end to its asset purchase program, but did not give any specifics as to when the tapering might begin. 

The Fed last year cut interest rates to near zero and pledged to buy an unlimited amount of assets to support the U.S. economy through its sharpest economic slowdown of the post-World War II era. 

The yield on the 10-year bond note fell to 1.45% on Friday in response to the Fed’s tightening plans. It hit a high of 1.75% on March 31. 

David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Toronto-based Rosenberg Research says that **adjusted for interest rates, the S&amp;P 500 is 20% above its intrinsic value.**

He believes investors would be foolish to ignore the signal that real rates, or those adjusted for inflation, are sending to the stock market.



""Overweighting defensive sectors and secular growth segments that tend to benefit by a sharp slowing in GDP growth, is a sound strategy,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, if the message from real rates proves prescient, investors will be well advised to trim their cyclical exposures.""",finance

Forex,DXY/EURUSD Analysis Thread.,"First off, happy belated *farter's* to all fellow *farters* of the sub. I hope you all enjoyed the spoiling this past weekend (I had a few make up sessions haha). 


This report is a little tardy but the analysis is still relevant. 



Adding our beloved EURUSD (DXY) back to the watchlist. As previously  [discussed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/n3zt7l/eurusd_full_analysis_short_term_bearish_bias/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), we are out of the short trade with good gains. 



Although we are bulls in this market (bearish on the dollar), we can't shake the feeling of last week's market behaviour. It's as if market participants didn't know what the decision was going to be during the FOMC press. 





**Fundamentals**



We do remember last year [over here ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-june-2020-133528214.html) that the decision was made to keep interest rates low until 2022(3). Meaning, there's nothing that's changed in terms of sentiment and fundamentals - especially with the new administration.



With that being said, we still had climactic buying (or should we say rally rather) in the dollar off the support level. 


2 reasons come to mind. One being impulse buying off support levels prior to release, the other being short sellers getting squeezed out of their positions prematurely.




Now that we understand there's a possibility of continued buying in the dollar(I personally would like to differ), let's get into our short analysis.  



We've traded off the support ([here](https://imgur.com/yREI3BL)) (resistance ) level we analysed a month ago and price dropped to possible areas of demand. 



One thing worth a note from this [image](https://imgur.com/YunNmJ8)  is how this structure already looks like a double bottom (we know what these mean especially in macro lenses). 




Which is why for now until price action gives us reason to look bearish we'll be bullish looking. This and the QE that could cause a weakened dollar by failing to meet demand(_sentimental analysis_)




The area price is currently resting was a level of reaccumulation which led to the removal of a [previous highs](https://imgur.com/XcUG4xw) which would have otherwise acted as a supply zone to keep price trending lower. 


Meaning this may be a good level to start looking out for accumulation price action in anticipation for buying. 



A breakdown below 1.53 (those equal lows) or just the bullish engulfing candle, the bullish idea is invalidated(see the weekly chart)



Looking at lower timeframes for the validity of the current zone we're looking to buy from we can see that the price action that took place in the current price level led to a previous price structure break([here](https://imgur.com/isL6Oa7) &amp;[converse](https://imgur.com/XcUG4xw) ). Meaning that the quality is good enough to cause a shift in price

An opposite but same price action is seen in the Dollar where a HL was broken and a new Low was created (see previous image) leading to what we call BOS(break of structure).

Meaning price will have to return to the origin that caused the structure break in order for it to continue with its new bearish momentum



You can take this information and use it in the direct opposite for the EURUSD



Failure to sell off may result in a rally that could last until the last point of supply[(lpsy here)](https://imgur.com/HseRwVM) which is $96-97. Which means we can buy the retest of the break at the potential neckline (~$87)


For more confluence, monthly seems to have broken dynamic support and retested as [evident here ](https://imgur.com/B33xkS5)






**Other Pairs To Trade Along Such Analysis**



Adding USDCAD as well along with the USD pairs. [USDCAD Monthly](https://imgur.com/G7Y7Nsx)





We've taken profit just as well in anticipation of a downturn. Oil prices may cause a continued rally in the pair but I believe that the dollar supply could still prove a stronger issue against its reign over the Canadian Dollar.





Here we have a macro size ([distribution](https://imgur.com/B4qgflf) which is very likely to cause a long term bear trend in the pair. 


We will be following closely for distribution signs in the lower timeframes

Weekly doesn't give us a clear picture of where we could start looking to sell, which is fine. 




Once there's some sideways trading, we'll investigate which side of the market wins the battle.






GBPUSD will also be added to the watchlist. As previously discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/nm96f6/gbpusd_a_technical_analysis_and_discussion/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)



Given the Dollar maintains its predetermined weakness, we hypothesized before a halt around these levels a few weeks ago. 


Reason for it to be these levels is because a resumption of the major trend means not breaking lower than these levels (until ~1.36400). 

A breakdown and close below those levels could mean an end to the bullish rally on the GBPUSD that started towards the end of 2019.




We are going to be trading off a bullish engulfing pivot (although fresh demand zone in the daily) - see the daily chart for reference) 







**Possibility Of A Failed Setup**





**A strong theory that may invalidate this hypothesis is that**; with lowered rates kept low for the period highlighted, a lot of demand may actually meet the supply caused by QE. Since lower rates lead to eased borrowing. The one thing we can hold on to is that it could be increased corporate borrowing as opposed to individual investors meaning that the lower rates could be advantageous to the equity market which is usually negatively correlated to the dollar.

ethereum,Thoughts on Sorare (Ethereum NFT based game)?,"Hi fellow redditors, I'd be very interested in hearing you guys' thoughts on **Sorare**, since I've seen that related recent posts on crypto-subs have been getting some traction.

For those who have not heard of it, here is my current understanding of it:

Sorare is essentially similar to a classical fantasy football game, only that you play with digital cards. Sorare cards are NFT's (digital collectibles) using the Ethereum blockchain. Each football player's card is tradeable inside and outside of the platform and depending on their performance in real-life games, they can score points that would increase their card value and assist it's owner to be elligeable for rewards when partaking in Sorare tournaments.

It's basically a crypto variant of FIFA'S Ultimate Team (for those familiar with it) in the sense that you can acquire player cards which can then be featured in your squad for you to compete with others.

Each card is subject to a limited supply and features various characteristics like age of the player, a serial number and a scarcity (Unique, Super Rare (10 copies) and Rare (100 copies)). There are multiple layers that define the value of a card:

1. its collectable desirability (as any other NTF)
2. its in-game value, depending on player perfomance/skills and
3. a third-party game value (which I have not yet perfectly understood, but apperently there are other games where these cards can be used).

Not all global football leagues are yet covered by Sorare, since they require to enter licensing deals with league federations and teams. However more and more regions and teams have been joining over time and the platform seems to be growing quite rapidily in terms of player base, supposedly being backed by prominent football players (Griezmann to name one, can't remember the others).

I have bought/sold a couple of cards now, without participating in the tournaments yet. Also, I do not have yet gotten a good grasp on how ETH volatily affects card prices and in-game rewards/prizes. But in general, the game and its mechanics have been fun and enticing so far.

**Do you guys think that this platform could have some serious potential?** I am worried for it to be a bubble of which the tokens will eventually end up having no value at all. On the other side, I could also see or other similar platforms arising or the game getting very popular. To me it seems like Sorare has the first mover advantage, since it already acquired many licenses and thus could potentialy be viable as an investment opportunity (e.g. buying undervalued players and sell these with a premium combined with collecting in-game money prizes).

**Does anyone have any experience with this specific or similar games/platforms and would be willing to share?**

Finally, I don't mean to shamelessly plug my links, but If anyone is planning on joining or trying out the game, you might aswell use my referal link: [sorare.com/r/kyrotos](https://sorare.com/r/kyrotos).

personalfinance,Credit score dropped 60 points,"So I’ve always had awesome credit and never had any real financial problems. There were even periods when I only put a few very small charges on my card to keep it active and would pay things off almost immediately.

I recently moved though, and I put a lot of moving expenses on my credit card. I’ve had the charges get pretty close to the limit because of this, but I made decent payments (several hundred dollars). I recently noticed though that my credit score fell by 60 points, and I’m worried that if I keep using the card it’ll keep negatively affecting the score.

I know this is dumb but my family is planning a vacation and I would need to pay for my part with this same card, and these new charges would put it near the limit again.

I looked at the big 3 credit agency reports just now and saw I only have 2 hard inquiries, for my new apartment and a new car that my family helped pay a big part of right at the time of purchase. I do have a small car loan now through the car company, and two small federal student loans in deferment. I also just closed 2 store credit cards I opened years ago and never used.

I've been doing more reading in this sub, and based on what I've learned, it's been very helpful to better understand what events trigger investor's moves.

I am hoping to better understand the relationship between Federal Reserve announcements and how that impacts investment moves into and out of certain sectors, market caps, or asset types. Other indicators that I will be monitoring are the 10 Year Breakeven Inflation Rate, Inflation for consumer prices in the U.S., S&amp;P/Case Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, CPI, PPI, and GDP. Are there any that I am missing?

My goal is that this thread can serve as a resource to help newer investors better understand the economy and how to better flesh out a strategy. Regarding the partial list of indicators that I've provided, I was hoping to get contributions where people would provide input in a manner along the lines of ""When I compare home prices to inflation and unemployment rates, that tells me that I should start looking at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and the reason I say that is because \_\_\_\_\_"". I think that something like this would promote healthy discussion as well as outline how the various moving parts impact behavior.

Ultimately, if there was some sort of flowchart similar in nature to the one I listed above, that would be a really quick and useful tool. But a thread that is full of conversation could serve that purpose as well.

Remember technology is 10x deflationary. Even if there will be inflation, it will be temporary and technology will continue to bring the prices down.

https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/

Please see where we are in this chart in relation to past cycles.  History, as often is stated in this group, never repeats but often rhymes.  We are at 1 of 2 phases in this cycle if we are in relation to any BTC cycle history.  Either we are about to crash another 30-50% again and BTC will be on a fire sale, or we are somewhere around 2014, and BTC is about to do it’s second massive run up.

Honestly, I see us plummeting further, just because of the dying of hype, the strong media turn against crypto, the “booming” economy, the fed becoming more “hawkish,” the doge crash, and of course the China FUD.  All of these things hurt investor confidence in crypto for the short term.  So while I don’t see us going to a full despair crash from here, BTC 20k is absolutely a real possibility, and so is full scale crash in all alts.

Listen, if you invested more than you can afford to lose, and you -need- the money, you probably shouldn’t have gotten into crypto.  But at this stage, if you can leave it in, you should.  If you can’t, then I’m sorry, come back when everyone is saying crypto is dead.

And if you can afford to lose the money, getting out now is a dangerous ploy.  Stake your crypto, prepare for the Hodl, and earn more coin while the market whipsaws.

Not financial advice but, remember, there were people who bought BTC at $1200 and sold at $400 thinking it was gonna go belly up.  Don’t be those people now, because in 4 years, 30k will be a fire sale price.",cryptocurrency

After these 3 years my salary will jump to around 250k. I currently live with my parents and am able to save 2500/month from my salary of 60k. I am planning on entering REPAYE loan repayment program (gov subsidizes half my accruing interest costs every year as long as I make minimum payments (100/month) while putting the 2500 into index funds, then refinancing my student loan debt after residency to a more decent rate (3-4%)and taking the money accrued over 3 years (90k + market return)  from the index funds and making a balloon payment towards my student loans. From there I would live on 60k and use the rest of my income for loan repayment/savings. Goal is to be debt free within 4 years after residency (I will be early 30s at this time). Public loan forgiveness is not really an option as I don't plan on working at Federally qualified health clinics for the whole 10 years and there benefits/pay tend to be lower in my area.

My question is, does it make sense for me to pull out the 16k in stocks and put it towards my loan now and what else would you guys recommend/change regarding my plan. Thank you!

CryptoCurrency,MicroStrategy really paid $54930 net per BTC,"I made this comment on another post but its worth saying it again. [MicroStrategy's latest senior notes maturing in 2028, to raise $500m, came with 6.125% yearly interest](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-completes-500m-offering-of-senior-secured-notes-due-2028-with-bitcoin-use-of-proceeds_06-14-2021). 

It means they need to pay out $500m \* 0.06125 = $30.625m interest each year (assuming non-compound interest). 

So the full cost of this funding is 7 \* $30.625m + $500m = $714.375m

Therefore even though MicroStrategy said they bough at an aggregate price of $37k, the NET cost is  $714.375m / 13,005 = $54,930. i.e. they would need to sell these new BTC at or above $55k before their position would be profitable. 

Personally, given the interest rate and the net cost being significantly higher than the market price,  MicroStrategy almost seem desperate to buy more regardless of the premium to do so. Clearly they (its board) believe BTC's market value is significantly discounted.",cryptocurrency

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. The Ecosystem is getting even bigger every day we inch closer to Alonzo! [https://twitter.com/TyIsDigital/status/1394345977952284676](https://twitter.com/TyIsDigital/status/1394345977952284676)
2. The Cardano Foundation is out to do something incredible with supply chains as described in the fireside chat! In his previous Cardano Live appearance, Frederik Gregaard, CF CEO, also expressed a very healthy and sustainable perspective on what DeFi should become. He compared the current state of DeFi to just moving funds from your left pocket to your right pocket and taking profit.

3. The ISO model entering the capital formation toolbox in Cardano is going to make the stake pool game extremely interesting with SPOs scrambling to find the right balance between rewarding ADA and giving their delegators other things like tokens. Some stake pools could even become like portfolio funds with relationships with many different projects the tokens of which are given to delegators. Babel Fees could also play a role here for smart SPOs as they may allow access to a wide variety of tokens in the ecosystem that could be used to reward delegators with a sort of index fund exposure to a wide variety of Cardano projects.
4. May Cardano 360 coming one week from today (always the last Thursday of the month). [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1395117067960045569)

6. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

7. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
8. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

29. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

30. Cardano 360 is tomorrow. Don’t miss it if you want to hear about all the awesome things happening with Alonzo (smart contracts), Hydra (scalability), and everything else! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338)
31. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
32. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
33. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
34. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
35. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
36. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
37. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
38. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
39. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
40. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
41. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
42. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
43. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
44. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
45. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
46. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
47. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
48. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

51. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
52. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
53. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
54. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
55. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
56. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
57. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
58. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

67. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

78. This could have huge ramifications for bank and accounting treatment of Bitcoin potentially including that banks might suddenly be allowed to handle Bitcoin as a foreign currency. Today it was BTC. But, wait until they find out what Cardano can do. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1401334421773504517](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1401334421773504517)
79. Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, also clarified that there will be no capital gains taxes on Bitcoin since it is a “legal currency” and crypto entrepreneurs will be given instant permanent residence.

personalfinance,Great credit but high pre-approval car loan rate?,"I just started looking into a new (for me) car. This is my first time buying one. 

Background info about me:
-27 y.o. 
-salaried (~80k)
-about 2k in monthly expenses 
-current car is paid off but isn’t technically mine, my dad’s on the title
-credit history: approximately 20k left in student loans, oldest are 9 years old, and one credit card. At the credit union, the guy told me my credit was 797. 

My dad wants to give “my” car to my younger sister to use for attending community college in the fall, hence why I need a “new” car. 

I went to my credit union and completed a pre-approval loan application. Just found out today that I would be accepted, but due to my “lack of credit history”, the interest rate would be 7.1% for a 5 year, $30k loan. 

Is that also a really high rate to you, or does that make sense given my history? Wondering if I should shop around for better rates or if this is probably as good as it will get? 

I know going used is best, but the used market is very tight rn. Leasing could be an option, but I would definitely drive over the annual mileage limit.

personalfinance,Cash out refinance home to pay off car,"Firstly I want to say thanks to everyone on this sub.  I recommend it to sooo many younger people to help them keep good financial decisions on the front of their mind.  One of the healthiest subs on reddit in my opinion with regards to toxicity.

Anyways.  So I bought a house 2 years ago in Phoenix and the house has since appreciated by about $120k.  Around the October time period I would like to do a cash out refinance and hold onto the money.  The goal would be to potentially use the money for a down payment on a second house if the market comes down and a good deal comes up.  If not i'll just pay the money back or invest it elsewhere.  For me the extra money spent in interest is very much worth the potential opportunities for investment it opens up.

Part two is that I need to purchase a new vehicle.  I know I know taking money out to pay for a car.  Typical bad investing but i've spent the last 10 years driving a $500 geo metro and doing all the work on it myself and getting good gas millage to save every cent possible so I could buy a house.  Now I just can't do the unreliability anymore...it's 115 degrees and I don't even have AC.  I find myself not going out just because I don't feel I can trust the car not to break down and it's not healthy for me mentally anymore.

So here's my question.  Do I need to wait to do the refinance before I buy the car?  Or can I buy the car right now.  Lets say I end up with a $300 payment.  And then in October when I refinance can I tell them I want to pay the car off and have them put that money aside in escrow so that car payment doesn't effect my debt to income ratio?

I know this could potentially be dependent on the lender (Wells Fargo) but i'm just wondering if this is generally a normal thing so I have some knowledge going into it when I chat with the lender.

If you've made it this far I appreciate your time and thanks again to everyone in this sub!  It for sure helped me get through all the hard times when I felt like no amount of saving would ever be enough.  This sub really does prove that for most people personal wealth is absolutely achievable in the United States contrary to what the news would have you believe.

Couple extra things.

\-Yes if the market crashes by the end of the year I can still afford the car payment

\-The car loan will likely be at about 1% so if I can still refinance out without paying off the car and just take out less against the house i'll do that depending on what the new interest rate on the house would be.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 21, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 21, 2021**

***Please Note:*** *Hello friends! If you were wondering where the Daily Market has been the last two weeks, I have had a great few months in the market and decided, now that I am fully vaccinated and the US is reopening, to go on vacation to New York (I live in California). I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.*

Stocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve’s outlook was announced. If anything, last week’s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. 

Last week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. 

In my opinion,  it seems the Fed’s decision to leave out a “taper timeline” in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are “transitory” (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another “Taper Tantrum” like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed’s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum [here,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp) but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. 

Moreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. 

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.

For those who have not heard of it, here is my current understanding of it:

Sorare is essentially similar to a classical fantasy football game, only that you play with digital cards. Sorare cards are NFT's (digital collectibles) using the Ethereum blockchain. Each football player's card is tradeable inside and outside of the platform and depending on their performance in real-life games, they can score points that would increase their card value and assist it's owner to be elligeable for rewards when partaking in Sorare tournaments.

It's basically a crypto variant of FIFA'S Ultimate Team (for those familiar with it) in the sense that you can acquire player cards which can then be featured in your squad for you to compete with others.

Each card is subject to a limited supply and features various characteristics like age of the player, a serial number and a scarcity (Unique, Super Rare (10 copies) and Rare (100 copies)). There are multiple layers that define the value of a card:

1. its collectable desirability (as any other NTF)
2. its in-game value, depending on player perfomance/skills and
3. a third-party game value (which I have not yet perfectly understood, but apperently there are other games where these cards can be used).

Not all global football leagues are yet covered by Sorare, since they require to enter licensing deals with league federations and teams. However more and more regions and teams have been joining over time and the platform seems to be growing quite rapidily in terms of player base, supposedly being backed by prominent football players (Griezmann to name one, can't remember the others).

I have bought/sold a couple of cards now, without participating in the tournaments yet. Also, I do not have yet gotten a good grasp on how ETH volatily affects card prices and in-game rewards/prizes. But in general, the game and its mechanics have been fun and enticing so far.

**Do you guys think that this platform could have some serious potential?** I am worried for it to be a bubble of which the tokens will eventually end up having no value at all. On the other side, I could also see or other similar platforms arising or the game getting very popular. To me it seems like Sorare has the first mover advantage, since it already acquired many licenses and thus could potentialy be viable as an investment opportunity (e.g. buying undervalued players and sell these with a premium combined with collecting in-game money prizes).

**Does anyone have any experience with this specific or similar games/platforms and would be willing to share?**",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Big problem,"I'm selling a bunch of worthless stuff (to me) from the garage so I can buy all these dips, but I have a big problem. I can't decide what I want! I love ADA, ALGO, Cosmos, and recently started looking at Matic. 

I'm really looking into something with decent interest so I can set it up, forget it, and come back at the next peak a happy happy man.

Matic has good interest rates on celsius, but it's kind of my last choice because it hasn't lost as much as the others so there's possibly less chance for gain. Also I'm still a bit iffy on celsius. It's got a bright future as long as etheruem does though.

ADA has ok interest rates but not great. I also see it as the most risky because it's mainly academic theorizing atm. It somewhat runs the risk of another coin beating it to it's intended purpose if it isn't careful. I do believe in it though. It is one of my first picks despite the lower interest rates. It hasn't lost much either in these dips, so once again lower gain potential from a comeback.

ALGO, I feel,  has a real shot of adoption or implementation from government and institutions. Let's face it. We all hate the central authorities and their control of the economy, but they aren't going anywhere. If crypto really takes off and super powers adopt it as a form of currency ALGO is up there for 1st choice. It's got ok interest that I can claim directly from my ledger too. It is my first pick.

Cosmos is really attractive because it's fundamentals haven't changed (that I know of), but it took a rather big dip in price during this crash. I also bought into it really low and like the passive coinbase interest. I feel like for short term gain it has great potential. I'm not as emotionally invested in it though.

Honorable mentions of course are chainlink and polkadot. These are ones that I like, but probably won't invest in with this money. A bit iffy on polkadot but those interest rates are choice.

What would you guys invest in right now if you came into approximately $2k?

personalfinance,Sanity check on California condo purchase,"Hey everybody, just looking for a sanity check on our numbers for purchasing the condo we currently live in. The landlord has decided to sell at the end of our lease, and rather than move out of a place we love, we're leaning toward offering to purchase it.

The landlord hasn't actually told us his asking price yet or what kind of offer he's looking for, so we are planning based on the Redfin estimate. Obviously we'll reevaluate things if his asking price comes back higher than the estimate, but for now that's the only number we have to work from.

**The property**:

* Bay Area, CA - 2bd/2ba condo
* Redfin estimate: $939,000 (we're using $1M for our mortgage calculations to give ourselves a cushion in case the landlord goes higher)
* HOA: $460/mo
* CA property tax: ~~\~$7,000/yr~~ Edit: actually more like \~$11,000/yr
* Homeowner's insurance quote: \~$25/mo (Edit: maybe more? that's the quote we got but data suggests it could be as high as $150/mo)

**Us**:

* 2 unmarried^(1) software engineers in their mid-20s
* 780-820 credit scores for both
* Our combined base salary amt: $290k/yr
* Our combined total comp amt (pre-tax): $420k/yr
* No debt except for $650 car payment, but the car will be fully paid off in a few months
* No kids now or in the future
* We live frugally and are good at saving and investing, with total tax-advantaged retirement savings of \~$400k after 3 years in the workforce. We don't travel much and are planning to stay in the area for at least 5-10 years

**The mortgage**:

* 12% down (\~$120k). Most of this would be coming from sold equity (we weren't keeping cash for a down payment since we weren't planning on buying), which means a lot of capital gains taxes this year unfortunately
* We've been quoted rates of 2.8%-3.25% from different lenders depending on how many points we purchase at closing
* 30 yr fixed rate jumbo mortgage
* Estimated monthly mortgage payment of \~$4700, give or take, including property tax, PMI, and HOA
* To contrast, we currently pay $3500/mo rent, but this was a great pandemic deal that we are unlikely to get elsewhere for a similar rental, based on looking at several places over the last week. Current similar rentals go for $3700-4000/mo

**Questions we have**:

* If we're doing an off-market sale with our current landlord, we don't need a real estate agent, right? My understanding is that agents are most helpful for navigating the housing market but are less involved when you've already decided on a place.
* Does it still make sense to get a home inspection done if we've been living there for 1 year and haven't noticed any issues? Inspections aren't too expensive so we're leaning toward getting one regardless.
* Should we go through an online-only lender like [Better.com](https://Better.com) or a bank like Chase? We've received similar quotes from both but [Better.com](https://Better.com) seems to have the lowest rate overall due to not having PMI. However I'm a bit suspicious since I can't figure out *why* they don't charge PMI.
* Is it generally a good idea to purchase the most points possible at closing to lower the monthly payment? I'm wondering if we should just put that toward bumping up our down payment a little, or just invest the difference. We'll math it out but I'm wondering if there's any common wisdom here.

The biggest issue I'm concerned about is that we weren't planning on buying a home so soon, so we would need to sell considerable amounts of company stock and mutual funds to get to a 12% down payment, let alone 20%. That means capital gains taxes, which are a bummer (but were going to happen at some point, right?). Otherwise, this feels like a good deal, since interest rates are super low and we'd be avoiding the current insane housing market by buying privately from our landlord.

My sense based on number crunching is that we will be fine given our high incomes and job security as SWEs in the Bay, but obviously we're young and this is a huge purchase, so we're looking for outside opinions. If there's anything we haven't thought of and need to consider, we're all ears.

^(1) I'm aware that this subreddit tends to dogpile on people who want to purchase property before marriage. We've been living together with joint finances for many years, and plan to sign a tenants-in-common agreement before finalizing any house purchase, so we have legal protections in the event that we split up down the line. The primary reasons we aren't married (not that these are anyone's business) have to do with taxes and wedding costs. As high income dual earners, we don't benefit from any tax advantages of being married, and we get better rates on health insurance, etc. separately through our own employers. With that said, courthouse marriages are cheap and fast so if anyone has solid arguments for marriage before house purchase that are NOT addressed by a tenants-in-common agreement, please feel free to share.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to allocate monthly savings while trying to buy a house.,"I am 28 years old and just recently got my first job out of college. I am currently making 65k a year and live with a roommate. I have no student debt or CC debt, but I do have a 15k loan on a car with a 1.99% interest rate.

I currently have 20k in a savings account and about 2k in my traditionally 401k (getting employer's match). After expenses each month I have about $1700 left over to save.

I just recently learned about investing and I am really interested in putting away more money into my traditional 401k and I'd like to put some money in both national and international ETFs (and maybe a little into a appreciating dividend ETF for fun.

With all that being said, my biggest goal in life is to own a home to call my own. I understand there are enormous closing fees with buying a home, and if I do not do a conventional loan with less than 20% down than I will be paying PMI/MIP insurance.

I've been aggressively saving my money for a house in case the market crashes, but it would be nice to also start dollar cost averaging into some stocks, but I also want to keep my savings on hand for rainy day and (not all, but some) for a house down payment.

The question is would if owning a home is so important to me should I avoid investing all together in order to buy a home (and possibly buy one if there is a crash), or should I start investing and  pull out some funds from these investments (assuming they are positive or negligibly negative) to buy a house if there is a good opportunity? Another option would be to take out a FHA loan and swallow the MIP insurance, and then allocate any additional funds to the house down payment.

Alternatively, I could put a % of each month's new savings into each category, such as raw savings, active investments, and 401k, or perhaps there is a safer investment alternative.

As you can see I am a bit overwhelmed by the options, but it feels wrong to have any more savings than I already have without investing. But liquid funds may be essential in the near future to buy a home.

TLDR: I want to buy a home, have 20k saved, save 1.7k a month. Not sure how to allocate my new 1.7k a month to set up for my future and to be able to buy a home.",finance

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin: Past, Present, Future.","Lets talk about how Bitcoin. What is it? How does it work? What is its future?

So Bitcoin is a ledger (record) of transactions (data). It is more commonly thought of as a payment system with no middle man. So no banks, or credit card processors telling you where/how you can spend your money.  But how would this run? Who would pay for it?  So what Satoshi (creator of bitcoin) thought of was incredible.  He would create an system for ""miners"" to keep a copy of this ledger going. In order to incentivize these miners  for lending their computing power (writing to the chain), there would be rewards for each ""block"" mined.

Miners are competing to write each block. They computer for the right to the block by having their computer solve a complex algorithm that validates and orders the transactions. Basically like having a computer keep trying random numbers until it hits the correct combination. Whatever computer solves this first, is allowed to write the block to the ledger.

With all the recent news, I am sure we all know by now that Mining cost money, (electric, maintenance, knowledge, time, etc.) In the beginning, anybody could mine bitcoin with their computer and have a chance to ""win a block"". But in today age, it has become more specialized. Specific equipment, networking, cooling, etc.  Basically only huge investors with big bankrolls can successfully mine. (Think datacenter big).

So what rewards do miners get? They get the ""reward"" offered by the original network protocol, plus transactions fees paid by every person who writes to their block while it is being solved.

Originally when Bitcoin was created, there were only 21 millions coins created. That’s a finite amount. No more will every exist. So for every block that is mined, the winner receives part of that 21 million.  It started with 50 coins to the winner, then every 4 years or so it halves.  25, 12.5, 6.25 (Where we are now).  This will continue until all of the bitcoins are rewarded.

This means that when Bitcoin was created, the mining reward was never meant to be the driving factor to keeping the network alive.  If it was, then the whole thing would die once there was no more reward, and nobody to keep the ledger going.  So again, Satohi was thinking way ahead of everyone else. This means the intention was that once the rewards were gone, the miners would make just as much or more solely off the transactions fees contained within the block.

This is where things get interesting.

For the amount of reward from transactions fees to stay high enough to incentivize (stay profitable) miners, the blocks would need to fit millions or even billions of transactions. (As the prices to mine goes up).

There are two ways to go about this.  

The first is to raise the transactions fees to interact with the ledger. This results in what todays bitcoin looks like.  Small Blocks, (MBs in size) with very few transactions. Where if I want to send my local coffee shop 3 dollars in bitcoin to pay for a coffee, I have to pay 30 dollars in bitcoin fees. (And wait a long time for them to be verified). You can get around this by using ""lightning networks"", but in reality, this is payment channel that is being created between two parties so that they can pay small fees, but the transactions take place OFF CHAIN. (Defeating the purpose of a public, immutable ledger.)  In both of these situations, the fees collected during the block solving time, will not be enough revenue to incentive miners to keep the ledger alive….

The 2nd way to fix this is to uncap the block size.  Make the data capacity unlimited, resulting in blocks with HUGE numbers of transactions.  This not only allows miners to stay profitable, thus keeping the blockchain ledger alive, but also keeps the transactions fees to pennies for the people interacting with the chain. So now, in that same situation, I can play my local coffee shop 3.01 or even less for my 3 dollar cup of coffee, and they will get the money instantly.

Now…. some of you know what I am about to say, others may be hearing this for the first time.

investing,"House prices, inflation, and interest rates","Everyone knows the housing market has been extremely hot, many calling it a bubble. But is it really, or are we actually in the early innings of the start of a massive appreciation of home prices much more than we've already seen? 

First, housing pretty much only goes up looking at [20+ year time spans](
https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/).  I don't own a home (or any REITs), but housing is increasingly looking to me like the safest possible bet over the next decade.  I was going to wait out the storm to buy, but now I'm questioning that logic. It's also (IMO) by far the safest way to be leveraged, especially for a first time homebuyer.

People bring up '08, but I think it actually strengthens the case if anything. If you bought ""the average"" home at the absolute worst time at the very peak... you'd be up around 50% today. And  besides the appreciation in value you received the added benefit of living in the home, or collecting rental income if it's an investment property.

Then we have inflation. Whether transient or not, inflation is an absolute boon for debtholders. If you think the fed is wrong and inflation is going to be terrible, then buying the most expensive home you can reasonably afford seems like the best choice as inflation will eat away at the interest and maybe even some of the principal if it stays high enough long enough. Also the link above shows that over any 20+ year period, house prices have risen in actual value, adjusted for inflation.

The interest rates are still incredibly low and the Fed is going to slowly raise them, and a small amount. The current mortgage rates are basically unheard of in US history.  This is like a once in a generation opportunity with rates this low. 

Finally this seems like a straightforward supply and demand problem. The supply of desirable homes grows slowly, because (for example) in desirable locations like London/NYC/SF development is extremely slow or nonexistent due to housing and zoning laws. And the demand grows constantly, because the population size is increasing.

Am I looking at any of this wrong? How are home prices not going to spike even more hugely than before in the current environment? 

**tl;dr** low interest rates are good for housing, high inflation is good for people with debt, buying even at the peak of the housing bubble in 08 means you are up hugely today, and the population grows faster, than houses in desirable locations can be built. All seem to point to an increase in home prices",finance

personalfinance,7 year auto loans can be good - change my mind?,"I find myself disagreeing with a lot of mainstream personal finance advice - especially in the market we've seen for the last 10 years. Here is an example. I hear pundits say you should never take on an 84mo auto loan because you may pay an extra $2k in interest than a 5 year loan. The other negative I hear is that if you total the car, you may owe more on it than it is worth. Consider this scenario. 

1. I have $5k in cash I can put this towards a down payment and get a 72mo loan or I can put it into the market and earn interest and get an 84mo loan. assume 1-2% interest in both cases
2. the 84mo loan gives me an extra $80/mo that I am saving an investing because of a lower monthly payment. the 72mo loan costs me an extra $1.5-$2k
3. I believe inflation is going to outpace normal benchmarks in the next 1-3 years - and real inflation may get as high as 8%. I expect my salary to grow commensurate with this (high employability, growing industry).

In the case of the interest - we could do the math but investing the delta in monthly payment is putting money in the market and earning interest much higher than the extra interest on the car. In the case  where we risk owing more on the car than it is worth - I am faced with the option of giving the bank $5k on day one to avoid this, or once again investing this money, earning interest and only having to cough up the $5k in the case I total my car and need to pay off the gap the bank. Still much better to have my money in the market. 

Please tell me what is wrong with my logic here? I am aware this logic starts to fall a part pretty fast when interest rates are higher than inflation benchmarks or better than what the market is returning.  However, interest rates on auto loans are quite good right now for credit worthy individuals.",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata. [https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg](https://youtu.be/JW6s9Jkyazg)
2. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
3. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency? Tax evasion in crypto is also obviously a target problem since we know only about 800 people a year paid taxes on crypto in 2013-2015.

4. The Cardano Foundation has released the full video of the Fireside Chat with Eva and Fred. Lots of questions answered on a variety of fronts. Very interesting remarks including that in discussions with financial institutions, Fred has found they are interested in exposure to the alpha provided by the asset class in general, tokenization of assets, and the yield provided by staking rewards. Fred counters that they SHOULD be far more interested in the Cardano standard including the concepts of reference accounts, programmability of money, and transaction metadata.

5. In a video press release yesterday, the Fed finally admitted that it’s moving toward a central bank digital currency (just like every other central bank). This will eventually be impactful on Cardano and every other crypto ecosystem. [https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag](https://youtu.be/WOAQxpG79Ag)
6. The Treasury is trying to figure out how to get cryptocurrency regulation in a headlock. This will probably go hand-in-hand with the Fed’s March toward a CBDC. Afterall, what good is all the tracking and monitoring afforded by a CBDC if it’s easier for everyone to just use a non-central bank digital currency?

24. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

26. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
27. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
28. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
29. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
30. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
31. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
32. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
33. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
34. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
35. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
36. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
37. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
38. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
39. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
40. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
41. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
42. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
43. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

46. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
47. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
48. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
49. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
50. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
51. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
52. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
53. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

62. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base.

CryptoCurrency,The Bank of France did yet another CBDC test on a “public blockchain” on 6/18/20. Prior tests have been on ETHEREUM; reasonable to assume this smart contract test was as well,"The bank of France successfully did ANOTHER CBDC test on Ethereum 6/18/21 and no one is talking about it.

In a press release issued two days ago (6/20/21), the bank of France noted it has been carrying out a series of CBDC tests since March.

The original legwork for these test was first announced in oct 2020 when, Consensys, a European blockchain developer for ethereum, announced that they were going to work with Societe Generale – Forge, the bank's digital assets arm, providing technology and expertise as part of ongoing CBDC pilot efforts.

In April, Lex Sokolin, head economist at ConsenSys, said: ""We think that Ethereum will become a global digital economy, settling the movement of all types of value across the world, including a meaningful portion of traditional financial services.""

The third test in an ongoing series was the 24 hr settlement of a 100million EIP issued bond in April.

Specifically, on 27 April 2021, the EIB launched a multi-dealer unsubordinated, unsecured 2-year bond issuance (EUR 100,000,000) on the Ethereum mainnet, for the registration and settlement of the securities, in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, Santander and Societe Generale.

In a partnership with Banque de France, the payment of the issue monies from the underwriters to the EIB were represented on the Ethereum mainnet in the form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

In an April 28th press release, Linklaters LLP, an international banking firm, noted: “We are delighted to have been involved in this first of its kind transaction, providing capital markets, data protection, fintech, outsourcing, tax, technology and US federal securities law advice to valued client EIB across a range of jurisdictions. Our global team worked hard to assist our client navigate highly innovative and complex issues, including the registration of the Notes in the Ethereum public blockchain (as a dispositif d’enregistrement électronique partagé under French law) and their issue on a delivery versus delivery basis against CBDC.”

  This month, on 6/18/21, a second test was performed “on a public blockchain” to test smart contract settlement of securities using TARGET-2 Securities (TS2), the European securities settlement project.

In the test, the CBDCs represented listed securities designed to trigger TARGET2-Securities on its Conditional Securities Delivery feature. Though the central bank didn't' state the name of the public blockchain, it has previously used Ethereum in its experiments. 

The test was performed in collaboration with Switzerland-based cryptocurrency bank, SEBA, LuxCSD, and Luxembourg’s oldest private bank, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg. 

A total of 8 experiments are planned to date. Notably, another experiment between the Banque of France and Switzerland’s Central Bank is to commence sometime in the near future.

The joint experiment (“Project Jura”) will explore cross-border settlement with two wholesale CBDCs and a French digital financial instrument on a distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. It will involve the exchange of the financial instrument against a euro wholesale CBDC through a delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement mechanism and the exchange of a euro wholesale CBDC against a Swiss franc wholesale CBDC through a payment versus payment (PvP) settlement mechanism. These transactions will be settled between banks domiciled in France and in Switzerland, respectively.

Circumstances have come up where my husband and I need a second car within the next 2 months. We have a lot of cash flow, but recently bought a house and furniture and so we don't really have any extra cash beyond our healthy emergency fund ($35K). In the next two months I estimate we can save $6K for a down payment. I want to go with either a new car or a lightly used car and I think the car budget is somewhere around $30K.  We are looking for a small SUV with 4-wheel drive given we live in a snowy area and plan to have kids soon. I am happy to keep the car for 7+ years and so I don't think leasing is for me.

So I'd like to know all there is to know about financing a car. Do I call up and get preapproved or should I get financing from the dealer? Is a 20% downpayment about right? How long are loans for? What are interest rates? Are there any other levers I can pull to get a better rate?

Any tips and tricks? I know we're in a car shortage, but unfortunately there doesn't seem like a lot I can do to wait beyond maybe September.",finance

Bitcoin,Making sense of the market and China FUD,"The current dip in the cryptocurrency market is very healthy for the industry. There are many factors at play here including the federal reserve becoming more hawkish in their economic rhetoric, thus leading to contractions in the price of commodities and the tendency of investors to move away from risk-on assets. Also, the cryptocurrency space tends to follow the price action of Bitcoin and currently Bitcoin is receiving FUD surrounding China deciding to effectively ban Bitcoin mining and trading within the country. 

What many people don't realize is that China doing this reinforces why having a permissionless free monetary system like Bitcoin is important in the face of totalitarian governments. There's also a silver lining in that Bitcoin mining moving out of China alleviates some of the concerns people had about China's control over the Bitcoin network through its hashpower and its use of dirty energy to facilitate its production. With mining moving out of China, the network hash power should gravitate towards more democratic and clean energy providers thus strengthening the security and ethical consumption of the network. Regardless, having a monetary technology that frees us from the theft of our value through inflation by Central banks is a huge step forward in my opinion and is worth the energy needed to provide that in a secure and transparent fashion.

CryptoCurrency,Legendary Investor on Bitcoin — Paul Tudor Jones Explains Why Bitcoin Is So Attractive,"***TLDR is located at the bottom of the post***

The year 2020 will forever be remembered as a special year in the history of Bitcoin. There will clearly be a before and after of the COVID-19 crisis. The responses of governments and central bankers to this pandemic of a magnitude not seen in decades have exposed once again the flaws in the current monetary and financial system.

Even those who had always refused to open their eyes realized that we were in the middle of great monetary inflation.

Under these conditions, it became obvious that it was up to each individual to make the best decisions to protect their money future. If you don’t do it, no one will do it for you. You cannot rely on governments and central bankers to make decisions that will preserve the fruits of your labor over the long term.

# Paul Tudor Jones was the first prominent institutional investor to take a stand in favor of Bitcoin

In the world of institutional investors, many had already been tempted by Bitcoin for several months, but one fear remained. The fear of being misperceived by the rest of the profession. Indeed, Bitcoin was still seen as a dangerous investment at the beginning of 2020 in this world.

And then, in May 2020, one man came out of the woodwork to change everything. **The announcement made by this legendary Wall Street investor will probably remain as the tipping point for Bitcoin**. That man’s name is Paul Tudor Jones.

In May 2020, shortly before Bitcoin’s third Halving, **Paul Tudor Jones revealed to the world that he was opting for Bitcoin instead of gold** as a hedge against the great monetary inflation. This announcement set the world of institutional investors free.

For a little over a year now, many other major Wall Street investors have joined Paul Tudor Jones in his analysis: Bitcoin is a tremendous opportunity that must be seized.

Paul Tudor Jones was the first prominent institutional investor to take a stand in favour of Bitcoin

# Paul Tudor Jones explains the certainty that Bitcoin gives him

Interviewed in mid-June 2021 by CNBC, Paul Tudor Jones revealed this time that he had gone from allocating about 1% to 5% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. He once again took the opportunity to explain why Bitcoin is so attractive to investors from all walks of life in these highly inflationary times.

The words used by Paul Tudor Jones to justify his attraction to Bitcoin are extremely powerful:

&gt;*“Listen, I like Bitcoin right. Bitcoin is math…I like the idea of investing in something that’s reliable, consistent, honest, and 100% certain. So Bitcoin has appealed to me because it’s a way for me to invest in certainty.”*

I get five powerful words out of this sentence by Paul Tudor Jones:

* **Math**
* **Reliable**
* **Consistent**
* **Honest**
* **100% Certain**

If Paul Tudor Jones has opted for Bitcoin, it is also and above all because its programmatic monetary policy is known to all in advance and which therefore leaves no surprises. Everyone knows that a Bitcoin Halving takes place every 210,000 blocks mined.

# Bitcoin’s programmatic monetary policy makes all the difference

By 2024, the supply of new Bitcoin issued each day will be halved again no matter what. And so on every 4 years.

This inevitability of Bitcoin makes it predictable. This gives investors incredible guarantees. Paul Tudor Jones chooses Bitcoin over the erratic monetary policies of the Fed, which depend only on a handful of people who are not representative of the people.

This is a strong signal sent once again in favor of Bitcoin at a time when some are starting to doubt it as the price of Bitcoin just experienced its first crash of the year in May 2021.

While many new entrants doubt, institutional investors like Paul Tudor Jones have no doubt. For him, Bitcoin will succeed and he wants to take advantage of it. Who knows if he won’t increase his portfolio allocation to Bitcoin to 10% in the coming months.

# Many will realize in the future that allocating 5% of their portfolio to Bitcoin is not enough

As Michael J. Saylor says, that would be something extremely logical:

&gt;*“If you invest 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin, you have made the decision to invest 95% of your portfolio in assets getting demonetized by bitcoin.”*

By investing only 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin, you are leaving 95% of the rest of your portfolio at the mercy of the Fed and government decisions. So it is in your best interest to go well beyond that 5%.

This is the opinion I share with all Bitcoiners, and it is nice to see that Michael J. Saylor is putting his words into action as he continues to accumulate more and more BTC with MicroStrategy.

software,Gamepad Phoenix for Windows - Play any game (old or new) with any gamepad (old or new),"Hi all

A few days ago I released the public beta version of a new controller emulator tool for Windows.  
It's called Gamepad Phoenix and its mission is to play any game (old or new) with any gamepad (old or new).  
This is somewhat similar to x360ce however Gamepad Phoenix emulates not only XInput but also DirectInput and WinMM APIs, thus supporting a wider range of games. On top of that, the user interface is kept simple and snappy.

A bit of back story. About half a year ago I finally got fed up with the tools I kept trying to use to get a bunch of controllers working in various couch co-op games. It felt like every time I wanted to play something with the family I spent up to an hour tinkering with x360ce old and new, XOutput, XInput Plus, Xidi etc. And the cluttered UIs and drivers and manual DLL copying was always frustrating to me.  
I thought to myself, there's got to be a better way!

So I started working on this tool and one by one got the games working that we wanted to play. Overcooked, Rayman Legends, Spelunky, Hammerwatch, to name a few. The tool now supports not only XInput and DirectInput controllers but also Wii Remote Controllers (Classic Controller or SNES Classic Mini controllers are great). Later in development I tested a broader spectrum of old and new games.

Current version is 0.9.1 and I call it a beta because I don't own that many games and I'm pretty sure there's plenty of games out there which use some obscure method to access joysticks.

The tool is available on itch.io. It's also open source so there's a GitHub repository as well.

https://schelling.itch.io/gamepad-phoenix

And here's a 2 minute video showing it off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MDrkfe06Q

Feedback of any kind is very welcome! If you have any issues, try to be constructive and as technical as possible. Also if I don't own the game (and there is no free demo) I might not be able to help.

So I'm starting college in the fall and wanted to make sure I have all the necessary accounts in my name that I should have/is recommended.

1.  Checking account - so I should have a checking account just for normal everyday expenses right, in case anything breaks or I need to buy food, books, etc. So for a checking account, I've been looking into banks that have no maintenance fees and have lots of ATMs that don't charge fees, and right now I am leaning towards radius bank as from what I've read they offer these. Now I don't even know if those points are important as I don't know if I will use lots of ATMs to get cash so if I am overthinking or if there is a more important point that I should check out to choose my card I'd appreciate that. Also if you guys have any suggestions regarding checking accounts for college, I'd also appreciate that.

2. Savings account - so should I also get a savings account? From what I've read most people use savings accounts for an emergency fund, for my first year I'm going to dorm, so no rent or utility payments yet, but if I should set one up and just start putting money into that I will, and if so any suggestions? From what I've read Ally is a good savings account because it has a high interest rate, but any and all recommendations are appreciated!

3. Credit cards - so starting to build credit at a young age is good right? Right now I'm added as an authorized user on a parents capital one credit card and my Experian account says I had a 730 fico score around the winter the last and first time I checked, but from my understanding that score isn't really mine or something and that I should also start building my own credit. From my understanding of credit cards, I should use less than 30% of my limit, and I am not really a spender so what I was thinking is to get a credit card, purchase like a Spotify subscription or some other service for like $5-$10 a month and pay off the card every month, and for any other purchase I would just use my checking accounts debit card. is my thinking correct? I don't currently have any student loans cuz of a full scholarship so I shouldn't have to worry about student debt, right?

4. Investing - so I've been reading and right now I'm really leaning towards the boglehead strategy of just opening a Vanguard account and buy 100% $VTI or $VTSAX and just keep adding money into that monthly or yearly and let the account sit for 30-40 years and gradually as im getting older change the portfolio makeup to have more bonds ($BND)? Is this a viable strategy? Any additional info is highly appreciated!

Thank you for reading all of this! Any other account that I am missing that I should have? Again if I got anything wrong please correct me, I am happy to learn. Thanks and have a great day!",finance

CryptoCurrency,What Are Your Investing Rules?,"I'm taking a logical approach to investing in crypto since FOMO and FUD are very real. I'd be curious if anyone looks at things the way I do or is looking at them differently with rules that I could possibly adopt.

My rules:

* Don't invest what you can't afford to lose (given).
* Stake applicable coins as long as possible if interest rates are good (e.g. Ether).
* Target specific coins with a mix of stablecoin and altcoins that serve a purpose (not just storage of wealth / fiat alternative). 
* Keep portfolio heavier on Ethereum to minimize altcoin impact. (Ethereum fan here.)
* Target a max coin count to have a hard cap on fiat going into this market. Stop buying once the target coin count has been reached. (Ideal case.)
* Target a max cost basis to have an out if prices rise too fast. Stop buying if the cost basis is reached before max coin count. Not everyone can DCA down all the time- this is a hedge against DCA'ing up.
* Target a stretch coin count to DCA down \*if\* prices tank by fixed percentage from max cost basis (say, 33% or 50%- talking big dips here). This is a caveat to allow buying to a new max coin count if (and only if) prices dip a lot. 
* Have low, medium, and high coin target prices to sell based on market cap. Recoup investment plus reasonable profit at low target, sell most of the investment at medium, and keep the rest for a high if still rising and, if I can't time it, sell before it drops back below medium. 
* If one coin hits the target before others, re-distribute to other coins assuming max cost basis from above has not been hit. Otherwise, move out to more stable investments outside of crypto (likely something stable and dividend-oriented). 
* If all coins hit the target at around the same time (what a dream), exit crypto entirely unless new opportunities exist.
* Re-evaluate yearly with the mindset that this is a long play.

I put these rules in place to not get carried away and to force myself to have an out if my targets are ever reached. I'm sure they're not perfect, and I'm not going to divulge any more details on positions, coins, target figures, etc. so please don't ask. You gotta do what is right for you there.

But I am curious, do you have any broad investing rules? Kind of sick of seeing YOLO and FOMO investing posts so figured it could be a fun discussion if anyone else is taking a measured approach to this like I am.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage as a hedge against inflation,"My wife and I are moving from CA to PA in the next several months. Of course the housing market everywhere is crazy now so that's been a fun challenge to find something we like that's also within our budget (~1M).

My question is regarding mortgage options as my understanding is that holding a mortgage at a low interest rate can be a good hedge against inflation.

We currently have 2 options (both are 20% down):

National Bank: Jumbo loan 30yr fixed at 2.75%, around 800k loan total. If we go this route we'd just ride the monthly payments out as long as we owned the house, wiry the likelihood that inflation would outpace the interest on the loan. 

Local broker (can't compete with the national jumbo rates): First mortgage 30yr fixed at 2.75% but just under 550k to avoid the jumbo rates. Then a second mortgage for the remainder (~250k), 10yr ARM at Prime minus 0.25%. His sell is that since we aren't planning on staying in the home for 30 years (kids will be gone and I'll be almost 70...) this enables us to put extra monies into the 2nd mortgage to drive our monthly payment down, but doesn't seem to hedge against inflation as well. While it does give us some flexibility if we need extra money at a certain time it also seems to be a ticking time bomb where we have 10 years to come up with 250k to pay off the principal and doesn't seem to act as quite as good of in inflation hedge.",finance

Also on [TheDayByDay](https://thedaybyday.com/f/belief-in-the-currency-or-escape-from-the-dollar)

Last Friday, the digital currency set its latest high, above $ 41,800, but since then it has traded in a negative trend and tonight it completes a 20% drop to a price level of about $ 33,000. About $ 30,500 was the lowest rate tonight, reflecting a 28% drop from the peak. The currency price crash comes along with a jump in the dollar index (DXY), is this a correction after a jump or an expectation towards 2021?

The DXY, following the strength of the dollar relative to the basket of foreign currencies, climbed tonight and reached a peak of 90.7 points, a record of the last two weeks. On January 6, the index recorded a 33-month low, closing at a total of 89.21 points. Since the market crash in March, Bitcoin and the index have moved in opposite directions and each time the DXY has recovered slightly Bitcoin has corrected accordingly.

 **Bitcoin Dollar**

'The value of bitcoin grows as inflation expectations rise. At the same time, the dollar weakened to a perennial low, resulting in an inverted fit between Bitcoin and the government-backed Fiat currency, the research body Kaiko noted in December. The price of Bitcoin fell from $ 12,000 to $ 10,000 in early September, during which the currency shuffled, while the dollar jumped from 91.75 to 94.75 points. A similar operation also took place in June 2020. 

The cartographic currency began to soar during October, when foreign exchange markets began to sell dollars in anticipation of further significant quantitative easing in the United States. At the same time, a steep decline in the DXY also began, which accompanied the meteoric rise of the currency from $ 15,000 to over $ 41,000 in just two months.

The reverse correlation is not surprising, given that listed companies like MicroStrategy (NYSE: MS) are buying Bitcoin to maintain their dollar cash value. 'What we're trying to do is keep our capital. The purchasing power of cash is declining rapidly, ""said MS CEO Michael Sailor. Bitcoin is not the only asset that falls when the dollar recovers. Gold, the classic inflation hedge, fell to $ 1,817, peaking at $ 2,000.

The recent jump in the dollar appears to be fueled by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. Analysts predict that interest rates on ten-year US bonds will reach 2% by the end of 2021, noting that ""a similar outburst of rage is a real risk."" The same bond passed the 1% threshold last week against the backdrop of the election results in Georgia that led to democratic control of the Senate. (To the full article)

The question that needs to be asked is whether the jump in the price of bitcoin is due to a belief in the technology and the new ""monetary"" system that it will create, or is it a momentary ""hype"" resulting from a sharp fall in the dollar exchange rate? We will know the answer at the end of the year, when the interest rate on bonds is expected to rise and the scope of the purchase plan is expected to fall, which will strengthen the dollar even further. If Bitcoin does not succeed in disengaging from the negative correlation against the dollar, it is likely to have a year saturated with wars against the strongest economy in the world.

How is the US administration expected to respond to Chinese control of Bitcoin? ""Immediately there is no China"" - for many, this caption embossed on products from the Asian power has become a role model, a commodity that is medium and falling apart, but the hot commodity of the moment, some of you may be surprised to discover, is also Immediately No China: Bitcoin.

I always do fresh installs per major revision updates. This past update resulted in a lot of fucked up bugs and performance seems trash overall compared to how snappy it was a few years ago. This crapbook barely keeps up with browsing and watching videos on another monitor, it did for a time..

It really seems super fucking shady to me after all the other cover-up bullshit.

I've definitely reached a point I will not buy another MacBook or Apple product. The quality is nothing like it was especially from a software standpoint.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin briefly drops below $30,000 amid China crackdown on cryptocurrency operations","With Tuesday’s sell-off, which slashed the values of many of the 20 largest tokens by market cap, bitcoin has lost half its value since April

 

Cryptocurrency investors got hammered Tuesday, with losses wiping out more than $100 billion in market value overnight and slashing most of bitcoin’s gains for the year.

The most popular and valuable token fell more than 9 percent before recovering somewhat early afternoon, briefly sending the digital currency below $30,000, a significant psychological benchmark not seen since January. Though long-term holders are typically better suited to weather the volatility of the cryptocurrency, the prolonged slump has erased most of the astronomical gains built up this year. And those who purchased near bitcoin’s all time high of $64,000 have seen their investments cut by more than half.

By early afternoon, bitcoin was trading around $32,000.

The slide follows reports that China has ramped up its [crackdown of bitcoin miners](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/bitcoin-mining-china-crypto-america/2021/06/17/0a39c3a8-c903-11eb-8708-64991f2acf28_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_7) in the country, in a continuation of Beijing’s antagonistic approach to cryptocurrency. To reduce energy consumption in support of their climate goals, Chinese authorities have sent miners scattering.

The networks on which digital currencies run require robust computing power to execute transactions and other purposes, such as generating a fresh supply of cryptocurrency. But those maneuvers require large amounts of energy, a long-standing concern of environmentalists and other critics.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said earlier this month that his all-electric vehicle company would return to accepting bitcoin as payment once it confirms that enough miners are using renewable energy to power their networks.

While the pronouncement highlighted the great electricity demands of crypto operators, it also illustrated how Musk and other big personalities can influence the market.

Dogecoin, the [popular meme-token](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/17/dogecoin-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13) that has been a window into the exuberance of the crypto market, sank more than 8 percent, to about 20 cents. That’s well off the high of 72 cents set last month, leading up to Musk’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live.”

As with other digital currency sell-offs, bitcoin’s plummet has dragged much of the market with it. Most of the 20 largest tokens by market cap fell on Tuesday, several by double digits, according to Coinmarket cap, the cryptocurrency tracker. Even as tokens recovered some lost ground in afternoon trading, the overall market has shed more than $1 trillion since May, when investor optimism fueled a record shattering run up.

On Monday, China’s major state-owned banks reiterated their commitment to not facilitate the trading of cryptocurrency, [reinforcing a previous ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/chinese-banks-promise-to-step-up-cryptocurrency-ban/2021/06/21/70ee0f00-d286-11eb-b39f-05a2d776b1f4_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_17) that Chinese authorities put in place to shield the country’s economy from added risks.

In the U.S., Biden administration officials are [reviewing potential oversight measures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/05/25/biden-bitcoin-crypto-markets/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18) related to the speculative trading of the crypto market, and cryptocurrency’s potential uses to facilitate crime. The White House and the Treasury Department are also backing a [new plan to target cryptocurrency](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/05/20/biden-tax-compliance-treasury/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_18) as part of a broader effort to curb tax avoidance.

Crypto’s staggering climb this year has coincided with record gains in the stock market and the emergence of “meme stocks,” pulling in waves of new investors attracted in part by the excitement generated on online forums.

Wall Street has wrestled with its own volatility in recent days. After Friday capped off the worst trading week since October, stocks rebounded during Monday’s session and were set to notch a second winning day.

For months, market observers had been anticipating how the Federal Reserve would react to an improving economic outlook and whether central bankers would signal an interest rate hike to curb inflation. While fears of climbing prices have weighed on investors, some analysts say that the interest-rate concerns may have been overstated.

I'm in a position to move up to a pretty good salary over the next 5 years. In a couple months I'll hit $80k. Given an upcoming retirement I am expected to move into a new position that would bump me into three figures. Long term I could see $150k+ from 40 years old on realistically.

personalfinance,"Victim of Ebay ""empty package shipping scam""","I thought I would share my experience being scammed on Ebay (I won in the end). I hadn't heard of this scam before it happened to me.

In May, I bought a few computer hardware items on Ebay. One of the items was about $350, the deal was a good price (not ridiculously cheap) and the seller had 100% positive reviews but &lt; 10 total feedback. At the time I did not read the sellers feedback.

After buying with a CC on ebay, I thought nothing more as the estimated delivery date was about a week later. I happened to be on my ebay account that weekend and noticed that the package had been delivered! I got no email about it. I searched high and low around my apartment -- no package.

I then checked the FedEx tracking number and noticed 4 unusual things that made me think I was being scammed (I didn't know yet how). First, the seller did 1-day overnight shipping from another state (the listing had standard shipping). Next, the seller uploaded the tracking number AFTER the package was delivered (I found out later this is why no email was generated by ebay). Third, it was signed by (common US name that's not mine). Lastly, the weight was &lt; 1lbs (my product ordered would have been a few lbs). The odd thing to me at the time, is the package was delivered to my zip code (I had thought maybe there was a way to just buy random real fedex tracking numbers).

I called FedEx. The first rep I had talked too accidentally thought I was the shipper at first and accidentally said the name of the street it was delivered to. He quickly back tracked when he realized I was not the shipper. This is why the scammers use FedEx. I was stone walled. I was able to get the rep to confirm that it was NOT shipped / delivered to my address. After I confirmed that I knew I was being scammed -- and googling confirmed that sellers will send cheap items / empty boxes to the same zip code. This allows the seller to win disputes that are automatically decided by the ebay algos.

I then called Ebay. What's crazy is this is not an uncommon scam, yet it took about 3 Ebay reps before I got someone who understood what was happening. At that point the rep opened a case for me. The seller didn't respond after 4 days, so I asked Ebay to step in. Here is where I almost messed up --- the case was initially closed b/c the tracking number showed delivered. I had to request that Ebay require address level proof. They agreed (I actually think this is the new policy at ebay). The seller never responded to Ebay. Ebay ruled in my favor and I got my $$ back.

In retrospect, the sellers feedback was fake. He had ""sold"" a handful of items for a few dollars and the reviewed were about expensive items, etc. During this whole time the seller changed his user name as well. I reported the seller to ebay on multiple occasions and he is now banned.

I also reported this scam to the FTC.

This scam is annoying AF. Lost about 3hr of my time. Lessons learned: Look at ebay seller feedback. FedEx is not helpful in these cases. Finding an Ebay rep that understands the scam is important!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Ebay seller sent an empty package to a nearby business to make it look like an expensive item was delivered. Ebay thankfully was able to reverse the charge. 

(EDIT: As pointed out below, it's likely tracking numbers are mined to find one that matches my zip code. It's likely nothing was ever sent by the seller and the tracking number was a real package between 2 other people)",finance

personalfinance,Cash in 401k to pay off mortgage?,"36, married, one child. I want this mortgage off my back and the deed to my house. If I were to cash in my 401k and pull some cash savings, I could pay this thing off. I’ve read a lot of posts where people advise against cashing in retirement accounts and maybe I’m a little thick in the skull but I just don’t get why not. 

I owe $158k on the house, interest rate is 3.25%, I’m 14mos into a refinance but have been paying an extra $130 monthly since first payment. The positives I see from this are:

1) The obvious - no more mortgage payment. Ever. 
2) That $1130 I free up in mortgage payments can go directly back into the 401k or a brokerage. 
3) In any economic downturn, having no house (or car) payment opens a lot of options for weathering the storm as far as jobs to take. I don’t need to take a 6 figure job to keep the lights on. 

The only con I see is giving up all the gains my 401k has made over the last 18yrs (which isn’t a ton).

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 22, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 22, 2021**

The stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar

dogecoin,China trying to screw over South America?,"So we know China basically halted Bitcoin, the thing that is super sus to me is the timing. They obviously could of done this at ANY time in history. They did do it, like a week after a few South American countries decide to legalize Bitcoin (or started considering it), essentially throwing the switch to OFF. It cannot be argued that getting as much mining as possible out of China is great for crypto in the long run. Maybe that is why they never banned it before.

Then again their ""digital Yuan"" is the most centralized crypto ever, of course they can't let people be free from complete monetary control. Their systems will allow them to see and track every transaction made to an amazing degree. These are the same guys who have a country wide surveillance system that identifies it citizens BY THE WAY THEY WALK. [https://nypost.com/2018/11/06/chinas-latest-recognition-technology-can-id-people-by-how-they-walk/](https://nypost.com/2018/11/06/chinas-latest-recognition-technology-can-id-people-by-how-they-walk/)

Hopefully all the mining operations move to South America honestly. They could really use a decentralized currency more than anyone. Might get some jobs or some new towns out of it too. A new kind of ""mining town"" if you get the reference.

China ran an estimated 65% of the Bitcoin network, and supposedly 90% of that is offline. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/bitcoin-btc-price-drops-on-china-crypto-mining-crackdown.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/bitcoin-btc-price-drops-on-china-crypto-mining-crackdown.html)

So, a new challenger has appeared. No one can compete with the government. If they can just ban your operation there's no competing with ""turning off the system, and putting in a single player game"". If the world starts to move to digital currencies at the state level, and bans any crypto that doesn't align, that would be the only thing that could really threaten the crypto space. Hopefully the people of the world don't bend over and take that level of corruption, but I always hear morons say ""well if you have nothing to hide..."" as if that's the point. The point of monitoring everything everyone says, does, and buys is controlling what everyone says, does, and buys. If you think otherwise you are being naive, pardon the actual French.

The title of my post begs a question, is China sending a message to South America, are they sending a message to the world? Is it coincidence? Maybe. I guess it's just as likely that all of these world events happened within a week, but I for one, am always trying to find a deeper connection. If the Federal Reserve tries to make the world reserve currency a digital dollar, incoming VAT taxes for sure. Taxes based on race, gender, and political opinions. Maybe too tinfoil hatty for some, I understand. It's all been written about and theorized for years, so it's not like it's a new concept or something I'm tripping about all by myself. Future atm seems bright still, the far future though, who knows. HODLing and waiting for more positive news.

Basically if the USA took a stance of ""We will never be like China and attempt to ban cryptos."" I would sleep like a baby, but that's highly doubtful. We have been trying to falsely associate crypto with crime and other such no-no's since it's inception, which is very sus in itself.

TLDR; china is sus a/f, be wary of other countries trying to follow in their footsteps.

But since there's no prepayment penalty and assuming the negative points are greater than the closing costs, what's stopping someone from pocketing the cash from the points then walking over to the next bank and immediately refinancing the loan at a lower rate with zero points?",finance

CryptoCurrency,The FULL picture: Why I believe the crypto bull market isn't over yet,"I've seen a lot of posts today about whether we have entered a bear market or not, so I wanted to share with you why I'm convinced at least for now that we are still in a bull market and this is just a corrective phase before at least another push to a new ATH. I'll break down my argument into 2 parts, macroeconomic landscape (wider economic landscape) and onchain data (data specific to bitcoin/crypto).

# Macro indicators

Macro risk appetite affects crypto. In a *risk off* environment all players tend to seek refuge in cash or liquidity. In a *risk on* environment players perceive an infusion of fresh liquidity in the markets and as result resort to speculation to make sure they capture as much as possible of this new liquidity entering markets.

An analogy I like in this sense is that of an oasis in the middle of the desert. In every oasis there is a water pool and life flourishes around it. You can imagine how important this pool is, without it life in the desert would be impossible. Financial markets are organized in a similar fashion when it comes to liquidity. No matter how much an economy grows, liquidity will always be limited and it's something all players keep an eye on, just like the inhabitants of an oasis. Let's say now there is a huge block of buildings in the oasis inhabited by wealthy individuals who also happen to be the only ones to have an internet connection or access to geothermic data on the predicted inflows of water. So what happens when this group of people learns that inflows of water are about to stop for whatever reason? Automatically they will start pulling more water from the main pool than they actually need (without having access to the information the rich people have), as they prepare for a dry season. The others around them will start noticing this, maybe they will notice the water pumps, and as result of this slowly everyone will start pulling more water from the pool than they actually need until dry season eventually comes. When it comes to liquidity in markets, something similar happens at the end of a bull cycle. The biggest players such as pension funds or huge hedge funds that have access to very good information, are the first ones to start pulling liquidity out of circulation. Once big players start pulling money out, considering the amount of assets they sell (the equivalent of water pumps in the desert, are assets being dumped at markets), they initiate a rush to liquidity that slowly propagates to the rest of the economy. Important here that most other players do not have access to any of the information of these big funds, however they react just like people in the desert react when they see a big block of flats is suddenly pulling water out to build up water reserves.

So what indicators can we look at to determine whether big players anticipate tightening market conditions or not? US treasuries and corporate bonds are the gold standard in this sense. So when we want to see whether anything is changing in the attitude of *whales* (not crypto whales, real market whales) we go looking for the yields of US treasuries. In fact when whales foresee a liquidity crunch they expect much higher returns on their capital, therefore the interest rate of treasuries goes up. When whales foresee that there will be plenty of liquidity in the markets then dynamics change, there is competition over who lends the money at the lowest interest rates and therefore treasuries go down.

[**If we look at 10YUS treasuries**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y)**, after spiking to 1.7% in May, yields have kept going down and are currently at a 2 month low of 1.46%. Therefore treasuries suggest the markets are risk on (which is good for crypto).**

&amp;#x200B;

[Low risk corporate bond prices](https://preview.redd.it/tge40c9f4x671.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cf8773cbb09802fbf18a0a90d40f42f782e7b6b)

The next thing I look at are low risk corporate bonds, similar to treasuries where people lend money to the US Government, with low risk Corporate bonds people lend money to big, blue chip corporations that have a solid track record and are perceived as being in low risk of default. For them we can check the above price chart, as we can **see prices of low risk corporate bond ETFs have been moving in a rising channel since March 2021**. Beware that here we are checking the price chart, which moves in the opposite direction of the interest rate of the underlying bonds. Here too we have a confirmation that markets are still in risk on mode, meaning there is no shortage of liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

[High risk corporate bond prices](https://preview.redd.it/jopu87ti4x671.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57d85e9cd0fe8198e6f7df9fd976442e7c01091a)

The third indicator is the price of high risk corporate bonds, these are inversely proportional with the interest rates at which the market is willing to lend money to corporates that are perceived as being at high risk of default. In other words this is a direct measure of the risk appetite of smart market or legacy market whales. By looking at the above chart here too we see that prices are in strong uptrend, meaning that markets are lending money to these high risk borrower at increasingly lower rates. **This is our third indicator that confirms how smart money, which isn't influenced by short term news cycles and media narratives, is risk on.**

To conclude, in this first part of the analysis, we can see how in our desert nobody is pulling water out of the desert pool, therefore the wider market gradient favors a bullish crypto market as there is no liquidity shortage. Now let's look at crypto indicators.

# Crypto indicators

For this I rely main on Glassnode onchain data analysis. The most interesting chart in this sense is the following, that shows how the amount of coins bought at the beginning of this bull cycle is still *maturing.* In other words, this shows how holders did sell something at the peak area, but they have kept most of their assets with unflinching conviction regardless of volatility. This implies that these investors do not consider the current cycle closed, and therefore are waiting for even higher highs to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jbazfp6c6x671.png?width=1603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f21abd0d072372213af53ec84caef1d372bdd18

The second indicator has a somewhat mixed meaning. In fact, if look at long term holders, we see that they are accumulating again. This is bearish short term, because when long term holder accumulate they create downward pressure on price since they patiently wait for retail or short term holder to sell at market. However, something else is going on in the hidden OTC markets, where big amounts of coins are traded, because miners probably affected by the recent clampdown in mining in China, are fueling distribution. We're therefore in a distribution phase in the OTC markets. Below is a glassnode chart illustrating this. This distribution however does not affect market prices because it is *hidden,* being OTC\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

[Distribution OTC](https://preview.redd.it/jnj5un3q7x671.jpg?width=1235&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9bbae31fa844e583786832e3ead38aff992b345)

Finally the recent China ban of bitcoin mining has brought the hashrate to the level of June-September 2020. Negative hashrate momentum means less coins mined and also less selling pressure. While the effects of this are limited in the short term, it is likely that if this trend continues the amount of minted coins may reach an all time low which may then trigger the next cycle to the upside. Again here the timing seems to be around fall 2021.

To summarize, I believe that after almost a year of *up only* what we are going through now is a healthy market correction. Considering the wider market context, the pieces are in place for this crypto bullish cycle to resume/continue later this year once the stars re-align. These include accumulation by whales (which is already at Jan 2021 levels), as well as other catalysts such as decreasing hashrate due to the China ban.",cryptocurrency

CryptoMarkets,Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi ?! :O,"DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

30. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
37. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

46. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

My fellow Shibes,

It’s been a wild ride so far but now our backs are up against the ropes. We’ve had our ups and downs like all of the other crypto communities but, if anything, we’ve proven that we are resilient… and the potential futures look *so* bright; however, we **are** at a crossroads. We have in front of us the opportunity to come together and blaze a path forward through the challenges facing us as well as the broader crypto community and to represent something more.

Dogecoin related announcements by various organizations seem to be coming out at a faster rate, which is fantastic. The core developers and contributors are doing an amazing job, but there are some intense global pressures and a lot of us are simply looking for ways to contribute to the success of the coin. Unfortunately the barrier of entry in contributing to the Dogecoin core codebase is steep, but I believe that i’ve found the way forward… a viable pathway to running Dogecoin completely on ***SOLAR POWER***... and it all starts with this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1x96ubqqz671.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d405dfd502e8b8957134bbe638158ce7e0fa13bd

&amp;#x200B;

The humble Raspberry Pi.

I’m proposing that we build an appliance based off of it.

&amp;#x200B;

In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/nmfejy/alpha_release_dogecoin_on_kubernetes/) I announced the alpha release of a DogecoinD Docker Image and Kubernetes Helm Chart. The tech industry uses Kubernetes (k8s) to operate services in the cloud and is increasingly becoming the de facto standard upon which to develop and deploy your applications. When I started looking for ways to contribute I started with the simplest question: How do I run Dogecoin and work on it? The Dogecoin Core codebase ultimately gets compiled down into a single executable file that can run on your machine, but you have to run the file that maps to the type of machine you’re using. If you look in the “Assets” section of the [latest Dogecoin release](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.3) you’ll see that it’s available for a variety of platforms. I would venture to say that most people interact with the Dogecoin Core Wallet with the GUI interface on either Windows or OSX because it’s simple to use and we haven’t really had a need for something more complicated. Until now.

Admittedly, k8s is typically synonymous with large enterprises that run very complex workloads and historically it’s notorious for being a beast to set up, but the ecosystem of tooling these days has made it relatively simple to get started. Just keep in mind that Kubernetes is simply a way to package up software like Dogecoin to make it portable across systems and to help automate its lifecycle. It’s an orchestrator to be specific. So I decided to demonstrate how easy it can be by turning a Raspberry Pi into a Kubernetes powered Dogecoin FullNode. Thankfully, the devs have already been producing an aarch64 build, so I did a bunch of work and today i’m proud to announce **multi-arch support in the Dogecoin Docker image**. The \`aitherarchitect/dogecoin:latest\` image now supports both x86\_64 as well as aarch64/armv8 ***simultaneously*** and the entire initial setup from a fresh Raspebrry Pi has been boiled down to:

1. Flash MicroSD card with 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS for arm64/armv8/aarch64 (Official, but still a pre-release) - [http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/raspios\_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip)[http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios\_arm64/images/](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/)
2. Immediately change default user’s pw and set up new user with sudo
3. Apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y git &amp;&amp; Apt-get upgrade
4. Start SSH and set to start on boot (raspi-config cli tool &gt; Interfaces submenu); Switch from console over to a remote SSH connection as desired
5. Enable container features: \`cgroup\_enable=cpuset cgroup\_memory=1 cgroup\_enable=memory &gt;&gt; /boot/cmdline.txt\`
6. Reboot
7. Install k3s: \`curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io) | sh -\`
8. Install helm: \`curl [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3) | bash\`
9. Configure cli tools to use k3s provided user config:\`export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml &amp;&amp; echo 'export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml' &gt;&gt; \~/.bashrc\`
10. Install arkade simply because it’s amazing: \`curl -sLS [https://dl.get-arkade.dev](https://dl.get-arkade.dev) | sudo sh\`
11. git clone [https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git](https://github.com/Aither-Architect/dogecoin-helm.git)
12. \`cd dogecoin-helm/; helm install dogecoin .\`

With those commands, your FullNode will start syncing with the network, provided that your local network firewall settings allow the communication.  I shall call it… the Dogeberry Pi! When I got all of that working I couldn’t help but get a chuckle from the seeming insanity of packing all of this high tech into what most people regard as a hobby board, but I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GiB of RAM; it’s a respectably beefy little thing that (thanks to the armv8 architecture in the Pi 4’s) is now capable of training Machine Learning models and neural networks. Looking at the resource usage, a fully synced and idle node consumes approximately \~1GiB of RAM and the cpu is mostly idle:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qie6e4trqz671.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d750ad144171411b7d95c1b02bedb2920360c67

So one could very reasonably assume that we generally have about 6 GiB to work with on the side and treat this as both a dual purpose Dogeberry Pi node as well as a home software development server. Personally, i’ve been warming up to the idea of installing [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) on it to tie all of my smarthome devices together. All of this capability in such a small device that can be powered on \~10  watts under load is pretty amazing.

To put that into perspective, that’s about how much power it takes to run a modern LED 60 Watt-equivalent light bulb. To put this into perspective even *further*, that’s approximately 10 [Hamster-Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/383iqq/how_much_power_could_be_generated_from_hamster/)

It’s such a minimal amount of power that one could so very easily… yep you guessed it:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tbhblr9tqz671.jpg?width=2604&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45ed5c71eb0b6c5fa909e7b5f582e25068ed0064

run this thing completely off of solar power! Yes, that Dogeberry Pi is completely off-grid save for the WiFi that it’s consuming. The PiJuice HAT made it so easy to set this up, you just plug the thing in and go for the most part. The solar panel array I bought is honestly way overkill for this Proof of Concept, as they’re rated at 100 Watts. I went oversized because I live in Austin, TX and ERCOT isn’t exactly winning any awards lately…

So let me back up a bit… i’m running the Dogecoin Core software on a Raspberry Pi 4B, **COMPLETELY POWERED BY THE G-DANG SUN** with power to spare. I call that a win!

Before we go further, I can already hear some of you: “That’s cute and all, Sean, but a Raspberry Pi doesn’t have a shot in hell stacked up against ASIC mining rigs”. Yes, that’s true… well sort of  ;) Let’s unpack that a bit.

For any given computer running Dogecoin, it’s doing two things:

1. Securing the network by validating and propagating transactions
2. Mining

With a Proof of Work model, the Pi has *zero* chances on the mining front when stacked up against GPUS and ASICs, i’ll give you that. The thing is, though, that both functions are necessary and the beautiful part is that every solar powered Dogeberry Pi out there can be treated as a sort of carbon offset when considering the Dogecoin network as a whole and towards that goal of “using less than 1% the energy of Bitcoin”.

When it comes to mining from the Dogeberry Pi, we have well.. work.. to do. Proof of Work and Proof of Stake have gotten us this far so we can’t knock on them too hard but their shortcomings are painfully clear for where we are in our global crypto journey. The dynamics of centralization of wealth in both systems leaves something to be desired and locks the common people out. The barrier of entry into Proof of Stake IS existing wealth, so that means there’s almost no hope for someone starting from scratch. Now on to Proof of Work and the electricity consumption… here we go. We are using so much electricity because of the sheer amount of computation being done (to get the duh, no-brainer out of the way), but what is that computation actually doing? Taking a look further, we are more or less just exploring a solution space by randomly guessing. In other words, when you’re trying to mine for rewards what you’re actually doing is playing a fancy-pants version of Battleship where you’re trying to hit a target by process of elimination. You’re playing against a computer opponent and everyone else is playing against their own. Whoever beats their opponent first, wins. Now what if you started playing the game at 10x the speed of all of the other humans playing? This is why people invest in ASIC rigs for mining, to simply play the game *faster.* But to what end? Sure, somebody gets a reward, but the game/computation itself is otherwise useless and everyone else simply wasted electricity in the attempt. If we’re going to use up computation (and thus electricity), its use should be maximized or at the very least *useful*. Enter the aptly named system, Proof of Useful Work:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09244v1)

&amp;#x200B;

This gem of a paper as an alternative to the traditional Proof of Work was brought to my attention by u/Odysseus2202. I have to admit that at first I brushed it off because I didn’t know too much about the nuts and bolts of the proof systems in crypto at the time but I really don’t like dismissing things out of hand. So I sat down over the course of several nights to study, consumed the topics as best I could to get oriented with the landscape as well as some of the nuance, and made a concerted effort to understand what the paper was suggesting. I’m so glad that I did because the ideas presented shook my soul. It offers something groundbreaking and revolutionary for crypto yet the premise is so simple:

If the river is flowing -anyway- let’s put a water wheel on it to put that energy to work.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/as65illwqz671.jpg?width=612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30edb24b346ba7cb8d9ced0beade1f7f065b3400

This brings about a system that promotes: **Honest Pay for Honest Work**

Organizations and individual experimenters require huge amounts of computing power to train Machine Learning models and Neural Nets and they pay HEFTY sums to get it. The Dogecoin network is one big global pool of compute power. Let’s sell that compute power to organizations and the reward for doing honest, useful work is some Dogecoin. We would need to expose an API and customer/utility portal of some sort, but that’s a road well trodden. This idea of crowd-sourced distributed compute pools is nothing new as there is precedence with the SETI program, Folding@Home, NiceHash, etc. In this model, **EVERYONE** that participates in a batch of useful work would get a Dogecoin payout proportional to the amount of computing power offered to the compute job.

Before I got too excited I wanted to run this paper by some friends in Data Science to get their thoughts on the viability of this paradigm. I reached out to Rob Chong and Deepak Shah, a Director of Data Science and a Principal Data Scientist, respectively. While they did raise some questions related to the finer points of data flows while training models (I kind of went cross-eyed at this part of the phone conversation, I can’t lie), they each gave a thumbs up on calling it a viable pathway. Let’s debate the merits of this paper together.

A supremely critical point to bring up is that this model could potentially invalidate the usage of ASICs ***altogether*** due to the nature of the work at the macro scale being very general and unknown in advance. This levels the playing field for the common folk.

Switching to Proof of Useful Work means that the Dogeberry Pi appliance could then legitimately become an entry-level mining rig and thus becomes a passive source of income by selling computing power to organizations; the operator/maintainer of the Dogeberry Pi appliance then only needs to worry about keeping the rig online and in good working order to earn a passive income. The payout price would be comprised of numerous factors like the availability of compute pools with respect to demand, the capability of the underlying hardware offered, the current price of Dogecoin at the time, etc. Since the compute power would be crowd-sourced and (ideally) solar, I think it could be reasonable to target a cost of compute that is 50% of the cost of major cloud compute like AWS. Keeping the price point a proportion of cloud compute costs incentivizes organizations to prefer the Dogecoin Compute Network over others. The economics of this should work out such that it’s feasible to run this with a single Dogeberry Pi node and earn an income, or go all in on a massive solar compute farm as a business. Ultimately what I would love to see is that we make running a FullNode profitable enough that someone from an affluent country would want to do it. If we can do that, then the possibility exists to raise entire families out of poverty in the less affluent countries (of course assuming training volume). The barrier of entry into a new socioeconomic bracket then becomes

* Raspberry Pi
* Power Management Module w/ Battery
* Solar Panel
* Internet connection and bandwidth
* The willpower to learn and the commitment to stick to it

There are some tradeoffs, of course. Yes, the training process for ML models would be slower than GPU based clusters that are not based on this federated model of training. It’s not meant to be a Model S Plaid; it’s more like the commuter train. It’s about Economy vs. Performance. Each individual unit isn’t a screaming machine, but if we have thousands of them acting in unison, then we have something formidable. This paradigm brings several layers of utility to Dogecoin, creates a forcing function towards adoption, and creates transaction volume. Building this fleet of Dogeberry Pi’s could be the first major step toward a more harmonious future for crypto.

**A note here for a follow up post**: Building this out means that there will be more levers in the codebase to pull that can have serious economic consequences. We should look into implementing a governance token to start a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for voting rights over key decisions. Governance tokens could be earned by staking coins to a Liquidity Pool (thus paving the way for some advanced DeFi applications) and earning/farming an intermediary utility token. The intermediary token could be farmed and used to buy more Dogecoin or it could be minted into the governance/voting token (non-transferrable).

**Market opportunities people could use to generate income from a Dogeberry Pi world:**

* Dogecoin branded and custom 3D printed Raspberry Pi cases -- The picture of my solar Dogeberry Pi makes me a little sad because adding the PiJuice HAT prevents me from using the case it came with. Also, I did have a problem with cooling for the POC I did because it had no protection from the sun or any way to actively move air over the heatsinks. I would be willing to pay someone handsomely for a 3D printed theme mashup of Dogecoin and Pirates of the Caribbean
* Professional Services and Support offerings
* Training courses
* Building tooling for easier management
* Gamification around producing solar power for the Dogeberry Pi. Maybe a points/ranking system
* I’ve never had my hands on a Tesla PowerWall. Are there any opportunities for a tight integration between that Dogeberry Pi and the wall unit?

## 

## The Ask

This proposal is complex and the most elegant way to implement this paradigm is on the Dogecoin blockchain itself. It will take time for all of us to discuss Proof of Useful Work and come to a consensus. In the meantime, I have a way to produce the same effect without having to modify Dogecoin Core itself. Running Kubernetes on all of the Dogeberries allows us to tie all of them together into one big pool of compute. If we put an API and a payment portal in front of the fleet then we have a product where companies can pay fiat currency to use compute and the fiat currency is automatically converted to Dogecoin for payout to pool participants.

I believe that I can build this with the support of the community. In my previous posts, I invoke the idea of “we at Aither” but to be honest, Aither is still a company of 1 --myself-- and it’s a company on paper as there is zero revenue at the moment; i’m still building my prototype. The truth… is that i’m just a regular guy. I work a day job to pay the bills… yet also, I am that proverbial guy in his garage building things, willing to challenge the status quo. Through hard work, a bit of luck, the support of loved ones, and the grace of god I was able to overcome some economic boundaries and help lift my family into the middle class; since then i’ve made it my mission to extend that hope to as many people as I possibly can. People deserve to live life with dignity and self respect. They shouldn’t have to choose between buying medication to avert some debilitating symptoms or putting food on the table for their children or grandchildren; affordable healthcare is a whole ball of wax unto itself. Putting a good, honest 40 hours of work in per week should guarantee a livable life and there should be no need to get a second or third job just to barely make it over the finish line month to month. Nevermind the fact that one might be one major car breakdown away from losing those jobs and having their whole life come collapsing down upon them. This is the reason I founded Aither, hope for a better future for all of us.

Dogecoin and cryptocurrency in general is a way to break free from aspects of this vicious cycle that dominate so many of us across the world. It can help us start correcting our financial systems and restore power back to the people. This is why I am asking for your financial support in order to quit my day job and develop this pathway full-time. I need a runway in terms of funding so that I can put food on the table for my family while I dedicate my full work-week to the dogecoin community as well as take care of things like:

* Cloud Infrastructure costs for development
* Security
* Hiring contractors for software engineering and to speed up project deliverables
* Security
* Legal analysis
* Security

I was able to put all of this together in a couple months as I scratched time away from my job and family duties. Just imagine if I could dedicate full, consistent time to this endeavor. If any of my work that i’ve presented here is valuable to you or if you would like to support the initiative, please consider donating:

I thank you for reading all the way to the end of this letter and I would like to end with one final thought: The cross-currency hate is foolhardy, because the reality is… the reality is that we already live in an ecosystem where all coins are interdependent in various ways… if for nothing else than the fact that **humans** are behind all of this technology. We can’t forget that. The **serious** crypto communities will find ways to cooperate, share and evolve knowledge, and boost each other. We have an opportunity to let go of primitive tribal tendencies and come together because we are **all** part of the human race.

personalfinance,Taxes - $2500 correct?!,"I got a letter about a month ago stating I owed the IRS $750 for my 2017 taxes. Upon logging into TurboTax I realized I never fixed them after they were initially rejected. I was in college in 2017 and had various waitressing/work study jobs. My income was around $18k with the majority of that being from one of my waitressing jobs (14k). I refiled my taxes on TurboTax today and it says between MA state (550$ ish) and federal ($2000ish) I owe about $2500. Does that sound correct to you? Is it just because of how grossly late I am submitting them with all the penalties? Is it worth taking it to a professional to double check or should I just cut the IRS a check to get them out of my hair?

personalfinance,Financing a Low Cost car on a short-term loan?,"Good afternoon Redditors!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent college graduate with a full-time job that pays around $40K per year. I live in the suburbs of Charlotte, on the SC side. I live with two roommates and have very low living costs in a 3-BR apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently looking for an extremely specific used car and was able to find one that was taken care of very well, owned by someone who cared about and will be reliable for a long time. The car is from a private owner with a traceable ownership history and not through a dealer so any finance would need to be arranged through a bank, not a car dealer.

It's a rare-trim performance car that I have always wanted, and I have already established that I can afford the maintenance, insurance, and other costs of ownership well within my budget. While the cost of ownership is higher than a Honda or Toyota, I am a car enthusiast and enjoy performance cars as a hobby, so I see it as another use of my disposable income rather than going out, bars, other hobbies..

&amp;#x200B;

The car costs around $8K, and I was planning on taking out an auto loan through a local credit union(I have a co-signer with amazing credit) for $6K, putting a $2K down payment on the car. Ideally I would like to do a 24 or 36 month loan term and get the car paid off in short of a time as possible while also building credit for myself since I have no other sources to build it.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the pros and cons of doing this? Will my interest rate be higher because of the lower amount and shorter term? Should I take a pass on it?

CryptoCurrency,EverRise Tokenomics,"Market Analysis of the Big Buyback Announcement

Two market analysis pieces today, aren’t we lucky!

As you have probably seen, Titan gave an announcement on Telegram. In substance the announcement was this:

**The buybacks will no longer come automatically after every buy. Instead, they will be executed in bigger chunks at random intervals.** As of yet I do not know all the details of when &amp; how this is done, so there is no point asking me ‘will there be a buyback tomorrow at 4pm’.

This post aims to answer the following:

1.  Is this a good or a bad thing? (probably what you’re more interested in)

2.  What does this do to the incentive structure of the token? (what you should be more interested in)

**Positives:**

**1.**  **Gas fees &amp; investor return**

If you ever did economics at a university level, you’ve probably heard of **transaction costs.** In the normal pen &amp; paper market, these involve things like negotiating and drafting contracts (and paying lawyers to do so) that are necessary to get your main deal done. A market is more efficient the less it has to spend on transaction costs, and sometimes transaction costs can make a certain activity that is otherwise beneficial economically inefficient because you would have to negotiate with so many people to get the deal done that you’ll spend more negotiating than you would get profit from the successful enterprise. 

If you’ve ever been to a board meeting where Karen from Marketing just doesn’t see why we can’t talk about the types of fonts we use before making any substantial decisions, you’ve seen it. 

Anyway, because of this logic, and because transaction costs tend to compound, **investors are interested in investments that have low transaction costs**, and finding ways to lower them can mean you win in the great competition of life. 

So here’s the thing: With continuous buybacks, the gas fees (=cost of the computational effort used to effect the transaction) stack up. The amount of trades in a minute can be pretty insane, and for every one of those you pay gas fees. Grouping these payments together into one chunk is a really sensible move, from a transaction costs point of view. 

In other words, your money is used more effectively for the main purpose of the enterprise, i.e. for control of irrational price swings, burning supply and all that good stuff. 

In other words, **the Kraken has more money. Your taxes are spent better.**

**2.**  **The old system was subjected to constant bot attack. This one cannot be.**

I’ve said this many times, and will say this many times again – automated features can always be gamed. I’ll return to this below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns I’ve heard:**

**Doesn’t this make it unpredictable?** **Investors don’t want upredictable things.**
everrise_kraken_market_incentives/) there in section 2) that unpredictability of the Kraken is one of the things that works to our advantage against the design and execution of sell-offs. 

Sell-offs are bad for retail investors, because there will come a point where the retail investor will have to make the coin-flip decision on whether to liquidate everything to save his skin. Flip wrong, and you lose. The person who executed the sell-off does not have to make that decision, because they know when the sell-off will end. 

Except with the Kraken, they don’t. If the Kraken buys back just when the re-accumulation was about to go into full swing, the whale who executed the sell-off loses money. Gets rekt, as you say. 

Knowing this, **the whale may not even try to execute a sell-off and reacquisition, or certainly has to factor the risk of the Kraken into it.** And the last thing the whale wants is to get locked into a pissing match with the Kraken, so most of the time even trying it is just not going to be worth it (because successful execution would require more risking money than you stand to gain, so your expectation value is negative). 

(**expectation value**: Profits you stand to make if you win x percentage chance that you win – losses you stand to make if you lose x percentage chance of loss. If this number is negative, you should not invest. If investing 10k can make you 1m on a 10% chance (i.e. you lose 10k on a 90% chance), your expectation value is: (1,000,000 – 10,000) x 0.1 – 10,000 x 0.9 = 90,000. You should invest.)

**What about automating the Kraken?**but the point is, algorithms can be gamed. Goldman could spend 500,000 developing and testing an algorithm that perfectly matches our Kraken’s algorithm, drain it of cash and tank the market and make 2m in minutes. If I could spend 500k to get 2m in four minutes, I would do it. 

**Why should Titan have all the power? What if he gets run over by a car?** 

This is a very complex question but here goes:

1)  Titan always had all the power. He could always set the buyback amount at a time of his choosing. All that is changed now is that the transactions are executed in a more cost-effective way.

2)  If that level of human oversight makes you uncomfortable, consider the alternative: if the thing is automated, it can be gamed. 

3)  Titan is not the only developer, so if Titan gets run over by a car someone else takes over (this was an answer I heard on voice chat a few days ago from one of the devs, I have no further details). 

If you want my personal take on what the optimum would be for investor confidence AND security from bots, I personally would be in favour of a kind of fiduciary boardroom (so a room of people who make the decision together and who must act in the investors’ best interests by law), but I am not one of the developers so I don’t get a say. If any developers would like to get in touch and talk about various investor confidence strategies, I’d be happy to chat. 

**Incentive Structure Changes**

Now, from a more general market analytics perspective, this is a very interesting change. Basically, the thing that was genius about the automated buyback Kraken with variable amount was that it could create very complex changes in the predictable incentive structures of investors just by changing the amount of the buyback at unpredictable times. 

Those incentive structures themselves were predictable, once you knew what the amount would be, where the market was and how much the Kraken had in its war chest. But when the incentive structure would change was totally unpredictable. 

Take an example:

1.  At amount x, when price is falling irrationally, everyone’s incentive is to buy as quickly as they can before the Kraken takes the token back to a steady floor level

2.  At amount y, regardless of direction, everyone’s incentive is to execute lots of tiny sells to push up the price quickly, and then sell, and then buy back again (like when it was 60bnb)

3.  At amount z, when the price is steady &amp; nearing a reversal, everyone’s incentive is to buy in the hopes that the kraken will help them break a ceiling.

What those numbers are is not the point and depends largely on how much the Kraken has in its belly so it’s a variable number. The point is that the Kraken could be set in sequence (like x, then y, then z) to make really subtle incentive structures. 

**It could actually have been used to trap market manipulators** – set it at y, wait for the market manipulator to take the bait, set it at 0.1, then set it at x to find a new floor and so on.

The problem with this was that the **bot attacks were too fast** **for a human to be able to react.**

So instead of spending 1m community money building AI and algorithms to do it for you, **it’s a much cheaper approximation just to have a guy who pulls a lever.** 

However, this now creates a whole new set of different incentives.

Most importantly, since the buybacks are not gradual but big chunks at a time, the price swings will be bigger:

1.  More money is spent on a purchase at a time

2.  A larger number of coins is burned at one time

3. Since the burned coins are bought (and value spent on them) at the market rate, this has more of an impact on price than just burning tokens.

I personally think this is a good thing, for the following reason:

Every coin that has survived through the initial predation phase and becomes a genuine investment product (BTC, ETH, DOGE, Safemoon, you name it) has done so because people were holding it. Nothing more. Just that some people held on to them and didn’t sell when others panicked. 

That meant that there was a bottom that a predatory trader couldn’t break through, which meant that the coin had some underlying bottom value, and that meant that others could invest and start to push the floor upwards.

**With bigger swings, day trading becomes more risky. And at the same time, every holder gets more reflections so holding becomes more profitable.** So if you don’t want to enter the day trading arena with the big boys, and take the bigger risks, just hold. You still have exposure to the exact same general trend as before, but now you get a bigger interest rate on your money the longer you hold. 

So bigger swings = more incentive for hodlers to hodl (because bigger risks of day trading and bigger reward for holding) = more credible underlying value on the token = more investor confidence = more investment = more growth.

CryptoMarkets,Blockchain Startups Disrupting the Supply Chain Industry,"**How blockchain can help the supply chain industry -**  


* Transaction Process – The technology’s traceability enables wholesalers to pinpoint a product’s exact origin, which can save lives in case of contamination and gives the consumer trust in return
* Fraud/Theft Elimination – Blockchain’s public ledger technology offers transparency and allows tracking the ownership history of various items such as diamonds, for example.
* Smart Contracts – Enabling the automation of the purchasing process as well as ensuring the quality, authenticity, and availability of goods.
* Tracking – Blockchain facilitates the tracking of purchase orders, changes orders, receipts, shipment notifications, or other trade-related documents.  


I am exploring the supply chain industry for quite a long time now. I shortlisted 5 startups that have real-world use cases and are seriously adding value to the community. 

 1) [OriginTrail](https://www.origintrail.io/) : It is an Ethereum-based ecosystem for supply chain use cases, founded in 2011. The idea behind the project is to employ the power of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology in the sphere of logistics and supply chain management.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 23, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 23, 2021** 

Stocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. 

In a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Moreover, tomorrow Thursday  the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

investing,Robustness of treasuries as hedges on a PSLDX/Hedgefundie style investment,"Recently I have been reading more about the PSLDX style of investment, also used by Hedgefundie on the Bogleheads forum. In this proposition, there is a roughly 60% allocation (the exact numbers aren't super important) to a leveraged market ETF such as UPRO, and a 40% allocation to an equally leveraged treasury ETF such as TMF. This strategy has been used by a number of folks to great success, and has been backtested to work quite well as well, overcoming volatility decay to outperform the underlying index over time. 

Obviously, the drawback of the leveraged ETF is that in case of a crash or correction, it will suffer a severe drawdown - however, this is countered by the treasury holdings, which historically have a negative beta with respect to the market. So the treasury ETF can be thought of as a hedge, and historically it has been an effective hedge. However, I understand that when interest rates go up, treasuries broadly go down. And the market has been jumpy lately (see late 2018) about any rate increases; there is reason to suspect a panic may ensue when rates are increased. But if there is a panic (and crash in equities) due to rate increases, would treasuries then increase in value, or decrease?

What do you think? Will treasuries continue to be negatively correlated with equity even in the event of a crash/panic caused by interest rates? Will they still be an effective hedge on a Hedgefundie-style investment going forward?",finance

personalfinance,Recently learned about the avalanche method and can’t wrap my head around consolidation.,"I’m going to try to make this as brief yet detailed as possible. I have eight separate loans through Navient, all of which are federal. The interest rates range from 6-8% and I owe around $180k combined. I haven’t made any payments yet as I graduated in 2020 and forbearance saved my ass during unemployment.

I make 65k/year (pre-tax) so I’m in a pinch and am looking to go on an income based repayment plan. Luckily my expenses aren’t too high and I can pay around 2,600/mo towards my loan. 

The standard 10 year plan I’m currently on will require 2k payments/mo. I’m leaning towards going on REPAYE just in case a time comes where I can’t manage the 2k payments but again, can’t wrap my head around consolidation and whether/why it’s even necessary. 

Navient told me I have to consolidate to go on any income based repayment plan but I don’t understand how I’d apply the avalanche method if my loans are all squished into one? Also, why even consolidate if my interest rates don’t vary greatly? 

Does it make more sense for me to stay on the standard 10 year plan for now then consolidate and go on an income based repayment plan later if I find that I need to spend more money on other things and can’t dump 80% of my paycheck towards my loans? Or does going on an income based plan later on harm my progress in any way? 

I’m worried I’m going to end up being like one of those unfortunate people who pay $80k on a $100k loan over 10-15 years and end up with a balance higher than what they started with. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!

Edit: to add, I’d like to not live at my parents house forever and am expecting to receive a decent raise on an annual basis. I’m looking to pay aggressively now so that when the time comes that I can afford to live on my own (I can’t now regardless of my loans as it’s too expensive in my area), I can ease up on the loan payments and avoid regressing on any progress. I also have around 40k in my 401k that I can cash out with a penalty, which I’ve been considering, but I owe so much that I don’t think it’s worth it.",finance
investing,This rotation makes no sense - why are we worried about a cooling economy?,"So from what I understand, the current rotation from cyclicals into growth is due to worries that, when the Fed raises rates sometime in 2022/2023/2024, that will lead to the economy cooling off, which therefore hurts cyclicals, who usually thrive in a booming economy but not in a cooling one. Therefore, investors are buying growth now and selling cyclicals in anticipation, since growth performs better during a cooling economy. Add to this the belief by some that we're already in 'peak reopening', meaning that pent up demand likely eases from here, and you can start seeing why a rotation might happen. However, the underlying assumptions of a cooling economy and peak reopening are completely nonsensical in my view. This rotation makes absolutely no sense to me, and I'd love it if someone can tell me why I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We are nowhere near 'peak reopen'. Concerts haven't even begun in earnest, international travel is still nascent, many cities still have capacity limits and restrictions in place, people are still getting vaccinated, half of America is still social distancing. We spent 12-14 months laying at home, but suddenly folks are thinking we're at peak reopen after barely being halfway-reopened for a couple months? New York City, for example, hasn't even fully reopened yet. We have a long way to go before we reach peak reopening pent up demand, and companies that benefit from the reopening still have significant earnings to make before they begin to slow down. Heck, airlines are starting to cancel flights because of the huge levels of demand, and we're worried this demand is gonna start cooling so soon? We have no data or evidence to think this.
2. Projections are that the Fed raises rates by 0.5% by 2023. Why do we think raising rates 0.5% or so will dramatically cool the economy?  The economy is booming because of pent up demand, and we are seeing no signs of it slowing down. Yes, a marginally more hawkish Fed may cool the economy slightly, but this Fed would still be extremely dovish compared to normal times, even if it is not peak dovish. Rates would still be much lower than they were in 2019. At interest rates still below &lt;1% by 2023 based on projections, whatever 'cooling' occurs will likely be minimal, and again this rate increase is still at least 1-2 years away at least. We're really pricing in a 'cooling' economy a full 1-2 years early based on a minimal interest rate hike despite seeing no signs of it cooling yet nor having an exact timeline for rate hikes, while we're just starting the reopening?
3. A ton of these growth stocks have insane valuations. If our fears are due to increased interest rates, are we not at all worried that these high valuations will likewise come down? You've got companies trading at 20-30x sales booming, ironically due to fears of increased interest rates, while companies at 15x P/E that aren't even at their pre-COVID levels sell off. Makes no sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no expert, and it's possible everything I said is nonsensical. Please educate me if that's the case.",finance
Bitcoin,Two blockchain bills pass in the US House POLITICS,"From The Block:

""On Tuesday night, the [Consumer Safety Technology Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3723/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7&amp;s=1) passed in the House of Representatives.

Soto's bills had previously passed in the House, only to be shelved amid the political maelstrom that surrounded the end of the last Congress and the presidential election. Their passage this early in the current Congress will at the very least give the Senate more time to consider them than they had last time around. 

The Blockchain Innovation Act would require the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to put together a report on blockchain's use in trade and, especially, to fight fraud. On the House floor last night, Soto described the bill as ""a first step towards our long-term goal of setting up a Blockchain Center of Excellence in the Department of Commerce.""

The Digital Taxonomy Act — not to be confused with Warren Davidson's Token Taxonomy Act — starts with the proposition that ""the use of digital tokens and blockchain technology is likely to increase in the future."" It subsequently mandates that the FTC assemble a report on unfair and deceptive practices in crypto markets. 

The legislation's progress comes on the heels of major public attention on illicit use of cryptocurrencies following high-profile ransomware attacks like [Colonial Pipeline](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107496/us-official-says-majority-of-bitcoin-paid-by-colonial-pipeline-after-ransomware-attack-has-been-recovered) and JBS.

personalfinance,"Selling my house, using proceeds to fund continuing education. Where should I put my money to be accessible as needed, but not sit idle/lose value?","I have recently quit my job after deciding it was never going to be as good as I had once believed. I bought a house 4 years ago in an area that has experienced significant growth, and the home has nearly doubled in value in that time. I expect to pocket somewhere north of $130,000.00 from the home sale, which I intend to use to pursue a nursing degree, with the medium-term goal of becoming a CRNA.

I have a useless BA already (Political Science) and pretty much capped out on federal loans, so as far as I'm aware financial aid is out of the question. I therefore need to keep enough on hand to pay out of pocket for tuition, books, etc. Also, as my wife has made it clear that she is not okay with returning to a college student level of spending (i.e., ramen noodles and rice w/ chicken broth for every meal), some of this money will also need to go towards subsidizing our lifestyle along with her income. I will also be working full time for the first year of school (pre-requisites) and likely part time for the two years of nursing school itself. All in all, we've run the numbers and I'm confident our money will last, hopefully with a fair bit leftover at the end for a down payment on a new house.

What I'd like to know is what I should do with the money that I won't be needed in the very near term (~100k). I don't want it to be eaten away by inflation, even if only 2% annually, but at the same time I don't want the money in an even slightly risky investment, as a market crash would legitimately ruin our future plans. Is there a safe investment I can look into, something that will beat inflation but still allow me to withdraw funds without penalty, periodically over the next three years?

personalfinance,Odd situation: Apt complex towed my car by mistake. Now they're offering gift cards for the amount I spent on recovering my car.,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub, I'm not sure where to post this. 

My complex started pushing people to get tags renewed/plates taken care of, supposedly because the local government is pressuring them to do it. My car has expired tags, but I talked to the office manager after getting a warning sticker on my car about it. I explained the circumstances that led to the expired tags and the year-long process fighting to get those righted, so I could get the tags renewed. This process is ongoing and should be resolved early next week, if all goes well. It's all in the hands of the post office and bureaucracy at this point. They told me I wouldn't get towed after talking to them, and that they call before towing. 

Fast forward a week, and my car gets towed and I was not contacted at all. I was furious, especially because there were plenty of out-of-state and local expired tag plates in the parking lot that were NOT towed. Not to mention the asshats who keep parking all day long in the accessible spot without a hangtag or a plate showing they should park there. Had to pay several hundred dollars to get my car out of the tow lot 50 miles away, missing half a day of work because they're only open 9-5 and they're not staffed, only by appointment. 

I talked to the complex office, and initially they kept giving me all sorts of excuses for why it was that I was towed and not the others, that they don't police out of state cars, and that their process and communication with the towing company is still being sorted. I pointed out the out of state cars are not complying with state law requiring new residents to title and plate in the state, and that claiming to want to be equally enforcing the laws while ignoring other blatant law-breaking behavior is very puzzling, to say the least. I pointed out that I had been a good tenant, with no issues or complaints or late rent for years. All I left with was ""the property manager will call you"", and no guarantee the SAME thing won't just happen again next Monday. 

Two hours or so later, I do get a phone call from the property manager, saying how sorry they are about the mix up, that it won't happen again, and that they will issue ""points"" for an amount short of the total I spent, in their own rewards program, that I can redeem for gift cards to the stores of my choice. Initially I was happier to hear that I would get something back after all, but now I'm a little worried about how sketch it sounds, getting money back from the complex in the form of gift cards. Not to mention that, redeeming the points in some stores costs actual points, so it costs me ~$15 of ""rewards"" to get a gift card for $250.

Should I try to see if they can discount the amount from my rent or something? Either that or cash/check? I'm just very weirded out now, with how they chose to make up for their mistake. Am I overthinking it? 

Thanks for any advice or insight.

EDIT: $250 is not the total that it cost me to get the car. It was above that and an hour of driving each way.

EDIT #2: Went back to speak with the manager again. I voiced my concerns about the points being deducted to redeem the cards, and that I would take instead cash/check/rent deduction so I could pay my medical bills. The manager said they would need to talk to the regional rep, and see what they can do. They also didn't know about the rewards, they said, so they would look into that. I provided a copy of the towing bill, and asked to make sure I wouldn't be towed again this weekend. They assured me they have an employee working on making sure that doesn't happen again, and apologized profoundly for the mix up. Best part is, all of this I recorded on my phone this time, and this is a one party consent state. I guess I'm hopefully optimistic I'll be able to get my money back soon.

Final edit: I doubt anyone will see this, but here it is anyways. I checked the posted sign on the lot and the max tow penalty is over a hundred dollars less than what I paid for my car. There's no mention of tags being required to be up to date on it. My tags finally came in yesterday so they literally towed me while the stuff was in the mail lol.",finance

personalfinance,Please help me .... Re financing !,Ok so last year I lost my vehicle to a hail storm I needed a vehicle badly for work so I financed one with terrible credit a  600 credit score.  My interest rate is around 17% and I've barley made a dent. I'm basically just paying interest every month. Now this past year I've brought it back up to a 720 score and i think it would be smart to refinance my car it will lower my  interest rate and possibly my monthly payment. How do I do this should I go talk to my bank? Is there a car loan broker like a mortgage broker that would help me find a better deal? And would my bank offer me the best option ?

personalfinance,Extended car warranty for a used car,"My bank is requiring it to obtain an auto loan…

Idk something just doesn’t match up. It’s a credit union I’ve been with since I was 18 I’m 23 now. I have a good credit score. And some credit history. Since 2015 at least. Stable job, just moved with my partner (no new loan).

I’ll just go ahead and give the details below maybe someone knows if this seems typical or not.

My credit score is just below 750. My car is going out and it’s getting too costly to repair. I found a great deal on a used car with low mileage that will last a good long while. But need a loan to fill out the gaps. 

It’s my first auto loan. My bank can fulfill the loan for about 10k at 11%. They offered 48 months but I requested 72 month (they were offering low rates like 3% and I was anticipating on that to pay over the monthly amount but not have that payment hurt in case anything something happens. Not financially sound but the final amount wasn’t too different).

The thing that gets me is that I went to a dealership a while ago and got a rate for a brand new car it would have been an over 17k loan with a 6% interest rate for  72 months. Same score, first time loan, same history, and no co-signer. (Didn’t go for it because they started getting shady as dealers do and wasn’t willing for the term length on that one).

I thought surely my bank I’ve been with for years would be similar or less. Between the rate situation and my credit union to actually require an extended car warranty and everything to be 100% finalized for a private auto loan, it just seems weird? Idk maybe this is normal and this was a just the woes of a first time buyer.

Does this seem weird or what? I’m actually thinking that there was a glitch applying since I went online. I’m going in tomorrow to talk to someone face to face rather than email. Maybe they’ll have some answers.

In addition maybe it would be better to  go with a different lender? Any recommendations? I saw light stream on another post. I can always skip but the used car market here is awful. I’d have to wait a year or get lucky again and go through this all over.

Update:

Talked to my bank and essentially the underwriters changed their policy 2021 to actually include extended warranty on a used car if it is a first time car loan. The policy is essentially treating me as if I don’t have any credit history. I’m going to assume they got hurt by COVID

I’m looking for another lender because it’s literally the same rate and length as the new car was and I have no idea how that’s even possible lol.

Just thought I’d update since this was so unusual",finance
CryptoCurrency,Other People's Research: Sometimes Even Better than DYOR!,"Right after the old salts tell you ""Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto"", they tell you to **""Do Your Own Research""**. Unfortunately, here in the year of our Lord 2021, we also all know a racist uncle who ""did his own research"" on the COVID vaccine using Facebook Groups and Parler, and we saw how that worked out for him. How can you avoid falling prey to bogus academic-sounding hogwash masquerading as research? Easy. You find real experts -- experts who are trusted by other experts -- and you listen to what they say and watch what they do. 

# Experts in Academia: The Scientific Method 

The **[Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)** won't let you down. Thousands of people all over the world participate in academic research every day, painstakingly forming rigorous hypotheses, testing them, and then publishing in reputable journals. They publish so that others can evaluate their results and try to poke holes in their methodology or data. (This is a lot like upvotes and comments on reddit, except only people with relevant expertise get to vote. Even with those precautions, it's still a racist sexist trash fire... but it _does_ get results.) You can look for peer-reviewed papers on **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21&amp;q=bitcoin&amp;btnG=)** for example. Now you might think that cryptocurrency is too new for there to be any good academic research, but there are already some bangers out there: 

- **[Some Simple Bitcoin Economics](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0304393219301199?token=427494639CF831A7D38D31799C21CB30C2E0F8FEC63F2ED93BE411195B4275AFF65172968F18304E99EE4FCB04EA0454&amp;originRegion=us-east-1&amp;originCreation=20210624023315)** (Schilling &amp; Uhlig, 2019) - ""We show that Bitcoin gradually must disappear as a medium of exchange, if their total supply is bounded above and if Dollar inflation is strictly positive...""  
- **[Is Bitcoin Really Untethered?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jofi.12903)** (Griffin &amp; Shams, 2019) - ""Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns [in USDT purchases of BTC] are most consistent with the
supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency prices."" 
- **[Technical Analysis Around the World: Does It Ever Add Value?](http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_132605923.pdf)** (Marshall, Cahan, &amp; Cahan) - ""Technical analysis is not consistently profitable in the 49 countries that comprise the Morgan Stanley Capital Index once data snooping bias is accounted for.""

Now I know, nobody's publishing a peer-reviewed paper on your favorite memecoin or DeFi project! That's okay. You've got another ally in your corner!  

# Experts in the Bazaar: KYC/AML as a Signal of Honesty 

Occam's Razor says not to multiply complexities, or, in its modern bastardized form, ""the simplest explanation is probably correct"". Now if you love cryptocurrencies, you probably are not a big fan of banking regulations -- they slow down commerce, sap liquidity, create lags and latency in what ought to be low-friction transactions. Hate them or not, banking regulations like Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) are the gatekeepers to the dollar. 

Now, I'm not here to argue about the Federal Reserve, or whether the dollar will continue to hold its value. But I will argue that billions of people around the world today believe -- today -- that it is desirable to hold US dollars, and those people have to go through the gates of KYC/AML to get at their dollars. To a rough rounding error, these rules work as intended. These rules definitely do keep some worthy people out, and they definitely do let some scumbags in. But, largely speaking, these rules are enforced by experts, which means the odds of getting caught trying a low-rent fraud are high. 

It follows then that if you're doing a basic ""rug-pull"" or Ponzi, you would rather set up shop somewhere that doesn't have KYC/AML rules, because you don't have the extra margin to do an entire secondary complex fraud just to _hopefully_ fool the experts. And once you're in the US banking system, the experts don't go away! You can get audited, or you can just get detected by some anomaly-detection software and find your accounts locked out.

What this means is that, as long as you stick to exchanges that are touching the US banking system -- exchanges that transparently allow you to move US Dollars in and out -- you are much less likely to be a victim of a rug pull. Conversely, if you keep reading about a particular exchange making excuses about why they can't have a free-flowing two-way exchange of dollars, or why they have such strange instructions for how to transfer money in and out, and only do it via banks in non-US countries... Occam's Razor suggests that the long list of weird excuses they make _might_ be true, but it is more likely that the truth is ""we do not want to step too close to the light"". 

The ""experts"" in this case are the forensic accountants and auditors whose expertise scares off garden-variety fraudsters. It won't stop everyone who intends to cut and run, but it creates a two- or three-tiered system: 

- Systems that are perfectly legal in the US and can move dollars around easily 
- Systems that appear legal, but handle dollars in complex or awkward ways 
- Systems that are not legal in the US and which rely primarily on dollar-replacement currencies to take the place of the dollar   

Even if you're not in the US, you can still benefit from the systems our US taxpayers create. Choose systems from the first, or maybe second, bin and you're much less likely to have a bunch of shady characters run off in the middle of the night with a duffel bag full of your money.  

# Experts in the Efficient Market: No Return Without Risk 

This last one is really based on the **Efficient Market Hypothesis**. There are traders out there, wealthy traders, who make a shitload of money day in and day out by moving money around. They know the tricks, they know which apparent shortcuts are likely to be dangerous, and -- apart from a clown-car of guys who got caught naked shorting $GME -- the ones who make egregious mistakes don't last long in the business. It is a hypercompetitive Darwinian market. 

You are not better at their jobs than they are. I know it feels good to think you are. I know some of them are high-ego pricks from preppy private schools, and it feels _so good_ to hate them, and they deserve it, but at the end of the day, you're good at your job because you do it every day, and they're good at their job for the same reason.

If there were a risk-free way to make 8%, they'd already be doing it. Fairfield Sentry Ltd. was able to briefly sustain incredibly reliable **[10% returns year on year](https://mbrownltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_37361.jpg)**, until its founder Bernie Madoff was arrested for fraud. 

When you invest money in something that supposedly is paying returns, be exceptionally wary of these signals, which are all things that send seasoned investors heading for the exits: 

- The person taking your money can't or won't tell you in plain English what they are doing with your money to generate a return on investment  
- They can't tell you who your counterparty is going to be - in other words, who needs to borrow _your_ money so badly that they're willing to pay such a premium?  
- They guarantee returns, especially any returns over 10%   
- They tell you it is ""risk free""   

There probably are some market inefficiencies in cryptocurrency right now! But if the person trying to convince you to let them hold your money can't explain what you are taking advantage of -- say ""we are arbitraging the same-day spread on ETH:DOGE to park our DOGE in funds that give away promotional DOGE offers then cash it back to ETH"" -- if you can't draw a stick figure diagram of _whose money you are taking_ -- you do not really understand the trade you are making and you may be setting up to get scammed. 

Assume that you are no smarter than the experts. Look where they're going, not where the salesman wants you to go. 

# I ain't reading all that 
###*I'm happy for u tho* 
###*or sorry that happened* 

**TL;DR** - There is a lot of unscientific hogwash out there that appeals to your emotions, but if you truly intend to **Do Your Own Research**, supplement it with the hard-won wisdom of experts. 

- Find peer-reviewed papers that challenge your beliefs 
- Stay away from marketplaces that deliberately operate far from KYC/AML rules 
- If anyone promises you returns without risk, run like hell",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How should I invest 30k as a 25-year-old?,"Hi everyone, I'm pretty new to investing and managing money so I would really appreciate everyone's help. I have no debt and already maxed out my Roth IRA. I have 30k in my savings account and I am not planning on making any big purchases in the next year. I am currently living with my parents to save more money but I may purchase a house in 2-3 years (this depends on my future job location.)

With that said, I would like to invest my savings because they're just sitting in my bank account with a low interest rate. My question is, should I put them in a high yield savings account? Or should I open a brokerage account? Should I invest all of 30k or leave some in my savings account (I can continue to save portions of current paychecks in my savings account)? I'm currently sticking to these options because I don't want to make any high-risk investments. But any other advice on how I should invest my money is welcome. 

I'm not sure how taxes/commissions/fees work with high yields savings account or brokerage accounts so information on this would also be helpful.

CryptoMarkets,Derivatives + Crypto (possible??),"# What are Derivatives?

&gt;Contract based on underlying asset

A derivative is a financial transaction **contract** between two or more parties **based on** a change in the future value of an **underlying asset**. That underlying asset can be a tangible asset, an index, or an interest rate. Derivatives themselves have no intrinsic value.

&gt;Assets: Gold, silver, precious metals, coffee, rice. Index: Stocks, bonds, interest rates.

That is, users transact based on a change in the value of another entity rather than directly owning that entity. Profit is generated based on the spread and price movement of the underlying asset.

Derivatives trades have been around since medieval times, between merchants. The first base assets used were olives and food.

In derivatives trading, there are four basic types of contracts:

* **Forwards** Contract: An agreement to trade between two parties at a specified time in the future. The price is determined and agreed upon by both parties in the present.
* **Futures** Contract: This is a standardised form of forwarding contract and listed for trading on official exchanges.  
For example: In the US, there is the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
* **Option**: A contract in which one party has the right to require the other party to perform the obligation to buy or sell an amount of the underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date.
* **Swap**: An agreement between two parties A and B in which they exchange the cash flow of party A's financial instrument with the cash flow of party B's financial instrument for a certain period of time.

Crypto derivatives are only a few years old. In the following sections, we will learn in detail about derivatives trading in crypto which will help us to make a profit in this type of crypto market.

 

# What are Crypto Derivatives?

&gt;Short Answer: Crypto-based derivatives are dependent on change in value of crypto tokens

Simply put, you will trade with each other based on the price of tokens. You will not be directly owning and trading those crypto coins.

The biggest difference between traditional derivatives and crypto derivatives is that crypto's underlying assets are not bonds, stocks or interest, but crypto tokens.

For example, you see that the BTC/USDT is aligned with your risk profile and you can find a way to make money there.

There are two methods for you to participate in profitable trading:

* Method 1: Buy $BTC directly and trade it.
* Method 2: Trade derivatives of $BTC. This comes in the form of a financial contract. At this time, you do not need to buy and own $BTC.

If you choose **Method 2** to trade, you are trading **derivatives**.

Currently, in the crypto market, many exchanges and tools support crypto derivatives trading. Off-chain uses centralised mechanisms and on-chain uses decentralised mechanisms.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Warning of account closure at Bitwala / Nuri / Solarisbank,"I herby warn everyone from opening and using an account at [Nuri.com](https://Nuri.com) (ex Bitwala). I'm a user of their product since the early days. They have always delivered a great product, building a bridge between fiat and crypto (especially Bitcoin).

Bitwala recently re-named themselves to Nuri and partnered with Solaris Bank to and Celsius to provide an interest account for Bitcoin and a standard bank account with a bridge to a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet.

Don't trust banks.

I want to add an additional warning regarding their interest account (or any other interest account like Blockfi, Celcius and co.).

Terms of service of Bitwala (now NURI):

&gt;**Special risk factors for the Crypto Interest Account**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investing cryptocurrencies via the Crypto Interest Account is associated with significant risks. The risks described below can occur individually or cumulatively. For the customer (""investor"") there is the risk of total loss. The order in which the risks are presented does not provide any indication of the materiality of the risks, either in terms of their probability of occurrence or in terms of their impact on the investor and his claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;The further risk information on cryptocurrencies in § 8 of our General Terms and Conditions ([https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/](https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/)) must be observed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. No deposit insurance**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no statutory or voluntary deposit insurance for the cryptocurrencies invested via the Crypto Interest Account. In the event of a default by Celsius Network Limited (Celsius Network), no payments will be made to the investors by third parties (e.g. a deposit protection fund (“Einlagensicherungsfonds”). Bitwala GmbH (""Bitwala"" or ""we"") also does not provide compensation in the event of loss of the cryptocurrencies used and does not accept any other securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. Bankruptcy of Celsius Network**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investors bear the full risk of the bankruptcy of Celsius Network. Celsius Network is the sole debtor of the investors' claims to the agreed income and repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies used. Whether Celsius Network will be able to fulfil the due claims of the investors in the future depends solely on the success of its business activities. If Celsius Network becomes illiquid (e.g. in the event of bankruptcy), the investor will suffer a total loss of his investment as well as any income already earned but not yet disbursed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**3. No participation, co-determination or control rights**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors have no rights of participation, co-determination or control with regard to the business activities and business strategy of Celsius Network. Investors cannot verify whether Celsius Network conducts business activities that will enable it to service the claims of investors from the Crypto Interest Account in the future. The business activities carried out by Celsius Network may result in further risks for investors. As investors do not know the business activities of Celsius Network in detail, they are not in a position to verify these potential risks. Celsius Network could make decisions that could have an impact on the investors. The investors have no possibility to influence the business activities of Celsius Network. This also applies to the use of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. No state supervision**  
&gt;  
&gt;Celsius Network is registered as a Money Service Business (""MSB"") with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit within the US Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information on financial transactions in order to combat national and international money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Nevertheless, Celsius Network and its business activities are not subject to extensive government supervision. In particular, there is no guarantee that registration with FinCEN will meet German standards of comparable governmental supervision. There is therefore no state or other protection for investors against misuse of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5. Application of foreign law and prosecution abroad**  
&gt;  
&gt;The legal relationship between the investor and Celsius Network is governed by US law / the law of the United Kingdom. Investors may not be aware of the law and may therefore not be able to exercise their legal position under the respective laws vis-à-vis Celsius Network or not exercise it properly. Claims of investors against Celsius Network must be asserted in foreign courts. For investors this may mean higher costs and difficulties in enforcing their claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;**6. Price and earnings volatility**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investor bears the risk of exchange rate volatilities with regard to the cryptocurrencies provided by him. The price of cryptocurrencies on corresponding trading platforms can be subject to high volatility. The investor has a claim against Celsius Network for repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies provided by him plus the agreed income. This entails the risk that the cryptocurrencies provided by the investor may have a lower value at the time of repayment than at the time of transfer to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;The interest rate for calculating the returns on the cryptocurrencies provided is subject to weekly changes by Celsius Network. Medium- or long-term planning with regard to the amount of income is therefore not possible. For the investor, there is the risk that the interest rate will decrease after the cryptocurrencies have been transferred to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;**7. Tax risks**  
&gt;  
&gt;The current tax treatment of the income has not been conclusively clarified and may also depend on the individual tax treatment of the respective investor. It cannot be ruled out that the tax authorities and courts may adjust or change previous tax assessments on the treatment of income with cryptocurrencies. It is also not clear whether the previously applicable principles for the tax treatment of trading in crypto-currencies can be applied to income from the Crypto Interest Account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note:Bitwala does not provide investment advice to the client. Bitwala does not verify whether the Crypto Interest Account is a suitable investment for investors in view of their personal investment objectives and financial circumstances. Bitwala also does not provide any corresponding recommendations. Bitwala also does not conduct a reasonable assessment as to whether the Crypto Interest Account is appropriate in view of the knowledge and experience of the investor.

This is just so hilariously wrong coming from someone who thinks they are so right.

Visa is a custodial payment network that charges fees for processing transactions. They deal in multiple currencies. It, in and of itself, has nothing to do with fiat currency. They could theoretically settle in gold if they wanted to.

Fractional reserve banking has no inherent tie to fiat currency. Banking was done initially with commodity money - gold being the largest one. Federal reserve banks still hold gold on behalf of other central banks. Also, anyone can deposit gold into safety deposit boxes at a bank.",cryptocurrency

**DME.V**

* Desert Mountain Energy Corp. TSXV: DME. OTC: DMEHF. [https://desertmountainenergy.com](https://desertmountainenergy.com)
* Helium exploration. Production and refining expected to begin Q4 2021
* Developing a +85,000 acre helium project in the Holbrook Basin, Northern Arizona. The Holbrook Basin has the highest helium (He) grades in the world. Historic production of helium gas – 9.23 Bcf – ranging from 8% to 10% He
* Market Cap: 288.16M CAD
* 2020 Revenue: 0
* Helium is irreplaceable in many high tech applications and there is a global shortage
* He prices are soaring, with a 135% increase in the price of crude helium over the past 12 months
* DME is building a solar farm to power its processing/refining facilities (\~270 days of sun in Arizona).
* Along with helium (He), rare earth gases found include: neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)
* Significant helium percentages in two wells in Arizona (they have only drilled 3)
   * In the 10-1 well
      * Flow rate of 24,214 MCFGPD (thousand cubic feet gas per day). The average gas analysis showed Helium 7.1321%, Nitrogen 77.0837%, CO2 4.0183% Methane 2.6512% and other assorted minor gases.
   * In the 16-1 well
      * Flow rate of 1,251.2 MCFGPD. The average gas analysis showed Helium 4.0904%, Nitrogen 90.2742%, CO2 0.0063%, Methane 3.5535% and other assorted minor gases.
* Low percentages of carbon based gases (CO2, CH4) means lower refining costs as the nitrogen gas can be vented during the refining process whereas carbon gasses cannot be vented or flared due to environmental regulations.
* Estimates of the costs to extract the helium vary. The lowest I have seen is $65/MCF. HeliumOne has stated refining costs of $20/MCF. Total production costs are likely in the $100/MCF range.
* Refined helium prices range from $1100USD/MCF to $3500USD/MCF! On the low end ($1100) its 99.5% He and at the high end its 99.9995% He.
* There is going to be a lack of supply of helium once the US Bureau of Land Management holds their last auction of their helium reserves in September (this reserve was established in 1925).
* DME is currently drilling a fourth well with plans to drill 3 wells this summer (wells 4, 5, and 6 for the company).
* Construction of the fully funded processing/refining facility to begin this summer. Production expected to begin in Q4 2021.
* A large advantage for DME is their proximity to their customers. The company had planned on purchasing a fleet of vehicles to deliver their helium, but have reached an agreement with their customers to have them come pick it up. This saves the company $7 million in vehicle costs and they will not suffer the loss during transport. Driving from Arizona to Texas in the middle of summer would account for an \~18% loss
* The company has no debt, is fully funded through 2021, and has no plans for future dilution. Currently there are 70M shares outstanding with another \~10M shares in warrants and options outstanding.
* Desert Mountain Energy Corp. (TSX.V – DME) is a forward-looking resource company actively engaged in the exploration and development of Helium and Rare Earth Gas properties in the U.S. Southwest, with its executive offices in Vancouver, Canada. Currently, the company holds +85,000 acres land in Arizona, the world’s best address for Helium.

Feedstock for the facility is the world’s most available and inexpensive feedstock of household, commercial and construction/demolition garbage, including feedstocks of Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”) and cellulosic materials such as wet organics (compost), all plastics, paper, tires, cardboard, sawdust and wood.
* Market Cap: 431.33M CAD
* 2020 Revenue: 0
   * Commercial production expected to begin at the Aldersyde, AB facility next month.
* Begins trading on the TSX Venture exchange today (previously traded on the CSE)
* Many governments require diesel to have a certain % of renewable or clean fuel blended into it.
   * In Canada the federal requirement is \~2% and but each province has their own policy (see Q5 in link).
   * USA: The Renewable Fuel Standard is a federal program that requires transportation fuel sold in the country to contain 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel blended into gasoline or diesel by 2022.
   * European Union: fuel suppliers are required to reduce carbon-intensity by 6% for transportation fuels supplied to the EU. This requirement is integrated with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive. Both policies require Member States to enforce targets.

* Cielo facilities can transform most household and industrial waste that currently goes to landfill into valuable diesel fuel. Our facilities operate with virtually no emissions and we can help greatly reduce methane emissions from landfills, as well as reduce reliance on imported biofuels made from agricultural products.
   * Cielo’s process is referred to as Thermal Catalytic Depolymerization (TCD). Waste materials are liquified in the reactor with green power and blended with our proprietary catalyst. The catalyst causes an instant reaction and forms a distillate which is then distilled further into renewable transportation diesel, kerosene (jet/marine fuel) and naphtha.
* One Page Overview: [https://www.cielows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/One-pager-June-24-2021.pdf](https://www.cielows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/One-pager-June-24-2021.pdf)
   * Scalable Modular Model. Cielo has developed a simple modular “plant” manufacturing system. Each “plant” can produce 4,000 liters per hour or 32 million liters per annum. This format allows for multiple “plants” to be built based on feedstock supply at each facility site. This also allows Cielo to build in more remote locations and eliminate many transportation issues/costs.
   * Economics. Each “plant” costs approximately $50 million to build. Pay back on the capital investment is approximately $28 million annually based on EBITDA.
   * Facility Buildout. In addition to the pilot/test facility in Aldersyde, Cielo also plans to complete one corporate facility and one JV facility by end of year 2023. With all three plants operating at full capacity Cielo expects to see revenues of approx. $125 million in 2023, with expected EBIDTA of approximately $70 million.
   * Additional Facility Builds. Cielo expects to build at least 1-2 corporate facilities over the next 24 months in addition to another 1-2 JV facilities. With 5-7 facilities in operation Cielo expects to realize in excess of $350M in revenue and almost $200 million in profits.
* Cielo will, with its planned 40 locations in the next 5-7 years, divert annually approximately 3.9M tonnes of waste, creating approximately 1.3 B liters of renewable fuel making us one of the fastest growing ESG companies in the world.
* Cielo’s renewable diesel costs $0.56-0.61/litre to produce and sells for $1.67 in Alberta. That is a gross margin of 63.4%. This cost is expected to decline with scale.
* Cielo's 1st commercial facility is now operating and producing high grade renewable fuels in Aldersyde, Alberta
   * Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE: CP) supplying scrap railroad ties for 4,000 lph green facility for Medicine Hat.

## Antivirus pioneer John McAfee found dead in Spanish prison

John McAfee, the creator of McAfee antivirus software, was found dead in his jail cell near Barcelona in an apparent suicide Wednesday, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States to face tax charges punishable by up to 30 years in prison. McAfee was arrested last October at Barcelona’s international airport following charges the same month in Tennessee for evading taxes on unreported income from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consulting work, made speaking engagements and sold the rights to his life story for a documentary. McAfee was discovered at the Brians 2 penitentiary in northeastern Spain. According to a statement from the Catalan government, security personnel tried to revive McAfee, but the jail’s medical team finally certified his death. McAfee was The 75 years old.

## Chris Inglis confirmed as first national cyber director

Inglis will be tasked with making sure all the federal agencies operate from a coherent cyber policy. Introducing Inglis at his confirmation hearing last week, Maine Senator Angus King called the national cyber director and the head of the CISA “the equivalent of the Secretary of Defense and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.” One key challenge for Inglis will be defining the role of his office in practice. There are a growing number of agencies with offensive and defensive interests in cyberspace.

## New iPhone bug can permanently break WiFi simply by connecting to a rogue hotspot

Researcher Carl Schou discovered the vulnerability when connecting to his own personal WiFi whose ID included a percent sign (%) as every second character. On connecting, his iPhone’s WiFi would then be disabled, and only a full reset of its network settings allowed restoration. Schou and other Independent security researchers speculate that the flaw could be caused by a parsing issue in the Wi-Fi settings in which Apple iOS misinterprets the letters following the percent sign as string-format specifiers instead of considering it as part of the name of the specific hotspot. This kind of bug, he says, could have a severe impact in a real attack scenario that sees a threat actor setting up an open rogue WiFi hotspot in a crowded area such as a hotel hall or a station.

## Bay Area water treatment plant targeted in cyber attack

In February, a malicious actor attempted to raise the levels of lye allowed at a Oldsmar, Florida water plant to toxic levels. Now NBC News reports that earlier in the year, on January 15th, another threat actor attempted to impact the water being processed at a San Francisco Bay Area water treatment plant. The system was accessed through a former employee’s TeamViewer account credentials, and used to delete a program used to treat drinking water. The access was detected the next day, with the program restored. No one reported being sick from the incident and according to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, tampering with the program would not have resulted in poisoning the water.

## Ransomware payments might be tax deductible 

According to tax experts interviewed by the Associated Press, ransomware payments made directly by an organization could be tax deductible, as funds lost through more traditional crimes of robbery and embezzlement meet the criteria of being ""ordinary and necessary"" to be deductible. Payments made by ransomware insurance would not be deductible. The IRS has issued no formal guidance on ransomware payments, although the US FBI and other law enforcement agencies have issued guidance urging organizations not to meet ransomware demands.

## Six Flags to pay $36m over collection of fingerprints

The theme park operator has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit over its acquisition of the fingerprint data of visitors to its theme parks. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in a recent case that collecting biometric data at premises’ gates by scanning fingerprints of people who enter the company’s theme park violates Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court’s decision sets a precedent for how the BIPA can be used legally in the future, clearly setting limits on companies’ collection of biometric data and seeming to side in favor of private citizens’ rights.

MachineLearning,[D] Transformer model which predicts probability distribution,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a problem, where  I need to predict human activities in a time window. 

 I have a context, which is a sequence of human activities (and objects) and I want to predict the human activities in the next 20 seconds. The prediction should be a distribution like (0.2, 0.6, 0.1, 0.05, ...) which can be interpretated as: The predicted time window consists of activity A (20\*0.2) 4 seconds, activity B (20\*0.6) 12 seconds, etc.

So far, I have fed the activities in the form of word embeddings into various neural networks (e.g. LSTMs) and used Softmax to give me probabilities. That has worked well so far.

I was now wondering if there are pre-trained transformer models that I can use to achieve something similar. I have already found multi-label classification models, but these always have a target vector consisting of 0 or 1 per class and are not able to predict a distribution like I want.

I am grateful for any advice!",technology

personalfinance,How much will a 40-50 point difference make on an in-house auto loan if my credit will still be considered fair?,"Not sure if I’m posting in the right place but Background: 

I am a rising 3rd year law student and I am also a single mother. Texas is requiring us to return to campus this year so that means I have to put my daughter in daycare. So I am in desperate need of a car but I can no longer afford to drop $3-$4k on a cash car that may not even be reliable in addition to daycare and rent etc. So I was going to try to finance a car under $10k, $1,000 down, payments under $300 if possible. I have been taken advantage of in car buying in the past so I really need advice.

As of right now I’ve seen my credit score as low as 611 and as high as 624. Before this medical bill got reported as a collection in April, it was as low as 631 and as high as the 660s. The medical collection has never been delinquent and I plan to pay the remaining $212 within the next couple of months. The collection will be removed once paid so I expect my score to go back to where it was. 

But I need a car ASAP. So should I bite the bullet and pay the $212 in hopes that my score will go back up in a few days (although it could take a month or more) or should I just leave the collection since it’s been reporting positively? I guess what I’m asking is will the difference in score even make much of a difference in my Approval odds, interest rate, down payment, and monthly payment? 

FTR: I know I won’t get a great deal most likely which is why I plan to trade it in next year after passing the bar and securing a job. Also, could I be upside down in the loan before then? I’m not entirely sure how any of this works lol which is why I’ve been taken advantage of in the past.

TLDR: I need to finance a car under $10,000 ASAP and I’m wondering if paying off a medical collection that has been positively reporting will be worth the increase in score that may not even happen immediately.

CryptoCurrency,5 Blockchain Gems Disrupting the Supply Chain Industry,"**Why can blockchain help in supply chains?**

The key characteristic of blockchain is that it offers security. Therefore, its application in the field of financial services is self-evident. But security is relevant in many business fields such as pharmaceuticals, energy, or logistics. In the case of logistics, security is linked to another feature, which is transparency. 

In a proper implementation, participants of the blockchain are always able to track the location and condition of the product which is transported. Last but not least, blockchain can boost efficiency in logistics. Especially with respect to customs formalities, the technology promises many reliefs and could be an important element for paperless trade.

I am exploring the supply chain industry for quite a long time now. I shortlisted 5 startups that have real-world use cases and are seriously adding value to the community.

1. [OriginTrail](https://www.origintrail.io/) : It is an Ethereum-based ecosystem for supply chain use cases, founded in 2011.

personalfinance,Is an exchange from a Money Market fund to non-retirement fund in Vanguard taxed?,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this.

I have a VMRXX with Vanguard that's a rolled over 401k from a previous job. It's just been sitting there for years. I just recently became aware its interest rate is tiny so I'm wanting to move it to a VTSAX fund I have. Question being, would this exchange be taxed? I'm leaning toward no based on a sentence on this help page: [https://support.vanguard.com/tutorials/exchange-funds](https://support.vanguard.com/tutorials/exchange-funds)

""An exchange between different funds in a nonretirement account is a taxable event that will generate a 1099-B, provided that the from fund has a fluctuating value (**i.e., not a money market**) and the to fund is different from the from fund.""

In my case, the from fund is *not* a fund with fluctuating value (right?) so exchanging it may not result in a taxable event?

Thanks!

**edit:** Thanks for the quick responses! So yes, the VTSAX I am referring to is in a separate account, thus, I see now that I should exchange the VMRXX to a new VTSAX within the Rolled-over IRA account. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Just a quick reminder of why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir. But these days all people care about is the price.,"* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got insufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them.
* All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.
* From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation, you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at interest.
* Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
* Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.
* What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

investing,Genius Sports $GENI- Picks &amp; Shovels for Sports Gambling,"disclosure: 1000 shares and 2500 warrants

Here is the ONLY* way to play the pick and shovel side of the rapidly growing sports gambling segment: Genius Sports **$GENI**

*edit* *Competitor Sportradar is in process of traditional IPO but no date has been set. They had a failed merge with a SPAC recently most likely due to the high valuation and in my opinion the loss of the NFL contract. If the IPO is at a decent valuation this will be another good play on the picks and shovels part of sports gambling. GENI and Sportradar have a duopoly on the market.

Genius Sports is the official data, technology and commercial partner that powers the global ecosystem connecting sports, betting and media.

They are the trusted partner to over 400 sports organizations globally, capturing the highest quality data for many of the world’s largest leagues and federations such as the NFL, EPL, FIBA, NCAA, NASCAR, AFA and PGA.

Not only are they partners with the sports leagues, they are partners with the 300 of the world’s largest sportsbooks brands, and media outlets:

**Sports:** NFL, NBA, Premier League, NCAA, Football Data Co, FIBA, Euroleague Basketball, PGA

**Betting:** Bet365, Flutter, William Hill, Betway, Draftkings

**Media:** NFL, CBS All Access, Pizza Hut, Michigan Lottery, MLB, POINTSBET, FanDuel, BETMGM, Caesers Sportsbook, Volvo


Not only are they partnered with the NFL but **$GENI** won the exclusive distribution rights for NFL official data in April. They beat out their only main competitor, Sportradar. In addition to data rights, the partnership includes adjacent agreements such as video streaming rights to international (non-US) sportsbooks. $GENI will also support the NFL’s data collection and advertising capabilities while also helping monitor suspicious activity to maintain integrity.

This exclusive deal validates Genius Sports competitive position as a core cog in the global sports betting industry, where global sportsbook operators rely on data feeds distributed by **$GENI**

1st Quarter Earnings $GENI reported 1st quarter earnings on May 20th and raised full year 2021 revenue guidance by 35%

-Q1 revenue increased 52% year-over-year to $53.7m

-First quarter group Adj. EBITDA up 414% year-over year to $9.3m (net loss of $5.3m)

-Raised FY2021 group revenue guidance from $190m to $250m-$260m

-Announced a six-year strategic partnership with the National Football League

-Entered into a two-year marketing partnership with FanDuel to deliver data-driven, targeted advertising

-Announced the acquisitions of two leading technology companies, FanHub and Second Spectrum, diversifying our offering and enhancing capabilities

-Appointed sports industry leader and former Turner President, David Levy, as Genius Sports’ new Chairman. GROWTH

Gross Gaming Revenue expected to nearly double from $31B in 2020 to $59B by 2025 (via H2 Gambling Capital). These numbers do not include Canada who just passed a federal bill to legalize sports gambling across the country – Consider Canada as a second California for population.

**$GENI** looks to take advantage of this with 120% EBITDA growth CAGR from 2020-2022.

**$GENI** has also proven their growth over the past several years: $88m in 2018, $115m in 2019, $149.7m in 2020. As previously stated they have increased their 2021F from $190m to $250-$260m, already surpassing their 2022F of $238M.


**MOAT**

**$GENI** is the leading exclusive content and data provider for data acquisition and data monetization:

-They are the mission critical supplier to sports betting operators

-Provide exclusive, official data to sports betting operators worldwide with risk management and trading solutions

-They acquire exclusive, official rights to sports data from major leagues and federations

**$GENI** is one of two players (and the only publicly traded one for now) of scale providing full-service provision: # of events covered, # of sports covered, Sport League Services, One stop shop betting services, media solutions, Streaming solutions.

Their Technology and scale provide high barriers to entry:

-1500 employees across 6 continents

-450 employees in technology and trading

-7,000 statisticians and agents

-650+ long term partnerships with sports and sportsbooks

-$110m+ invested in proprietary technology

-Their technology exchange for rights means **$GENI** becomes fully embedded and hard to replace (150+ integrations)

-Analyze risk and manage markets, probabilities and results for 240k+ events every year

-Highly customizable software to manage every aspect of a sportsbook’s data and trading offering: outsourced sports wagering at scale


**OFFICIAL DATA**

**$GENI** has the feed of live sports statistics that is sanctioned by the sports for collection and distribution (BIG DEAL).

Why that matters:

Matters to sports – it goes to the very heart of their funding

Matters to sportsbooks – only official data gives them the security of the supply they need

Matters to regulators – protects consumers

Matters to investors – the cost of sports data is built into their model, contributing to our high barriers to entry

Anecdotal: Genius Sports is so important to Draftkings that it is listed in their risk factors



**Coverage**

**$GENI** has been covered by a handful of analysts who have all given this a buy rating with PTs in the high 20’s and low 30s:

Goldman Sachs: $31

Craig Hallum: $30

Needham &amp; Co: $28

Benchmark: $33

Oppenheimer: $32

As of writing this, the stock is trading at $19.40. Still a huge discount to the price targets above. Part of this discount is **$GENI** recently had an upsized stock offering of 22 million shares. While the market reacted negatively, Oppenheimer came out and reiterated their PT of $32 as they saw this as a positive for the company to raise cash to continue to acquire companies that complement their offerings. Most recently they acquired Second Spectrum (Augmented reality and tracking technology backed by Steve Ballmer), and Fanhub (free to play games).



TLDR: **$GENI** is the the pick and shovel data provider to all the favorite sports betting books including $DKNG, and the only publicly traded sports betting data provider in one of the fastest growing segments in the US market. With a huge moat, Exclusive partnership with the NFL, and partnerships with hundreds of other sports leagues and sports betting books why try picking a winner when you can invest in the data provider that supplies them all?



*Edit* It was also brought to my attention I was lacking bear cases. The only bear case I can think of is that GENI overpaid for the NFL contract. My rebuttal is while Sportradar had it from 2015 to 2020, they were not able to take full advantage of sports gambling revenue as it was not prominent or legal in most states. This is rapidly changing and GENI has built in 5% of revenue from any sports book that uses their data. As gambling continues to grow so will Genius Sports revenue. Another element of the partnership with Genius Sports gives the company the right to distribute live audiovisual game feeds to sportsbooks in international markets, while it will also represent the NFL’s legalized sports betting advertising inventory across the league’s owned and operated digital platforms domestically and internationally.

These aspects along with great exposure for the company via the NFL and Genius Sports ability to entrench their technology into the leagues technology make this deal worth it IMO albeit the high price tag.

If you have any other bear cases that I have not thought of please comment below.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Some Best Practices for Crypto and Computer/Device security,"This is written with new crypto investors in mind. More experienced investors may find it a useful reminder of some best practices.  The beginning is general best practices in handling your crypto with a high level overview of some things you can do to keep your crypto safe.  Further down is a more detailed breakdown of common device, internet and personal security practices to keep yourself and your electronic devices safe as well, thus protecting your crypto even further.  I hope folks find it helpful.

**Cryptocurrency best practices:**

* Never, ever, for the love of God, invest more than you can afford to live without.  Don't invest your rent, mortgage, bill payment or food/gas/living expenses money.  Do not buy crypto on credit or take out loans to buy it either.
* Never talk about how much crypto you have. It's a bad idea. Why? Because it makes you a target. The wonderful thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money. The terrible thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money. If a hacker penetrates your security and gets your crypto you're screwed, no recourse, your money is gone. So why make yourself a target by advertising? Contrary to popular belief the internet is not anonymous.  People can, and will, find out who you are and where you live if they think it's worth doing it.
* Make sure you use reputable exchanges.  Google reviews of the site before sending any money or even creating an account.  When in doubt feel free to ask here.  The biggies are (in no particular order):  Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Binance (not available in USA, [binance.us](https://binance.us) is but isn't as good), Kraken, Gemini, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (exchange not available in the US yet).  There are others, these are just some of the better known ones.
* Back up your seed phrases on something durable and store them OFFLINE in a safe place. (one copy in your safe, another in a safety deposit box is a good choice).
* Do not lose your seed phrases!
* Never give your seed phrases or passwords to anyone for any reason.
* For the love of god, don't fall for any ""Send me # crypto and I'll send you # crypto back"" scams.
* Do Your Own Research!!!!!!   Do not take someone else's word for a crypto being a good investment.  Value their opinion but verify the information separately, on your own.
* When you get a software wallet, which you should if you have more than a couple hundred dollars worth of crypto, make sure it's the official one, not a copycat.  Always use a link from their official site to download software wallets.
* When you get a hardware wallet (I typically tell friends to wait until they have at least 10x the price of the wallet in crypto to buy one) Only order hardware wallets using their official links.  NEVER buy or use 2nd hand wallets or 'free' wallets you get in the mail (yep... that's a thing).
* Never download any app for crypto that isn't from the official website or linked from it.  There are tons of scams out there that will try to get you to download bogus wallets, apps and even bogus exchange apps. Always go to the official website before downloading anything.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some further security advice if you want it.**

Warning... it's long.  I've been in the IT industry for over 30 years now and working in Cybersecurity roles for over 15.  It's terrifying how few people practice even basic security methods to keep themselves safe in the online world of today. The recent ransomware attacks on the pipeline and meat industry?  Totally preventable with some basic security practices. This is true of the vast majority of hacking/virus/malware/ransomware attacks.  So.. if you wish to help keep yourself safe online feel free to read below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep your devices up to date**

Always keep your devices on their latest security patches! I don't care if you're scared that windows update MIGHT break something or your apps might have issues if you update your iOS version (My wife's favorite complaint). I'd rather have to revert to a last known good than allow a script hacker using a downloaded exploit kit get into my system with ease. It's just not worth the risk to keep your system unpatched because 1 in 10,000 people experience an issue with update # XYZ from Microsoft/Apple/Whomever.

1. No, Apple computers are not hack/virus/malware proof. They are just as susceptible to vulnerabilities as any other platform. A LOT of apple users buy into the myth that the OS is more secure than MS. TECHNICALLY it does have fewer total known vulnerabilities but... it only takes one and more are found all the time. No OS is ""safe"", not even Linux.
2. Keep all of your apps, not just your antivirus and antimalware, up to date as well. It can be a pain keeping everything up to date on a PC because there's not a lot of automatic updating going on for 3rd party apps and most of the time it's a manual process. There's apps like PatchMyPC that help with this (do research before using one) and can make your life a whole lot easier.
3. Speaking of Antivirus don't just use antivirus. Get a good anti-malware solution as well. As to antivirus, ironically Windows 10's built in defender is actually a pretty decent antivirus solution these days so you can just stick with that and a good malware program if you don't want to pay for MacAfee, Norton, Kaspersky or one of the other premium AntiVirus programs. But make sure you have a good antivirus and a good anti-malware solution and that you use them.  Not just on your PC, also on your devices.  Folks often ask me, and no this is not an endorsement of any particular software or hardware please do your own research, so I'll go ahead and answer now: on PC I use Windows Defender + MalwareBytes as well as the Ghostery browser extension to block ads on any browser that doesn't already block them.  On my android I use Bitdefender.
4. By the way... yes... Apple computers need antivirus and antimalware too.  They are every bit as vulnerable to viruses, malware, spyware and ransomware as any other computer, including Linux.

&amp;#x200B;

**Use Two Factor authentication**

Even online games have 2FA these days. So use 2FA on any website you log into that has any kind of sensitive information on it, especially anything financial or email accounts. Wherever possible use an authenticator app rather than email or SMS for your 2FA. SMS is good if nothing else is available but phones can be sim spoofed and email can be hacked. So get a good 2FA app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) and use it or get a 2FA device like a YubiKey. Even Reddit supports 2FA now. Absolutely use 2FA for any site you buy/sell crypto on!  I even use 2FA on my online games when it's available.

&amp;#x200B;

**Periodically check your email addresses to make sure they haven't been breached.**

A great way to do this is to check [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and put your email address in to see if it's been reported in any breach reports. It's a very reputable site and is well maintained. No, you aren't putting anything at risk by putting your email address there. People can already get that easily enough. You're checking to see if your PASSWORD has been hacked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Password Security**

Don't re-use passwords if at all possible. Use a different password for every site and make sure they're complex, especially for email accounts. Never re-use an email account password because that's how sites reset your 2FA or password (or both) and if your email gets hacked all bets could be off.

If you have trouble making complex passwords use autogenerated ones from Chrome or Brave browsers built in password service or get KeePass, Bitwarden or any number of other good password utilities. Some VPN suppliers provide one and a lot of ISPs do now as well. You can also use these utilities to store them securely so you won't forget them. A bonus to using them is most password utilities, and some browsers, also have an option to check breach reports to see if your accounts stored in them have been compromised somewhere so you can proactively go change your passwords there.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *If you find that an account HAS been breached, immediately change that password and, if you've used that password anywhere else go change it there too.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Use a paid VPN to keep your network traffic private!**

I do not recommend using the free VPN applications offered by various browsers, ISPs, etc. They are junk and they log and they are not truly secure. There are a couple free VPN's (sort of free trials) out there that are secure but they have limited bandwidth or limited servers to choose from and they generally don't support split tunneling or many other important features. Pay the 5 or 6 bucks a month for a good one, it's worth it. No, it's not going to noticeably slow down your internet unless you're downloading a lot of really big files (more on that in a minute). Most good VPN solutions even let you stream videos just fine without any issue. I do it all the time on mine.

A VPN is vitally important if you ever use public Wi-Fi at a restaurant, store, workplace, hotel, etc. It encrypts your connection so that anyone looking at traffic on that network can't tell where you're going or what you're doing. This protects all your traffic, not just web sites, and makes you immune to MITM attacks. I won't recommend any one VPN over any other, there are a lot of really good ones. Because people ask I will admit that I prefer NordVPN but that's not an endorsement.  There are websites that routinely rank them. Do some research and pick one you like.

The big things to look for in whatever VPN you choose are:

1. AES 256 or better encryption. (many VPN provides call this military grade even though it really isn't.)
2. Integrated Kill Switch that kills your internet connection if your VPN drops.
3. Maximum Connection Speed.
4. Unlimited Data Transmission.
5. Firewall.
6. Multiple Device Support.
7. Worldwide Servers.
8. VPN Blocking Prevention (some websites, like Netflix, try to block people using VPN's. Make sure your VPN has blocking prevention as one of it's features if you plan to stream)
9. Split Tunnel availability (Useful for sites or apps that choke on VPN's, also useful for gamers who need to avoid latency for their video games.)
10. No Logging

Some 'nice to have' items:

* Multi-Hop VPN capability
* Anonymous DNS Server services
* Peer-to-Peer support (if you use any peer-to-peer network applications)

Note: If you have trouble using a website or app with your VPN you can use split tunneling for that specific app or website (thus why it's on my must have list) to allow your traffic to and from that app or website to bypass your VPN. Use it sparingly but it may be necessary from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't use any Browser Extensions that aren't for your security!**

I can't stress this one enough. Sure, you might be able to use a Facebook plugin in chrome to block all cute kitten posts, or whatever, but those extensions can contain keyloggers, track everywhere you go on the internet AND report them back to their creator/owner and even, in some cases, execute code on your system or take captures of what's on your screen. Even benign extensions typically include a permission like: ""Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"". Do you really want some random extension developer to have access to that kind of information on everything you do in your browser? Even if that permission isn't included when you load it they can add it later and if you aren't paying attention you may miss it.

The only browser extensions I feel are worth it are ones that come with your antivirus or antimalware software and a good add blocker if one isn't built into your browser already (not an endorsement but I personally use Ghostery). Believe it or not, there are malicious ads out there that can be used as a penetration avenue against your system and they can wind up on sites that you would typically trust, like Facebook, and others. Never turn off your ad blocker, no matter what the website you're visiting bitches about. I'd rather not read their content than turn off my add blocker.

**Important!** *If you are using any extensions check periodically to make sure they're up to date and verify they haven't been discontinued.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Android &amp; iOS (and any other device OS):**

**Android Don't:**

Don't ever side-load apps. You have no way of knowing if that app is trustworthy or not. And... guess what one of the most prolific hacks in side loaded apps is right now? Jacking your phone and using it to mine crypto in the background... another big one is keylogging to steal crypto keys and, of course, ransomware, malware, etc.

No, you can't mine crypto on your phone as it's banned on both Apple and Google's stores.  For good reason.  It will fry your device very very quickly and, end of the day, the device isn't powerful enough to mine enough to bother.  The crypto-jackers that hack phones to do it only make it work by jacking thousands of phones and aggregate their gains and even then it's only profitable because they don't have to replace the devices they destroy in the process.

**iOS Dont:**

Do not assume that your device is 'safe' just because it's an iOS device.  It's not.  iOS has plenty of vulnerabilities that can be exploited.  Make sure you keep your iOS devices up to date and have antivirus and antimalware on them as well as ad blocking extensions if possible.

***All Devices: If your device no longer gets the latest security updates from the vendor... GO GET A NEW ONE!  Seriously... outdated devices are super easy to penetrate.  Personally I prefer to always use devices that can support the latest OS version as well.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Some good habits to get in to protect yourself from Malware, Addware, Ransomware and Viruses:**

* Don't click on links in emails, SMS messages, Discord, etc. Look at the URL and google the site to see if it's trustworthy first then manually type the address into your browser if it appears to be legitimate. URL's can be faked in a number of ways. Also always pay attention to the end of the URL (not the beginning) to make sure it's a real domain. Google isn't [www.google.com](https://www.google.com)\*\*.mycoolwebsite.com\*\* (for example). Also best to hover your mouse over the URL before clicking it. This will usually show the real URL in a hovering textbox. Make sure the URL is legitimate before using it. You can also use Trend Micro's Site Safety checker or other URL checkers if you want to be extra careful.
* I highly recommend turning off dynamic display in your email. Basically this turns off images, links, etc in your email and disables scripts. Email is one of the most common ways hackers get access to you.  If you want more information feel free to use your preferred search engine to research it.
* Please remember: No bank/exchange/website/whatever is EVER going to ask you to send them your password/secret word/whatever. If you get a message/email/whatever of that type report it as phishing and block it. The IRS (or whatever your country's tax institution is) isn't going to ask you for your banking information or your social security number (guess what, they already know what bank you use and they already have your SSN) Don't ever give out private information to someone you aren't expecting a call from on the phone, SMS message Email or whatever and, even then, try to make sure you know that they are who they say they are before giving out any information.
* Don't download random crap from the internet! Stick to trusted sources of files if you have to download something. And even then use your antivirus program to scan it immediately after you download it. Also check the file hash before extracting it. This can be done using Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256 in the windows cmd line (on Linux you can use sha256sum ‘filename’) you can then enter the hash these commands return into [VirusTotal.com](https://VirusTotal.com) to see if it comes back malicious.  You can even upload any file to [VirusTotal.com/gui](https://VirusTotal.com/gui) before running/opening it and the site will allow you to run security scans on it there as well.
* Some applications will offer to install 3rd party software as part of their delivery. I hightly recommend that you always decline those and then go get those applications directly from the actual vendor, yourself, if you want them. At minimum the one wrapped into whatever installer you're using will be out of date and full of vulnerabilities. At worst it could have a virus, malware or rootkits embedded.
* Consider using the TOR browser if you go to sites you don't fully trust (I recommend avoiding them but if you feel you MUST go to them, be safe about it). It's a fork of Mozilla with some built in security settings to help prevent it from being compromised and it uses built in 3 hop protection (beyond your VPN) to keep you even more anonymous when browsing. Another good alternative is the Brave browser.  Epic Browser is another good privacy and security oriented browser and Ghostery is working on their own as well.

personalfinance,refinancing home for the first time - need advice,"Hi guys,

I am looking at refinancing my home, it is my very first home and I have had it for 11ish years, on a 30 year mortgage. I am at a 5.875% interest rate. my loan is with wells fargo and they are offering me a 2.50% interest rate with an APR of 2.895% with 1 standard discount point which im not really understanding. my house has appreciated in value, so I owe about 62k(899/month - Principal + escrow through them) on it and zillow and realtor.com have it valued in between 106k and 126k. I have 0 credit card debt, excellent credit and besides my home loan I have an auto loan in which I owe 24k (675/month payments) on

the wells fargo advisor said she would suggest refinancing my home to a 15 year term, my monthly mortgage payment would go up slightly but they would pay off my truck, saving me that 670 a month truck payment and taking years off my mortgage loan term as it would be 15 years now instead of the 19 years i still owe on it. 

does this sound like a good deal? should I shop around or visit with a broker before refinancing? do you guys have any recommendations? I don't understand, am I taking a loan out basically for the newly appreciated value of my house? my goal isn't to pull cash out and fix my home up, I just want to get in to a lower interest rate and save money.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. 
* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies.

deeplearning,Why is Normalization causing my network to have exploding gradients in training?,"Hi folks! I've built a network that performs well for image restoration purposes. I'm using an autoencoder with a Resnet50 encoder backbone, however, I am only using a batch size of 1. I'm experimenting with some frequency domain stuff that only allows me to process one image at a time. 

I have found that my network performs reasonably well, however, it only behaves well if I remove all batch normalization from the network. Now of course batch norm is useless for a batch size of 1 so I switched over to group norm, designed for this purpose. However, even with group norm, my gradient explodes. The training can go very well for 20 - 100 epochs and then game over. Sometimes it recovers and explodes again.

I should also say that in training, every new image fed in is given wildly different amount of noise to train for random noise amounts. 

I'm scratching my head at this one and I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions. I've dialled in my learning rate and clipped the max gradients but this isnt really solving the actual issue. Any ideas? Thanks!",technology
Bitcoin,Trying to Orange Pill an Older Relative by Giving a Formal Presentation,"(I’ve edited this post a touch to clarify a few things)

Hi Bitcoin Team!

My godfather/close friend is an older fellow, who owns a tiny stake in Bitcoin. He’s been soliciting financial advice from me because I helped him allocate his money to some vanguard etfs a whole back. He doesn’t understand Bitcoin very well and I don’t want him to own something he doesn’t understand. 

Ideally I’d like to give him a better education on the topic and help him to increase his bitcoin position to around 5% of his portfolio, while making possible for him to sleep at night and ignore the media FUD/ volatility.  He doesn’t understand it and thinks it’s going to go to 0. 

I told him that I'd like to just have an in-depth conversation about it in a few days. He likes that idea, and so do I.

So here's where you come in! I'd like to prepare some google slides that I can present to him formally and when I make them, I'd be happy to share them here for your use as well. I want to package my bitcoin experience in a nice, complete, concise presentation. 

I could use links to short video clips from influential people, quotes, and links to important charts. (Money supply and other charts about the financial system/ no TA, although I'll explain S2F to him)

Here are the points I'm imagining right now, which I'm hoping to abridge into a 20 minute presentation:

1. Quick overview of the financial crisis from a macro perspective. Just the main points, skipping over stuff he already knows.
2. What is QE?
3. How this was a backdrop for Bitcoin to be created
4. A brief overview of Satoshi, Cypherpunks, and the Sound Money protocol/ how it works. (the ledger, the halving cycle, mining, the difficulty adjustment, cryptography, and fully validating nodes)  I don't want to go to deep into any of this, so I'll probably make some comparisons to things he can understand and just scratch the surface. He should be left with the idea that this is new technology and pretty exciting stuff.
5. Stock to Flow, what is it and how bitcoin has tracked the price.  I'll tell him about Plan B, the anonymous Dutch institutional investor, which is an interesting story.
6. The interest rates in Europe going negative, what that means, and how we're headed there in the states.
7. Quotes from Billionaires on Bitcoin. I'd like to gather some one-line quips from Ray Dahlio, Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones.
8. Explaining a Store of Value, the properties of money from Preston Pysh's inteview with Robert Breedlove, and why bitcoin's hard cap and decentralization positions Bitcoin to uniquely be the best store of value humanity has ever created.
9. The best short (around a minute) Michael Saylor Video Clip. After which, I will explain that Michael Saylor is a MIT Alum, Billionaire CEO/ early investor in Apple, who understands networks and networks effects on a master-class level.  I will tell him about Michael Saylor's position in Bitcoin on his company's balance sheet, how he doubled down during the recent dip, and what he's doing to bring in the institutional investors.
10. A short clip of Jack Dorsey's interview at the Bitcoin Conference. ""absolutely, its the only way out""
11. A short clip of Chamath Palahaptiya calling Bitcoin ""shmuck insurance"" on the news.
12. Energy FUD and why Bitcoin incentivizes clean, cheap energy. Changing the bird's eye perspective on energy- why energy use is a good thing for humanity and the evolution of society.
13. Bitcoin in El Salvador, the lightning network, and a brief explanation of Bitcoin's game theory. I might tack on the reasons that I don't like ETH and why altcoins are irrelevant for him. Quick explanation of layered money. If there's a short, inspiring Jack Mallers clip please link!
14. I'll maybe close it with the idea that bitcoin is a speculative asset class, but it is also a growing network, with the intrinsic value being the network itself.  I'll explain that just like a Microsoft words utility is to help you make documents, Bitcoin's utility is:

Sound Money without Centralized Manipulation

Store of Value

Transfer of Value/ Settlement

Smart Contracts

Second Layer Network Technology

Financial Sovereignty for the Unbanked (and banked alike)

Access to a growing Asset class without real estate, wall street, or any third parties.

And we're barely scratching the surface.

personalfinance,"Student Loan Refinancing via LendKey - early repayment ""penalty""","TLDR: Lendkey potentially has a clause for early repayment which I believe will charge you the full balance of interest upon early repayment. 

So I know it doesn't make sense for a lot of people to be refinancing student loans right now but mine were private so I decided to shop my interest rate given 1/3rd of it was at &gt;5% and my credit score is 800+. Since I was looking I started receiving targeted ads and specifically got one from LendKey which was listing pretty decent rates for financing. I got all the way through the application process and was reading the fine print when I noticed that under the Prepayment section the following was noted:  ""If you pay the loan off early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge."" That sounded really weird to me so I wanted to see if my interpretation is correct. Basically I read that as if you pay off early, you still have to pay the full amount of interest you would have paid if you had the full loan. To confirm I called up their number and asked the rep who basically confirmed my thought. That said, the rep didn't really sound very competent so I don't know if she was just agreeing with me or if that is actually how it works. I feel like if they were trying to say you wouldn't get historically paid interest back it would have been written more clearly.

personalfinance,Trying to come up with a good strategy. Found out I might be in a bad loan for my solar panels.,"So I was looking at my solar loan and noticed that although I was making payments every month, my total cost wasn't going down.Found out I might be in some sort of ""interest-first"" loan?  Which, considering I plan to pay this loan off relatively quickly, seems like it doesn't matter at that point. I have very little understanding on this topic, so bare with me.

I have a solar loan for $47,800, my interest rate is Fixed APR 4.99%.  However I am required to pay back 13k within the first 18 months or my monthly cost goes up (I already have the 13k, but I'm using it for some other investments temporarily. Don't worry, no risk).

I also have a loan for my car, I owe $20,724 and my APR is 2.84%

I make 60k /year, My wife contributes $500/month.  I also rent out a couple spare rooms in my house which grants me an additional $1300/month.

I spoke to Desert Financial, because they hold my car loan.  They suggested I use my house to open a line of equity (second mortgage?) and pay off my solar panels and maybe something else such as put new flooring into my home (That has always been a plan.  Just not sure if I'm ready to spend 20 - 30k on it until I have at least my car and my solar paid off).

My wife also wants kids soon.

My main goal is to move my solar loan to something better. Lower interest if possible, but definitely off the ""interest first"" loan.

I have fantastic credit, and my home has more than double what I owe in equity.

I have no idea where to start other than the fact that I spoke to Desert Financial credit union already.I'd love suggestions on what my next steps are, or whom else I should contact for a loan / refinance for my solar.

My wife and I are planning on buying a home using a VA loan since it doesn’t require a down payment. However, there will likely be a ~$4500 funding fee as well as closing costs of about the same amount on a house that’s $190,000 (I believe the funding fee and closing costs are separate fees, but I’ve heard mixed things on that as well as how much the fees are). We don’t really have money to pay upfront at all, though with our BAH we could easily afford the mortgage even with the funding fee and closing costs rolled in. The issue is that you can’t roll closing costs into the mortgage. Does anyone have suggestions on how to handle this? 

I know you can ask the seller to pay all or a portion of the closing costs, but that could make our offer weaker and we could miss out on an amazing house at a good price. 

I saw somewhere that you can pay a slightly higher interest rate in exchange for a few thousand dollars to cover closing costs? The rate being advertised for my lender is 2.625% APR, but I’m not sure how much it would go up.

###Compound COMP - Algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers

Compound is a protocol on the Ethereum ETH blockchain that aims to establish money markets. In the crypto space, money markets constitute pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates based on supply and demand for a specific asset. Suppliers or borrowers of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning or paying a floating interest rate without the need to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate or collateral with a peer or counterparty.

Each money market is unique to an Ethereum asset. It contains a transparent and publicly inspectable ledger that includes a record of all transactions and historic interest rates. Investors with long-term investments in ETH and other altcoins can use the Compound money market as a source of additional returns on their investment.

Decentralized applications (dApps) and exchanges with token balances can also use Compound as a source of monetization and incremental returns. Analysts point out that Compound could have significant long-term potential, as it promises to unlock entirely new business models for the Ethereum ecosystem. https://compound.finance/

###Nano NANO - Digital money for the modern world

Nano wants to make money efficient and accessible for everyone. The altcoin does not rely on mining, printing or minting. Therefore, it is regarded as an eco-friendly cryptocurrency with less of a carbon footprint in comparison to other bigger cryptocurrencies. It claims to be a sustainable digital coin, requiring minimal resources to operate while processing a high transaction throughput.

Nano is fee-less and can instantly be exchanged into any currency. Each account comes with its own blockchain that only the owner can update. Users sign a transaction that updates their ledger and broadcasts it out to the Nano network.
Once Nano nodes see enough confirmations to validate a transaction, they independently confirm the transaction as irreversible, updating their copy of the ledger. This is a unique feature in the crypto space. All transactions are stored into blocks with a finite capacity, and users need to pay a fee to create new blocks.

Users may find Nano a compelling cryptocurrency, as it can process a high transaction throughput with minimal resources. The Nano convention can keep running on low-control equipment. For example, on the online gaming platform Steam, users have been recommending the use of Nano. https://nano.org/

###Neo NEO - A Smart Economy

Neo was designed to use blockchain technology to digitize assets using smart contracts and a standard programming language, similar to Ethereum.

Tokens are indivisible. The platform has a dual token mechanism that separates the rights of using the network from governance rights. Put another way, the digital coin has two main features — the right to vote and participate in the governance of the network and to claim GAS tokens needed to perform transactions on the Neo network. As highlighted by its website, the “network charges GAS for the operation and storage of tokens and smart contracts.”

Neo is currently being upgraded to version 3.0, known as N3, which aims to bring “the first all-in-one blockchain development experience to the industry, packed with powerful native features such as distributed storage, oracles, and name services.” https://neo.org/

###Solana SOL - Build Crypto Apps that Scale

The Solana blockchain aims to challenge the Ethereum blockchain by offering high-speed processing and low fees. SOL, the network’s native cryptocurrency, has gained significant traction in 2021.

Solana is a network built on the development of both Proof of Work (Pow) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Solana’s new consensus protocol called the Proof of History (PoH), coupled with Tower BFT, enables a more scalable blockchain with faster throughput than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. PoH “can provide a way to cryptographically verify passage of time between two events.” On the other hand, in PoS, “the rate of validation of transactions on the blockchain occurs according to how many coins a person holds.”

There are currently more than 250 projects in the Solana ecosystem. Some notable projects are - Serum SRM is a high-speed, non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX) - Raydium RAY is an AMM (automated market maker) and liquidity provider - Audius AUDIO enables free streaming for users using blockchain tech -  The Graph GRT is the indexing and querying protocol for the decentralized web - https://solana.com/

THETA is an altcoin of the blockchain-based video-streaming platform Theta Network. Users depend on the open-source network “to simultaneously watch video content and earn token rewards for relaying video to other users who are also watching the same content.”

Among the platform’s advisors are Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, and Justin Kan of Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. According to Chen, Theta’s “decentralized peer-to-peer network … can offer improved video delivery at lower costs.”

The Theta network uses two types of tokens. Theta pays users Theta Fuel TFUEL for extending their computer’s bandwidth into the network, while THETA functions as stimulus money for users that contribute excess bandwidth and computing resources.

The altcoin is likely to strengthen its position against other cryptocurrencies thanks to its growing list of partnerships. For example, Theta Labs’ “enterprise validator and governance council program” already includes Alphabet, Samsung, Sony, Creative Artists Agency, Binance BNB Blockchain.com and Gumi. According to CEO Mitch Liu, “Theta Network is quickly moving towards full decentralization with 14 enterprise validators.”

###ThorChain RUNE - Swap between blockchains directly from your wallet

ThorChain is a “decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol” that allows users to “swap freely from one chain to another, one asset to another.” Put another way, the platform that supports interoperable blockchain communications.

Instead of using wrapped coins or intermediaries, ThorChain enables cross-chain swaps with real currencies while still interacting on a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) exchange. On a side note, other AMMs include Bancor and Uniswap. Those cross-chain trades are powered by RUNE the native token offered by ThorChain. So far, ThorChain users can make trades with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin LTC, BitcoinCash BCH and Binance BNB. Other altcoins are likely to join the list in the near future.

In each trade, RUNE acts as a settlement currency allowing swaps between any two other assets. For example, a user who wants to swap ETH for BNB would first trade their ETH for RUNE before trading that RUNE for an equivalent amount of BNB https://www.thorchain.com/

###Waves WAVES - The Easiest Way to Access DeFi

Waves, the multipurpose blockchain ecosystem that functions as a token launch platform and a decentralized exchange (DEX), was founded by entrepreneur Sasha Ivanov in 2016. It is a fast blockchain with transactions settled quickly with low transaction fees.

WAVES is the official currency of the Waves platform, which enables users to create and launch custom crypto tokens. The Waves ecosystem also includes its own built-in decentralized exchange, namely the Waves.Exchange, where users can trade a newly created coin in a trading pair with any other Waves coin.

Commenting on their near-term goals, founder Sasha Ivanov has recently cited, “Several key directions and milestones will be pursued with the goal of locking at least $10 billion in different DeFi products on Waves until September 2021.” He added, “The Ethereum network has the most liquidity now but, at the same time, is the most congested one. By redirecting part of ETH liquidity to Waves, we help Ethereum and boost Waves’ usability.” https://waves.exchange/

EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ERRORS AND LENGTH",cryptocurrency
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown June 25, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The June Cardano 360 was yesterday. It is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
2. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa.  Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month.  Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges.  Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
3. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals.  Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
5. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).

8. Charles is interviewed on Yahoo Finance where he explained: 1) how the lack of an obvious decentralized governance system in ETH and BTC will cripple their efforts as they attempt to scale and the founders/core developers start losing prominence, 2) the ADA EUTXO system is vastly more scaleable with it’s local state being so much more amenable to sharding than ETH’s global state system, 3) Cardano has a high willingness to bring on users in hypergrowth areas like Africa where ETH seems to have little interest, and 4) ETH does not seem to be as highly concerned with interoperability which might become highly valuable in the future.

9. Cardano 360 is tomorrow. Don’t miss it if you want to hear about all the awesome things happening with Alonzo (smart contracts), Hydra (scalability), and everything else! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1397549347592675338)
10. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1398290866419105802](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1398290866419105802) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun\_Lisa\_Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun_Lisa_Yin)
28. We don’t often get to hear from the engineers behind Yoroi over at Emurgo. But, here’s a podcast with Vicente Almonacid from Emurgo. Check out 12:50 where he mentions the dApp Connector (Cardano’s Metamask Equivalent).

30. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
37. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

46. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

personalfinance,Livid. Someone help with possible reasons.,"Filed my taxes April 9th. Got my federal a week and a half later. State taxes (Maryland) took forever. Checked my bank account out of curiosity today, 2 months later, to see that my tax return is $1900 less than what it should be. So, a nice little $290 is what I was left with. 

Im so upset. Can someone please explain how this happened? I’ve never owed the irs a dime in my life. I’ve been doing my taxes with the same preparer for years. 

Things to know: I never not once took a dime from unemployment during the pandemic, I actually worked throughout the entire thing, if not more, and received several pay increases because of it. I pay for school out of pocket too which is what increases my refund just a tad bit every year; but all in all, NOTHING has changed. No dependents. Nothing new.

Im so upset because regardless I’m an average person and those $2000 were going to do A LOT for me.",finance

Then boy oh boy, I saw the head and shoulders and panicked even though I was head first in this community and said I'd Hodl until the end of time.

 ""I'll never have paper hands"" I said to myself while buying more. 

But then my dumb human emotions got involved and I sold mid way through the major dip lost about $760 and now seeing it come back up to almost 30 cents again really hurts.

personalfinance,Deferred Compensation strategy?,"Hi, I currently work for a city in the state of CA and about 4 months ago I started contributing to my deferred compensation plan that my job offers. I want to try to save as much as possible for retirement and get as much juice from investing my money in differed comp as possible.

Here is some info about me:
Age: 30
Filling Status: Single, no kids
Differ Comp contribution: 5% pre tax
Regular work hours: 40hrs/week
Hourly wage: $45.10
Yearly income: $86,592 (without counting overtime, graveyard differential, etc).

I believe my tax bracket for federal is 22% and for state (CA): 9.3%

My differed comp allocations are currently:
50% small/mid cap
20% global/international
20% large cap
10% bonds

The reason for this pick of allocations is that I believe that because I am fairly young, I can go aggressive with a high risk high reward strategy. But again, what do I know.

Should I keep that 5% in PRE TAX or switch it to ROTH? Or maybe go 5% on each?

I am fairly new to all this, so everything I am doing is based on reading about investing on the internet.

Anyways, thanks in advance!",finance
CryptoCurrency,What is Web 3.0? Four Altcoins leading the way.,"You may have heard the phrase Web 3.0 and wondered what that actually means. 

The rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment, overtaking Web 2.0’s centralization, surveillance and exploitative advertising. Decentralized infrastructure and application platforms will displace centralized tech giants, and individuals will be able to rightfully own their data. 

This is by no means a comprehensive summary rather an introduction to some interesting Alternative projects that intend to change the way the internet operates and how we engage with it going forward. I have not included Ethereum as I do not consider it an Altcoin in this sense, and would deserve a write up entirely of it’s own. 

###Cardano ADA -  Third generation Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain smart contracting platform.

Cardano is currently the biggest cryptocurrencies proof-of-stake by Market Cap. It’s designed to be a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain platform for running smart contracts, which will allow the development of a wide range of decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more.

Cardano is a product of scientific philosophy and research that is interoperable, energy-efficient and sustainable. All updates and developments are peer-reviewed before implementation. The Cardano Foundation is the main custodian of the project and a regulated, non-profit organisation whose primary task is to promote, standardize, and protect the Cardano core protocol.

Cardano’s truly global commercial wing, Emurgo, has been driving Cardano forward and has offices in Singapore, Japan, India, Indonesia and New York. Cardano also has an Ambassador program which invites skilled people from around the world to help with Cardano development offers their native token ADA as a reward for work done. Cardano hopes the scheme will “strengthen the transparency and decentralization of the Cardano ecosystem.”

Notable projects include - COTI, a blockchain protocol that allows crypto payments for various businesses integrating native fiat currencies - World Mobile Token WMT the first mobile network built on blockchain and the sharing economy based in Africa https://cardano.org/ 


###Algorand ALGO - Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol with open participation, scalability, security and transaction finality.

Algorand aims to solve the three main problems faced by blockchains today, also known as the blockchain trilemma: security, scalability, and decentralization. Further, block rewards are distributed to all ALGO coin holders, offering all holders an opportunity to earn rewards instead of just block producers - otherwise known as staking. 

- Low computation requirements: No need for high energy-consuming mining farms.
- Fast agreement: The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.
- Delegation: Token holders can delegate their tokens if they wish to participate in the consensus.
- Extremely low fork probability: Users can rely on a new block as soon as it appears. Even if the network is temporarily partitioned, Algorand ensures that no users have divergent views of confirmed transaction.
- True decentralization: the network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected.
- Governance: Community token holders can propose changes to the protocols and agree on its evolvability.
- Security: There is also no risk of data manipulation, loss, or destruction. Therefore, Algorand is a secure and a trusted platform

Notable projects include - SIAE, one of the largest rights management companies launches 4 Million NFTs representing rights of nearly 100,000 creators. - Republic is a private investing platform that lets anyone invest in early stage companies. - Ledger's hardware wallets provide the highest level of security for crypto asset owners. https://www.algorand.com/ &amp; https://algorand.foundation/

###Polkadot DOT - connects different individual blockchains into a single network

Polkadot is more than a single blockchain -- it's an ecosystem of connected blockchains, sometimes referred to as the ‘blockchain of blockchains’. The central chain (known as the relay chain) provides security for the entire network. And the side chains (known as parachains) increase the network's capacity. Dubbed a sharded multichain network, Polkadot can help blockchains become more scalable.

Most blockchains tend to do one single thing very well. As user adoption increases, many blockchains are pushed to move away from specialization into generalization to stay competitive.  By using Polkadot, other projects with their own blockchains can focus on their core specialty, rather than building sub-par features for integration and scalability. 

Note Ethereum 2.0 plans to offer similar functionality. Arguably Polkadot will still finalise transactions more quickly, and the Polkadot network produces stronger guarantees of transaction validity with fewer validators per side chain.

Notable projects include - Polkastarter fundraising platform that facilitates cross-chain auctions and token pools. Ocean is based on AI, algorithms, data processing and storage. Reef Finance used to unify liquidity between DEFI DEX and CEFI https://polkadot.network/

###Chainlink LINK- decentralized services for smart contracts on any blockchain.

Chainlink promises to connect all the blockchains together, and to connect them to real-world data that exists outside of the blockchain, using a secure Oracle Network. (Oracles are programs that can be used to retrieve and verify external data such as weather stations, stock prices, health records etc). Interoperability helps users and developers get access to varying features of different blockchains, all the while ensuring that the integrity of both the networks remains intact.

Any API (software with a distinct function that can be separated from it’s environment) provider, individual developer, or payments or e-signature provider, is free to join the network. The users can become ChainLink Node Operators by connecting their API to ChainLink which also has a robust reputation system. Every Oracle is given an on-chain identity and a reputation that helps in defining its reliability. The nodes in the network have to stake LINK tokens which could be forfeited as a penalty for providing bad data. This makes the network freely available to all and discourages bad data, while maintaining a completely decentralized architecture.

- Securities smart contracts–  bonds and smart contracts based on interest rate derivatives.
- Insurance smart contracts– data from external sources can be used in case of an insurable event.
- Trade finance smart contracts– these contracts could be used for confirming the fulfillment of contractual obligations.

Notable projects include - Chainlink is currently integrated into a total of 567 projects globally https://www.chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem/ &amp; https://chain.link/

This is only the beginning of the story, but this post is long enough already, so I will leave it there for now. [.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/4a/7d/ce4a7d6d5973eb83c68029cef4c25b23.jpg)",cryptocurrency

stocks,$SKYT - Skywater Technology - American semiconductor foundries with short and medium term catalysts upcoming,"for starters: this is only the second time I've done a DD like this, and I welcome criticism if you have any. I'm not a financial advisor, I'm like many of you, a redditor who got too interested in the markets while I've been working from home. 

Allow me to introduce you to an American semiconductor company that's poised to do very well in the short and medium terms. Skywater Technology is a Minnesota-based foundry that helps companies develop prototypes for highly specialized semiconductors. They're currently opening a second facility in Florida to expand production and capabilities. They also build radiation-resistant semiconductors for the Department of Defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors. While it was established in the early 90s, it only IPO'd a few months ago, so this is a stable, solid company with an established client based that's poised to grow as semiconductor demand increases.

I'm not going to get into balance sheets or earnings reports or anything like that, because they mostly don't matter for the catalysts I'm talking about, and we only have two from this year since they IPO'd. If you want earnings or income or whatever, look elsewhere: they're still negative. That looks to change as their second facility comes online in Florida, but like I said, it doesn't matter for most of the information below.

The stock has increased significantly since it IPO'd near $14. It's currently sitting closer to $30. It has a number of very short term and medium term catalysts that will propel the stock to new highs, but first let me explain:

* One of the reasons it has had such an increase in price is because it has a very low float, about 7.5 million shares, and most of its investors know that there's nothing but up for this company, so they never sell. (The short-term catalyst is based on this knowledge.) 
* Another note is that this is not a short squeeze, because nobody shorts this company because it's absolutely suicide. The stock only goes up. It's %short is less than 2% of float.

#Short-term: Russel 3000 today.

[The Russell has announced that $SKYT will be included in the Russell 3000 later today.](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-technology-set-to-join-russell-3000-index/) This is the first time this stock has been indexed, and as such the index will be forced to buy shares. With a low float and a small shareholder base comprised of buy-and-hold investors, this volume will cause a spike in the price. 

#Medium-term: Semiconductor funding

The US federal government has been working on a bill to secure American semiconductor manufacturing. Skywater is wholly based in the US, with a foundry in Minnesota and another about to open up in Florida. It's a key provider for radiation-resistant chips for the Department of Defense, and might be the only company able to fulfill some of those contracts. At a market cap of 1.2 billion, it's very likely to receive the most money from this bill by market cap of any company. [Shortly before the Senate agreed on their version of the bill, the senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar, as well as their US Representative Dean Phillips toured the plant.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005861/en/SkyWater-Hosts-Senator-Amy-Klobuchar-and-Representative-Dean-Phillips) This company is on Congress's radar. They're getting a nice piece of the pie.

#Another catalyst of questionable term

Another factor is that Skywater does not trade options. This is likely due to the relatively low volume of the stock. The above catalysts could propel the volume high enough for options trading. If options start being traded, volume will further increase. Volume is $SKYT best friend, and if you're a $SKYT investor, it's your best friend too.

CryptoCurrency,Algorand APY on coinbase has been lowered,"Today, Coinbase has dropped the APY on Algorand holdings from 6.0% to 4.0%. I know I know... I shouldn't be using Coinbase at all.

The change in interest rate came out of nowhere. And the APY listed on algoexplorer is still at 5.75%, which implies that there are better interest rates to be had. Is AlgorandWallet my best option?

stocks,PTRA: Perhaps the Most Direct Beneficiary from the Infra Deal,"[Proterra](https://www.proterra.com/) \- $PTRA - you know know them, the electric bus company.

For the Investors:

* [The bipartisan infrastructure bill's framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/) agreed upon in Washington yesterday explicitly sets aside $7.5b for Electric busses (scroll 2/3 way down to see the allocation table).
* PTRA is not some 2025+ until revenue ""company."" They're building and selling electric busses all over the country right now.

* Backing from Washington.
   * The Secretary of Energy - Jennifer Granholm - was [previously on the board of directors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/politics/jennifer-granholm-proterra-stock/index.html) of Proterra before surrendering the position to take her position in the administration.
   * Before the reverse merger, on the [board of Arclight](https://arclightclean.com/our-team/) was the co-founder of lobbyist Clean Energy for Biden (now Clean Energy for America), Audrey Lee.
   * Biden recently took a video conference tour of the factory. I won't link it here because auto-mod kills posts with links to certain video websites to protect against grifters. Easy to find with a simple search though. 
* As crowded as the EV space is, there just isn't solid US-based competition keeping them from seizing the moment. [This article](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/5-electric-bus-makers-shifting-next-gear) does well to show the competition, which is all EU/CN-based. Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They're not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it's about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.
   * Municipalities aren't just buying this to show how ""green"" they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn't they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?
* The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S\*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it's no longer a S\*AC). The wheat is separating from the chaff among those companies now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the short-term opportunist crowd:

* Bullish options chain up to $30 and some recent unusual options activity ATM.
* Short Interest is hard to tell from [Ortex](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/Nasdaq/PTRA/short_interest) this early in the new ticker's life, but:
   * 99.80% utilization
   * [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/PTRA) shows a measly 1,000 shares available to borrow at. . .
   * 86.8% cost to borrow. Lenders want serious interest on something they feel is at risk to squeeze.
   * Mark-to-Market losses for short sellers this week during its climb from $16 -&gt; \~$18.
   * For the TA crowd, it's about to cross MACD on the 3M chart.

personalfinance,"Sell our car to pay off debt, does this make sense?","So, I have 51k in private loans at 3.26% I just refinanced at 700.25 a month. 

Have 30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

That is our only debt (my debt). 

We collectively make 190-200k

We are 29 years old and have a combined net worth of ~250k-260k. That included retirement, home equity, paid off vehicles, etc. 

We have a 1.5 year old and are planning to have another baby soon. My wife is a teacher and we want her to be able to take a few years off with the next baby. 

To do that, we would need that 700/monthly student loan payment gone, so I can continue to contribute to retirement and our sons college fund. 

Here is my plan. I have a 2003 Tahoe she has a 2019 VW. We paid 30k for the VW in December 2018. Vroom offered us 23,500 now for the truck. 

Sell the VW, buy 1 more cheap commuter car, and sit on the money until September-October. Pay off the 51k in private loans, have around 5k left. Build our emergency fund back up to 15k by November-December. Save from December-June for a nicer car for my wife and the kids. End of June comes, we will be able to live comfortably off of 1 income. Going from 185-190k to 115-125k. 

Does this sound like a good plan? Is it over kill? Truck has 32k miles, 7 year 110k warranty. But, with used car prices the way they are now, if we sell, that means we drove for 30 months at 200/month. 

Thanks in advance. Looking forward to reading your responses.

Edit: if we don’t sell the car to pay the loans, I could cover everything monthly when she stops working, but would have to stop college savings, stop maxing my Roth and probably decrease my 401k, which I don’t think is the right move.",finance

stocks,What happens to the stock market if labor participation keeps dropping?,"Not sure if there has been discussion?  I didn't see a search function.  If there is one I will do that.

I am trying to make sense of everything going on. There are lots of things I do not understand like Hawkish vs Dovish.  I believe the debate right now is do the Feds raise the rates to slow down inflation or do they leave them low to support the labor market?

If we look at labor restraints for manufacturing, shipping, etc I think the general assumption on Wall Street is that we are getting back to full participation at some point.  We are just having a difficult time figuring out how long that will take.

If for instance the Junes job report shows job losses, what is the impact on the market?  What if we have a continual drain on the labor force of let's say, 100k people exiting the workforce every month?  Would that catch up to a company like American Airlines and force them into Chapter 11?  That is to say, what if American Airlines actually loses more staff and has to cancel 100 flights/day in September?

I will be a temp for 6 months or less, and being paid $25/hr. The temp agency offers multiple benefits packages and a 401k. Considering that I will be hired through the temp agency for such a short period of time, should I forgo the benefits and 401k? I am currently still on my parents plan so I will still have health and dental. Also, I figure I should forgo the 401k since I'll have to pay taxes to enter it, and then pay taxes and a penalty on it (likely less than $1000 will be accumulated in 6 months) to roll it over once I'm hired out of the temp agency.

He talks about the inverse relation between (rapid) increase in oil prices, lowering supply and high demand, but he takes a detour. The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after… oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007. No more cheap refinancing causing defaults (subprime etc), and booooom.

Let's jump right in to leverage! 

# People Misunderstand Leveraged Investing Strategies 

Let's visit someone who blew up an account - [Market Timer over at Bogleheads.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934)

Market Timer was following a popular Yale paper at the time - Mortgage your Retirement and the later book [Lifecycle Investing.](https://smile.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement/dp/B005X4I7ZI) The premise of Lifecycle investing is you start off with an aggressive 200% equities allocation while you're young. Essentially instead of saving $10,000 per year, if you invest with 2x leverage it's like you're saving $20,000 a year. You're borrowing time from the future and smoothing out sequence of risk returns. If the market tanks 50% in one year, an young investor can withstand a $5,000 50% loss. An older investor near retirement with $2 million can't withstand a $1 million loss. 

Eventually with Lifecycle Investing you'll reach a point where you start to de-risk your leverage ratio essentially borrowing a ""constant"" portfolio of your expected retirement each year. Then as you get closer to retirement you glidepath into an 80/20 or 75/25 bond allocation. On average the Lifecycle Strategy historically gets you to retirement 10 years faster at a 15-25% savings rate than traditional retirement would in 100% stocks. 

The key thing Market Timer missed is the paper calls for **monthly reset** of the 2x leverage. If you monthly reset SPY [you would not have been margin called in 2008.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=200&amp;symbol2=CASHX&amp;allocation2_1=-100)


It's incredibly hard to do monthly reset of leverage intuitively, but it is critical to do so if you're following this paper. It is literally buying more stocks when the price of stocks is high, and selling your stocks to pay down your margin loan when stocks crash. It is a brainfuck strategy.

Let's say you have $100k you want to put at 2x leverage. That means you're buying an additional $100k of stocks on margin. So you now have a $200k position with a $100k margin loan backing it. If you sell this position you're left with $100k, your equity. So your leverage ratio is $200k position / $100k equity = 2x leverage.

Now, what happens if stocks double from here? What is your new leverage? 

Your position is now $400k, you still have $100k of a margin loan, and your equity is $300k. Your leverage is now $400k/$300k = 1.33x leverage ratio. You now absolutely have to buy more stocks at the top of the market to maintain your desired 2x leverage ratio. 

Ok, now let's do the other case, what if stocks drop 25% instead? (50% will result in a margin call).  What is your new leverage if stocks drop 25%? 

Your $200k position is now $150k, you still have a $100k margin loan, and your equity is $50k. Your leverage ratio greatly increased! It's now $150k position / $50k equity = 3x. You better sell down some shares with the market being in the bottom as now you're way more risky than 2x leverage. Further percentage losses will be even worse.

On Reg-T your maintenance margin is 25% equity. You're currently at 33% equity - 50k equity/150k position. TD Ameritrade's house maintenance margin is 30%. **You're 3% away from getting a margin call to wire in funds or sell down your position.**  IBKR is getting ready to auto liquidate you at their maintenance margin! 

So as you can see a trading strategy on margin you literally buy high and sell low. It's very hard for people to do in practice.

# Enter Leveraged ETFs

Since managing leverage yourself is a brainfuck calculation, instead it's better to invest with a leveraged fund like 2x for SSO, or 3x - UPRO. This is why UPRO and SSO daily reset their leverage! It's providing you the most safety and the most return!

In my code with quantconnect daily reset = monthly reset. There is no additional volatility decay from daily reset. You're going to have the same volatility decay even if you manage monthly reset of leverage on your own. 

UPRO/TMF has a 0.75% management fee and with $2.2 billion of AUM they're getting **institutional** borrow rates. IBKR marks up their margin interest rates by 75 basis points. In my code on quantconnect.com UPRO and TMF are identical to SPY and TLT on portfolio margin after adjusting for actual margin interest paid. Unfortunately portfolio visualizer's CASHX variable does no margin markup so SPY and TLT look misleading compared to UPRO and TMF. 

You're getting an excellent deal for the leverage UPRO and SSO provide. You can run these funds in a cash account, in retirement accounts, and so on. I'm running Hedgefundie's portfolio in all my accounts - taxable, Roth IRA, pre-tax solo 401k (rolling 100% over to the roth ira in the 22% marginal bracket), and a HSA account.

# People Misunderstand Leveraged ETFs

[Volatility decay is a myth.](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php) This article explains it a lot better than I can. You can buy and hold leveraged ETFs for long term! 

I just showed you how leverage works. The market is a lot more trending/momentum based over a period of 10-20 trading days. You're not going to see a daily gain of 10% followed by a loss of 10% each and every day. Yes the Leverage ETF prospectuses is scary with math of the VIX being 75+ for an **entire year** of having substantial losses but they're writing it as if **every day** in the market followed the same gain 10% and lose 10%. In COVID the VIX spiked to 85 then quickly normalized to 25.

This last back test is why I'm 100% invested in this portfolio. I could *possibly* achieve $1.3 billion dollars nominally. I have a chance to hit that figure at age 62 if history repeats itself. 

Yes its $555 million inflation adjusted to 1987 dollars, and that $62m of the S&amp;P 500 is $25m in 1987 dollars. And yes, past performance is no predictor of future returns. 

CASHX is modeling actual interest rates. It's the 1-month Treasury Bills from 1972+. No 0.75% markup though which IBKR and UPRO/TMF have.

# Why does Hedgefundie's Portfolio make so much money?

It's due to several factors. Currently the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) of these two asset classes is 55% stocks and 45% bonds. The unlevered portfolio has about a 8% return and a 15% drawdown during 2008. The 2x leveraged portfolio has a 16% return and 30% drawdown, and 3x roughly 24% return for a 60% drawdown risk. 

100% stocks has 50% drawdown risk, which was my previous portfolio. I'm comfortable with 10% more drawdown risk.

Second, because we are adding leverage, we are still maintaining the [tangency portfolio but getting more return for the same amount of risk vs 100% stocks.](https://i1.wp.com/earlyretirementnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beat-the-market-Chart03.png?resize=863%2C627&amp;ssl=1) Credit goes to Early Retirement Now for this graph. With the 3x leverage we're going past 100% stocks and our risk is 27% standard deviation along that same tangency line. 

Many people try to get more return by mixing in riskier assets like Venture Capital, international funds, and so on. Instead Hedgefundie's Portfolio is Modern Portfolio Theory taken to the extreme.  

We are getting more return from having a large insurance component being heavily weighted to bonds. They saved the portfolio a lot in 2008 and in 2020 during Covid. Another quite surprising fact is we are actually profitable on this insurance too. 

Finally, Hedgefundie's portfolio deploys a well oiled correlation trading strategy that produces a crap ton of extra yield via quarterly rebalancing vs annual or monthly rebalancing. The rebalancing period is correlated to when earnings reports are minimal in the stock market. Essentially each quarter you're making a 55/45 bet on the market having great earnings or disappointing earnings. 

# How correlation trading strategies work

Let's say we have two assets that are **perfectly inverse correlated.** Let's say asset A has a 50/50 chance of either doubling or losing 50%, and asset B likewise has the opposite chance?  Can you think of any trading strategy to take advantage of these facts?

Let's say we have $100k to invest with. One strategy is to throw 50% on A and 50% on B - $50k each. After some point in time let's say A doubles to $100k. B will halve to $25k. Now our portfolio is valued at $125k - a 25% gain! So now we rebalance both to $75k A and B.

Now, what happens if we add leverage to this trade?

So instead of taking $100k to invest with, we borrow an additional $100k with our equity. We now have $100k on A and $100k on B. After one year we have $200k on A, and $50k on B. We have a $250k position and owe $100k. Subtract $100k and our equity is $150k. 

Since our equity is $150k we now have a 50% gain. The 2x leverage doubled our return.

Bringing this back to Hedgefundie's portfolio it's a well oiled correlation trading strategy machine with a ton of leverage. Now you see why that 55/45 bet every quarter is paying off! It doesn't matter if earnings are bad or good, **we still profit.**  We do expect more good earnings it being the stock market and growth, so that's why we're weighting our bets a bit for the optimal growth. ;) 

# 40+ year bond bull market - aren't you worried about rising interest rates?

No, I am not. Most the return comes from the 165% equities, with TMF acting in the nick of time for crash insurance. [If we plot out simulated UPRO and TMF you see simulated TMF doubles then draws down 50% all the freaking time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+100%25+UPRO&amp;portfolioName2=Simulated+100%25+TMF&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=300&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_2=300&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200&amp;allocation3_2=-200)  We see UPRO trending. Again, we are seeing the correlation trading strategy I just discussed about in action!


Then for rising interest rates, bond funds operate differently than an individual bond does! That is because bond funds have [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). TLT happens to sell the 20 year bond to buy the 30 year bond at auction! So if interest rates raise slowly, say no more than 0.25% - 0.50% per quarter, then soon you'll start profiting with the higher interest rate! 

Then there are many strategies that you actually want to go LONG on 20+ year treasuries in a rising interest rate environment, such as the [Barbell Strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

&gt; In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

Right now TMF is mooning as thanks to the Feds statements there are less inflation fear in the 20+ year treasury market. So now yields are dropping which causes bonds to rise. The yield curve is flattening as bond investors are trying to get the risk free rate regardless of the duration of the bonds due to the positive outlook.

If TMF keeps it up it will be the first time I'll have to sell TMF to buy some UPRO! I got really tired of having to buy TMF all throughout Covid. I'm sitting on some nice gains having to buy TMF at $22! It's about time to back up the truck a bit on more UPRO shares! 

Many people in the Hegdefundie Bogleheads thread also simulated random 1-6% randomly rising interest rates using a monte carlo situation and the portfolio holds just fine under those conditions. 

If you look closely at the backtests the last ten years have been the highest gains vs earlier on in 1987. We're investing in these bonds not for their income but for their capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 10% to 9% is not going to produce much capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 2% to 1% is going to have tremendous capital gains. 

Again the purpose of these bonds are stock-market crash insurance. Most of our return is coming from the 165% equities position. The future predicted low interest rate environment is very favorable for the bond component of this portfolio. Again, this portfolio makes great use of a correlation trading strategy so we **want** interest rates to raise and fall and have it be **inversely correlated** with the stock market! We want to keep those low interest rates! Let's keep that money printing machine going! 

# Why I'm not worried about another 1970-1980 stagflation era

This is the worst drawdown period for Hedgefundie's portfolio. It has a 75% drawdown over this decade. I completely discount this era due to one critical reason: [US Treasuries were CALLABLE until 1985!](https://www.sapling.com/7796395/treasury-bonds-callable)  No one in the right mind would be running a leveraged treasury portfolio in 1970!

Callable bonds are bonds that can be called at face value at any time! Let's say the treasury issued bonds at 12% in one year then the next year rates dropped to 6%. The treasury's call feature let them stop interest payments and they were called at face value. 

So you have large NAV losses when interest rates rise, and you don't get any upside when interest rates drop! 

Now, just because historically these treasuries had a call feature doesn't mean that the US treasury exercised it. So I went to my local library and viewed old WSJ articles from the 70s on microfiche. Sure enough there are huge lists of US treasuries that got called every single month in these articles! It would not make any logical sense to run a leveraged bond portfolio in this era! 

This entire portfolio is a play that US treasuries are no longer callable and I would stop trading this portfolio if they ever become callable again in the future. It's also a play on the current Fed policy remaining the same - doing quantitative easing and dropping interest rates in future stock market crashes just like they did for 2008 and Covid! 

# TMF is a Yield-Curve Play on Long Term 20+Year US Treasuries

Right now the 20+ year US treasury is trading at 1.5%. TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps with the overnight rate effectively 0%, with 80% of the fund being TLT itself. You're getting 1.5% * 3x leverage = 4.5% of interest on TMF before lending expenses. After TMF's 0.75% management fee it's a 3.75% APR return. If you're 55%/45% then this portfolio is getting 1.68% APR in a low-volatility sideways market. Since TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps the dividend gets paid into the fund and the NAV grows! 

Again, yes TMF is taking a 0.75% management fee, and doing the same trade with IBKR on portfolio margin you're paying a 0.75% markup on the overnight rate if you want to buy TLT directly. 

Again, we are using TMF for protection and insurance, but it's nice to have something that's profitable vs buying puts, calls on the VIX, going long on VIX futures or VIX ETFs. I'm very happy to keep holding TMF throughout post covid. 

# Taxable account performance

With my code using www.quantconnect.com and calculating all the PnL on the quarterly trades, then computing actual LTCG and STCG taxes on these trades, the federal tax drag is 1.5% for an account at my current level for the historical last 10 years. For a $10+ million account it's 2.0%. Living in California adds another 1.0% state tax drag.  So if you're getting 24% CAGR in a tax-advantage account you're getting a 22% CAGR in taxable for federal tax drag (21% in California).

In my original simulations when I started this portfolio I paid $300k in federal taxes for 10 years with UPRO/TMF, and I paid $600k in taxes over 10 years with SPY and TLT on portfolio margin. Buying 2x dividends really sucks.

UPRO and TMF are excellent tax dodges as the vast majority of their return is total-return swaps with the banks. So instead of realizing dividends, the swap pays those dividends into the fund as part of the total return index and the NAV of the fund grows! So when you sell UPRO and TMF you realize your dividends then! 

It turns out if your hold period is less than 30 years with a 2% federal tax drag, you're best in a Roth IRA, followed by Taxable, followed by pre-tax 401k. After 30 years the order is: Roth IRA, Pre-Tax 401k, Taxable. It turns out paying 40% in ordinary income taxes in the pre-tax case is worse before 30 years, but after 30 years it has a higher after-tax value thanks to dodging the tax drag.  

UPRO and TMF holds about 80% unrealized gains across my simulations, and mostly throw off LTCG gains when major re-balances happen too. You'll want to use specific identification to sell shares that have the lowest possible tax cost. 

# Tax Loss Harvesting

Tax loss harvest pairs:            
UPRO -&gt; SPXL      
TMF -&gt; TLT Synthetic Stock on Reg-T/ 3x TLT shares if on PM                      

You can also take advantage of tax loss harvesting which I did not write code to evaluate for. URPO's tax loss harvest pair is SPXL, another 3x ETF. So my 2% federal tax drag is a **worst case estimate.**

TMF has no other 3x 20+ year treasury ETF, so it's tax loss harvest pair is [Synthetic Long Stock](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-stock.aspx) on **TLT** at 3x delta. So if you have a $45,000 position in TMF and want to harvest all losses in your $45,000 position, and TLT is trading at $143.64, then this is the formula:

3 * (45,000 / 143.64) =  939 delta of synthetic stock on TLT.

So you will buy 9 ATM call options and sell 9 ATM naked puts on TLT for 31+ days to keep your position, then you will want to close the synthetic stock and rebuy TMF with the left over cash.  Again using quantconnect.com this is the most accurate model I can get to TMF. It turns out bond futures are a terrible replacement for TMF and it brings me to the next topic.

I personally did the synthetic stock trade to tax loss harvest TMF in February 2021 and I was able to buy back the same number of shares of TMF. It works wonderfully.   

If you're on Portfolio Margin just save your time and commissions and buy 939 shares of TLT. [Use Box Spreads to Refinance your margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegqz0/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) instead of paying your broker's usury margin rates unless you're on IBKR. 

# Futures suck for Hedgefundie's portfolio

In a taxable account futures are **marked to market.** You realize your PNL every year as of Dec 31st. In my above simulations /ES and /UB futures costed me $2.8 million in federal taxes. Talk about an insane tax drag!

Futures are only worthwhile in a retirement account, which brings us to the next problem. There are no micro futures for /UB and /ZB. Each /UB future is currently $180k notional value. You need a $1-$2 million+ retirement account to get fine grained leverage on these futures, otherwise your leverage will swing from 2x to 4-6x depending on if you round nearest or round down your number of contracts! 

Finally, I cannot get any mix of /UB and /ZB to replicate TMF's fund testing with quantconnect. Convexity strikes again! It turns out reviewing the actual deliverable of these future contracts its a basket of bonds that is EITHER the 25 year or the 30 year bond. So you're only trading one bond! The future traders will deliver the 25 year bond as it's the cheapest to deliver if interest rates are below 6%. They will deliver the 30 year bond if interest rates are above 6%!  Only if interest rates are **exactly** 6% are any of the 25-30 year bonds deliverable! 

So the bond futures are less than ideal for leverage with this portfolio. They either add too much risk or not have enough risk. /ES futures track UPRO very accurately though. 

# Won't you have Liquidity Problems on your trades?

No I won't. ETFs have [authorized participants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp) that help with liquidity in ETFs. Also ETFs are required to post their [indicative Net Asset Value (iNAV) every 15 seconds.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicative_net_asset_value.asp) You can look to see what the quotes are vs the most current iNAV.

In February I decided to tax loss harvest TMF and I sold down my entire position slowly at a time as level two quotes were showing 700 shares offered. I was a bit fearful as I know TMF is a bit illiquid at $200m AUM and I had a huge position. I switched to synthetic stock on TLT.

Then I wanted to test the reality of buying back all my shares, which I had $132,000 remaining in cash at the time in my taxable account. At $22 a share it'd be my biggest trade - 6,000 shares. I was sweating bullets. I still only had quotes of 700 shares on L2 quotes. I was about to buy 6,000 shares all at once with a marketable limit order of $0.01 spread on TOS over TMF's iNAV. TMF had a $0.01 premium - works for me! I'm doing it for science. I had coded an entire algorithm at Quant Connect to sell TMF and UPRO randomly in 200-700 round lots using IBKR's API instead if this portfolio got so huge out of the concern of the L2 quotes I was seeing.

For the next 30 seconds TOS played sound after sound of order filling. I filled my entire limit order, then the spread widened to $0.05-$0.10 for the next 30 seconds after I was filled, then it narrowed back down to $0.01 and TMF was $0.10 higher iNAV wise. I had an instant profit of $600 on my position. Soon the iNAV went back down to what it was before my trade. I had discovered a lot more people in the order book than those 700 shares!

Finally, if you do have a large enough position you need to re-balance from that an Authorized Participant will take - the process is simple. [Make a phone call to your brokerage's block trading desk and they'll help you out.](https://www.tdainstitutional.com/offerings/investing-wealth-management/trading-services/block-desk.html)

TDA Ameritrade and Fidelity both offer block trades for free to high net worth clients! Both TDA and Fidelity Block Desks can place trades with the authorized participants so I will definitely get NAV of TMF when my account grows this large! 

# Tail Risks

People point out if **BOTH** stocks and bonds go down 33% **in one day**, this portfolio would go to $0. Quite honestly it'd take an irresponsible Fed to raise interest rates so high that it'd piss off the entire market to sell off like this in one day. I don't think that will ever happen. I would not be 100% invested if I thought this was at all a realistic scenario. 

Then yes, UPRO can, and has gotten near to 0% (historically simulated UPRO had a 98% drawdown in this portfolio!) but we're hoping TMF will moon hard to save the portfolio instead. 

Then right now with the [S&amp;P 500 circuit breakers](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp) it's impossible for UPRO to go to $0 in a day, although the drawdown will be gnarly.  UPRO has roughly 220% of swaps and the rest are S&amp;P 500 futures. So even if the swaps can't be adjusted this day UPRO can probably unload enough futures on the market to cover in a drawdown.

This is also why I'm staying the hell away from TQQQ. Normal QQQ had an 80% drawdown in the 1999 tech stock crash. Granted, all these tech companies are a lot more mature on the NASDAQ, but I personally have no interest in tilting or having an allocation to TQQQ. 

# My De-Risking Strategy 

I have a de-risking strategy that helps me sleep at night. I will be selling a portion of my portfolio to invest in 100% VTSAX (or the 2x spy/tlt leverage version) at every milestone I hope to achieve:

* $12.5m - $25m NW - I'll be selling $2.5m to lock in a FIRE lifestyle.      
* $110m NW - I'll be selling an additional $7.5m to lock in a $10M Fat Fire lifestyle       
* $1.1 billion NW - I'll be selling an additional $90 million to lock in a rich $100m Whale Fire lifestyle      
* $4 billion - $10 billion - $20 billion NW - I'll be selling 25-50% of my portfolio to go into wealth preservation, lock in billionaire status and let the rest ride.       

I'm projecting each milestone is 10 years of my life. Selling 10% over 10 years is roughly a 1% unlevered allocation.

I may transfer the amount I de-risk into an asset protection trust so I'd feel comfortable if I want to borrow on this portfolio in the future.

# Securities Lending for Hedgefundie's Portfolio

I've decided that any additional borrowing on this portfolio is too risky. I had a whole section here calculating the margin math based on it's previously max historical drawdown. IBKR currently only requires 30% initial margin on 55% UPRO 45% TMF when you use Portfolio Margin.  

When I wrote my guide on NTSX and [when I wrote part 2 of this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/oaiw3h/part_2_of_my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_for/) I realized NTSX (1.5x 60/40 bonds - 90/60 with leverage) and 1.5x Hedgefundie's portfolio is very close in stats to 100% stocks in their stats. Therefore, borrowing on this portfolio is equivalent to taking out cash while having a 200% stocks position or buying more NTSX on margin! 

Would you withdraw cash while being leveraged 2x on 100% stocks? I wouldn't. So I've changed my mind and **any additional borrowing on this portfolio is irresponsible.**

# Are you worried about the strategy if leveraged ETFs are shut down?

No I'm not. The SEC made a final decision in October 2020 to keep leveraged ETFs. They're limited to borrowing 2x directly with margin but can go up to 4x with derivatives. 3x UPRO and TMF are safe. 

If they ever go away then I'll be running this portfolio using SPY and TLT on portfolio margin in a taxable account.

# Aren't you too optimistic?

Why yes, yes I am. However I'm 28 years old with $600k riding on this portfolio with an excellent track record that since 1987 goes to $1.3 billion in nominal dollars. It's my only shot in the world to be a billionaire in nominal dollars and I'm taking it. :)

# Is this portfolio right for me?

Ultimately it comes down to your willingness and ability to take risks. It may not be right for you. **Even Hedgefundie is only risking $100k on this for a good chance of it turning into $10 million over 20 years.** 

I'm following a lifecycle investing philosophy of investing while young. My financial situation is very unique. 

You need to have the balls to sell TMF for UPRO in a stock market crash even if UPRO has drawdown 85% or more. In 2008 UPRO had a 85%-90% drawdown for the 60% of the portfolio's drawdown. If UPRO repeats its historical 98% simulated drawdown you need to be backing up the truck with TMF and buying those shares on a fire sale! 

You absolutely need to be mechanical about rebalancing every quarter and not have any second thoughts about doing so. 

Feel free to invest at a lower leverage too. You can do 2x with SSO and UBT. Or 2x with [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

Or you can drop down to 1.5x. One [popular investment is NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSTAX's return with a lot lower risk! NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

Finally, [good old 1.0x leverage does pretty well.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=55&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=45)

You can also use Hedgefundie's portfolio strategically. For instance, start a Coverdell ESA account for someone who's a baby and [by the time they're age 18 it's grown to $875k.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=2000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=2000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200) It's quite impressive for investing $2k a year! You just gifted $875k from $2k of annual gifting - excellent for estate tax purposes! 

You can get around the income limits by making contributions from a trust or corporation: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310

&gt; Organizations, such as corporations and trusts can also contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income.

My sister just had a child.  I started a Coverdell ESA account for her child at TD Ameritrade. They allow UPRO and TMF and individual stocks to be invested for benefit of the child. Yup it's 100% invested in 55% UPRO and 45% TMF. 

Ultimately you don't have to be 100% in this portfolio and many people aren't. It's incredible how much growth just $2k a year turns it into if you hold it for long enough. 

# Useful tools

I made [a spreadsheet you can use that pulls in quotes from Google Finance to easily re-balance this portfolio.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GzOp0mTp6AYr_arvPHlAb1bJR_6WUjFCdbuSGpaZNCM/edit?usp=sharing) Please make a COPY and don't request edit access. 

It tells you how many shares you need to buy and sell. It also supports tax efficient cash rebalancing too. I personally invest in it's current allocation but doing simulations on both it doesn't matter much in the long run. It also tells you how many shares of SPXL to sell if you tax loss harvest this portfolio. 

Then it also tells you your percentage ownership of the two ETFs. I may have to file 13Gs/13Ds in the future for this portfolio. You can see how a $3m portfolio is already owning 0.63% of TMF.

If you're young enough that a 100% equity portfolio doesn't give you enough risk, you can lever up to increase returns without dipping into alternative/speculative assets such as venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, and so on.

personalfinance,Sprintax ghosting me,"Sprintax ghosting me

I’m a Canadian who worked as an intern in the US for a bit, so I had to file US federal + state taxes. I was recommended to Sprintax as a filing service by my company who gave me a discount code, although I still had to pay a bit. It’s been about 3 months, and they still have not given me any update on my taxes being filed. I’ve emailed them every week for a month with no response. I chatted with their customer service, and the person refused to give me their email and eventually just closed the chat. Is there anything I can do? My main qualms are 1) I paid for a service and they did not deliver 2) I legally need to file my taxes. ( 3) is that they should face some retribution for their poor quality.)

altcoin,"Digital Reserve Currency. The next big SoV. Market cap of only $3 Million with over 2,500 HODLers, Up 23.33% since the last post here 2 days ago!","**What is DRC and why does it have value?:**

Digital Reserve Currency (DRC) is a store of value cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. When you hear store of value you immediately think Bitcoin. The problem with Bitcoin is that it’s slow and each Bitcoin is divisible up to 10\^-8 meaning there are really 100 million parts in a single Bitcoin or 2.1 quadrillion parts that could ever be in circulation (21 million / 10\^-8). DRC on the other hand is an indivisible token meaning you can never have less than 1 DRC making it a much more efficient store of value. If you’re looking for a SoV you want a rare asset that won’t inflate. 100% of the DRC supply is already in circulation and was put into circulation initially. No team tokens or any other hold making it a truly fair, decentralized ecosystem. There’s a total of 1 billion DRC. Now I’m not saying DRC is going to replace Bitcoin. At the end of the day, it’s just a much more efficient SoV, it’s non-divisible (first and currently the only cryptocurrency to do so), and it’s on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains making it much quicker and more efficient. The product is also fully developed. I suggest you take a look at their website to see the DRC vault (basically a store of DRC created for HODLers who are rewarded with random DRC and NFT drawings which include hashmasks rare AI art pieces and many more).

**More Info on the DRC Ecosystem:**

On the DRC website hyperlinked below, you can go and check out their vaults that were created to further benefit the Digital Reserve Currency ecosystem. One of these vaults for example ""s2"" is comprised of 90% USDC 5% BTC and 5% ETH, the reason for doing so is with such a high stable coin allocation the vault basically acts as a stable coin, except for the slight volatility around the final 10% allocation. This allocation allows for it to be a true preserver of wealth unlike USDC and other stable coins. The problem with stable coins is that they still experience inflation at the rate of the USD (about 4.5% this year alone) meanwhile s2 vault performance not only matches the rate of inflation per year but actually slightly surpasses it making it a real preserver of wealth (\~6% APY). The problem with the USD and all other fiat currencies has become more evident this year than ever before. The United States and countries all over the world are printing more money than any other time in history, fiat currency is only inflating and the people this is really affecting are those who can't afford/risk spending their money on assets like real estate or stocks that generally hold their value. This is where s2 comes into play. It's a relatively no-risk way to preserve one's wealth, its volatility is only slightly greater than that of any stable coin. To me, it's a no-brainer way to help people all over the world and it's just one of many aspects of the Digital Reserve Currency ecosystem, and as more and more people use assets like s2 or DRC they only work to create an ecosystem that feeds into itself.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Tesla’s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company’s latest regulatory filing. 
* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, “there is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee”.

personalfinance,Hey PF. Is this refinance to get rid of FHA PMI the good idea that I think it is?,"Bought a house Nov 2019. We put 3.5% down to get our house with expectations to refinance eventually. 144,000 original amount. $139,000 left on the loan currently. 

3.375% for 30yr rate but I also pay about $100/mo PMI. 
Tax is $700/year Insurance is $1024/year. Total Payment $884/year including taxes and insurance. $611/mo without counting escrow I believe. 

Looking to take advantage of increasing housing prices in my area to convert into a conventional mortgage without PMI. We have received an appraisal waiver from our current mortgage company that would put the LTV below 80%. 

The new mortgage would be 2.99% for 30yrs for $140,000.  $7,000 at closing including $3,200 for points to bring the rate to 2.99. My wife's credit is in the 780s but mine only about 700 unfortunately. 

Is my math correct to assume that saving the $100 per month in PMI would recoup the 7k I just less than 6 years?  We don't plan to move any time soon as we live in a LOC area and I can work remotely. 

My wife recently received about 30k inheritance and we will be using 7k of that for these purposes. IRAS are already maxed for the year and 401k is at employer matches and a very healthy emergency fund. 

Getting rid of PMI as well as getting a lower interest rate all while lowering overall payment makes this seem like a good move for us. 

Please let me know if y'all need anymore info, but I really just would appreciate your input to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021.

# **The jobs report will move markets in the week ahead as stocks enter the second half riding high - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/the-jobs-report-will-move-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-stocks-enter-the-second-half-riding-high.html)**
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs report is the highlight in the coming week, as June winds down and markets start the second half of the year.
*****
&gt; Economists are expecting about 700,000 jobs. That’s better than the 559,000 in May but below the forecasts of several months ago that payroll creation would be rolling along with monthly gains of at least 1 million.
*****
&gt; The report is a key read on the labor market, which has replaced lost jobs more slowly than expected as companies complain about worker shortages and difficulty finding help. But it is also being watched as a gauge on how sticky the current jump in inflation might be. Rising wages are one thing to watch but also worker scarcity, since that can make goods and services more expensive.
*****
&gt; Stocks have turned in a mixed performance for the month of June so far. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.8% as of Friday for the month, and up 7.7% in the second quarter for a 15.6% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq was up 4.4% in June and up 8.4% for the quarter. The Dow, meanwhile, lagged in June with a modest 0.3% decline, but it is up 4.4% quarter-to-date.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500, ending Friday at 4,280, has already edged slightly above 4,276 — the average year end forecast of Wall Street strategists surveyed by CNBC.
*****
&gt; For the most part, strategists expect the market to continue its upward trajectory into the second half, although at a slower pace. Some have also said the second half could bring a pause in the rally before the market ends the year higher.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s been very good for the stock market that long rates have stopped going up in the first quarter and are going down, taking the pressure off,” The Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; “Meanwhile earnings have continued to climb unabated, and if you think about it the vast majority of stocks didn’t go anywhere in the second quarter,” Paulsen said. “What we’ve got is a cheaper market than we had in March and we had one where rates are lower and we’re still getting unrestricted policy help from both monetary and fiscal authorities.”
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he thinks the S&amp;P 500 could hit 4,500 before pulling back later in the year to finish at about 4,100.
*****
&gt; “My attitude now is it’s a very hard tape to fight, and it takes a lot of fortitude to do so, but you’re at a point where it’s a lot cheaper to hedge than it has been,” Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said. “It’s a lot cheaper to hedge and a more opportune time to do so. It’s always cheaper to buy an umbrella when there are no rain clouds on the horizon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, despite the turbulence the week earlier after the June Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed laid the groundwork for its ultimate step away from easy policies, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying Fed officials were considering tapering their purchases of mortgages and Treasury securities.
*****
&gt; “There seems to be a greater complacency,” Sosnick said, noting the market reaction to the Fed’s potential unwind of easy policy was calm.
*****
&gt; If the Fed announces it will taper its bond purchases in the next several months, it would be expected to wait several months more before it starts the process. Then it could take many more months to take the $120 billion in monthly purchases to zero. The unwind of that policy is especially important since it could be a precursor to the Fed raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Underlying everything, there’s a huge faith in the Fed, that they will do the right thing, and they’ll continue to do the right thing,” Sosnick said.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said he’s watching the bond market going into quarter end this week, after the surge in yields last quarter end. The relatively tame behavior of bond yields, which move opposite price, has been a hallmark of the last part of the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury was yielding 1.52% Friday, up from 1.45% a week prior.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said if the 10-year yield does remains contained, that should be good for tech. “Right now, it appears there’s that kind of relationship between the 10-year and NDX. If 10-year yields are lower, people are using it as a buy signal for the Nasdaq 100. Is that fool proof? Far from it, but people are using it,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks were up 2.4% for the week and 9.4% for the quarter so far, after being out of favor when yields were moving higher in March.
*****
&gt; “The advice at the end of the first quarter was that [10-year] rates were going to 2%. Rather than going up, rates went down and as a result growth beat value and techs beat financials,” The Leuthold Group’s Paulsen said. “Now everyone thinks rates are going to stay low longer. I think value, cyclicals and small caps are going to win this quarter. I think we’re going to have a correction and end the year around 4,100.”
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; The payroll number Friday morning is by far the biggest economic event of the week.
*****
&gt; “We expect next week’s June employment report to show that nonfarm payrolls expanded by 800k, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.5% from 5.8%. Strong demand and weak supply should continue to put upward pressure on wages,” wrote Bank of America economists.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect 683,000 payrolls were created in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.7% from 5.8%. But the market is also looking to see if the data reveals anything new about inflation and whether it could be transitory, or temporary, as the Fed has stated.
*****
&gt; “The problem is because the markets have tended to surprise us, it’s tough to figure out what the trade is,” said Sosnick. “There’s two components of it. It is the unemployment rate, or the labor force participation, the stuff Powell is really looking for.”
*****
&gt; Wage data could be hot with the Dow Jones estimate at a 3.7% year-over-year gain in average hourly wages, up from 1.98% in May.
*****
&gt; “Are we approaching full employment? With non non-transitory inflationary affects?” Sosnick said. “You’re seeing companies giving signing bonuses. Those are transitory but if you have to raise wages and if wages are going to go up, that is non transitory.”
*****
&gt; Besides the jobs data, there is ISM manufacturing data and monthly vehicle sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; OPEC also meets on July 1, and market pros are watching to see if the OPEC and its alliance in OPEC plus will continue to add oil to the market.

&gt; # July has been Top Month of Post-Election Years

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and strong performances in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2021).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the fifth weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.6% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/24425b5573f14df7e7f5039ac0dd34f4/01813a8e14a72b86-9a/s400x600/8951bac1faa8d0887549c23fc161e859a01787fd.jpg))**

&gt; Post-election year Julys rank at or near the top of all post-election year months. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ are ranked #1. Russell 2000 ranks #2. Delving deeper into this data revealed that many of these past “hot” Julys were preceded by a flat or down first half of the year so there is no guarantee that this July will live up to its historical post-election year record again this year.

&gt; # Bears in Hibernation

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's dip below its 50-DMA and the corresponding rally to new all-time highs did little to dramatically change investor sentiment. This week's survey results from the AAII saw bullish sentiment fall slightly from 41.1% last week to 40.4%. That is once again within the past several weeks' range at the lowest level since only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment was also lower this week, falling by 2.9 percentage points to 23.3%. As with bullish sentiment, that is the lowest level in two weeks. From a longer-term perspective, bearish sentiment is more than 7 percentage points below its historical average of 30.5%. In other words, while sentiment is not exuberant, it continues to skew optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The historically muted level of bearish sentiment also shows up in the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers. This week, that reading fell half of one percentage point to 15.8%.

&gt; # Manufacturing Activity Indices at Historic Levels

&gt; As recent economic data shows, the robust post-COVID recovery has brought about a historic rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity. Pent-up demand and low inventories of capital goods have caused companies to fire up their machines at record levels, and manufacturing supply management professionals have responded with relative delight in recent surveys. Both the IHS Markit and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Indices have been robust across the board, as new order growth, hiring plans, and the backlog of orders point to better health in the sector. The downside…higher prices, as purchasing managers’ queried in the survey pinpointed high levels of input cost inflation brought about by a broad-based spike in raw materials prices. The latest survey results show the June IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI at a new all-time high of 62.6, which compares to the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 61.5 and May’s reading of 62.1.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.24.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; “The demand for goods and the rebound in manufacturing activity have been remarkable as folks seem determined to get on with their lives. We know that U.S. consumers like to spend, and it seems like they are more than willing to make up for lost time.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

&gt; We believe the latest IHS Markit manufacturing readout may foretell a good result for the ISM benchmark’s expected release on July 1. That index series has also been near record levels, although just below its all-time high. The long-term ISM chart paints a fairly good picture of past peaks and troughs and the roller-coaster of activity that can occur in the manufacturing sector. In fact, the recent highs in the two manufacturing indicators we have mentioned have us looking ahead to an eventual deceleration in activity, which could come later this year. This deceleration could be brought about by the ultimate slowing of demand for some of the hottest items of late: automobiles, appliances, and technology devices. This doesn’t mean we are souring on the prospect for economic growth in the U.S….only that peak activity, as we are witnessing now, which is usually followed by an eventual slowdown in demand. We should see some of this become visible via U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is expected to advance at a slower pace in late 2021 and early 2022.

dogecoin,Doge 4 life! But as an 🦍 I feel an obligation of to inform my family 😎 TICKER SPCE 🚀🚀,"History was made, and we’re all apart of it. Virgin Galactic has just been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) 

Some brief DD to get you started:

-Virgin galactic’s competition; which includes the company “Blue origin”, founded by Jeff bezos(yawn, the billionaire’s success with Amazon and his unlimited supply of funding doesn’t mean he will be the leading company of space flight, as a fan of Jeff, and an admirer of his ambitions, it doesn’t mean he’ll be #1 in commercial space flight, which has already been proven) has yet to meet the standards of the FAA for approval. Although Blue Origin has applied, it was unable to obtain an FAA license,(im not saying that someday Blue origin will not be approved in the future) but presently, as of right now, Blue Origin was unable to meet the extremely high standards and regulatory requirements to safely partake in the transport of actual human life. 


Brief DD about the company Virgin Galactic:

-Virgin Galactic manufactures air and space vehicles and the company’s spaceship operations include commercial human spaceflight, flying commercial research, and development payloads into space.


Onto DD about TICKER SPCE: 

-On today, Friday, June 25th, Virgin was Granted approval by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) for a full commercial space-launch license, opening the door for outside passengers to join flights, this approval was made following the successful test flight on May 22.

-Last month Virgin Galactic completed its first manned space flight from its new home port in New Mexico in May, as its SpaceShipTwo craft with a capacity of six passengers glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots.

-The company so far has more than 600 reservations for 90-minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.


FUTURE PLANS
-Richard Branson, along with Virgin plans to send passengers to space in a rocket-propelled vessel that is launched from a highflying airplane. After being dropped from about 50,000 feet in the skies over New Mexico, the spacecraft shoots above the Karman Line—the imaginary lower boundary of space—where passengers experience weightlessness for a few minutes before the spacecraft descends and lands on a runway.

The roughly 600 people who have signed up as future passengers with Virgin Galactic would likely pay less than $500,000 for a ride, Virgin executives have said.

Virgin hopes eventually to offer space flights from multiple locations. The company has also cited plans to take tourists to orbiting hotels and to use its vehicles for superfast long-distance travel. The Virgin spacecraft is flown by a pair of pilots. Blue Origin’s capsule is fully automated and is launched vertically from the ground in Texas.



Why did I spend the hours of research it took to provide my community with this information. Well it’s quite simple, as an individual who was born and raised under the poverty line, I was always willing to split a slice of bread with a friend or stranger who was hungry, even if it meant less food for myself. fast forward several decades, I’ve come along way, but I’ve never lost sight in the fact that majority of the people struggle financially, wether you’re below the line or walking it. 
We all know space is the future, and Virgin galactic was able to achieve is just a step forward in that direction, but that step is historic. All i want is the average person, poor or middle class, below the line or walking the line, all across the globe, regardless of ethnicity or background, to partake in this financial opportunity, that is truly the first of its kind.

Throughout the day my budget started to rise and I scheduled a meeting with my bank for a loan quote for 3pm. At 3pm I was being told that the paperwork to ""cancel a sale"" for a 2021 kia was going to be brought to me after 4 hours of price negotiations and saying I was leaving. I ended up financing $22,323 at 6.14 percent for 84 mo at what I can afford right now but for the next 7 years totaling almost 30k? Idk, the interest rate didn't even cross my mind in that moment. My payments are 329 a month, insurance at 198 and I only make about 28k a year. I'm starting college soon and will try to make larger payments but I really wouldn't have the room to work more hours during the year. They talked me out of a used car and I planned on keeping it for a long time and got gap insurance as well. Immediately underwater on the loan so Is refinancing in a year or so my only option. I think I've made a big mistake. My car broke down after replacing a lot of stuff. From anger to insurmountable auto debt.",finance

personalfinance,Should I kill my student loans?,"As many know, payments on federal student loans will be resuming on October 1st. I've been fortunate enough to still be working during the pandemic and redirected the money that I would have been using to pay my loans ($600/month) to my savings account.

On 10/1 I'll have a student loan balance of $17,000 with a \~4% interest rate.

On 10/1 I'll have about $27,000 in my online savings account with a 0.4% APY. This money is a mix of my emergency fund and the redirected loan money.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm debating 2 options:

A) Take $12,000 and put it towards the loan balance and return to my pre-pandemic plan. This would leave me with a $5,000 loan balance that I can pay off in about 9 months with $92 of interest in that 9 months. This option lets me keep my savings very healthy at $15,000, but I'd still have to commit to loans.

B) Dump it all on loans. This would leave my savings in ok condition with $10,000, but a little bit lower than I'd like it. However, getting rid of my loans would feel incredible and I wouldn't be charged the interest. Having that $600/month freed up would open me up to doing so much more (after I rebuild my savings).

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Should I rethink how I'm approaching my savings? Any advice is welcome!

Thanks!",finance

I have a 554 FICO score and need to improve it within the next 2 years to hopefully buy a house. I'll give you the quick rundown:

• 4 accounts in collections totalling $2430 and 1 account in collections that I just paid off for $157.

• A car payment totalling $16,000 with a 12% interest rate. I just brought that down from 16% this January. I've always made the payments on time. Car has been appraised at $10,000 so trading it in doesn't seem to be an option at this time. 

• A Capital One card that has a balance of $2148 out of a $2500 limit. It has been open since 2015 and I've always made the minimum payment on time. 
A Kohl's charge card that's been open since 2019 with a $0 balance.

Questions:
• I just paid that collection account off last week. How long will it take before its removed from my credit report? 

• Should I nuke the Capital One card back to $0 or continue paying it down slowly? 

• Do I work on the Capital One card before the collections since it's still charging me interest or do I just worry about the collections first since they're probably hurting my credit more?

• Is it possible to raise my score in 2 years and if so, how do I do it?

personalfinance,Trading in a car,"Okay so this might be a lengthy post but I’m in need of some other opinions and perspectives!!

I bought a brand new Ford Fusion in 2019 for $17000 and after adding warranty and all that my loan was for about 26000. Monthly payments are $410 and my APR is 6.7%. My current amount to pay off my loan is $19,167. 

My husband and I are now expecting our first child and as much as I love my car, I’m considering taking advantage of the high trade in values and getting an SUV, for the space and the convenience of bending over to strap little one in the car. 

The other issue is that I accumulated a little bit of credit card debt planning our wedding last year (which made my credit score drop down to like 650) and I have spent the past few months paying $15000 down to $6000 and my credit score has recovered to around a 740. I have some money budgeted for our baby and some in savings as an emergency fund I don’t want to touch. 

Out of curiosity, my husband and I took my car to get appraised and it came back at $19,500, which would effectively pay off my loan amount and put $500 ish down on the car I want (Rav 4 for $29,000ish). I have 56 months left on my loan so I would get a 60 month loan, probably at a lower interest rate of 3-4%, making my monthly payments $490ish. 

I’m trying to decide if it would be worth it for me to go ahead and trade in my car, even though I don’t have as much as I’d like to put down. My thought process is that there will probably never be an opportunity to get more than I bought my car for as far as trade in value is concerned, so if I don’t trade it in, I will not want to buy a new car until 2-3 years after it is paid off",finance

bonds,Pay off Mortgage at Discount if Rates Rise?,"Let’s start off with some basics.  When you take out a mortgage, you are effectively selling a bond to a lender.  Say the mortgage is fixed-rate 30 years.  Then the long duration makes the present value of this bond sensitive to interest rates, and its present value will drop if rates rise.

My question is this:  say the 30-year fixed mortgage rate goes up to 8% in a few years.  Then the present value of my 30-year mortgage would drop below par.  In other words, other banks would be able to buy it from my lender at a price lower than the balance outstanding.  So if other banks could buy it at a discount, couldn’t I?  If so, that would mean that rising rates would avail fixed rate mortgage holders the chance to pay off their mortgage at a discount.

Related question:  if interest rates went up, what’s stopping companies from buying back their own corporate bonds at substantial discount?",finance

&amp;#x200B;

The 401k offered has a decent selection of mutual funds, but I am not pleased with the fees. Due to the fact that my wife and I are saving heavily for a downpayment, we aren't saving as much for retirement so I think my following plan will work.

&amp;#x200B;

Contribute $7200 a year into HSA and invest it 100% in stocks (we'll pay any OOP costs ourselves). Open an IRA in my name and my wife's name. What we would have contributed to my 401k, we'll instead invest that directly into our IRAs. (my wife does have earned income, but no benefits). The only time we would contribute to the company 401k is if we exhausted the $7200 HSA limit (which we will) AND the $12000 combined roth ira/ira a limit between the two of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense? I understand that for IRA contributions, we'll fix what was over withheld at tax time. Is there convenient calculator that tells me how many exemptions I should take? I have what I need withheld out of my paycheck for federal taxes down to the penny after accounting for all the deductions and the new ira deductions. If I don't do anything, I will probably have my federal tax withheld at double the rate at which it should be.

personalfinance,W4 Withholding Help,"TL;DR: Can I have 0 federal taxes withheld and pay those taxes regularly out of a savings account instead of my paycheck?

\--

Hello,

I started working mid-year and heard about part-year withholding so that I don't get such a big refund once I file my taxes. This wouldn't be a big deal normally, but I want to contribute the most I can to my Roth 401k/After-tax buckets which I understand can only be done by taking money out of my paychecks. By lowering my withholding, I hope to be able to contribute more to these accounts.

I essentially want to put my entire paycheck toward these accounts to hit the 58k limit, and any amount withheld from my paychecks is going to make it harder to hit that limit . This led me to using the IRS withholding calculator to reduce the withholding for this year's remaining paychecks. However, I am wondering if I could potentially withhold even less and pay taxes with money from a savings account instead of from my paycheck? How would I go about doing this? I don't want to mess up and get hit with tax penalties...

I feel like this is a very peculiar situation and I haven't been able to find anything on the topic. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",finance

financialindependence,"28M - Just hit a third of a million in Sydney, Australia: Slow and steady","Hi everyone

I've been a long-term lurker of this subreddit and always enjoyed reading about other people's stories and journeys to get inspiration and lessons from. So I thought I would share my own journey so far. Always keen for advice and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions or want to know more!

I also thought this might provide a slightly different perspective as a (relatively young) millennial professional working as a lawyer in a high cost of living city in Sydney, Australia taking the *slow and steady* route to FIRE.

No life-changing windfalls from crypro-currency, the share market or property here unfortunately...

# About me

* 28 male, single
* Lawyer
* Living in a HCOL area in Sydney, Australia
* Net worth = $333k AUD (\~250k USD)
* Savings rate = 44% this year

# Slow and steady

If I had to give this chapter of my life a title, it would probably be ""*Slow and steady*"" - looking back, it's been surprising how consistent and steady my net worth has been tracking since starting full-time work despite all the other changes personally and in the world with:

* the pandemic hitting in 2020 - despite the initial drop in the markets and the uncertainty with the lockdowns and working from home, I think I've been lucky so far with work continuing and life in Australia being relatively less affected than other parts of the world;
* I've had modest promotions and pay rises in my role including a change of job - but it appears this has been offset with lifestyle creep and additional expenses like moving out and getting my own place;
* being a late convert to FIRE. I've always lived a reasonably frugal lifestyle with a view to the future and preferred to spend more on experiences rather than chasing fads and material possessions. It was only in 2019 that I discovered that there was a whole community of like-minded people who had a name for this mind-set and a much more developed plan for financial independence! Until then, most of my savings was just sitting in high-interest saving accounts with no clear plan.

# Net worth

Below is a graph that shows how my NW has grown and how my allocation of assets has changed over time. I am still waiting for that exponential growth...

[Graph of Net Worth](https://i.imgur.com/Q7oLT7P.png)

I only started tracking numbers regularly in the second half of 2019 after discovering FIRE but have managed to back-track the previous numbers from looking at my records.

2015 = **-20k** (Finished Uni with a negative net worth due to student loan debt. I did some part-time work over this time at Uni as a tutor and a paralegal which helped.)

2016 = **-6k** (Started my first full-time job as a Graduate Lawyer)

2017 = **30k** (Continued working as a Lawyer with some modest pay rises)

2018 = **80k** (Moved out of the family house and rented my own place)

2019 = **140k** (Changed jobs with a corresponding pay rise)

2020 = **230k** (Weathered through the pandemic and bought my own place)

2021 = **333k** (Hit milestone of a third of a million!)

# Current allocation of assets

Below is a pie chart that shows my current allocation of assets.

[Chart of Current Allocation](https://i.imgur.com/TGwftyB.png)

Bank Account = **3%** (I've kept a few months of living expenses in my bank account as a fund just in case.)

Savings Account = **0%** (With interest rates so low at the moment, I've moved all my money out of my previous high-interest saving accounts.)

Shares = **37%** (I historically hadn't kept too much money in shares as I've been cautious about the historic highs of the market but am looking to put more money into index funds moving forward, having been burned losing a few months' salary with a few speculative plays into tech stocks following the exuberance of Tesla and Gamestop shares recently.

Retirement Account = **18%** (Australia has a compulsory superannuation retirement system where they force employers to put 9.5%, now 10%, of your salary into your retirement account. There are some tax benefits if you choose to voluntarily add more money into your retirement account but I haven't done too much of this as I hope to use any extra money before I turn 65, which is when you get access to your retirement account.)

Property = **42%** (I recently bought my own apartment in Sydney. Sydney property prices are quite high compared to other places in the world so I am still not sure if this was ultimately a good decision, especially with the transaction costs involved. Only time will tell! However, part of the reason was to take advantage of interest rates being at such historical lows.)

# Spending

Below is a pie chat that shows my spending and saving over the course of the last year.

[Chart of Spending](https://i.imgur.com/CvKmhXq.png)

Unfortunately, tax rates in Australia are quite high (the highest tax bracket is 45% tax) so your actual take-home pay ends up being significantly less than your salary.

Savings = **44%** (I suspect this a very average savings rate but the cost of living in Sydney is quite expensive and I do want to enjoy myself with experiences and find a balance!)

Clothing = **1%** (I think I spend quite a low amount on clothing with the occasional purchase for office attire and casual clothes. This past year with working from home has also meant there has been less need!)

Electronics = **2%** (I don't spend too much on electronics and the latest gadgets -  I am still using an old hand-me-down phone!)

Entertainment = **1%** (This past year has meant there has been less opportunity to go out and spend money! It also just so happens that most of my hobbies and interests don't require much money - like playing football, cooking and binging on TV shows.)

Food = **11%** (This is probably an area where I am spending more money than others as I choose to eat out with friends and family or choose to spend a bit more for groceries. But I don't think I regret it!)

Housing = **34%** (Rent and property prices in Sydney are relatively high. A one bedroom apartment in my current area is $500-600 per week or 380-450 USD per week or 1.65k-1.95k USD per month. But that's just what I have to deal with having grown up and with my job in Sydney. They say that you are under 'housing stress' if you are spending more than a third of your income on housing...)

Life Admin = **7%** (This category comprises various things like bills, medical insurance and other personal expenses. Most of these are inevitable.)

Transport = **0%** (Transport costs for this year were significantly reduced with travel restricted and working from home for much of the year. I don't expect this to be repeated moving forward.)

# Next steps

Overall, I think I am tracking well and am trying to find a good balance between enjoying myself in the present, taking advantage of opportunities, and setting myself up for the future.

At my current rate, calculators say that I will reach FIRE and $1 million in \~11 years at the age of \~40, but part of me does want to enjoy the luxury of having a nicer home and looking after my current (and potential future) family.

So it may just be that this point ends up being delayed further and further to the future!

Keen to hear people's thoughts and advice and if you want to hear more.

My goals for the next year are to:

* **Invest more into stocks and in particular Vanguard index funds** \- I've always been conservative and part of me is still concerned about the current state of the stock market but part of me is also concerned that I will miss out on the next few years if it continues to rise. Having been burnt by some speculative plays into tech stocks, I think I've also learnt my lesson trying to follow the success stories of others in gambling their life savings into stocks like Tesla and Gamestop.
* **Maintain a balance between living in the present and saving for the future** \- I am conscious that my current savings rate of 44% is pretty average but I don't think there are too many other places to cut down without a significant impact on my lifestyle. Food (especially eating out) is probably one area that could be cut down but I am not sure if the additional savings would be worth it for the time spent with family and friends.
* **Find more like-minded people with FIRE in mind to share and learn from!**",finance

CryptoMarkets,APY &amp; APR | by Econteric.com (Free research reports),"# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,Some of the use cases for crypto,"I keep hearing it repeated the bitcoin and dogecoin have no use cases. When I first saw bitcoin people where buying drugs with it on the dark web back in 2011-12. I regret not buying some (bitcoin), but even then I recognized its importance and usefulness. It's the only true free market left that's isolated from the feds. Every asset you can buy in the US has its price set not by evaluations, it's set directly by what the feds decide to do with intrest rates. Usd, stocks, and real estate are all directly influenced by the feds. The first use case is making purchases anonymously. Second selling items anonymously. Third, being able to isolate your assets from the feds control. I'm sure other people can think of more, but the point is crypto is incredibly useful!",cryptocurrency

gaming,A game from the dream,"Had a dream last night, about a video game which does not really exist (sadly). It was VERY lifelike.

In the dream I was watching a youtube Let's Play of a video game which does not exist in reality. It was an Inspector Gadget game, and it was a Streets of Rage/Bare Knuckle style beat'em'up in the serious style of a noir detective. Gadget had a gun inside his arm, a smaller pistol finger, a boxing glove on a spring which came out from his head when his fake face was lifted, a mallet on a spring in his shoulder, a drill in his heel, a shotgun in his elbow and so many other animations I wouldn't count them all. 

He also had a companion - either a humanoid dog or a midget furry, a poodle-headed human wearing noir detective trenchcoat, pants, shoes and fedora, while standing he was just a bit taller than Gadget's knee, he spent most of his time in the bag on Gadget's belt, but it was possible to control him on ""special missions"", and those were pretty much the same beat'em'up levels, only with different characters and animations and resized backgrounds. 

I remember the animation was a little bit slower than I would like, and the companion at the start of the level took forever to climb on Gadget's leg into his belt bag. The youtuber's face was seen on the little screen in the corner, he looked a bit like Jonathan Young, and he constantly commented on everything. One of his phrases that I remember was ""Unlike the show in which Inspector Gadget ends up broken or disassembled at the end of every episode, in this game he keeps his integrity which is a new take on the character, the same as the general serious tone"".

Would be cool if such a game existed.",technology

Short term opportunity?,"Now I’m not going to pretend that I’m an expert with gold miners (honesty I don’t think anyone can accurately value this industry, just read [Barrick’s](https://s25.q4cdn.com/322814910/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/Barrick-Q1-2021-Results-Presentation.pdf) latest investor presentation which goes into detail about their mining process, it’s extremely complicated) or here to present a 10x opportunity. I’ve been closely following gold prices for a few months and have seen a lot of discussions around the relationship between inflation and a potential increase in interest rates which would negatively impact gold as investors seek better risk-adjusted yield opportunities in bonds.

Despite interest rate concerns, I still believe gold is a decent hedge since SPY keeps hitting new all-time highs every week. The Fed continues to reassure the market that interest rates won’t move until late 2022 at the earliest. In my opinion, inflation may run hot for the next year giving gold a decent tailwind. I know this is a simple macro overview, but let’s move on to the trade opportunity.

I have noticed recently that Barrick has been lagging its major competitor Newmont this year, why? It already traded at a lower multiple compared to Newmont at the start of the year which makes sense as it has lower operating margins/growth expectations. There doesn’t appear to be an explicit reason for the relative dispersion between the 2 companies’ share price YTD when they have historically been very correlated.

Here are my 2 potential strategies:

#1 Target Price Realization: Go long $GOLD common stock while selling monthly calls 5-10% above purchase price. Current monthly implied volatility shows about 2-3% monthly premium. Not bad. If I get assigned first month, would re-enter.

#2 Pairs Trade: Go long Barrick ($GOLD) and short Newmont ($NEM) until both securities revert to their mean averages of the past 5 years (89% correlation).

In summary, I strongly believe there is a 15-20% short term opportunity here which may not be groundbreaking but still outperforming the broader market if this mean reversion occurs &amp;amp;lt;1 year. Which strategy would you implement?",finance

Bitcoin,China VS Bitcoin 2021,"China is trying to take over the dollar at a low currency. The yuan is lower than the dollar at the level that China has planned. It will benefit China in terms of exports. and production of export products But the dollar fell beyond the threshold. or risk that China will be able to balance it (Actually, there are many factors), one of the main ones comes from the crypto market, so China only needs a balance of the currency. and other assets held by China including public debt in dollars only (Don't let which one is too high or too low), but since the beginning of 2021, China has started to worry that Crypto, especially Bitcoin, is taking away control of China's financial game. Watch the Dollar Fall as Bitcoin &amp; Cryptos Rebound Significantly And because the money game's insidiousness lies in its control. not destructive Therefore, China must come up with a new strategy. by creating a situation and the news that floods in until new investors have to shake as well as the trick that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates (Despite the fact that QE money is pumped out in abundance) because this is China's plan to begin to adjust the market price for the dump. Something that they own. What can you do???
The fact that the US came out to raise interest rates and pushed QE back into the market meant a signal. The bubble in the dollar that was born until it was clearly visible. Because when investors fear the bubble may burst soon Everyone will rush back to the safest things (for investors) are US assets and gold. In fact, at this point in time, the vast majority of holdings are China. This kind of money game is much more brutal than destroying Bitcoin. It has to do whatever it takes to lure inexperienced investors to flee US Asset and Gold before dumping them on the market. So the only thing that still remains is The world's bitcoin and crypto frenzy will make this China's plan. It's more difficult to accomplish because investors have a very high chance of turning to bitcoin and other cryptos instead. I hope you read this line. I wish you all good luck and please study the risks before investing every time.

cardano,My First time experience with cardano was bad.,"I had heard about cardano  from a few websites and when I saw the founder on a podcast he talked  about pushing power to the edges and decentralizing governance and  monetary policy.  So I decided to do what I have always done when I am  interested in a coin, buy $100 bucks worth and use it.  I purchased 100  ADA from coinbase and sent it to my Daedalus wallet.

That was when I noticed that the transfer fees where above .15 us  dollars.  I had heard that there was some kind of cool POS algorithm  that was gonna make it so there could be tons of validated transactions  in a super scalable way so transaction fees would not have to be high.   But they are huge… measurable in usd. One of the things I usually do  with my 100 dollars test investment is to try to send some to my friends  to spend back at my business to see how the coin works as a transfer of  value. If I where to send my friend 10 bucks worth of ADA and he where  to come to my shop and buy a 1.00 soda every day … he could not get 10  soda’s or even 9 sodas . Transfer fees would have eaten away over 1.50  of that money. So not the best for transferring value especially for low  income people.  If its not good for transferring value, what else can  it do. Nothing yet.

So with nothing I could use the coin for I decided to stake it.  I  looked around in the Daedalus wallet and there is not an option to stake  on your own, or to set up a pool, (while I have the expertise to set up  a pool and the documentation is fine, I am just “playing” with my 100  ADA as a “regular” user).  My only option is to delegate to someone  else’s pool.  I Click the recommended one. And it wants 2 ADA for me to  delegate. Gross. Oh and I have to pay another .17 US dollars transfer  fee.

This was the second thing I noticed was off, these are not  decentralized staking nodes, these are big money investment companies  setting up multiple staking nodes to game the pool saturation variable.   So I scroll down and find one with a shitty website so its obviously  not owned by some corporation, of course its 1/3 as profitable as the  big business nodes. Oh and another .17 Us dollars to transfer the 2 ADA  they are ‘Holding’.

Ok. Fees too high, pools not decentralized. Thats fine … those are all votable perimeters!  
 I open my Daedalus wallet and have a look around … the voting system is  convoluted.  I download the catalyst voting app register my wallet … I  have 0 voting power because I have less than 3 G’s in my wallet.  Where  can find the current perimeters? In a json file that is unaccessible to  the user.  There is no way for me to vote or propose a vote on the  system. If voting is a core feature of the system, it should be a  feature in the core software.

Nothing about my experience screams pushing power to the edges… the  current state of the system seems to be to drain a users wallet through  transfer fees into big business staking nodes.  This just consolidates  voting power to the centralized staking companies who’s incentive is to  further drain users wallets.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Can I afford this condo?,"I (29M) am in the market for a condo in an east coast, HCOL city.

I've largely avoided the obscene rents here by living with multiple roommates in lower-end apartments, but it's high time I move on into a place of my own. I was tempted a year ago to consider a $2-$2.5k 1bd, but decided to buckle down, save aggressively, and be able to buy my own place years sooner.

I think I'm ready to swing this, and am motivated to get in while the interest rates are low and before certain neighborhoods appreciate out of my budget again. My budget range has been $500-600k, but I'm leaning toward the upper end of that in order to make fewer trade-offs. (And just to be clear I'm not talking anything fancy. Even $600k is a mid-tier condo at best here.)

**Salary:** $120k, plus a 15% bonus that's been reliable to-date. There is plenty of growth potential above me within my current company and in my field, so I anticipate my earnings increasingly steadily in the years ahead.

**Downpayment/closing costs:** $65k, likely $70k by the earliest I could close on a place. Should be enough for around a 10% DP and closing costs.

**Emergency fund:** $15k. This was a comfortable 6+mo at my current living expenses, but I know it won't be enough with the big mortgage payments factored in. I'm working on growing this, but may elect to do a smaller DP in order to putt the remainder into my EF.

**Retirement:** A hair over $100k. I've been contributing 15-20%, and plan to maintain a similar contribution rate even with the condo.

**HSA:** $6k.

**Debts:** None\*\*.\*\* I paid off $60k of student loans and a $15k car note a couple years back. No other debt.

**Credit score:** low 800s.

**Mortgage specs**: $440k-$540k. My lender estimates a 2.75% interest rate and $75-$125 PMI, both in large thanks to my strong credit score.

What do you think? Could I make this happen?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing: approved for $2k more than payoff amount?,"Longtime lurker, don't know much about finance, but have learned a lot from this community. 

I have been approved to refinance my private student loans with sofi, but the amount on my contract is almost $2000 over my payoff amount. I am pretty sure this is because I payed about $1800 towards my loan this month, but I do not know what is going to happen to that overpayment. I spoke with the new lender and they told me that my current lender would send the overpayment amount back to them. Is this normal? If my current lender takes a few weeks to send back the overpayment, wouldn't I be paying interest on the $2000? I do not mind paying interest on the $2000 considering my interest rate will be going from 12% to 4.3%, I just wanted to make sure everything is on the up and up. Thanks everyone.",finance

Which site would be the best to do this with? I'm assuming no site has insurance against losing the funds. If there are any please let me know. Otherwise I would be looking for the highest interest rate combined with lowest transfer fees to get the stable coin in and out of the account. I plan to keep my emergency fund outside of this account so that if an emergency pops up i don't need to pull these funds out.

Forex,Question about *real* interest rates [Fundamental analysis],"I have been looking into how real interest rates have a significant impact on forex markets, and how the differential between real rates can influence price.

I have looked into real rates for 2021 but only found data from 2014? However I can see that real interest rates are just the nominal rate - inflation rate. 

So I took the Federal funds rate of 0.25 and took away the current CPI rate of 4.993 (what I think inflation rate is?) and arrived at a \*real\* interest rate of -4.793. 

This seems shocking to me and I think I have done something wrong, used the wrong data or am completely on the wrong page entirely. This seems like such a significantly negative rate. Can anyone help me understand? 

I am still learning so apologies if I seem out of my depth. Anyways hope that has made sense to anyone, thank you.",finance
gaming,As far as EA sports goes....,"Is there anyone out there who's played NBA Live 19 since it first came out, I have and I've been waiting for EA to pursue developing another project.  A good while back I deleted 2K21 cause I was getting annoyed and didn't want to play 2Ks style of basketball anymore, I reinstalled Live 19 and that's been my basketball fix cause I definitely like Live. 

 The graphics still hold up, the game looks great, presentation wise, courts, player models, and overall in game graphics, and on next gen, the boost to the graphics makes it look even more amazing. I'm so tired of EA, first they throw Fight Night to the wolves, now here we go again with Live. It's mighty funny EA thought Live wasn't going to be successful, now YouTubers are playing it and it's been trending for a while, and fans from both the Live and 2k community are curious to know if a new Live game is coming.

Especially when the Twitter account said Live 20 was canceled, and they were focusing on next gen and they'll give updates, but they haven't said anything since. And people are fed up with 2k being the only basketball game available, nobody had an exclusive license so literally ANY company can attempt to make a competitive simulation NBA basketball game to rival 2k, at this point it's like EA is staying silent in order to let the curiosity and hype die, but instead it's growing day by day.

Ufc, fifa, madden, Nhl, and even golf is getting attention from EA, but stay absolutely quiet about NBA Live. There's a reason why people are playing Live 19 right now and are wanting answers from EA as to where is the next Live installment, we don't even care if it's coming out next year, just some kind of news, positive news that is.",technology

personalfinance,"Jumbo mortgage vs piggyback - first time homebuyer, mid 20s, NW USA","I'm getting ready to buy my first home (read: I have no clue what I'm doing), and I have pre-approvals from two lenders with different structures.  


Purchase price - $1.1MM  
Down payment - $137,500 (12.5%)  


Option 1: jumbo 30 year mortgage at 3.375%  
Option 2: conforming 30 year loan at 3.125% for ~$750k plus a HELOC for the rest at 5% (variable)  

Both carry no PMI.  

I like the fixed rate of option 1, but I also like the idea of being able to reduce my monthly payment (by paying down the HELOC more quickly) with option 2.  

Also, option 1 allows me to put only 10.1% down (still no PMI) and keep that interest rate (or put 15% down and drop to 3.250%). But, I can also buy points to reduce the interest rate ($2k per point, and each points drops the rate 0.125%).  

I'm generally quite risk-averse, so I want to stay away from option 2 and its variable interest rate, but the ability to lower my monthly payments makes it an attractive option. I'm leaning towards the 30 year fixed (option 1), putting down the minimum 10.1%, then buying a couple points to get the rate down to 3.250%. Am I making a mistake here?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Bonds to Crypto, why not?","Good evening,

Serious question here.

As a member of the military I was given the ability years ago to purchase series I and EE bonds with small portions of my paycheck every month until I had whole bonds years ago.  Once fully funded, they sent me the paper [bonds](https://imgur.com/a/gM1VknU) in the mail.  I did this for quite some time until the program stopped, I forgot about them. They have moved with me 4 times now, and I've always known where they are, I just, sort of, ignored them.

Until today.

I have about  \~ 1.3 ETH at current price in bonds that are of varying interest rates. Issue price is $1800, actual worth $2,486, and worth at maturity (in 19 years to mature all) is $3,212 -a gain of about $726.

That is an okay ROI but hey, I bought these and forgot about them.  I don't miss them now, I won't miss them later right?

Today, I remembered them, and to preface this, I don't have anything planned for them and they aren't an investment instrument intended for my progeny or anything.  Crypto has actually caused me to lose faith in them being valid instruments in 19 years.

To preface this, my wife said, no. Specifically she said ""why would you want to turn something that is real, into something that isn't?""

Ugh.

My question is, why should I not turn these into ETH, other than wife says no, and people likely saying convert them to BTC? (It is a good argument, but not one I want to have right now)

I have nothing against BTC, but I have the opportunity to buy more than one ETH.  This is from a guy with less than one ETH currently. 

Other than buy \*insert altcoin here\*, why should I hold them and not buy ETH?

UPDATE: I’m gonna talk to her about it again this morning, but I’m gonna be honest: yeah, they are MY bonds, but I’m not gonna go against her if she says no. I do however know I can sell her on putting it into our Acorns account, so it will at least be making “some” money.

Thanks for the help here though, it’s greatly appreciated. Especially thanks to the “happy wife, happy life” comments. I’m all big and bad with a few beers in me, but in the morning with some coffee, y’all right, it’s her money too.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Lightning eMotors (ZEV) added to the Russell Microcap Index. Undervalued commercial EV play with sector dominance and strong growth,"What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile” lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing “upfit ecosystems” that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage — They’ve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the “Buy America” mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example.”  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. “Combined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we’re ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.”  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they’ve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (75% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: “With Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

&amp;#x200B;

Quotes from clients:

“We looked at every brand of commercial EV and vehicle analytics out there, and after intense research, we chose to partner with Lightning eMotors.We require the highest tech vehicles to integrate with our online rental platform, and Lightning’s technology fits us well. We are able to show a compelling return on investment for these vehicles versus their legacy gasoline vehicles for our rental customers.”

–U.S. Fleet Operator

“We have chosen to partner with Lightning to help us achieve our aggressive worldwide sustainability goals. We have started our journey of procuring 1,000’s of zero emission trucks worldwide over the next 5 years and expect that Lightning will be a key supplier for vehicles and charging infrastructure.”

**More about DRC - What is DRC and why does it have value?:**

Digital Reserve Currency (DRC) is a store of value cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. When you hear store of value you immediately think Bitcoin. The problem with Bitcoin is that it’s slow and each Bitcoin is divisible up to 10\^-8 meaning there are really 100 million parts in a single Bitcoin or 2.1 quadrillion parts that could ever be in circulation (21 million / 10\^-8). DRC on the other hand is an indivisible token meaning you can never have less than 1 DRC making it a much more efficient store of value. If you’re looking for a SoV you want a rare asset that won’t inflate. 100% of the DRC supply is already in circulation and was put into circulation initially. No team tokens or any other hold making it a truly fair, decentralized ecosystem. There’s a total of 1 billion DRC. Now I’m not saying DRC is going to replace Bitcoin. At the end of the day, it’s just a much more efficient SoV, it’s non-divisible (first and currently the only cryptocurrency to do so), and it’s on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains making it much quicker and more efficient. The product is also fully developed. I suggest you take a look at their website to see the DRC vault (basically a store of DRC created for HODLers who are rewarded with random DRC and NFT drawings which include hashmasks rare AI art pieces and many more).

**More Info on the DRC Ecosystem:**

On the DRC website hyperlinked below, you can go and check out their vaults that were created to further benefit the Digital Reserve Currency ecosystem. One of these vaults for example ""s2"" is comprised of 90% USDC 5% BTC and 5% ETH, the reason for doing so is with such a high stable coin allocation the vault basically acts as a stable coin, except for the slight volatility around the final 10% allocation. This allocation allows for it to be a true preserver of wealth unlike USDC and other stable coins. The problem with stable coins is that they still experience inflation at the rate of the USD (about 4.5% this year alone) meanwhile s2 vault performance not only matches the rate of inflation per year but actually slightly surpasses it making it a real preserver of wealth (\~6% APY). The problem with the USD and all other fiat currencies has become more evident this year than ever before. The United States and countries all over the world are printing more money than any other time in history, fiat currency is only inflating and the people this is really affecting are those who can't afford/risk spending their money on assets like real estate or stocks that generally hold their value. This is where s2 comes into play. It's a relatively no-risk way to preserve one's wealth, its volatility is only slightly greater than that of any stable coin. To me, it's a no-brainer way to help people all over the world and it's just one of many aspects of the Digital Reserve Currency ecosystem, and as more and more people use assets like s2 or DRC they only work to create an ecosystem that feeds into itself.

11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

30. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
37. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

46. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

105. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa.  Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month.  Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges.  Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
106. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
107. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals.  Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

109. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

personalfinance,Need to pay estimated taxes on capital gains?,"If I sell stocks to fund a large purchase, like, just to provide a figure, I would owe $25k in capital gains tax afterwards, would I need to pay that as estimated tax for the same quarter I sell the stocks?


I tried my best to do this homework but a second opinion would really help: From what I found, if this $25k tax can't be covered by a year of withholding from my job (my brokerage doesn't withhold), then I must pay it as estimated tax, otherwise I'll get hit with the underwithholding penalty. Is this correct?


Also, a dum dum question: the 2021 federal long-term capital gains tax rate is 0% for up to $40,400 for single individuals. This $40,400 figure refers to the gross income, so unless my sole income for the year is capital gains, it doesn't mean I get to pay no tax on my first $40k of profits, right?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"The ""attack"" on crypto has started in earnest. BIS, The Bank of International Settlements, has joined in and in all likelihood will coordinate the attack to usher in CBDC and move out of the way all competing platforms. The US Senate, The FED and the European Central Bank will be their bed fellow.","IMO

The attack on crypto with the [press release](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709f.htm) from [The Bank Of International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) is picking up and in all likelihood should be full on by mid summer. The public face of BIS is one of concern for the unbanked and other altruistic qualities but this is a bank that the very property it sits on in Switzerland  is sovereign land unto itself not unlike the Vatican. BIS has its own para-military force and answers to no one. You should do your own research on this entity. But you gotta wonder why?

The vast majority of people have little or no understanding of Crypto, or the distributed ledger technology that underlies it. So they can be just told what it is, how it works and why its good or bad. And what will they be told, they will be told talking points that the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren has already espoused  from her position in the Banking Subcommittee (see this [committee meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r4dRxXUL_o) @ 41.49 min and 1:28 min). That the biggest use of crypto is money laundering, war lords, drug smuggling and black mail. Its mostly a scam and people only loose money. 

This will be an international  attack it will be coordinated and it will lay the groundwork for the implementation of CBDC's. (I wonder if it will be a reason for censorship of the pro-crypto groups by the major media like our recent experience?)

To some degree crypto created its own trouble in that some projects were pure scams and of course these will be the only projects ever talked about. BIS, Ms. Warren and others will give a bow to some of the great minds in Crypto and say it was a valiant attempt. Don't fall for it. They want control of the monetary system, the creation of money and the ability ""to catch the bad guy"". Who in all likelihood is you or me. This is a big subject and could be discussed endlessly but I will leave it here.

You are going to see as front page news each and every time a crypto and likely the most recognizable crypto, bitcoin, is used by a bad actor in a nefarious manner. The energy waste is already all over the news but no mention of the projects that use almost zero energy and much less than VISA. Every time a project explodes Forbes will cover it. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times will pound their readership with bad news about crypto. Exposés on people who were fooled into mortgaging their home for the promise of getting rich quick! It will be slow but continuous, this will go on and on and on. Death by a thousand paper cuts. 

But more importantly, as you may think we can all rise up and fight it, and in my opinion their organization of the message, control of the media and their position **as the authority** will be unstoppable, so which of all these projects are going to survive? No project is perfect, no project hasn't made mistakes. Which will have the blessing of the western style governments and which will be hounded out of existence or minimally be excommunicated to a small corner of the internet? 

You may think not being registered in or as a US or European Corp will protect them. I say go back to sleep and enjoy your sweet dreams my child, sweet dreams. Countries have been destroyed for less by this group.

personalfinance,$28K worth of credit card debt. debt. Baby on the way. Need to buy a car. Expenses going up. Feel like I'm on the edge of a cliff.,"Throwaway account because I don't necessarily want this tied to my personal account. I am in a constant state of regret, panic and borderline depression, so I kindly ask that any replies refrain from judgment, as I know I have already fucked up.

My spouse was in school full-time and out of the workforce for the past five years. He recently started a new job, and on paper our prospects look great. Now, we have a combined income over $170K. I'm in my late 30s. He's in his mid 40s.

The reality underneath is far messier. I supported us while he was unemployed, and due to many bad decisions and various unforeseen expenses, I accumulated $40K in credit card debt. In two years, I clawed my way out of a good chunk of it, and it now totals around $28K. Since he started his job, I had the ability to become more aggressive in payments and in rebuilding my savings (now about $15K) and making greater contributions to my 401K (now around $175K). We haven't had a car, so no car payments or insurance. No student debt. We have paid VERY below-market for our rent, despite living in a HCoL area, for what is essentially a three-bedroom+office space near public transportation for $1,300/mo. Our rent had only been raised once in like five years. However, due to debt, it was very much a struggle while we only had one income. I freelance on the side for extra cash. Depending on the month, it can bring in anywhere from an extra $200-$1,000. Historically, I've pushed it toward debt/bills, but lately I'm funneling it toward savings. We have really cut a LOT of expenses (no cable, work pays for my phone), don't really go out to eat (especially not this past year) and rarely buy clothes, etc. Haven't taken a real vacation in years - maybe a long weekend once a year.

Last year, after much hand-wringing, we finally made the decision to try to get pregnant. Age-wise, we were worried time was running out. We figured that if my spouse was still unemployed by the time baby, he could cover child care. We would make it work. And if he got a job, even better!

So, I got pregnant very quickly -- honestly, far sooner than I expected given my age. Spouse landed a job with a good salary, and splitting the bills finally was a HUGE relief. He also has some smaller debts to pay, but eventually he will be able to help me with mine.

And then we found out our rent was going up -- significantly, to $1900/mo. The landlord wants to renovate and rewire the unit, requiring us to relocate for two months. It is not optional. We considered just moving, but in our area, frankly we would pay more and get less in terms of space, and the upfront costs of changing apartments (first month, last month, security deposit, agent fee, etc.) just felt like lighting our savings on fire. We are not in a position to buy, especially not in this market. And while our apartment isn't perfect, $1900/mo is still a steal for what we have.

Baby is arriving very soon. Every day, I am completely wracked with shame, panic, regret and dread during what should be a happy time. I feel like we seriously, grossly miscalculated the financial aspect of this decision. When I try to draw up a budget for our anticipated basic expenses (not counting food, diapers, etc.), it's doable but VERY tight. And I'm now about 5.5 months along, so there is no going back. And we have to buy a bunch of shit for the baby, as I don't think anyone will be throwing me a shower. Meanwhile, this debt feels like an anchor pulling me underwater. I am devastated just thinking about all this money I'm throwing at credit card debt that could instead be put toward financial stability and a future for our family. Every day, I wish we had waited another year to start trying for a baby. I probably could have knocked out another $8-10K, which would still leave a lot left but feel more like the end is in sight.

Since I know people will suggest this: I have considered taking a personal loan with a lower interest rate for the credit card debt, but frankly the lack of flexibility in monthly payments makes me a bit nervous -- especially as I prepare to go on maternity leave and so many other expenses are suddenly in flux. Maybe it sounds crazy, but it feels somewhat ""safer"" right now to have the option to only make minimum monthly payments on the CCs if needed.

In terms of immediate needs and my purpose for this long, rambling, emotional post: We need to get a car for the baby, who is due at the end of October. While the area we live in is relatively urban and walkable -- with access to public transportation, Uber and Zipcar -- it's not a downtown metro area. We're just outside a major city and will require a car for getting baby to/from doctor's appointments and, eventually, daycare five days a week (another upcoming new expense). We can't make a move on getting a car until September due to the renovation/relocation (we're subletting a place without parking).

I am hopelessly torn between buying used or leasing. I know the market for both is terrible right now and that this sub hates leasing, but I feel like a lower monthly payment is probably we what we need to survive this period. And leasing could take some of the worry out of major repairs, right? (Neither of us are car-savvy people.) And I would not be taking on a new loan on top of this already absurd amount of debt. If we bought used, we would need to get a 60-month loan, which I know is also horrible, but in terms of monthly payments, I just don't think we'll be able to swing a 36-month loan without dipping into savings (which I would already need to do to put money down on a car). But of course, owning a car means the payments would eventually stop and I wouldn't sweat every little ding or dent in the vehicle. I'm very partial to an older model Honda HR-V, as it seems safe, reliable and would last a long time. And I know the list price on leasing doesn't include taxes, titles and fees, so maybe it breaks even... ugh, I don't know what to do.

------------------

Hi all, I've got about $150k in student loans, at varying rates between 6% and 9%.

I'm planning to purchase a home (to build equity instead of paying thousands each month in rent), and looking at rates just below 3% for a 30 year mortgage, for homes worth about $400k-$500k in total value.

I'm a high earner (&gt;%150k a year) and have ~$100k in cash to work with. Am I better off:

a) throwing $80k+ toward a downpayment for a home to get the 3% mortgage (with minimal mortage insurance)?

or b) lowering my downpayment by ~$40-50k, causing my mortgage rate and insurance to go up, but allowing me to pay off student loans faster?

---------------------

Another variable here is that I could refinance all or part of my student loans to the lower rates we currently have (I'd just lose the ability to potentially have them forgiven in the future).

CryptoCurrency,Proof of Stake should interest rates go up,"So, for the last few years the world has experienced unprecedented (citations needed) low interest rates. With PoS on chains like Cardano that are offering approx 5.5% APY ... are there any financial models done that give an indication on what would happen when (if) interest rates go up to the point where putting fiat into fixed deposits and the like would earn you far more in interest than you would get on returns from staking? 

What would happen to the likes of PoS etherium should people move their coins to banks/exchanges that offer higher interest? Would the gas costs go up to make up for less stake pools? Would it somehow form another equilibrium?

Imagine world wide interest rates of the 80s at 16% ish average.

Is there any literature on this?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Put cash toward better mortgage or student debt?,"tl;dr: I have cash to use toward either a larger home downpayment (and lower mortgage rate) or toward a massive set of student loans (at higher interest rates). Which should I pay off?

------------------

Hi all, I've got about $150k in student loans, at varying rates between 6% and 9%.

I'm planning to purchase a home (hoping to build equity instead of paying thousands each month in rent), and looking at rates just below 3% for a 30 year mortgage. Looking at homes worth about $400k-$500k in total value.

I'm a high earner (&gt;%150k a year) and have ~$100k in cash to work with. Am I better off:

a) throwing $80k toward a downpayment for a home to get the 3% mortgage (with minimal mortage insurance)?

or b) lowering my downpayment by ~$40k, causing my mortgage rate and insurance to go up, but allowing me to significantly reduce my 7-9% interest loans?

---------------------

Another variable here is that I could always refinance all or part of my student loans, given low prevailing rates and excellent credit (I'd just lose the ability to potentially have them forgiven in the future).

stocks,"$BA — Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification","https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/citing-a-serious-flight-test-incident-and-lack-of-design-maturity-faa-slows-boeing-777x-certification/

In yet another blow to Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration last month formally denied the jet maker permission to move forward with a key step in certifying its forthcoming giant widebody airplane, the 777X.

In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023.

That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned.

The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.

Boeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day.

The letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements.

And he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet’s flight controls.

“The aircraft is not yet ready,” Won wrote. “The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.”

An FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now “the subject of a lot of attention” at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.

Boeing’s last all-new jet, the 787, had to be grounded in 2013 when its batteries smoldered in flight. The next new plane, the derivative 737 MAX, was grounded for 21 months starting in 2019 after flawed new flight controls caused two fatal crashes.

Now the forthcoming 777X is having a troubled certification process. Is this just the FAA getting tough because of all the scrutiny?

The FAA official said that even if the MAX crashes hadn’t happened, the list of serious issues now raised about the 777X would merit rigorous regulatory attention.

Within the FAA, the person said, “there’s a general feeling that Boeing has kind of lost a step,” referring to the slide away from a historic reputation for engineering prowess.

And because of all the missteps, the official added, “the days of Boeing being able to say to the FAA ‘Just trust us’ are long gone.”

In a statement Friday, Boeing said it “remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development.”

The airplane is undergoing “a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability … to ensure we meet all applicable requirements,” Boeing added.

The FAA in a statement said safety drives its decisions and timelines.

“The FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,” the agency said.

FAA exasperated

Boeing launched the 777X at the Dubai Air Show in the fall of 2013, and at that time targeted 2020 as the year it would enter service.

Set to replace the Boeing 747 jumbo and Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger planes — which are no longer built — as the largest airliner in production, the 777X is a stretch version of the successful 777 passenger airliner featuring a new, superlong, carbon composite wing with folding tips and the largest jet engines ever built.

Boeing invested more than $1 billion in a new composites fabrication plant in Everett to build the wings.

Inside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing also installed state-of-the-art, automated stations to robotically assemble the wings — equipment designed by Mukilteo-based engineering company Electroimpact — and completely changed the way the 777 fuselage and wings come together to make assembly more flexible and efficient.

The first of two 777X models and the largest — the 777-9X, which carries 426 passengers in a two-class configuration — made its first flight in January 2020, kicking off the test flight program.

By now, four test planes are flying out of Boeing Field and at least 17 more 777Xs destined for customers Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and All Nippon Airways have rolled out of the factory.

Boeing will have to park those production aircraft and any more built from now through at least late 2023 until certification allows their delivery.

The FAA’s letter on the status of 777X certification is addressed to Tom Galantowicz, the head of Boeing’s internal organization consisting of engineers and managers who act as proxies for the federal agency, tasked with testing and verifying that a new airplane design meets safety standards.

The letter denies Boeing a specific approval for the 777-9X called “Type Inspection Authorization” readiness. Without this, Boeing cannot put FAA personnel on board flight tests and begin to collect certification data.

The wording suggests a degree of exasperation with Boeing pushing for TIA when the FAA deems it far from ready.

“The FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months,” the letter reads, adding that despite Boeing’s assertion that proceeding with TIA “warrants consideration,” the FAA in contrast “considers that the aircraft is not yet ready.”

The letter then lists a host of shortfalls in Boeing’s readiness.

FAA demands data, not promises

Asked about the test flight that experienced the “uncommanded pitch event” in December, Boeing said the plane went on to land safely and that engineers investigated the root cause and have developed a major software update to fix the problem.

In the meantime, until that’s approved, Boeing has given the test pilots instructions on how to avoid the incident recurring so that test flights can continue.

Yet the FAA clearly isn’t satisfied with Boeing’s promise of a software fix.

“After the uncommanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation,” the letter reads.

“Software load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays,” it states.

To confirm “the maturity and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft,” the FAA demands comprehensive and documented reviews of the changes resulting from the investigation into the incident, to ensure that a similar problem “will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.”

The FAA separately highlights concern over a critical piece of new avionics on the jet — the Common Core System, a set of shared computing resources critical to the functioning of multiple airplane systems.

Won notes that Galantowicz conceded in a letter to the FAA earlier in May that the CCS has incomplete software and does not meet TIA requirements.

Citing a “lack of data” and the absence of a Preliminary Safety Assessment for the FAA to review, the agency’s letter declares that Boeing hasn’t even met its own process requirements.

Boeing’s CCS “review dates have continuously slid over a year,” the letter notes.

In turning down the 777X for TIA readiness, the FAA also cited a finding that the supplier of the avionics provided “inadequate peer review” in a safety analysis “resulting in inconsistencies … and incorrect reuse of 787 data.”

GE Aviation’s plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, supplies the CCS, which builds upon the similar common core avionics system it designed for the 787.

GE, which touts the CCS as the “central nervous system and brain” of the airplane, deferred comment to Boeing.

Demand for 777X currently near zero

Another problem for the FAA is Boeing’s proposal of late changes to the 777X flight control system.

“Boeing is proposing modifications that will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electronics of the Flight Control System,” the FAA states. “Boeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new, inadvertent failures modes.”

Other pending modifications to the design of systems around the jet’s horizontal tail or stabilizer, which controls the pitch of the airplane, will change the crew alerts that flag certain system failures.

“Design maturity is in question as design changes are ongoing and potentially significant,” the letter states.

Separately, the letter states in passing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also “not yet agreed on a way forward” with regard to 777X certification.

In an emailed response Friday, EASA spokesperson Janet Northcote said the agency is “cooperating closely with the FAA” on 777X certification.

“We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing,” she said.

The FAA’s letter told Boeing that because of the gaps in the 777X technical data, it anticipates a significant increase in the required level of testing and analysis, “and the potential to increase the number of certification flight tests that will need to take place.”

The letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz’s unit “close these gaps” before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that “based on the information from Boeing,” 777X certification is realistically more than two years out, in “mid to late 2023.”

Ironically, the only positive for Boeing in this situation is that — because of the pandemic’s destruction of international air travel demand — no airline in the world wants a 777X right now.

When international travel begins to pick up again post-pandemic, airlines will begin service with smaller jets like Boeing’s long-range 787 until long-haul air travel gradually returns to a level approaching what was typical in 2019.

Yet at a Bernstein Research industry conference this month, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun doubled down on the 777X despite all the setbacks. Once the jet is certified, he said, “it will have a 40- or 50-year run, and I think it will be one of the great runs of all time.”

“I have lots of confidence in it,” Calhoun said. “We love it.”

Boeing’s website lists 320 orders for the 777X, though because of the delays airline customers will have the option to cancel some of those and may switch to smaller Boeing jets.

Dubai-based Emirates, the largest 777X customer, reduced its initial order for 150 aircraft to 115, swapping out 35 of the 777Xs for 30 much less expensive 787s.

The original 777 flight test program in the mid 1990s, from first flight to certification, took 10 months. For the 737 MAX, that period was just over 13 months. During the problem-ridden and much delayed development of the 787, first flight to certification took just over 20 months.

The 777X is currently set to reach certification almost four years after first flight.

Citing the delays in getting the plane certified, Emirates airline President Tim Clark has said he doesn’t expect any 777X deliveries until 2024.

Realistically, that’s the earliest any global carrier might want to take delivery of such a huge aircraft. Four years late, that’s when the 777X may finally be ready.",finance
investing,"By One Measure, March 2020 Was Worse Than the Financial Crisis","One of the hallmarks of last year’s market crash was the speed with which the Federal Reserve responded to it, stepping in to purchase billions of dollars worth of U.S. government debt within days of the Treasury market seizing up.

A new staff working paper from the Federal Reserve helps explain the urgency behind the central bank’s actions, exploring the mayhem that engulfed the Treasury market in 2020 when the yield on the benchmark 10-year jumped by 65 bps in fewer than 10 days as hedge funds unwound billions of dollars worth of leveraged trades. The trade typically saw hedge funds borrow money in the repo market to arbitrage the difference between Treasuries in the cash market and futures. But in March of 2020, as investors stampeded into the most liquid contracts in the market (Treasury futures), the spread between the two suddenly went haywire, leaving hedge funds to nurse significant losses.

You can see just how painful the trade was in the below excerpt from the paper, which show hedge funds’ average returns over time:  

“Given that the mean quarterly return over our sample is 2.3% with a standard deviation of 8.1%, a sector-wide return of -9.9% reflects unprecedented losses for these hedge funds, which is also depicted in Figure 5. This indicates that during the COVID-19 crisis in March, these hedge funds were under a significant amount of stress, to a greater extent than at any point since Form PF reporting started in 2012. Clearly, the current crisis unfolded more precipitously than the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, which was characterized by relatively longer periods of a buildup of uncertainty from 2007 onward.”

By March 15, after yields had been spiking for about seven days, the Fed announced a new U.S. Treasury and mortgage bond purchasing facility aimed at soothing the mayhem in the world’s most important funding market. By the end of the month, the central bank had purchased some $775 billion in U.S. government debt and $291 billion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. housing agencies.

According to the paper, much of the blow-up in basis trades occurred not because of a pullback in repo funding from big dealer-banks trying to protect their balance sheets, but rather as function of good old-fashioned liquidity management in anticipation of investor redemptions. Here, longer lockups on hedge fund money may actually have helped protect the market and prevent the crisis from becoming much worse.

Or, as the authors put it:

“We find evidence that the cutback in hedge fund UST exposures was driven by liquidity management considerations and investor redemption risks. By the end of March 2020, hedge funds with significant Treasury exposures increased their cash holdings by over 20% and scaled down the size and illiquidity of their portfolios. This boost to the precautionary liquidity holdings and the step back from UST market activity were less pronounced for funds with stricter share restrictions and lower redemption risk. Longer share restrictions allowed hedge funds to avoid fire sales and hold onto more of their convergence trades, thereby bolstering both fund and Treasury market stability … 

**Compared to previous crisis episodes, the March 2020 shock was unprecedented, particularly in the speed and scale at which extreme moves occurred and in its impact on otherwise safe and liquid markets such as the UST market.”**

datascience,Measuring model performance in production,"What are the common indexes to use when measuring and reporting model performance in production?

In our case it's a binary classification model (e.g. credit risk). Here are the stages the model goes through:

* Development - here we use GINI / AUC.
* Deployment - the model is exposed through an API
* Production - the model is used to score production records and a decision is taken based on the result whether to approve/deny (this decision is based on some business logic but eventually uses a cutoff point for the model)
* Feedback - after some events has happened in real life, the results are fed back to the system and attached as ""feedback"" to the predicted records. This is true world label result.

At first I thought to measure AUC/GINI of the production data, however I quickly realized that I have only half the picture. AUC is measured from the ROC and in the case of production we only have ""Negatives"" that is - records which have been predicted to be non-eventful. So the best we would have is ""non events we predicted and their results"". To get the ROC we also need events.

What would you measure in such case?

How would you report the quality of the model performance compared to training?",technology

11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

46. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

100. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

104. The June Cardano 360 was yesterday. It is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
105. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
106. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
107. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals.  Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

110. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

personalfinance,18 y/o looking for a good Checking and Savings account with good interest rates. Recommendations?,"18 y/o with a part time job, going to college this fall. Currently banking with capital one and a credit card with Discover. I am looking for a **high interest saving and checking account**. I would like it to not have foreign transaction fees so chime seemed to be a good option for their checking and savings account, but then I got lured into other options (not sure if they have foreign transaction fees on their debit cards , if they offer one that is) : Axos, T-mobile money, Schwab, Ally and even discover. All of them are offering accounts that look somewhat pleasing. I need some advice on what to do next. I would like to open a saving and checking account , no matter what bank, as long as the checking and saving account is offering decent interest rates. I'll put some emergency funds on the checking account since I won't be daily driving unless I go overseas. **I just need the debit card to have no transaction fees** so that I can have the added benefit and peace of mind.  As I did more research, Schwab looked extremely pleasing with their offering with no fees on the VISA debit card, a brokerage account **(I am interested in investing as well)** and high yield interest . Should I go for it or is there anything I need to know of? I don't care about brick and mortar branches because I don't see myself needing to go to the branch. The saving/checking can be from separate providers. No minimum deposit or fees preferred. Apologies if I broke any rules (first post here) and thanks in advance!",finance

If i do get in and graduate, I’m looking at around 400k in student debt. However, I can also expect to make around 150k a year straight out of school. Is it worth it to spend the first few years aggressively paying this debt off? Or should I extend the period over like 30 years with a low interest rate? 

I do want to get into real estate as well, so I’m wondering if it would be a better idea to pay the debt off before getting rental properties.

personalfinance,"I've shied away from filing my taxes in several of the past 12 years, &amp; some years I haven't filed, I want to get organized &amp; get everything straightened out but not sure where to begin","Wall of text incoming.

So, I haven’t done several years worth of state / federal taxes, some of which are too far in the past to get a refund on, as I understand it. I usually have the excuse that “I always get a refund anyway, so any years I haven’t done, I won't get in trouble for/don't have to worry about"" (which I still wonder if it may be true to some extent/in certain situations? But I obviously realize this is no way to handle my life, not knowing whether or not I'll get in trouble in regards to my taxes- hence this post and effort to get things straightened out).

So for some potentially relevant background, I'm 28, single, male, no dependants, live in my own apartment, and I don't rely on anyone for financial support. Working part time right now, not a current student. I lived in Iowa up until December of 2020 when I moved 10 minutes away to Nebraska. I worked in Iowa exclusively up until 2015, when I worked in South Dakota up through 2018. Ever since then I’ve worked in Iowa (including now, although, as I mentioned, I now live in Nebraska.)

I’ve sold stuff on Ebay a bit since 2017 but have never received a W2 from them or anything about doing my taxes. It’s my understanding that because I never received anything from them, I don’t have to worry about doing adding them to my income. Is this true? I could be misguided there (which is probably not surprising given my history of lack of understanding and vigilance towards taxes and finances and etc.)

I recently had my 2017 taxes done just before the cut off date- it was like April 29th or something. I got my refund for that in the mail. I need to do ’18, ’19, &amp; ’20 and I might need to address years past, like between ’08 and ’16, there were certainly some years in there where I lost out on refunds, and I think one or two years where I maybe only did federal taxes? I’m single, 28, no huge expenses or assets. Rent is $650 a month, I have about $10k in savings… I have no idea where to begin in getting this straightened out.

Is it safe to assume that I would have already gotten letters in the mail regarding penalties and etc. for anything 3+ years ago? I really just want to get things organized, I’m tired of having these questions weighing over my head and having to placate myself by assuming that I don’t have to worry about this stuff so much because “I always get a refund anyway”.

Please advise on what steps I should take to get things straightened out and let me know if there's anything that would be useful for y'all to know. Thanks in advance",finance

CryptoCurrency,I don't watch sport and I gambled twice my annual wage in one year. I didn't tell mum.,"Best use case for crypto...

A few years ago, I was fortunate to be in a group of ambitious humans that spent 2 years building and running an AI model for sports betting. The esteemed motley crew fed the AI an enormous amount of data. Millions of data points in a spreadsheet that ruled them all. It was a crazy time filled with lots of sport, gambling and you guessed it... data. I thought I go ahead and do multi bets too so that x2 the number of bets I was placing. Maybe 2500 bets over two seasons!

I'm going to leave some key things out since we would like to run the AI play again in the future. I'll also tell you why we stopped, and it wasn’t because of lack of profit 😉

It was an enormous effort to get the initial data to the AI it started processing. Once we had it, it was processing 24/7 well in advance leading up to kick-off and it continued to process throughout the season. That’s a LOT of processing! If I remember correctly it only stopped for 2 or 3 hours each day lol.

Once the AI was humming in the background another big issue, we were facing was who was going to take our bets? Sportsbooks are notorious for limiting people and we didn’t want our bets halted at any stage as that would fuck with our results. We could see in the backtesting that some small winning period covered a lot of losers. In the event of a book not paying or limiting the size of the bets at a critical time could be costly.

We needed inefficient odds to take advantage of. Having given sharps and winning bettors the boot, bookmakers these days are less concerned with odds. So, while it's easy to find bad odds those books are generally the ones that have the highest juice/Vig/fee and as stated they are going to boot ya anyways. 

Were we going to spend our days at the pub placing bets?? I was so ready for that. Especially after reading the story of Bill Benter and Alan Woods. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code)

It turned out the book that would end up taking our bets would be the game-changer. The sportsbook was in its early days but it offered exactly what we needed. No limits on bet size or access, low juice and no way they can refuse to payout. We had to take a risk on the book since it was new however once we weighed up the pros the cons quickly faded. But hey, where else were we going to go? 

The [WAGERR](https://wagerr.com/sportsbook) Sportsbook was chosen. A sports betting blockchain.

Once we started looking into Wagerr we discovered that there were multiple ways we could increase our take. The sportsbook is designed for both retail and commercial books. This means that the Wagerr sportsbook is a full circle gambling eco-system. How did we increase our take? By being the house at the same time as betting a shit load. Being the house means a cut of all the winnings and the more you contribute to the house, the larger the percentage you got in return.

**Ecosystem Overview**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvk27a62jz771.png?width=1498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763bf971a609cab457fa2462791b8b257605bcb4

I'm not going too deep in the economics of Wagerr. It can be read about in-depth here. 

[https://docs.wagerr.com/](https://docs.wagerr.com/)

So how did we go?

**Season 1**

This first season was going to be treading uncharted waters. We were so excited it was hard to not bet the bank trying to get rich lfg! lol. Winnings were very volatile. We knew that we had to amend the strategy as little as possible. But this very hard to stick to since we could see obvious things that needed changing. So the strat evolved a lot over the first season.

I can't remember but I think I was between 7% and 10% Kelly criterion at one stage. I was happy to do the larger percentage since the betting kitty was smaller ie less on the table to lose and deep down I was hoping we cracked the code. 

As expected, daily wins and losses we on the extreme side. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a87po089jz771.jpg?width=647&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8142ea1089f8ee486b1ac36f6d5d2c33a7a0b332

I did parlays during the first season. One thing I was concerned about parlays was if our odds were out it was going to be multiplied in the parlays so I kept it capped at two legs. I loaded the kitty up with a small amount and went fourth to place a shit load of bets every day. This had to be done on a centralized exchange since Wagerr was yet to offer multi bets. Funny, I wasn’t even winning and eventually they still limited my bet size. Once that happened, I pulled the pin and focused on the straight-up bets. 

&amp;#x200B;

[When I finished placing parlays](https://preview.redd.it/r9bjinzbjz771.jpg?width=337&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44dbc6542e2a7bcf569d8e2992dda6126ba14e31)

I was facing average returns. Ok. I was losing! Ghad, after so much hard work lol. I finished the season at a slight loss. This was fine as being the house covered a percentage of those losses. We collected a lot of data and together the team learnt an incredible amount.

&amp;#x200B;

[Not the full season stats - sorry](https://preview.redd.it/bmeunk9fjz771.jpg?width=273&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90eb766f7e5b1c3082c1651fe1d2dbdc213b148f)

**Season 2**

While the AI crunched numbers during the offseason, we changed a lot of things. We came up with a sound strategy it was reflected in our profits. We were correct 65% of the time!!! That’s a great achievement considering it could be done every season.

[Almost 1000 games bet on](https://preview.redd.it/i86mqjumjz771.jpg?width=365&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a155bdf475cd0705fffb0f7c0315c9305d4e46da)

It was all running great. Below is my bet kitty. It's 20 pages long covering almost one thousand bets. You can see all the ups and downs and the final figure before covid stop sports :( We got more invaluable data from the second season. Please note that where you see $ figure that wasn’t actually dollars since we were using the wagerr ecosystem. Each $1 represents one WGR coin. 

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/p3gjhor8e3jnlwq/Wagerr%20Returns%20-%20Copy.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p3gjhor8e3jnlwq/Wagerr%20Returns%20-%20Copy.pdf?dl=0)

Since the kitty was larger, I used a very modest 3% Kelly Criterion. Also, we still didn’t know if it was going to work, but it did!

[Profits over time](https://preview.redd.it/4y2bpooujz771.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=542dc1a23b695e715b24d576bf092ba5f8396ffe)

It was great fun. I turned over 2.4m+ Wagerr on the second season. Once you understand the Wagerr self-regulating, gambling ecosystem you can see how being the house can be very profitable even if you don't have access to ‘edge’ over sports markets. We didn't realise it at the time but the Wagerr sportsbook was a crucial part and I see a big future for it.

&amp;#x200B;

[The days were very exciting. I basically stopped work to focus on betting.](https://preview.redd.it/72uaxrrzjz771.jpg?width=351&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa3b2b19b8b6df921a6c6119de69e78a67cba66)

personalfinance,22YO recent college graduate with a job and lots in savings--what to do with it?,"I (22M) recently graduated from grad school and have been working from my parents' place during the pandemic. Staying at home allowed me to save up around $22,000. A month ago, I moved into an apartment in Washington, DC and bought all new furniture, etc., which has dropped my savings down to about $18,000, although I have about $2,000 more I try to keep in my checking account just in case anything happens. 

The $18,000 I have is just sitting in my savings account and I'd like to do something with part of it (I was thinking $10,000) so that I'm not just gaining pennies each month. However, I'm not sure where to start or where to go.

I'm making $51,000 in a government job with a take-home pay around $2,650 every 4 weeks. I've also been told I'll be getting a $2,000 bonus this fall (taxable). Pay should increase to around $52,400 this winter should the currently-proposed pay increase take effect. Right now my rent is $1,150 and I have another $1,000 budgeted for other expenses. I'm aiming to save about 10% of my income every month and have been putting 5% into the Thrift Savings Plan (not included in take-home pay). The other $235 I have left over I plan on using for student loan repayment when I have to start making payments this winter and can cut my spending in other areas to cover the full amount (I'm projecting $250-$275 if my understanding of the REPAYE program is correct--planning on PSLF and have $53,000 in all federal loans) depending on how the expected pay increase pans out. Additionally, I'm on track to start making $73,000 by July of next year due to the type of position I'm in.

I feel that I'm in a fairly comfortable spot financially and would be willing to place up to \~$13,000 into an investment account or something of that nature to see some more returns. My question is, provided my situation, where do I start and how much do I invest? I have no clue how to navigate investing or stocks to be quite honest, nor what kind of risks I should take, having never been in this secure of a spot before. Any guidance given this information would be very much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off private student loan while I can?,"Hey Reddit I was curious if this would be a good idea. I am 24 and graduated college two years ago so I still have some federal student loans and also a private student loan that is about 11k with 7.6% interest. I work in pharm sales making 45k base salary and then earn an uncapped commission. I am making a $214 monthly payment for my private student loan but I am able to pay it off right now and still have a decent amount in my savings.

I've looked into refinancing the loan but it only drops a monthly 214 payment to around 205, so I am not sure if refinancing would be an option. I was curious if that would be a good idea and just continue to save money.",finance

&gt;With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.

A senior Federal Reserve official has warned the US cannot afford a “boom and bust cycle” in the housing market that would threaten financial stability, in a sign of growing concern over rising property prices at the central bank.

“It’s very important for us to get back to our 2 per cent inflation target but the goal is for that to be sustainable,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times. “And for that to be sustainable, we can’t have a boom and bust cycle in something like real estate.

“I’m not predicting that we’ll necessarily have a bust. But I do think it’s worth paying close attention to what’s happening in the housing market,” he said.

According to data released by the National Association of Realtors last week, the median price for sales of existing homes was up 23.6 per cent year-on-year in May, topping $350,000 for the first time.

Rosengren said that in the Boston property market, it had become common for cash-only buyers to prevail in bidding contests, and that some have been declining home inspections to gain an edge with sellers.

“You don’t want too much exuberance in the housing market,” Rosengren said. “I would just highlight that boom and bust cycles in the real estate market have occurred in the United States multiple times, and around the world, and frequently as a source of financial stability concerns.”

He said the roaring housing market should be a factor as the central bank considers slowing or removing some of the hefty monetary support for the economy introduced during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Fed has been purchasing $40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities per month alongside $80bn in monthly Treasury debt as part of its asset purchase programme.

Fed officials are now beginning to discuss trimming that bond buying. And Rosengren said that “when it is appropriate” to begin that process, mortgage-backed securities purchases should be reduced at the same rate as Treasury purchases. That would mean the direct support to housing finance would wind down more quickly.

“That would imply that we would stop purchasing MBS well before we stopped purchasing Treasury securities,” he said.

James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, is among those who have called for the Fed to re-evaluate its support for the housing market against the backdrop of what he noted were broader concerns about a nascent bubble.

Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed president, has also advocated for the purchases to end “sooner rather than later”, especially given mounting evidence of financial speculation in the housing market.

The Fed has said that it would begin reducing its asset purchases only once it had made “substantial further progress” towards its goals of 2 per cent average inflation and full employment.

Given the rapid recovery, Rosengren said “the conditions for thinking about whether we’ve attained substantial further progress will probably be met before the beginning of next year”.

The latest economic projections by the Fed showed central bank officials increasing interest rates from their current rock-bottom level in 2023, earlier than previously forecast. They also exposed a greater divide within the Federal Open Market Committee on the expected path of monetary policy than had been the case.

“There’s a great deal of uncertainty in the forecast,” Rosengren said. “Some people are going to have very rapid growth [and] the conditions for tightening policy may be happening sooner. And other people are going to think that the recovery is going to be a little slower.”",finance

cardano,Profit with Loan?,"Hello there,

Sorry for a Noob question but I have a serious doubt that I wanna get off of me.

So, I was wondering if staking would provide me with a ""15%"" claimed interest rate annually, be able to pay off my loan which goes at 9% charge so i make a 6% profit in the end. Like I was thinking about loaning a huge amount and then stake that amount and pay off my loan. Has anyone tried this?

Also, How does one calculate the interest rate for staking? on CoinDCX they are estimating an annual interest rate of 15%, paid monthly. Sorry for my bad English. THANKS!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Use $6k to pay off car or put in Roth IRA?,"Hi there,

I'll try and keep it brief. I'm 29/m single. My only ""real"" debt is a $6.5k car note, and my other debt is money I owe my parents that they loaned me for school. I have about $25k in savings that I was going to use towards a downpayment on a house, but my timeline has changed significantly.  I have about $31k in retirement currently ($8k in Roth IRA, and $23k in 401k)

I was going to use my savings towards a downpayment on a house, but my timeline has been pushed out significantly. Because of that, I was considering using some of my savings to pay off my car loan in full. My monthly payment is $237/month and if I continued making minimum payments it would be paid off in February of 2024. The interest rate is 6.8% APR.

The only issue I have there is if I pay off my car loan, I know my credit score will drop significantly. According to Discover, my FICO Score is 805. My car loan is my only open account in addition to a Discover CC that I pay off in full every month, so my types of accounts will drop thus dropping my score.

What route should I take with \~$6k?

Option A- Pay off $6.5k car loan in full, and start putting the $237 I save from that monthly payment into my Roth IRA.

Option B- Don't pay off car loan in full, and put $6k into Roth IRA to continue to build good credit history.",finance
personalfinance,"Late student loan payment absolutely decimated my credit score, university is being uncooperative","Hello,

I graduated from university last year with about $33k in student loan debt. Through 2020, I've paid off around $15k through Nelnet. I was under the impression that all my federal student loans were consolidated in Nelnet, but after checking my Experian credit report I see that there is another loan straight from the university for around $2500. I had missed 2 payments on this loan because I had no idea it existed, and it had not shown up on my credit report until recently. University phone contacts are not open since it is summer and they are being unresponsive by email contact. I just want to know how to pay off the damn thing.

Is there some kind of dispute I can make about this? This dip will make it extremely hard for me to find housing in the future. Literally from 750 to 600 in the matter of a day. The entire loan repayment system is so clandestine. Its like they want to screw you via obfuscation.

Thanks

edit: I was 100% correct. After 20 different phone calls over 5 hours I was able to figure out that the issued loan in question was a Perkins Loan which normally would be paid back straight to the school but that was discontinued in late 2016 and now a company called ESCI handles it. They failed to notify me of any of this and now I will be able to dispute that account.",finance

To me the biggest WTF wasn't the hack it was the fact that this coin was backed by other stable coins. Essentially making it a place holder for a product that already facilitates its function better and more "" reliable"" . Personally over the past week came to the conclusion that non-federal backed stable coins are the biggest scam in crypto and essentially took all the problems of fiat and made them worse   

I now have a constant short on USDT open; the fees are 3% a month and I'm happy to keep it open for at least 6. Small price to pay for paranoia and apart from the fees there is no major downside risk. USDT isn't going to pump to $1.50 and liquidate me

There's a lot of questions to get through, so allow me to start by saying we are a registered UK company. [Here is a link](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13405765) with the details of the owners, this is public information. Our offices are open to the general public at HD6 4AH. If anyone is local to Brighouse, Huddersfield (or whoever may want to), we'll be watching football come home tomorrow in the offices, and you're welcome any time.

We will be going live on the Opis Hub Twitch tomorrow at 16:00 UTC+1, so if anyone wants to join us and clear up any further questions, [here is a link](https://twitch.tv/opishub) to our twitch channel, which operates during our working hours so you can see us live most days. We apologize first of all for the delayed response, as the situation escalated, so did the involvement of our company members. Unfortunately for us, this happened when we were all on a business trip in London, meeting with the existing investors to let them know how it's going and what our plan is going forward. The meeting was a success, celebrations followed, and we weren't in a position to be addressing this in the manner that we wanted to.We have read every comment, and we're going to respond to everyone that offered a legitimate query.

Your questions were reasonable, but please consider that we did provide the original poster with an information pack that had some of the answers in them, and that person either didn't read the pack or decided not to use it... we'll let you consider their motive behind this. An example of this is someone asking why we hadn't provided any information about how we were going to achieve our goals...well, we did, but again, this information wasn't shared as we weren't the original posters. If they were genuinely trying to look out for people, we applaud this as there are a lot of scams out there. However, to us, it seems like they assumed we were a scam from the initial contact and then cherry-picked anything that fed their own confirmation bias. Over the coming weeks and months, it will be interesting to see if the original poster changes their position because if we were a scam, we'd be dead in the water, but as we are about to answer every legitimate question, you can clearly see we're not.

As we're still awaiting the investment funds to be processed and reach our accounts, we are still looking to grow our community. We were doing this by approaching people that had a good online reputation/good following, offering funds for making posts about us to spread the word. None of the information we have asked people to spread about us was misleading nor malicious.

Downvotes - In response to us buying downvotes, obviously, this was not a good move for us to make, but we did this as we messaged, ""in good faith, he or she would be happy to make a post about us and the information we provided. This did not happen, and we weren't too happy about the resulting post, as we were under the impression OP was happy to help our cause. As our Reddit accounts didn't have enough karma to respond, we were unable to defend ourselves properly. Also, the main account we use for posting was banned from posting/commenting for vote manipulation before we had a chance to respond on [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/). This resulted in us paying for downvotes on the post. Once again this was a mistake move, and we apologize for this.

Although the use of computers instead of mobiles would result in more power for the project, there is a clear spot in the market for the use of already existing mobile tech. Utilizing a percentage of your phone's CPU when it is charging and otherwise not being used is a good solution.

This is also accessible to millions of homes across the planet who own smartphones but wouldn't be able to afford a desktop pc. A traditional server consumes 20 kWh each day. The same processing capacity is achieved for 7 kWh using your phone with Opis Hub, meaning more eco-friendly, and we are tapping into what is already an unused resource.

3.5m investment – We have only just secured the investment; however, the majority of this is going towards development. Developers are expensive, and we need a lot of them to build what we are trying to accomplish.

ICO/Website – We are no longer running an ICO as we have secured enough initial investment and will not be asking for any funding from the public whatsoever. The website will be updated in the next few weeks to reflect this.

Token and app launching soon – With us securing this initial investment we have some developers working on the alpha release of our app within 2-4 weeks.   


Referral Scheme – Referring people is a common marketing strategy for many new businesses as a way of growing users/customers, and as a result, people who do refer get rewarded. We do not require any personal information nor funds from users.

Planting trees – We are still figuring out the logistics of this, but it is a plan we take seriously. Users could potentially VOLUNTEER to have a seed pack sent to them. Of course, they would have to provide an address for this that would not be kept on record once the package is shipped. Every 10 downloads of the app, we would also be looking to plant trees in areas local to our office. (yet to be confirmed but once again something we are looking into)

Charity donation – When the app goes live, each transaction will have a small % donated to charity. In the future, users will be able to decide which charities the funds would go to. We would look to do this via a poll on our socials or through the app. List some charities, and whichever gets the most votes will receive the funds. We would look to cycle through this every month so each month, a new charity can be selected by our users.

Whitepaper and Tokenomics - Over the course of the last 6 weeks the project scope has changed dramatically and consequently we have had to make changes to the whitepaper which will be available to everybody on the new version of our website over the next few weeks. The whitepaper link is no longer functional because of the changes we have had to make. With regard to liquidity and tokenomics we are unable to answer these questions as we are still formulating how this will work. The important thing to note is that Opis Hub will not ask you for any money all we ask is that when our app hits Google Playstore please give it a chance.

A lot of these questions have been well considered and if there are any more questions, we're happy to answer any that show legitimate interest but we're not going to respond to people just jumping on a bandwagon. We can also share the info pack we originally gave Martin should anyone like to read about our company and our aims as this has been mainly answering your questions.

We look forward to reading your feedback, regards Opis Hub.",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,The Case for NTSX and Chill instead of VTSAX and Rest for FIRE,"Previously in my post on Hedgefundie's 55% UPRO 45% TMF portfolio I got a lot of criticism for recommending it's lower leverage cousin NTSX over VTSAX. I decided to write a quick post about this newly issued fund and why I'm recommending an investment in NTSX over VTSAX for FIRE. 

# What is NTSX?
[NTSX is a 1.5x leveraged 60/40 fund investing directly in the S&amp;P 500 and uses intermediate term treasury futures.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/from-60-40-to-90-60%3A-ntsx-on-portfolio-allocation-2021-04-16)

Essentially it is a 90% stock, 60% intermediate term US treasuries leveraged fund. It has performance similar to VTSAX/VOO but with slightly less risk. 

NTSX holds it's 90% stock position fully paid along with 10% of intermediate term US treasuries. It gets the rest of it's treasuries leverage through treasury futures. 

NTSX's duration risk is 7.0 years. 

[Read over NTSX's excellent FAQ as well for more information on this fund.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/wisdomtree_ntsx_faq.pdf)

NTSX re-balances quarterly with additional re-balancing bands at 5%. 

Vanguard banned ALL leveraged ETFs except NTSX. NTSX is the only leveraged ETF you can buy at Vanguard. This is a powerful statement made by Vanguard in terms of Vanguard's views for NTSX's suitability for investors. 

# Backtesting Limitations

Portfolio visualizer's CASHX is 1 month Treasury Bills 1972+. So it is modeling actual interest rates. It is not modeling any additional borrowing costs though so it overstates the final balances a bit. There will be a markup to the 1 month Treasury Bills 1972+ of roughly at least 75 basis points for IBKR or ~35 basis points for institutional borrow rates which these back test results are missing. You will need a pro level subscription if you want to view and model these results by charging an annual fee of 35 basis points to the leveraged portfolio. 

I'll be simulating NTSX's immediate term treasuries with SPY and IEF. Then for earlier back tests VFINX, VFITX, VTSMX.

Treasury futures can also move a bit differently than a treasury bond fund due to [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). You're only trading one bond issue in the futures contract while a bond fund has different issues with different maturities and different duration that the bond fund can pick and choose when to sell. So these back tests may not be as accurate compared to NTSX's actual holdings. 

NTSX's duration risk is 7 years so that is why I'm fine with just using intermediate term US treasuries. 

NTSX also mixes in a small percentage of 3 year US treasury futures which I did not do in these back tests for simplicity. 

NTSX also re-balances quarterly with additional 5% re-balancing bands. Portfolio Visualizer forces me to pick either quarterly re-balancing or percentage based re-balancing bands. There is no way I can combine both of them. This is why I decided to choose monthly re-balancing.

It also goes without saying past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. 

# Is it possible for the strategy to break?

It's written in NTSX's FAQ:         
&gt;Despite its use of accounting leverage, it is not possible for NTSX to incur losses in excess of its principal.

I cover more back tests in just a minute. Also feel free to play around with these links for back test dates and change parameters. I'm not going to spoon feed everyone over every possible period and yes I will be covering 2000 and 2007 start dates. Just hold on a minute. I want you to really think about these initial results first, as people were insanely disappointed with the first back test result. 

# Are you disappointed with these results?

When I look at these results I am very excited. NTSX is getting a bit higher CAGR and less risk than VTSAX. 

However, many people are really disappointed by these results. One person was very disappointed by the very first back test (Sept 2018) and they decided to invest in VTSAX instead. I am very impressed that NTSX is getting a 18.17% CAGR with a lower Stdev of 16.44% vs VTSAX 16.65% CAGR and Stdev of 20.22%! 

Take a few minutes to think about what these above back tests are showing. Are you disappointed in them still?

# What about when we withdraw for retirement?

NTSX is barely winning over VSTAX for growth and safety. They're getting 1% more over VTSAX. However, just getting that extra bit of growth and safety tells a different story. Whenever you analyze portfolios you should look at both contribution portfolios and **withdrawer portfolios.**

Let's jump to a few worst case scenarios. Each scenario is $1 million dollars withdrawing 4% SWR at $3333 a month. 

[Retiring in 2007 - current. $1m withdrawing $3333 a month inflation adjusted withdrawer portfolio.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2007&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000000&amp;annualOperation=2&amp;annualAdjustment=3333&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+NTSX&amp;portfolioName2=VSTAX&amp;portfolioName3=60%2F40+unlevered&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=90&amp;symbol2=IEF&amp;allocation2_1=60&amp;allocation2_3=40&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-50&amp;symbol4=TLT&amp;symbol5=VTSAX&amp;allocation5_2=100&amp;allocation5_3=60)

&gt;VTSMX	$1,000,000 -&gt; $591,390       
&gt;60/40 unlevered  $1,000,000	-&gt; $1,185,771      

For year 2000 $40k a year is now $62k a year after inflation. You're still at 3.6% withdrawals with Simulated NTSX. You're quite safe and comfortable.

You're on a crash course with VTSMX/VTSAX with 10.5% annual withdrawals. Will you make it another 9 years for a 30 year retirement? It might be time to go back to work if you haven't already done so in 2009! 

In 2009 VTSMX had a low point of $328,000. I'd be questioning going back to work in such a situation. 

60/40 unlevered is not sitting well at 5.2% withdrawals. (I wish Portfolio Visualizer had a stock/bond glide path option to explore unlevered strategies better!)

I'm a lot more excited to see an outstanding difference simulated-NTSX makes here! That extra safety and extra return with simulated NTSX is really paying off. 

This is why I recommend that NTSX may be a great investment alternative for someone who desires 100% stock risk. It's possible that you may be able to withdraw at 4% SWR on an investment in retirement on NTSX while with VSTAX you're probably going to be a lot more safe with a 3% SWR.

The extra safety of NTSX for a withdrawing portfolio helps out a lot. If you desire to withdraw on NTSX then you should probably invest directly in NTSX for your taxable account allocation so you don't realize a lot of capital gains in transferring over to NTSX later on. Yes these leveraged ETFs qualify for long term capital gains if held for over a year despite a recent MarketWatch article suggesting otherwise. 

Of course, in tax-advantaged retirement accounts feel free to change investments from growth to more security as that's one greatly overlooked benefit for FIRE - the ability to change your portfolio without incurring substantial capital gains. This is why we max out our tax advantage accounts first! 

After going through this work I've chosen NTSX over VTSAX for my fund to de-risk in from Hedgefundie's Portfolio. 

# TL;DR

NTSX and Chill is an excellent investing strategy for FIRE for those who desire 100% stock risk. You can possibly withdraw 4% SWR safely with NTSX in several cases that would be failures for 4% SWR for VTSAX or possibly the unlevered 60/40 portfolio. You would have to use the recommended 3% SWR with VTSAX or the traditional 60/40 portfolio.

Being able to withdraw at 4% SWR will greatly speed up your FIRE date. If you desire $100k of income you only need $2.5 million on NTSX compared to $3.3 million for a safer 3% SWR on VTSAX. NTSX will grow a bit quicker with a bit less risk, speeding up your FIRE date.

personalfinance,Refinancing First Home (Again),"My wife and I currently live in my first home in the Midwest. We originally bought the house at 4.0% APR in May 2019. One year ago when interest rates were low we refinanced our mortgage, got the interest down to 2.87%. I am a veteran and my mortgage company is constantly bothering me about doing a second refi under the VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) program. They offered a new lower rate of 2.3%. For consideration, as a disabled vet the closing costs are waived. They did mention something about a $1,200 fee unrelated to closing but I don't know exactly what this is for.

My question is, is there any real reason to go through the hassle of another refinance a year later, thus restarting my loan to 30 year fixed all to save $50-$70/month? We plan to live in this home for the next 3-4 years, we do not plan to even get close to paying off the home loan in full. (We don't overpay on our monthly payment).

Being a first time homeowner, I feel like there one or more good reasons people don't refinance all the time, even in my situation with the closing costs/fees mostly waived.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"I configured a crypto trading bot to buy crypto based on Reddit post sentiment from relevant subreddits, it's running right now and just bought me Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced.","I mainly built this for fun, and as a coding challenge, as I'm not sure how viable it would be to base my investing decisions based on the Reddit hive-mind. But having said that, I will test the tool out and see what it can do - who knows, maybe among all the shills and moon-farmers is where insight truly lives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's a little bit about how it works:** 

It's a trading bot that analyses reddit post sentiment and automatically buys the coins mentioned in the post. So it checks if the post title and body talk positively about x coin, and if that's the case it goes ham on that coin.

But it only does this for coins I tell it to look out for: by default it will only check BTC and ETH but you can add any number of keywords. This is built in to discourage shill exploits.

&amp;#x200B;

It also comes with several customisation options so you can choose how you want to use this:

1. Which subreddits it should look for (by default it checks [r/Cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrency/) and a couple others)
2. How to sort posts (hot by default)
3. How many posts from each sub will be analysed (by default 10)
4. What keywords it should be looking out for (default: Bitcoin and Ethereum)
5. &amp;#x200B;

You can also specify how often to check for posts, as well as the size of each trade placed.

I added a test mode so it can just simulate trades, so you can see how it would work in a live market, but without using real funds.

&amp;#x200B;

I just let it run in test mode now and here's the output:

`New posts detected, fetching new posts...`

`Found matching  keywords with the following sentiments: {'BTC': 0.01482083333333333, 'ADA': 0.0}`

`BTC sentiment is positive: 0.01482083333333333, preparing to buy...`

`PLACING TEST ORDER`

`Order created with 0.000439 on BTC`

`Sentiment for ADA is negative or ADA is currently in portfolio`

Here's my test order stored locally so that I can track the results. It bought Bitcoin hah.

`{`

`""BTC"": {`

`""symbol"": ""BTCUSDT"",`

`""price"": ""34170.99000000"",`

`""volume"": 0.000439,`

`""time"": 1624904258.977829`

`}`

`}`

You can also change the pairing to something other than USDT ;)

&amp;#x200B;

And here's an example of how posts are being stored:

`{""title"": ""SafeDollar \u2018stablecoin\u2019 drops to $0 following $248 million DeFi exploit on Polygon"", ""subreddit"": ""Cryptocurrency"", ""body"": """"},`

It has no body as it's a link. Though you can see that it ignored SafeDollar and only picked BTC and ADA as these are two of the keywords I have chosen for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The bot will also stop from buying or analysing posts while the same posts are in top/hot, to avoid re-buying on the same signal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the GitHub repo for the project:

personalfinance,"Very stable situation, do I really need to keep my EF doing nothing?","Hi!

Yes, yet another ""do I need my emergency fund sitting in a HYSA doing nothing""? I've been giving a lot of thought to this lately, and I cannot find any reason for me to keep my EF in a HYSA yielding 0.5% annually.

A bit of context: I have a very stable job in one of the most established tech companies in the world, my performance reviews are good and I don't see myself losing my job anytime soon. My wife recently graduated and will start working in \~1 month, we've always lived comfortably on my salary alone and that will add another significant income source. We don't have any debt except for the credit cards that are always payed in full every month, we basically use them for the points, not because we need the credit. Our car still has 2 years of curb to curb warranty, so no surprise expenses there. Low deductible medical insurances and we're overall in good health. Maxed 401k and decent savings in a brokerage account, where we DCA the leftovers. We're renting and have decent renter's insurance (mandatory here), so no surprises there either. Bottom line is, since I established our emergency fund a couple of years ago, it has been doing nothing in a HYSA, and it's yield has been going down due to the interest rates cuts and it's sitting at 0.5% right now.""

Our current EF is \~6 months of living expenses (we're in a very high CoL area), currently \~2 mo in our checking account for daily use, \~4 months in a HYSA. The point is: wouldn't make more sense for us to move the HYSA part to something that actually yields money, like BND, CMF (we're in california so that would be tax free yield) or similar? Our credit limit is \~2 months of living expenses (we normally use 1/4 of the limit), so we could rely on that if we needed emergency cash and that would give us plenty of time to liquidate the investment if we needed to. I know having an EF is seen like an insurance policy, it costs you money to get peace of mind, but in our case I think the opportunity cost is outweighing the benefits. A 1.5%-2% yield on very stable bond ETFs is something very easy to achieve right now and a 0.5% yield HYSA is losing us money due to inflation.",finance

I would appreciate your viewpoint on a financial question I have regarding if I should convert my IRA to a Roth IRA. My IRA has \~$140K of cash in it (it is not yet invested), and I was wondering if I should convert it into a Roth IRA?

My tax bracket between federal and state is 42% so I think the cost to convert to the Roth is \~$59K ($140K \* 42%) and if it matters, I'm in my early-40s. FWIW, I do have the cash to make the conversion - it is more of a question is if it is worth it to write the check to the government to convert.

I would appreciate your perspective, as I've heard positive and negatives about converting and not converting it and I am unsure what to do.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed’s outlook that interest rates won’t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. 

Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

personalfinance,This sounds crazy… but are we approaching a time where it’s more financially sensible to buy a brand new car?,"I honestly never thought this would be a realistic question to ask, but due to lack of inventory (mainly attributed to COVID), used car prices have absolutely skyrocketed. YoY used car price have increased approximately 30%. Some 5 year old SUVs and trucks are selling for a essentially what they sold for brand new. On the contrary, new cars prices have only increased 7% YoY, tracking fairly closely with inflation. 

Now, the suggestion for years and years has been to buy a car that is 3-5 years old as most of the depreciation has already happened. But, a big downfall is there is typically no factory warranty by this point in the cars life. If you buy a brand new car today you are getting a warranty of at least 3 years, typically more, and you are getting the option to finance at near 0% because of how low interest rates are. 

Now, I am VERY debt adverse. We haven’t had a car payment is 5+ years and don’t have any consumer debt. But, we are in desperate need for a new car and the more we shop, it seems to be a much better option to go new as opposed to used even if we end up financing for a few years and paying it off early. Am I crazy?",finance

personalfinance,First time home buying help needed,"My wife and I are in a strange position where our landlord for the house we are renting is planning to sell the house at the end of our lease (ending in august 2021). They have given us the opportunity to have first dibs on the house. It is a nice place and it is about the best we can get for the price in the area (Troy, MI). The current asking price is at 175k to 180k, it is not on the market, and we are going to forgo a realtor in hopes to talk down the price by removing the commission cost. We have a title company in mind that our credit union suggested. The house is a condo, and is quite nice compared to other options in the area that do have land included. The HOA is certified for use of an FHA loan according to a HUD registry.

We have a combined gross income of 140k (both mechanical engineers). We both have 700+ credit scores, so we aren't have an issue finding a lender, it is mostly an issue with finding a lower interest rate. We both started new jobs in the past year, my wife got hers in October 2020, and I am only 1 month in, which results in not a whole lot of savings. It should be noted that we are both 25, and my wife just graduated, I have been a Mechanical Engineer for a couple years at a small company with much lower pay and supporting both of us, so we were still unable to have a lot of savings.

Due to the unexpected nature of the transaction, we do not have the ability to make the down payment but we are receiving a gift from a family member to help with that and closing costs.

We first went to our credit union, which gave us 3.75% interest rate. The closing costs including 3% down was about $13,000.

We applied at Wells Fargo which gave a rate of 3.5% (and APR of 4.022% which I don't understand the difference really, nobody else uses that.) The closing costs with down payment were $12,866. Which seemed like a good option for the same level of closing cost.

Then comes Quicken loans who is offering a rate of 3.625% and a closing cost of 8900 including the down payment. They are going the route of an FHA loan which we had thought we were ineligible for with our level of income. We like the lower closing costs, and we may be able to get them to match Wells Fargo for interest rate, they are being quite pushy about getting our business. They are saying we need to sign today because they only work with us if we are in a contract. We were not ready for taking on any of this yet, but they want $500 for the contract fee which goes towards closing costs as well.

We really need some insight on if Quicken loans is worth going with, or should we avoid them. I keep seeing some stories about them that are a bit concerning, but the out of pocket cost is really hard to beat. The only issue is that they are going to call back at 8pm est. to take the payment/set it up.

CryptoCurrency,Algorand and USDC featured in Boston Globe article about stablecoins,"While high-flying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin capture all the glory, a little-known version of digital money pioneered by Boston-based Circle Internet Financial Ltd. could turn out to be just as important.

Circle’s digital currency, called US Dollar Coin or USDC, is a “stablecoin.” The clue to its value is its name: One Circle Dollar Coin will always be worth one US dollar, unlike bitcoin, which can swing in value by thousands of dollars in just a few hours.

That may make bitcoin exciting to follow, but it’s pretty unreliable as a vehicle to transfer money and conduct other financial transactions. Circle, which runs a technology platform for digital currency transactions, is betting the ironclad certainty of its value will help establish USDC as a universal medium of exchange, a vital part of the planet’s financial infrastructure.

Bitcoin speculators can instantly shift their holdings to USDC as a hedge against falling prices. Companies can use the dollar coin to move money seamlessly across national borders. Even credit card giant Visa lets businesses use USDC instead of dollars to settle their accounts.

“Circle is to payments on the Internet what a company like Intel is to computer processing,” argued Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer.

Disparte said that demand for its digital coin has increased 500 percent since January. And a band of investors led by Boston’s Fidelity Management recently invested $440 million in Circle. That’s the biggest single funding round ever for a Boston tech company, according to the National Venture Capital Association, surpassing the $400 million raised by restaurant software company Toast in February 2020 and the $320 million raised by e-commerce software company Klaviyo in May 2021.

The dollar coin isn’t a full-fledged “cryptocurrency.” Like bitcoin, it resides on a blockchain — an encrypted database running on thousands of computers worldwide. Blockchain transactions don’t have to pass through banks, so money can change hands at minimum cost and maximum speed.

But with a traditional cryptocurrency like bitcoin, the money is actually created by the network of computers that manage the blockchain. Creating more currency and recording bitcoin transactions require tremendous processing power and eat up staggering amounts of electricity. It can take 20 minutes to complete a bitcoin transaction, and cost around $60

By comparison, Dollar Coin is dead simple and much better for the environment: A customer gives Circle $1,000 in US currency and receives an account on the blockchain containing $1,000 in USDC. The cash is stashed at a traditional bank. Every month, global accounting firm Grant Thornton publishes an audit of Circle’s holdings, to confirm that the company has enough US dollars to redeem all outstanding USDCs.

Circle creates as much digital money as its customers need, then takes it out of circulation whenever it’s converted to traditional dollars or some other currency. The electric bill for each transaction is negligible.

USDC can trade on a variety of different blockchains, not just the one used for bitcoin. One is Algorand, a Boston-based company founded by Silvio Micali, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Algorand’s blockchain takes just seconds to process a transaction, and at much lower cost — a fraction of a cent, no matter how big the transaction.

Moving traditional currency involves lots of middlemen charging lots of fees, especially if the money is moving across national borders. But with USDC, a company can move $1 million from here to Tokyo in seconds with no banks involved, and at almost no cost.

For now, Circle serves corporate users and cryptocurrency investors, who can stash their earnings in USDC as a hedge against falling bitcoin prices. But the same system could someday provide immigrants with a cheap way to send money to family members abroad. The World Bank estimates that on average it costs about $13 to move $200 between countries. With USDC, the same transaction might cost just a few cents.

Circle plans to make its profits through an endless stream of minimal transaction fees, as well as investing the money the company keeps on deposit to back its dollar coin.

USDC faces competition from the most popular stablecoin, Tether, which is also linked to the US dollar. There’s about $65 billion worth of Tether in worldwide circulation.

But in February, Tether and the digital currency exchange that backs it were hit with an $18.5 million fine by New York Attorney General Letitia James and a ban on trading the currency in New York State. James alleged that Tether concealed $850 million in losses and added, “Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by US dollars at all times was a lie.”

Tether’s woes have been like rocket fuel for Circle’s US Dollar Coin. The company has $25 billion of it in circulation, compared to just $4 billion in January. Another growth driver, said Disparte, was the recent decision by Visa to support USDC transactions. This means that digital currency investors can use their USDC holdings to pay their Visa bills, without first converting it to US dollars.

Governments worldwide are interested in issuing their own versions of stablecoin, typically called a central bank digital currency. China has begun international tests of its digital version and the US Federal Reserve Bank is also studying the creation of an official digital dollar. Fed chairman Jerome Powell warns that the central bank will move cautiously.

I recently finished school and secured a job making 85k. I live fairly frugally, so I have about 2500+/month left over after my expenses are taken care of. In fact, I am looking into part time work which should bring me an extra 1k after tax each month, so might have that money to factor in as well. 6 month emergency fund is overly funded in HYSA and I bonds.

I do have a little under 100k in student loans that are all federal and deferred until October 1st at which point interest begins accruing again, so I could be putting it toward a savings account for that (haven't made any payments yet). For some reason, I just feel like saving at 0.40% is not the most optimal way to manage that money. I don't have access to a 401k at my work, not HSA eligible, and I've already maxxed out my Roth IRA, so my only available option is a taxable brokerage account.

I'm also very interested in getting into real estate very soon (in 2022) and have thought about saving a down payment over the next 6 months for a small rental and repairs. I have a fair bit of experience in purchasing and managing rentals for a family member, so this isn't completely new to me.

Should I just focus on saving all of it and paying my loans down as fast as possible? Or is it worth putting some into a taxable brokerage account?

The answer may be obvious, but any guidance or big picture advice would be really useful.",finance

I realize that neither interest rate is very good, but it's better than zero. Anyway, if you were in my shoes, would you just close down all the new accounts and pretend it never happened?

CryptoMarkets,DeFi is poised to EXPLODE in 2022 as FedCoin bucks with Uncertainty.,"DeFi is poised to EXPLODE in 2022 as FedCoin bucks with Uncertainty. 

Disclaimer: Everything within this post is derived from private and unofficial resources. This is not advice of any kind. This article is being written for entertainment purposes only. 

What is FedCoin and what place will it have in parallel to Safemoon over the next decade? To understand what FedCoin could become, let's have a look at the dollar and compare that to modern crypto currency. 

We are taught that the value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government. I will make it a little more clear to those, like me who are not economists: Fiat is backed by debt! That's right. Debt. 

It's almost as simple as this: Debt is facilitated by the Fed and issued by banks into corporate ownership in the form of bonds, which generate a return to its owners based on interest/time as those bonds (debt) are held through the maturity of loaned debt. Fiat uses debt to back it and by the corporations, holding that debt, the bank says, ""If you hold this debt, we can continue to print money and inject it into the economy. At the end of bonds ""term,"" we will pay you back whatever the purchase price at auction plus interest."" Money is a construct. Nothing more and nothing less. 

We know what a dollar is.. What is a deflationary asset? Deflationary crypto assets (Safemoon, for example) return reflections to their holders by taxing a portion of the amount transacted. A portion is returned to its liquidity pool, which stabilizes its price as it grows. In some cases, the other portion is permanently BURNED, decreasing its circulating supply, which drives price action upward. 

In contrast, the fiat dollar is inflationary* and loses value over time. DeFi crypto assets like Safemoon are deflationary*. 

As stated above, 1st world model governments employ debt to back fiat currency. Due to this, it's only natural that the cost of goods and services INCREASES over time with healthy consume spending. Thus, the power of the dollar Decreases over time. 

So we have to ask, What would FedCoin implement to leverage an advantage over a people's crypto currency? It would no longer be fiat if it were crypto, right? So, exactly how would FedCoin work next to other countries still using fiat if the expectation is to completely remove the USD. 

The short answer: FedCoin wouldn't work in most 1st world countries using the traditional model without some really savvy innovation. Here's why I believe it would be next to impossible to switch from a debt backed dollar to Federal/State-run crypto in 1st world countries: 

Federal backed crypto currency would take a cooperative effort between central banks, controllers, regulating bodies, etc.., who are currently competing across regions for domain. This, in itself could be problematic as crypto operations across multiple networks require transparency.. The logistics alone, especially ones over borders, great respect For and to security, does not really fit within 1st world's framework.. Each region/country has its own agenda. What we realize is the same currency, a mere digital representation of fiat; one now on a blockchain that only loses value due to inflation due to being tied to an inflating economy. 

So, how would FedCoin operate a crypto currency compelling enough for multiple countries to adopt it over a deflationary assets? 

Could FedCoin provide greater accessibility and use case to countries in need of our help such as The Gambia?  

Would FedCoin seek to help lean economies where banking infrastructure is broken or non existent? 

What do you think FedCoin would look like? 

This is a very exciting time in cryptocurrency, especially DeFi. Among so many advantages, we can be transparent and operate across borders. Blockchains can be immutable where people cannot. Would FedCoin seek to minimize risk and the need for arbitration? 

With DeFi, solutions can be customized to meet the needs of people without political repercussion. Ownership of assets and their transactions can operate with little to zero public oversight on ledgers; and ownership is NOT limited to any region or class. Remember, money doesn't corrupt people. It's people who corrupt money. 

We want access to alternative cryptocurrencies that are for everyone across multiple domains; NOT JUST SAFEMOON.. We want all crypto to succeed as long as they are solving problems and perpetuating growth.. 

With bridges releasing on June 29, our own blockchain and exchange releasing in Q4, we will drive great demand to crypto, continue to onboard new holders, introduce holders into our ecosystem with community support as well as additional resources and utilities such as the safemoon wallet to encourage safe and secure trading of multiple currencies across several platforms. The Gambia is our proving ground! 

We are the evolution.



If you find this post insightful, I would ask that you share it with a neighbor, friend or colleague (as a tool) to open a discussion about how Safemoon can benefit individuals, young and old, rich and poor all over the world. This is huge. Get the word out. People need to know ! 

I am accepting donations and contributions towards my selfish interest as well as charity are appreciated, no matter how small. 

I want Safemoon to succeed so we can help those who are also less fortunate. Donating helps support the cause and allows me to continue writing these articles, educate others and do some good for our planet. When Safemoon reaches $1, I will allocate 50% of the wallet below to philanthropic work, with a focus on creating shelter and supporting infrastructure build outs to increase accessibility to clean water, both domestic and abroad (We love you Africa!) and helping to save our planet by removing plastics from our oceans using equipment to remove plastics. 

(Did you know that more than 50% of Earth's oxygen comes from oceanic plant life?) 

Let's continue to be a positive force and make a difference!

personalfinance,How important should owning a house be to me?,"Hey guys, here's a breakdown of my personal finances. 

Salary: 120k/year

Stock option grants: 15k/year

Bonus: Up to 10%/year

401k match: 2.5%

So I'm currently maxing out my Roth IRA and contributing 10% to my 401k. There's also an employee stock purchase benefit where I can purchase up to 10% of my income in shares at a 15% discount in 6 month increments (after tax/no tax benefit). I currently have that at the full 10%. I will probably change it to be lower than 5% after this first 6 month buy in period. I'm also investing \~$1000 a month in other non taxed advantage investment accounts. So after all the above and with my bills taken care of I have \~$1000 leftover to put into savings each month. 

So here's my question: I'd like to buy a house but I live in a city that has had a very hot real estate market for the past ten years. Buying a house 5 to 10 miles within the city cost a lot. I have \~45k cash saved up for a down payment (and a totally separate 8k emergency fund so I won't spend all my savings). Seems like any house that catches my interest though will result in around a 2k to 3k mortgage even with a good interest rate. I currently pay $550 in rent. So I was hoping to find something in the 1.5k range and comfortably afford it without renting out rooms or having to reduce my other investments. 

My current living situation is pretty temporary. So I need to decide if I'm going to purchase a house or rent somewhere in the next 3 to 6 months. I'm estimating rent would be around $1.5k. And that is painful to throw that away each month. 

Should I just accept the 2 to 3k mortgage at the cost of reducing the amount I'd be putting in my retirement and investment accounts? Did anyone put off buying a house to keep pumping your retirement account up and regret it? Did anyone buy a house and all of a sudden wish they didn't take the extra cost on within 5 years? What other factors am I not considering?

I.e.- personnel management, training, accountability, interpersonal, communication, task prioritization, time management, etc.

That being said, today I saw where a local bank branch that just built a big, new building right in the middle of town is trying to hire a Branch Manager. This is just a summary of the job requirements:  

High school diploma or equivalent, 5 years banking experience preferred *OR* 3 years management/supervisory experience, proficient with Microsoft Office, ability to learn new software quickly, and a few other basic competencies one would need in an office setting. Salary is ""From $45,000 a year"". Which I understand means that's just a baseline pay rate that would go up from there, most likely based on experience and performance if hired. 

Is it just me, or does  the beginning pay seem a low and the requirements seem a bit... low bar... for a job managing a branch of a federally backed financial institution? Am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt or keep it on a credit card?,"I have $6,000 worth of debt on a credit card. I originally took it out to help survive during a summer program I needed to take and it just got out of control from there. I get paid roughly $700 biweekly. My rent is $700 and so I've been surviving on about $700 for food and gas. My fiance recently got temporary custody of his 13 year old and I've taken on more expenses.

A family friend passed away and left me with $2,500 that I'm going through the motions of obtaining. I intend to put at least $2,000 of this on the debt. 

The interest rate on the credit card is 14.99%. I've never missed a payment. 

I spoke to a banker who thinks it's a good idea to consolidate this debt into a personal loan. He said with good credit the monthly payments would be roughly $130 or so and I'd have about 5 years to pay it off. 

Should I consolidate or keep it on the credit card to pay it off?",finance

Stakehound and Fireblocks lost of ETH keys, went into 38,178 ETH probably inaccessible forever ($80 million aprox)

SharedStake token fell down more than 90% because of a rug, and people wondering if their 16,000 ETH are safe, this will be known once ETH 2.0 is released i guess... ($32 million)

Someone stole from StableMagnet 3Pool on BSC $27 millions and maybe it could be more.

Eleven Finance on BSC and Polygon $4.5 million

Alchemix near $6 million (lot of founds have been returned thanks to the users who took advantage of the bug the first place)

Iron Finance in Polygon, i think the number its still not known but for sure its also a lot of millions.

SafeDollar also in Polygon, 250k not much compared the other ones, but its still a big number, for some people even a $10-100 investment is a lot.

Yes, this has been only June month and i think im missing some other rugs.... Its a LOT of money, a lot of regular peoples money!! Even taking out Africrypt one, all the rest combined are more than $100million lost.

personalfinance,How necessary is an emergency fund if I have access to quick funds via 401k and brokerage account with an almost 20 year stable job?,"Even if the market crashed I'd still have quick access to 5 figures. Currently I could take a loan on my 401k for up to 50% as well as liquidate my current brokerage portfolio. Within a week I could have $75,000 sitting in my checking account with a 5 figure sum still in my 401k. Within a day I could access $40k. All of this is currently in the market. 

I have another 5 figures currently in cash and have a solid and stable job with a company that does well and even thrives during recession/ depression periods. 

Would it suck to be forced to liquidate stocks operating at a loss if an emergency popped up? Absolutely. Yet I feel as though my current cash emergency fund would be far better off in the market than just sitting in cash, especially with the ability to access fast cash within a day. 

My 401k allows a 50% interest free loan that can be paid back in full at anytime. Do you think, given these circumstances, an all cash emergency fund is necessary rather than allowing it to compound in the market at a solid interest rate?

stocks,Gold Miners With Potential,"BASICS

This is a gamble, but I think it has limited downside and significant upside potential. I have taken some small positions to leverage a potential rise in gold prices over the next 6 months.

$GOLD and $KGC are both fundamentally sound, well established companies. In terms of P/E valuation they are both trading at moderate discounts - $GOLD about 25% &amp; $KGC about 40%, compared to industry average. Both of these companies trend with, but do not directly track, the price of gold. The gap in P/E valuation should close, especially if gold prices get back close to $2000/oz.

In addition to the Fed tanking gold prices after their meeting, at about the same time $KGC reported a fire at their Tasiast project mine in Mauritania. They have since provided a mostly positive assessment of the damage, and mining operations have resumed. They did however revise the 2021 projected output for the mine down to 2.1m oz. from 2.4m oz.

Gold took a decent hit after the Fed meeting. Prices dropped from about $1900/oz to about $1750/oz in a week. As a result, share prices for $GOLD &amp; $KGC have taken a hit. Before the Fed meeting $GOLD was trading at the $23-$24+ level. $GOLD closed @ $20.89 on 25 June. $KGC was trading around $8.00 before the Fed meeting and the fire, closed @ $6.38 on 25 June. Here are some price points for comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price peak 6 Aug 2020 - $2071.05
* $GOLD 18 Aug 2020 - $31.22
* $KGC 19 Sep 2020 - $10.31

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $1859.45
* $GOLD before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $23.15
* $KGC before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $7.76

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold close 25 Jun 2021 - $1781.70
* $GOLD close 25 Jun 2021 - $20.89
* $KGC close 25 Jun 2021 - $6.38

FUTURE PRICE FACTORS

Predicting the price of gold is tricky, and frankly there are many factors which are beyond my level of understanding. My thinking is this: Inflation is real, significant and not transitory. As the US and other economies continue reopening, and inflation begins to squeeze the budgets of more and more working people, regardless of what the statistics say, it is going to become more commonly reported in the news. The result will be that retail goldbugs will put persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, even if central banks try to mitigate the rise. I also expect commodities in general to recover and rise through the rest of 2021. Gold is a unique commodity, but commodity price increases should apply upward pressure on gold as well. I don’t predict the price to spike to new ATH’s (although it could), but I do expect the price to be back to $1900 level or higher by EOY.

On the downside, I really don’t see gold prices falling significantly from here. For that to happen I think you would need to see a roaring US economy with moderately and steadily rising interest rates, significantly tightening money supply, very moderate inflation, and a profoundly strong dollar. That seems like a black swan from where we are now.

$GOLD and $KGC have floats of 1.8B and 1.3B shares respectively, so they can't be pushed around for very long. While high volume can have an impact on price short-term, because the earnings and values of these companies are so closely tied to the price of gold, longs won't be able to hold the price artificially high, and shorts won't be able to hold the price artificially low for an extended period.

CURRENT POSITIONS:

&amp;#x200B;

* 100 shares $GOLD
* 300 shares $KGC
* 20 x $GOLD 20220122 $25C
* 40 x $KGC 20220122 $10C

$KGC options are a bit more speculative than $GOLD, but both are cheap right now, with low to moderate IV, and decent theta. Both chains have good liquidity.

BOTTOM LINE

If you think the price of gold will be going up through the rest of the year, $GOLD and $KGC are both cheap buys now. If you think the price of gold is going up but aren’t sure it will be before the end of the year, buy shares and skip the options. Owning these companies should provide gains much better than owning actual gold or gold ETF’s. Based on previous price points, if gold rises 6.6% to $1900, I expect $GOLD up conservatively 15% to $24.00, and $KGC about 25% to $8.00. Those are conservative estimates. The Marketbeat analyst consensus PT for $GOLD is $33.25 and for $KGC it is $10.54. Overall, I'm looking for a 2-3 bagger on this play. Will reevaluate at the end of the summer, unless there is a big move before then.

Like I said, my understanding of gold market dynamics is pretty rudimentary. Happy to hear criticism and contrary opinions.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Secure your accounts, secure your investments","Hey guys,

I'm going to leave this post up for a couple of days and afterwards I am going to delete it. Take notes. (EDIT: The reason why I want to delete this after a few days is to protect my own security habits. At some commenters' request I will leave it up for longer than a couple of days. Perhaps a couple of weeks then. Do know that this will be deleted eventually. Do not save this post, copy and paste it to your own notes.) 

So a lot of you are losing money by using poor cybersecurity practices. Most of my friends and people online say I'm a bit overkill and paranoid. I think everyone should be overkill and paranoid about their online security. Cybersecurity isn't ""for the nerds"" anymore. A lot of companies, governments and black hats are after your stuff for one reason or another and you need to wise up. ""but i don't have anything to hide..."" &lt;- Zip it! Your computer and your phone hold more info than your closest friends. Believe me, you do have something to hide. That information can and will be used against you by anyone who can get to it.

I decided to write a quick post giving you a layman's introduction to protecting your stuff and where you can further educate yourself. Without further ado, here's the paranoia guide to internet privacy and security, volume I:

Passwords: 

Passwords are the keys to your stuff. You should never reuse passwords. You should only have one password, that is, the password of your password manager. That's it. Password managers are encrypted databases that hold your passwords and usernames, plus some extra notes if you wish. You use them by copying and pasting the info from the database to your login forms. They have specific security features for this purpose, therefore they're the right tool for this job (for instance, they clear your clipboard 15 seconds after you copied your login/password to prevent clipboard leak).

You program your manager to create as complex of a password as you want, but I find that 15 characters long with numbers and special characters in the mix are the best, as in case you need to use an external computer, you don't wanna be spending too much time typing in a password manually.

There are two types, offline and online. I prefer offline because I'm paranoid. Whatever is not in the cloud or accessible online is safer. If someone manages to hijack your browser or phish you, they may get access to your online manager. If someone manages to hack your account, they may get access to your online manager. Most people that use an online manager are fine. They have good programmers taking care of security. Still...

My recommendations are: For online Bitwarden. It's open source and endorsed by the best cybersecurity nerds here on reddit. For offline, Keepass. Works with windows, you can put it in a flash drive and also works with android. Do put it in a dedicated flashdrive or two, because if your computer breaks, there goes all your passwords.

""But wasn't Keepass hacked?"" &lt;- No. The machine where they hacked keypass, using a program called keyfarse, was compromised. That brings me to:

Machine security:

A lot of you use windows. Linux is much safer, but also can be a PITA to use sometimes. If you're gonna use windows (which I also do), make sure to use an antivirus and run regular scans (at least once a month). Which ones? Avast, karspersky, bitdefender, eset are the most recommended ones. Pair it up with malware bytes for a beefed up malware defense as well. ccleaner is great to tune up your machine, but I also use it to remove start up programs easily, in order to kill bloatware or infection vectors.

**However** like my cybersecurity teacher once told me, an antivirus is something that will protect you after you already messed up. It's a cure, not a defense. Someone has to get infected in order for the programmers to create a defense for it. So your true line of defense are your internet habits. Make sure your machine is updated. A lot of security holes are constantly being patched around the clock and delivered to you via updates. Updating is a slog, but it is important. 

Also, a lot of infection vectors come from pirated software and games. DYOR on the best piracy practices here on reddit (I shall say no more, nor link any more websites because I know some mods are touchy with it).

Browser:

A lot of people use chrome. Some people are into brave. I personally recommend Firefox. Firefox is the tried and true staple of anonymity and cyber security. It might not give you tokens, but hey it's pretty good at what it does. The default firefox is pretty good, but using extensions makes it perfect. Go into security settings, set up Do not track, HTTPS everywhere and jack up browser security to strict. Disable autofill, disable save passwords and logins (that's what the manager's for). I use the same on my android phone. For your phone you'll have to copy your keepass database manually using a cable every time you update it.  PROTIP: You can save your address/cc card as a login info for easy form filling. You can also save your cc card expiration date and emergency numbers too, in case your card gets stolen you can cancel it quickly.

Extensions:

I recommend you install ublock origin (I know, I know, support websites. However, ads are a massive vector of malware. You can always unblock your favorite sites), privacy badger, privacy possum (anti trackers), multiaccount containers and descentraleyes. On android there's no option for HTTPS everywhere, so you should use the extension HTTPS everywhere. Every extension has an explanation page, but if you wanna know more, I can give you the quick version. Just ask.

If you're good with computers, noscript and cleanlinks are good choices. The reason I say ""if you're good with computers"" is because these two extensions will break everything. Malware runs on scripts and trackers track you on tracking links, but so do normal website operations.

2FA:

**Do not use sms 2FA**. Several people have come here and to other cybersecurity subreddits because they were hacked this way. Your sim card can be cloned and someone else can get the same sms as you. In a pinch, you can use google authenticator, but what you should actually be using is yubikeys. Yubikeys are 2FA devices that will unlock your account via USB or via NFC. They're great, unhackable (so far), portable, offline, safe and only cost 50 bucks. Have more than one, because if your single yubikey breaks, then you have another.  Yes, you can attach more than one key to your account. They work with most of the popular services (google, microsoft, amazon, facebook, instagram, etc...) and, best of all, they work with keepass.

E-mail:

Have a secret e-mail that no one knows about and use it as a recovery e-mail in case all else fails. I personally use protonmail for my secret recovery e-mail. It also gets the e-mails in case my main e-mails gets an unauthorized access.

Likewise have a crap e-mail that you give to everyone who gatekeeps you from accessing what you want in exchange for an e-mail. I check that one once per give away, to confirm the link they send me. You can set up filters to forward the stuff you need easily.

Never click on links on your e-mail. Got an e-mail from Netflix? Manually use your browser to get to Netflix.

Reduce social engineering sources:

I don't know how you feel about social media, however I hacked my first account at 13 using info I got from social media of a friend. How did I do that? Well his security question was ""what color is my house"" and his profile pic was in front of his house. I didn't mess (too much) with his account, but it shows how easy it is to gather info from your social media and use it against you. Be careful with what you put on social media. Another way I can easily steal your info is if you use my computer and I change the save login and password settings to save yours. *Check the browser you are using and make sure your info isn't being stolen*. Nevertheless a keylogger can be running in the background, so better yet, do not put your credentials in a computer that you yourself aren't managing. Do not open, under any circumstances, your keepass database in a computer that you aren't managing. Also be aware of running your mouth on social media, particularly on reddit. Your post history is not private. You only need so many crumbs to pull off social engineering hacks. Loose lips sink ships!

Crypto:

Ok now onto crypto. As you are well aware, the best crypto storage device is a hardware wallet, like a Ledger or a Trezor. Do use a passphrase. As for your security key, keep it in a steel wallet. They are impervious to fires, floods and kind of secure but also super obvious to who's in crypto. If you're a digital nomad and you're roaming around, perhaps writing it in somewhere clever, say, a book, might be better to get through airport security. If you wanna store your mnemonic extra securely, I recommend several steel wallets and using Shamir's secret sharing technique using slip-0039. In short, it allows you to spread your seed over, say, 3 cards and you need all 3 to reset your hardware wallet. That means you can entrust those cards to someone (responsible, so they don't lose it) and they can't do anything with it. Or you can have 5 cards and need 3 out of 5 to get to your mnemonic. DYOR about SSS using Slip-0039.

What you should not do is invent your own cryptographic scheme (unless you're some sort of cryptographic genius) because you will create something that's less secure than what's out there, easier to crack and, worse even, you might forget what was your scheme.

VPN:

Tom Scott published a video saying VPNs were less useful than you might think and mocking adverts of VPNs. I recommend you watch it on Youtube for impartiality's sake. I honestly don't agree with it. I mean, he has many good points, browser security is pretty good nowadays and VPNs can be redundant. However, governments can still know which websites you're visiting and can keep you from accessing certain websites you want to access. Corporations will also have a harder time pinning you down with a VPN. I recommend a VPN. Personally i use wevpn, because it's super cheap. It costs money, but it removes internet gatekeepers and gives you that extra privacy bump. Do remember to rotate servers to try and mitigate the risk of landing on a compromised VPN server.

There's so much more that I'd love to tell you but it's getting pretty long. I didn't cover cloud services and hard drive encryption. Some other time perhaps.

11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

30. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
37. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

46. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

97. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)

99. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
100. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

103. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
104. The June Cardano 360 was yesterday. It is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
105. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
106. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
107. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
108. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
109. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
110. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself. [https://twitter.com/Madror7/status/1408505144984051716](https://twitter.com/Madror7/status/1408505144984051716) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407761823143645189](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407761823143645189) [https://twitter.com/MeiTrades/status/1408117430656905219](https://twitter.com/MeiTrades/status/1408117430656905219) [https://sharedstake.medium.com/the-sharedstake-story-by-kairos-44d37aa7837a](https://sharedstake.medium.com/the-sharedstake-story-by-kairos-44d37aa7837a)
111. Here’s another great Cardano data site. This one is from the Cardano Fans stakepool. [https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC)
112. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1408978882129272832](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1408978882129272832)
113. Here’s a great new interview with the CEO of World Mobile from Cardano Chats. [https://youtu.be/w0Z2RP6a9HE](https://youtu.be/w0Z2RP6a9HE)
114. New article from the Cardano Foundation on Governance. [https://forum.cardano.org/t/blockchain-governance-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/65493](https://forum.cardano.org/t/blockchain-governance-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/65493)

personalfinance,Should I borrow money to pay down mortgage in advance?,"I recently saw a post here where someone mentioned that contributing additional payment towards your mortgage early on is more effective than doing it later. I didn’t realize it had any impact on things. 

My parents refinanced their home recently because of the low rates, and I just bought my first home. My parents offered to let me borrow 10k as long as I pay them back plus the ~2% interest rate that they would pay on the home equity loan. The nice thing is I can pay them back at my own pace and it wouldn’t show up as a loan on any credit checks. 

I originally didn’t see the need to borrow and owe additional money if I didn’t need it, but now I’m wondering if its worthwhile for me to take the money and contribute it as a lump sum to my mortgage payments? My rate was 3% flat and I only put down 10% as a down payment. 

Alternatively, I could take the money and put it into my investment account in some index funds. Typical YOY growth would ideally be greater than the 2% I’d owe on the money.",finance

personalfinance,Starting My First Job and I Need Help With the 'Extra Withholding' Section of Federal W4 Form,"I don't want to ask my parents for advice because I'm trying to keep as much distance between us financially as possible. This is my first job. I'm 25, single, and I live on my own. The job is full-time between July and September 2021, and it pays $12.09 per hour. I also have federal student loans and some private loans. 

I have no idea what amount to put under 'extra withholding.' I tried looking it up and using one of those online calculators but it was extremely confusing and a lot of the information didn't apply to me. Does anyone have some advice about what amount I should put? I'm new to all of this tax stuff. I really need to get this form filled out and submitted before my occupational health appointment in a few days.  Any help is appreciated!",finance

dogecoin,We should collectively try to keep crypto free of influence from big organizations,"The main point behind any crypto is that it does not need the support (manipulation) of any organization out there. Not the fed reserve, no sec, no broker nothing. 

Lets try to keep it that way. What I mean by that is at some point all these corporate interests will try to move in on this and dig in with with their claws. There will crypto back options, derivatives, ETFs on and on. I know that having such derivates for crypto will improve its adoption but it defeats the purpose of what crypto is all about, that is works without the involvement of any of these organizations. And more often than not all the derivates are basically just a way to manipulate the underlying security. 

Look at the example of stocks. Stocks by themselves are pretty straight forward, they give people a way to become a greater part of the companies they believe in and in turns share in the economic prosperity of the business by becoming a part owner of the business. Then we have options the sole purpose of whom is speculating and betting on the price of the stock and realistically speaking has no connection to the actual value of the underlying  business. Its purely a tool of manipulation of the price of stock. If such things start to happen to crypto then they are doomed to repeat the hell of the stock market today.

what that means that in future if there are crypto backed options, futures, derivates and even ETFs we should not buy into that cuz that's just the rich trying to manipulate the crypto for themselves",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Contribute to 401k with no employer match or focus on paying down large debt?,"I am a 29 year old female with about $100k in debt. \~$80 is public student loans from grad/undergrad and \~$20 is personal loans and credit card debt. I just started a job making $68k, and am determined to be debt free by 35. I've learned a lot about personal finance over the past year and a half, and have put together a pretty comprehensive plan on how to tackle it. However, I'm not sure how to go about my 401k.

My new employer offers a 401K but does not match it. Ideally, I would like to contribute because it pre-taxed and I feel like I'm a little behind in terms of retirement savings. I do have just under $10k in a 403b from a previous employer than I plan on rolling into a Roth IRA.

I wanted to contribute 8% which would be about $209 pretax ($175 out of my take-home, biweekly). I'm thinking of maybe dropping that to 4-5% ($105 pretax/$88 from take home &amp; $131 pretax/$110 from take home respectively) so I'm still putting some aside, but have a little more per paycheck to put towards debt. I am also considering not contributing at all right now and putting everything towards debt.

After this next month, my actual credit card debt should be gone. I'm on a payment plan for my personal loans (I'm deferring on federal student loans at the moment), but opened a high yield savings account to ""bucket"" about $2k/month to make larger debt payments over time. I want the $20k debt to be paid off by June 2022, which I think is doable.

I would love to hear opinions either way. Let me know if I can give any other info. Thanks in advance!",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Banks could face major disruption from public digital currencies, according to former governor of Bank of Canada and Bank of England","Article:

&gt;Commercial banks could face a period of disruption and heightened competition as digital currencies upend payment systems and undermine existing models for bank funding, Mark Carney told a group of leading central bankers on Monday.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Dozens of monetary authorities around the world are contemplating launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), largely in response to the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and private digital currencies backed by large technology companies, such as Facebook Inc.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England argued in favour of CBDCs in a speech to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). But he cautioned that public forms of digital cash, if they are introduced, could alter the structure of the banking system and negatively affect incumbent banks and financial services companies.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“Banks are a means to an end, not ends in themselves, and they will have to adapt to a much more competitive environment,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At this point, the discussion is still largely theoretical. The Bahamas is the only country to have launched a CBDC, although several others, notably China, are running pilot projects. In Canada, the central bank says a “digital loonie” is not necessary yet, but it has accelerated its research into public digital cash.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;[Central banks’ battle against private entities to control cryptocurrencies has officially begun](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-central-banks-battle-against-private-entities-to-control/)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Carney, however, said major changes to the money system are imminent: “The old normal of cash, bank-based finance and bank payments rails is crumbling,” he said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;He urged central bankers to act quickly to prevent the “Uberisation of money” – a situation where powerful technology firms use their existing digital networks to establish monopolies in digital payments markets.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“We should be wary of path dependence and locking in existing advantages of tech companies via the payments system. There are powerful network effects in both social networks and money. If combined, these could be mutually reinforcing,” he said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;While some central bankers are warming up to the idea of CBDCs, monetary authorities should not underestimate the impact they might have on existing banking systems.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Banks have historically relied on customer deposits to make loans, putting bank deposits at the heart of an economy’s credit creation process. The concern is if individuals keep their savings in an account at the central bank through CBDCs, commercial bank deposits would dry up.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This could lead to a situation, Mr. Carney said, where banks would have to rely much more heavily on market-based funding: raising money from investors to issue loans. That would have implications for both the cost of funding and financial stability over all.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“Commercial banks will still be funded albeit at a higher cost and potentially with greater volatility,” he said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“Banks will become more reliant on non-banks for credit provision. With banks more vulnerable to a deterioration in sentiment in wholesale funding markets, lending rates could be more volatile over all for those borrowers unable to access other sources of financing,” he added.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;To prepare for this situation, Mr. Carney said central banks need to expand their role as “lender of last resort” to non-bank institutions. That means allowing direct access to emergency liquidity programs for non-bank financial institutions.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“As market-based finance become more important, a lender of last resort function that serves only banks increasingly will not serve society,” he said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Carney’s contribution to the digital currency discussion comes shortly after the BIS, which acts as a bank to the world’s central banks, came out in favour CBDCs, arguing cryptocurrencies and private digital currencies “tend to work against the public good element that underpins the payment system.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But the central banking community is by no means unified on the question of CBDCs.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;On Monday, Randal Quarles, U.S. Federal Reserve board member and vice-chair for supervision, gave a speech arguing against a U.S. CBDC.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“The potential benefits of a Federal Reserve CBDC are unclear. Conversely, a Federal Reserve CBDC could pose significant and concrete risks,” Mr. Quarles said in a speech that dismissively compared the current interest in CBDCs to the 1980s fashion craze for parachute pants.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;“An arrangement where the Federal Reserve replaces commercial banks as the dominant provider of money to the general public could constrict the availability of credit, fundamentally alter the economy and expose the public to a host of unanticipated, and undesirable, consequences,” he said.",cryptocurrency

* 2008 
* 350z
* clean title 
* 72k miles 

for $15,900 (steep price but the market is peaked and I'm gonna try to talk him down)

It seems I'm having a bit of an issue with financing. I have $65k in student loans and lightstream denied me because of it.

I got approved by another lender but with an interest rate of like 12%.

Bank of America basically shut their door in my face as soon as I said 2008 and refused to even discuss a private loan rather than an auto loan...

What are my options for financing with a decent interest rate? I do plan on putting a down payment of $2-3k.",finance

So the age old debate continues with BTC as there is low confidence it can be used directly as a payment system due to it's design.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off credit card debt?,"I was doing pretty good and got it to $5k, but then my car took a big poo, and I had to get a new one (but that one year of no car payments was so GLORIOUS let me tell you!).  I make $65k annually before tax, so about $3300 take home a month.  I have about $6k in savings.  My fiancé makes about the same but has his own bills and his finances are separate.  Here’s my personal breakdown:

Car: $322/month
Student loan: $270/month (3 years left approximately)
House payment: $1399 (fiancé pays half.  Just moved in and first payment is due August 1st.  30 year fixed at 3.125%)
Phone: $60/month
Car insurance: $70
Grocery: $300-$400 monthly (fiancé pays half)

I plan to start contributing to a Roth next month (hopefully the max a month).

My credit card debt doesn’t haunt me or anything.  I get by just fine. But I’m trying to figure out how to start the Roth and pay off the card at the same time.  Any advice appreciated.  My credit card balance has been steady where it’s at because I keep having random shit happening and making it difficult to get it down.  For example, our garage door broke and it cost $1500 to fix.  Slapped it on a card because I just put all my money towards the house down payment and didn’t have it.

It’s like I can’t escape large expenses.  I’m not a shopaholic or anything.  Everything I used my card for was necessary and not frivolous.  But I’m just tired of looking at it.  Everything else is great financially and credit wise but I would love to get it paid off.

ETA:  my fiancé’s check is not steady due to the line of work he is in.  He makes about the same as me yearly but it’s almost all in the summer.  His hours are pretty much halved starting November because of weather.  I’m salaried and my check never changes.  So in The winter, I pay almost all of the household bills. Last week, he worked 70 hours but the winter he gets max maybe 25-30 if he’s lucky.

ETA 2:  Credit card interest rate is 18.24%",finance

personalfinance,Potential student loan error on credit report,"Searched around a bit and found some relevant posts, but wanted to see if anyone had some more directly relevant information.

I checked my credit report as I recently started the house hunting process.

It appears that FedLoan has reported that I was 90-days late with my December 2016 payment for 5 separate loans.

What seems odd to me is that no payments before or after were late. Essentially that says to me that I logged in and made my payments for at least 2 months after the reported late payment, but specifically chose to pay January and February, but not December. 

Does that even seem possible? 

From what I've read here, my best course of action is to file a direct credit dispute with FedLoan. I'm in the process of doing that.

Has anyone else had a similar situation? Were you successful in filing a dispute?

My current approach in the dispute form is to act confused and suggest that it could be a glitch. 

Any thoughts on whether or not that's a reasonable approach? From what I've seen, if it's accurate, they won't change it, so I felt like highlighting the odd nature would be most useful in reinforcing that it's possibly a system error, of sorts. 

I've also read here that these late payments matter less over time. At this point we are 4.5 years removed from the reported late payment. Any thoughts on how much this might be impacting my credit score at this point?

Presumably my significant student loan balance (~$150k) is having a bigger impact on my score than the reported late payments, but I'm not sure how each component is weighted. 

If it was a single late payment, that might be one thing...but it's technically five 90-day late payments, even though they all happened in a single month with a single creditor. 

Last question, my lender pulled my credit report and it showed a credit score from TransUnion of just under 700. Interestingly, BoA also provides me a credit score from TransUnion. BoA shows a score just over 720, and the date associated with that score is only a single day different from the date of the score I got from the lender. 

Any thoughts or comments on the difference? A single day seems like too short of a period of time for a 30-point swing, but I also don't really know what I'm talking about, lol.

personalfinance,Is it better to completely pay off the debt by liquidating all your assets (cash and stock)?,"Hi, 

I am debating what is the ""best choice"" for me to take. I am married and we are expecting our first child in October.   


Here is the breakdown:

**Current income (net) per month:** $8K

**Current fixed spending:** $3.4K (rent, phone, Netflix, utilities, student loan - $571 per month) located in NYC

**Other spending:** $2K (groceries, eating out, necessary housing stuff that we buy, shopping)

Monthly disposable income/potential savings amount: $2.6K

**Assets total: \~$51K** 

**Savings acct:** $5k

**Checking acct:** $12K

**Investing acct:** $28K (stocks - currently up \~40% since I started investing; around $8.5K)

**Roth 401K**: $6k

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt: \~$46K**

**Private Student loan:** $46K

loan details: 8 years reminding of 10, Principal of $45,852.87 Interest rate: 4.349% (I think this is actually closer to 4.25 since I enrolled in autopay)  


I've worked hard to finally get to a positive net worth (\~$5K). I know it is a good idea to have an emergency fund (3 months of spending). However, I want to cash out on all of my investments besides my 401K and pay off all of my remaining student loans. 

If I do this, I know that I have to pay taxes on my capital gains, and I would be sitting at only $4-5K of cash as an emergency fund. I really want to get rid of my debt and be debt-free for the first time in 10 years.   


What would be the best ""choice"" here?

Edit: Thank you so much for all the answers. 

I just got this higher paying job so the $2.6K disposable income is a flexibility that I never had before. I was making closer to $6K net and threw everything to my investments.

investing,Betting on market inflation/correction,"Hi everyone I've been recently interested in all the inflation talk and treasury yield rates as the economy recovers from last year. I'm interested in learning more about bonds, inflation, the Fed etc. I want to make a play on $TTT ( an inverse (-3x) of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index). Essentially I'd like your help with these three scenarios, is my logic incorrect or am I missing some other important factors- or both.

Scenario 1: Inflation (currently around 5%, near 2008 high) continues to pick up in the following months. Does the Fed raise interest rates to combat this? I believe Powell has stated they don't want hikes until 2023. So in my mind higher inflation----&gt;demand for higher yields as investors don't want their money eroded by inflation. In this case I would be bullish on TTT (?)

Scenario 2: Lets assume there is a big selloff/correction in the general market in the following months, for any reason (i.e. overleverage). I'm assuming that investors would be interested in parking their money in safer treasuries/bonds, which would drive the yield down for these securities? In this case I would be bearish on TTT (?)

Scenario 3: Inflation tapers off in the following months, the economy is showing a decent recovery, no major financial events occur. I'm guessing yield rates remain the same or edge slightly upwards towards the end of the year. So this is a more neutral stance on TTT, slightly bullish (?)

I do realize that TTT is not meant for long term plays typically, I'm more interested in getting the market dynamics down of these possible futures down. I mostly used it as a real life example I could visualize. Feel free to comment using 1,2, and 3 for direct responses to my thought process.

Thanks in advance

financialindependence,Part 2 of My Guide To Hedgefundie's Portfolio for FIRE/FatFire/WhaleFire,"I ran into Reddit's 40,000 character limit on the first post and this post. Sadly Reddit's character limit includes hyper links. I wasn't able to explain everything I wanted in the first post so here's Part 2 of My Guide. 

This will be the last time I write a guide about this strategy. [Please read the first guide if you're new to this portfolio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o7tnm5/my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_and_why_im_100/)

Again, this portfolio is throwing 55% on UPRO and 45% on TMF. Both are 3x leveraged ETFs. If you do basic math, you have a portfolio of 3 * 55% S&amp;P 500 stocks = 165% and a portfolio of 3 * 45% of 20+ year long term US treasury bonds. This portfolio produces explosive returns with drawdowns being close to the risk of being in 100% stocks.

I'm 100% invested all-in this portfolio.

The second guide is going to answer a lot of common questions I saw come up in the original thread along with more graphs and supporting data to back why certain parts of this strategy works. I'm not going to repeat myself with information that's found in the first post. 

I expect you to have read the first guide before proceeding forward with the second part. 

# Rethinking Risk with the Futures Equivalent Portfolio

What is this portfolio if we think of it in terms of trading S&amp;P 500 futures (/ES) and 25-30 year UltraBond Futures(/UB)? 

When I originally wrote this post SPX is at 4,280.70, and /UB is quoted at $190`00 on Friday June 25 2021. 

/ES has a 50x contract multiplier so each contract of ES is equivalent to 50 x 4280.70 = $214,035 worth of the S&amp;P 500.

/UB delivers 100 of $1,000 face value basket of 25-30 year US bonds. In other words you can redeem these bonds for $100,000 which is the contract size. A quote of $190 means at expiration you will be paying $190,000 for this basket of bonds from the futures seller.

Our portfolio is 165% stocks and 135% 20+ year US treasuries. 

Let's start with /ES. We will divide $214,035 by 1.65 and get  $129,718 per contract.
Now let's start with /UB. We will divide $190,000 by 1.35 and get $140,740 per contract. 

So we need between $129,718 and $140,740 to run our portfolio. Let's just weight it at 55/45 for an average:
129718 * .55 + 140,740 * .45 = $134,677.90.

So for $134,677.90 on UPRO and TMF, this is the equivalent futures position:

Long 1 /ES Contract.       
Long 1 /UB Contract.       
$134,677.90 sitting in our futures account.            

Does that seem **excessively** risky to you?  /UB requires $7,150 for overnight margin while /ES requires $12,100 overnight margin at TD Ameritrade. We have 18.8x the overnight margin of our sole /UB contract sitting in the futures account and we have 11x the overnight margin of our sole /ES contract sitting in the futures account. That doesn't seem excessively risky to me.   

All together this position requires $19,250 of overnight margin and we have 7x of the overnight margin sitting in our accounts! [SPAN Margin could make this position require LESS margin too.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spanmargin.asp)  That doesn't seem excessively risky to me.

&gt; CAGR: 10.25%  Stdev: 14.46%  Max Drawdown: -50.97%         

In writing my guide [The Case for NTSX and Chill instead of VTSAX and Rest for FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o9proo/the_case_for_ntsx_and_chill_instead_of_vtsax_and/) I realized how close NTSX is to 100% stocks in terms of CAGR, risk, and drawdown. So I decided to do the same benchmarks and throw in 1.5x HFEA.

I now view 3x HFEA as taking the same risk of leveraging 100% stocks to 2x leverage or leveraging NTSX at 2x leverage. I view that as risky as investing in a lifecycle investing strategy. So I'm not being incredibly risky taking 3x leverage when you really think about it - its really applying 2x leverage to similar probability statistics!

With that in mind, I've decided this: **any additional borrowing on this portfolio is irresponsible.**

I've changed my mind. **I won't even think about borrowing a penny on this portfolio.**

I still feel comfortable holding long term before I hit my de-risking strategy milestone. After all, so far with monthly re-setting of leverage [it's been excellent to hold 2x 100% stocks for a long time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+NTSX&amp;portfolioName2=VTSMX&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VFINX&amp;allocation1_1=200&amp;symbol2=CASHX&amp;allocation2_1=-100) You definitely need a point when you stop playing though, of course. That's why I'm significantly de-risking 25-50% of HFEA at what I expect to hit around age 62-65. 

**I don't feel comfortable to retire on HFEA at all.** So far my de-risking strategy remains unchanged. 

# Rising Interest Rates already happened with TMF and TMF survived fine!

One self-proclaimed fixed income trader had this criticism of the portfolio:

&gt;Fixed income guy here, so let's do some basic bond math. Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price changes with respect to changes in yields. If your duration is 10 years, for every 1% (or 100 basis points) that rates increase, the price of your bond will decrease about 10% (yields and prices are inversely related).     
             
&gt; TLT duration right now is 18.84 years. For every 1% rise in rates, TLT will lose 18.4%. Now, you're advocating for owning 135% TMF. So, your duration risk is (3\*1.35\*18.84) or 76.3 years. Your bond portfolio on its own is wiped out if rates rise 1.31% or 131 basis points.

This person totally got the math wrong. The portfolio is advocating owning 135% **of TLT**,  NOT TMF! 

The correct duration math is 1.35\*18.84 = 25.434 years.

You can also calculate the duration math of the 45% TMF component this way: 3\*.45\*18.84 = 25.434 years!

[In 2020 to 2021 the U.S 30-Year Bond Auction rose from 1.330% interest to a high of 2.395% interest, for a 1.065% rise.](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history)

Just take a look at that graph. Did TMF get wiped out like that poster was predicting? [Nope, not really.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TMF/price)

How about this data? [The 30 year treasuries rose from 2.61% from Dec 15, 2008 to 4.65% June 08, 2009.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2521/30-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart) That's a 2.04% gain. Did this portfolio get wiped out? **HELL NO.** [It grew substantially thanks to UPRO!](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2008&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2010&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+UPRO%2FTMF&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200) 

A portfolio with a bond duration of 25.434 years is pretty darn safe!  I'm not worried about a rising interest rate environment. **We can clearly see gaining 2.04% over 6 months did not tank this portfolio!** 

# The Treasury DOES NOT SET the interest rates of their bonds! 

I also want to stress that the 30 year bond rates are **auctioned** in the market. The Feds DO NOT SET the rates of the 30 year bonds! The only interest rates the Feds control directly is the OVERNIGHT rate. [Treasury Direct has an excellent article on how Treasury Auctions work.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/auctfund/work/work.htm)

&gt;When participating in an auction, there are two bidding options - competitive and noncompetitive.
&gt; Competitive bidding is limited to 35% of the offering amount for each bidder, and a bidder specifies the rate, yield, or discount margin that is acceptable.
&gt; Noncompetitive bidding is limited to purchases of $5 million per auction. With a noncompetitive bid, a bidder agrees to accept the rate, yield, or discount margin determined at auction.

&gt;At the close of an auction, Treasury awards all noncompetitive bids that comply with the auction rules and then accepts competitive bids in ascending order of their rate, yield, or discount margin (lowest to highest) until the quantity of awarded bids reaches the offering amount. All bidders will receive the same rate, yield, or discount margin at the highest accepted bid.

The auction is DESIGNED to generate the lowest interest rates as possible. Quite frankly, the Feds **want** low interest rate bonds to continue. Lower interest rates benefit the Feds as the debtors. Lower interest rates make the long duration bonds swing more than at higher interest rates. 

Likewise, since it's the market that determines the interest rate, sometimes it will be higher too. Let's keep hoping the market wants higher interest rates while the economy is going good, we're winning on our equities, and we are getting our stock market crash insurance for really cheap! 

This is why I can sleep soundly at night running this portfolio. I want to keep backing up the truck on these bonds that still today appear to move inversely correlated when the stock market crashes, the overnight rate drops to 0%, and the market rate on these 20+ year treasuries drop to 1% or less from their previous 3-4% issued yields!  


# Lots of people don't understand how bond math works

[The best way to learn is to play with a bond calculator.](https://dqydj.com/bond-pricing-calculator/) Combine it with the [bond auction interest rate data above. I'll be nice and link it again.](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history) 

Now we need some more data on our bond fund. They're owning a lot of different bonds. We need [TLT's weighted average maturity which Fidelity is the first result for that.](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=TLT)

It's 26 years, so that is what most of their bonds are in the fund based on Fidelity's reporting. Now we have all the data to compute the percentage move TLT is expected at the current rates. Subtract 4 years from 2021 and most their bonds right now are bonds from 2017. The auction rate on that is roughly 3% for that year. One bond has par/face value of $1,000. Or you can put in $100,000 if you want, or whatever your actual dollars of bonds you currently own is. It doesn't matter. I'll just stick with $100,000 as the base price. 

Their annual coupon rate from the auction data is 3%. [Right now the market rate is around 1.5% looking at TLT's dividend yield.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TLT/dividend_yield) So enter 1.5 for the market rate. As we already looked up TLT's data, enter 26 years to maturity. US treasuries pay twice a year so leave that as a default.

So now we get a bond price - $132,195.71. If you sell this bond today you realize 32% capital gains from buying it! Now you can see how a 3x leveraged fund can move. If you bought two more of these bonds with a low cost loan, you're now sitting at 3 * 32% capital gains - or 96% before loan interest costs!  

[Now we see why TMF doubles and halves all the time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=TMF&amp;allocation1_1=100) 

Look at TMF's prices in 2017. They dropped a lot from the rising rates! They halved from $30 to $18 then trended up $20. Yeah people would have been complaining to buy TMF back then at $18 to $20 and complaining about their losses then. But right now TMF is trading around $25 to $27 a share! I'd be really glad to have a ton of my money I parked at $18-$20 a share in 2017 to be $25-$27 a share right now! 

In Covid TMF shot up to $40-$45 a share. I bet you were really glad to buy a ton of shares at $18-20 for re-balancing! 

Again, **we want interest rates to rise slowly** so we are purchasing higher and higher interest rate bonds that will provide a ton of protection when the next stock market crash happens. Now I'm really glad we purchased those high interest rate bonds in 2017! It paid off handsomely in the Covid stock market crash! 

This is why I'm not afraid of rising interest rates. Again TLT is buying bonds at auction. They got in at 2.32% interest rate despite the market rate being 1.5%! This is one of the advantages of being in a bond fund for a long time! Put in the calculator 2.32% for the coupon rate and 1.5%. Just TLT buying at auction produced a book value of 19% on those bond issues. I &lt;3 bond funds!

# Callable Bonds Revisited

[Interest rate graph of the OVERNIGHT rate 1954-2020, credit Forbes.](https://i.imgur.com/JFVMJcz.jpg)

Ok, now you know how bond math works. Now you know about the auction operations of the US Treasury. Let's combine those two together.

Then, because the Feds AUCTION all their bonds, the long term US treasury rates auction jumped much higher interest rates because the bonds were CALLABLE at the time! At the same time the Feds were messing with the OVERNIGHT rate too! 

I'm going to get really nerdy here and pull up the exact call feature of the 30 year bonds that were sold in auction before 1985. [Treasury Direct has a nice history of how bonds changed over the years.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/history/histtime/histtime_bonds.htm)

&gt;1974: 25-year area bond issues (callable after 20 years) became a regular feature of mid-quarter Treasury refunding operations.         
&gt;1977: 30-year area bonds (callable after 25 years) became a regular feature of mid-quarter refunding operations, replacing 25-year area bonds.         
&gt;1985:	Noncallable 30-year bonds, which are more attractive for stripping than callable bonds, became a regular feature of mid-quarter refunding operations.         

So it's no wonder WHY this portfolio tanks so fucking hard in the 70s. In all effect these 25 and 30 year issues were treated as a **5 year bond** thanks to the call feature! Since the Treasury were doing MARKET operations the MARKET decided to be like, hey, the best bid on these shit bonds is 6%. The best bid on these shit bonds are 12% and so on. 

They had to bid higher too than the overnight market rate which was likewise jumping around trying to fight inflation! 

The callable bond feature let the treasury FREEZE interest payments PERMANENTLY. Then you had to either mail in your bonds directly to the treasury or take it to a bank where they redeemed it for FACE VALUE. How would you like your $132,195.71 bond to be redeemed for $100,000? You would be fucking pissed! How do investors protect themselves at the time knowing the bonds they were buying have a call feature? They raise the interest rate for the risk that their bonds get called! The feds were a joke this era! 

If you got the 6% 30-year bond then rates rose to 12% - the treasury didn't call them, and you lost a lot of your bond's value!  If you got the 12% bond they'd be called in 5 years if the market rate was 6% at the time instead! **Again, all downside and no upside.** 

We just explored how bond auctions work. If I see the treasury ever re-introduce a call feature on LTTs I'm dumping TMF completely and probably will go to intermediate term treasuries. 

Let's see [how the intermediate term treasuries portfolio does.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=HFEA+intermediate+treasuries&amp;portfolioName2=HFEA+LTT+treasuries&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;allocation1_2=165&amp;symbol2=IEF&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200&amp;allocation3_2=-200&amp;symbol4=TLT&amp;allocation4_2=135)

We're still getting that desired 22% CAGR. Again I'm showing you - MOST THE RETURN is from the equities portion! 

Same exact drawdown in 2008. That was because like Covid both LTTs and the stock market crashed first moving in sync. However look at the worst year. -41.14% (intermediate treasuries) vs -26.21% (LTT treasuries). The intermediate treasuries don't nearly help as much to ballast these stats. 

Just look at the insanity 1970-1984 is. Do you really think we will repeat 20%+ overnight interest rates along with callable bonds? Do you think the Feds would jump interest rates that high with non-callable bonds? My answers to both questions are no. This is why I'm able to sleep soundly at night with this portfolio.

# More data on the Correlation Trading Strategy and why we Rebalance Quarterly

Many people criticized my choices of my dates to re-balance Hedgefundie's portfolio. So I want to provide more data to back up my findings.

[U.S 30-Year Bond Auction Data](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history)

Same link as above, but it needs to be repeated a second time. Go through their slider and look at the history of interest rates. [We can see interest rates rise and fall all the time.](https://i.imgur.com/wchI77W.png) This is the correlation trading strategy action we desire.

Our quarterly re-balancing happens to dodge when the 30 year US treasuries go up for auction by re-balancing on the first trading day of the new month. 

[Now let's go through all of 2020's Earnings Calender.](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings?day=2020-01-01)

You can see Jan 2nd is very quiet with only 2 companies reporting earnings, same with this week. Next week each day has 8-28 earning reports, next week 42-28, week after we see 75, 95, and 124 on some days, and so on. 

[I'm not going to write out every report so I found a very nice graph for the first ~quarter.](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reports-by-day.png)

You can clearly see a pattern emerging where it's quiet in January, then gets crazy in Feb, and Early March where the graph cuts off. The data still holds for 2020, so I'll spoon-feed the rest of march. The first week is averaging 126 earnings reports per day, 2nd week 127 earnings reports, third week 100 earnings reports, 4th week 100 earnings reports, 5th week slowing down to about 50 earnings reports per day, then first week of April is averaging 25 per day. 

**We are rebalancing each quarter when there are the least number of companies reporting earnings for that week in the US Stock Market!**  

Pick any day of that quiet week to rebalance, it doesn't matter. Hell pick quiet Fridays if you want. 

I'm going to be providing a few daily rolling Sharpe ratio graphs next. [Here is an excellent article on rolling Sharpe graphs.](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/rolling-sharpe-ratio/) 

[Here is a daily(60 days) rolling Sharpe ratio graph from QuantConnect showing 55/45 UPRO/TMF HFEA in action on the actual ETFs themselves re-balancing each quarter.](https://i.imgur.com/6zJNDj8.png) You can see the strategy is spiking to as high of a 2.0 to 4.0 sharpe ratio along each quarter, and dropping off in January sometimes and dropping off a bit on each re-balance period. 

Remember, the Sharpe ratio is independent of leverage, and Hedgefundie's portfolio is adding 3x leverage all the time to the above daily sharpe ratios here in this graph. Yes we do dip below zero at times and do take some losses.

[And here is a daily Rolling Sharpe Ratio Graph for SPY and TLT from 2004 onwards at 55/45 at 3x leverage, with
leverage reset daily and SPY/TLT quarterly re-balanced.](https://i.imgur.com/z02H2Gy.png)

Again we are seeing the same pattern above repeat. Yes it's harder to pick out dates given the huge history 2003-current represents. Yeah 2008-2009 really sucked hard and that is where we have our -65% drawdown. Just like COVID treasuries were delayed for a bit before they rose in response. Their safety did help out the portfolio tremendously. 

I really like how the Sharpe ratio really remains constant throughout the entire history I'm able to back test using Quant Connect. 


Again, the idea of correlation trading strategies are **we are always right** by betting nearly 50-50. This is some substantial evidence that a huge portion of the return of this portfolio is due to this correlation trading strategy. We are basically playing earnings each quarter. 

Then again, I previously shown in comments that [monthly re-balancing is fantastic too.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=600000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=8333&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=UPRO%2FTMF+Simulated&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VFINX&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;symbol2=VUSTX&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200) Most the return is from the equities portion but you are getting some substantial juice playing earnings by doing quarterly rebalancing. 

# OMG it could go to zero in a day?!?!

[Again, show me when the S&amp;P 500 dropped 33% in one day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index)

I've already outlined why it's impossible for the S&amp;P 500 to drop 33% in one day, and you can read the first guide to read my argument again. I even provided a 1987 back test that goes through **THE LARGEST DROP IN THE S&amp;P 500'S HISTORY and it was fine.**

If UPRO does zero in a day then we will have 45% of TMF left parking our cash, which would probably moon or grow more. We're parking our cash every quarter in a pretty stable value ETF given it's 3x levered. We are hopefully growing really fast with UPRO and parking more and more money each year you hold.

Then TLT and TMF's index is the [ICE US Treasury 20+ Year Index.](https://ycharts.com/indices/%5EICEUST20Y) **Show me where it's dropped 33% in one day.** It'd be incredibly unlikely for the worlds SAFEST treasuries to drop 33% in one day! Many nations buy our treasuries! 

Again, the bond duration of this portfolio is 25.434 years of long term US treasuries. 

# Dude you're going to crash/burn/etc in 30, 40, 50+ years 

I found it was really sad that people skipped over my de-risking strategy. My milestones are estimated to be hit roughly every 10 years. Yes I'm all-in now, but there will be a time I'm not all-in in the future. I'm extremely confident this strategy will exist in the next 10 years! 

I suggest you [make an Investment Policy Statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement) for your investment objectives. I updated my IPS when I decided to go All-In with Hedgefundie's portfolio. In essence, my two guides are partly my own IPS as well. 

# If this strategy gets popular will it affect the US Treasuries Market or US Stock Market? 

I don't think so. If you go back to the bond auction link the 30 year sells roughly **$27 billion** 30-year treasuries **per month**.  That's 324 billion per year. For the 20-30 years of bonds we are playing that is an estimated market cap of **$3.240 trillion of US Bonds.**

[TMF's AUM is $280 million.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TMF/total_assets_under_management) Is $280 million going to move the market? Probably not. They're using swaps and futures derivatives. If TMF loses 4% of their NAV($280 million) in one day of trading, $11.2 million is a drop in the bucket for the US treasuries. Again most of their holdings is swaps and the swaps are directly affecting the market. 

Ok, what about leveraged ETFs like UPRO? [Again their AUM is $2.5 billion.](https://ycharts.com/companies/UPRO/total_assets_under_management) That is not going to move the S&amp;P 500 futures market that [trades 1 to 2 million contracts a day.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/e-mini-sandp500.volume.html) 2 million contracts is $428 billion being traded every single day.

Clearly UPRO isn't going to affect the futures market. Most of UPRO's AUM is with bank swaps then they trade some futures on top of it.  If UPRO loses or gains 4% of their NAV($2.5 billion) in a day and needs to buy/sell shares, that's only $100 million of volume, and most of that volume is their swaps and not futures contracts being traded. 

A good rule of thumb is one person's trades affect the market when they become 5% to 10% of the daily volume. At 5% of the daily futures volume UPRO would need to trade $21.4 billion to start affecting the market **in futures** every day. UPRO on a usual day would need to grow 214x larger. At 10% daily volume UPRO would need to grow 428x larger! Quite frankly with the futures making up a small amount of UPRO, let's estimate 1/3, then UPRO needs to grow 648x larger to have 5% of the S&amp;P 500 futures volume, and 1296x larger to have 10% of the S&amp;P 500 futures problem. 


HFEA can probably scale to the billions range easily. It's buy and hold and the only trading it does is quarterly outside the daily leverage resets. I'm not worried about another SVXY or XIV event. UPRO and TMF are **ETFs** and **NOT ETNs.** XIV died. SVXY continues on. 

SVXY and XIV lost 90%+ as those two ETFs and ETNs were responsible for **shorting 70% of the daily volume** of the VIX futures market. Yes XIV shorted futures too as the ETN provider needs to hedge as people can sell/redeem at any time. It became such a huge crowded trade. Each ETF was designed to short, short, short as much as possible with AUM. Of course a short squeeze happened when the market got shorted so much that the VIX fell to ~9 before shooting up and a short squeeze happened! Just like GME getting naked shorted to death!

A **shorting** ETF on an obscure futures contract is incredibly different to a long 3x leveraged ETF on the largest most liquid stock index in the world! 

Also we can't just look at AUM, we need to look at shares outstanding for your ETF. More shares outstanding = inflows to the ETF. Less shares outstanding = outflows to the ETF.  [Remember ETFs have a redemption and creation mechanism!](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/what-is-the-creationredemption-mechanism) So more shares = more people joining you in your ETF. This is why tiny ETFs are actually so liquid!

[TMF shares outstanding has a ton of inflow and outflow all the time. I don't see anything concerning here.](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/tmf/)

[UPRO has gotten significantly less popular.](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/upro/) They went from 87m shares outstanding to 22.35m shares outstanding [despite splitting so much they're at a x36 multiplier](https://www.splithistory.com/upro/) It looks like the scare tactics of leveraged ETFs are working here! Most people are day trading these and not buying and holding. 

[TQQQ shares outstanding are constant](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/tqqq/) despite many people being in TQQQ it's not a crowded trade at this time either.

So I'm definitely not worried that these leveraged ETFs or Hedgefundie's portfolio is going to become a crowded trade. I had to write two guides on this portfolio, and it's clear most people don't understand leveraged ETFs despite my attempts to help. I'm definitely sleeping soundly at night knowing there are very few people joining me on Hedgefundie's adventure.

Again, to prevent it becoming a crowded trade this is the last time I will write about it on Reddit other than occasionally providing updates. So to the ~10 people that private messaged me worrying I was spilling too much beans on this portfolio you guys and gals can sleep at night soundly. Hopefully we can stay in touch and maybe have a HFEA meetup 10-20 years down the road. 

# Your strategy won't scale/You'll run into liquidity issues

Already covered above. It will scale tremendously. I already know how to make [block trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_trade) with my broker! See my first guide!  I already own over 10,000 shares of TMF and I'll be excited to get my first creation unit of 50,000 shares! 

[Here is another guide on ETF liquidity.](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-etf-liquidity) Then if you regularly trade 50,000 shares of an illiquid ETF there is more good advice in this article:

&gt;If you trade this size regularly, a good first step is to contact the ETF issuer itself and request the capital markets desk. One of the main goals of the issuer’s capital markets desk is to ensure that investors enter and exit funds at fair prices. They can also be a great help in providing market impact estimations, underlying liquidity analysis and connecting investors to liquidity providers.

# You have significant Bank Counter Party Risk

We already covered TMF's $280m aum and UPRO's $2.5b aum. [Let's look at all the Treasury ETF's AUMs.](https://www.etf.com/channels/ice-us-treasury-20-year-bond-index-etfs)

Let's focus on those shorting this index. We have 2x TBT with $1.49B aum, 1x TBF $619m AUM, 3x TMV at $301m AUM, and 3xTTT at $103M aum. Look at all their charts and performance, they're losing a ton and a ton of money. 

Now we need to look at the longs. TLT is unlevered and directly owns bonds so we can skip them. We only have one other sad long treasury - 2x UBT with $35.76M aum.  Man it's crazy to think about I'd own 0.75% of UBT if I de-levered to the 2x strategy!  I currently own 0.09% of TMF. 

Clearly the banks can match TMF and UBT's long swaps with the swaps of the short bonds. The banks are profiting handsomely right now being long US treasury swaps with all that AUM on the short side.

I'm not concerned with counter party risk for TMF at all. Yes it technically exists as they have swaps but there is so much dollars on the short side that the banks can pair TMF's swap to the shorts and profit off the interest rate spread on both swaps. 

Now time for [Inverse/Short ETFs for the S&amp;P 500](https://www.etf.com/channels/inverse-etfs) 

We have 1x SH at $1.40B, 2x SDS $619.36M, 3x SPXU $520.13m, and that's all as far as I can tell.

Now [let's do long leveraged ETFs.](https://www.etf.com/channels/leveraged-etfs) 

We have 2x SSO at $4.0B, 3x SPXL at $2.39B, 2x SPUU at $26.8m, and of course 3x UPRO at $2.5b. 

So yes, unfortunately there is possible counter party risk with the bank swaps for the leveraged funds. Fortunately that is very easy for the banks to handle - they buy shares of an S&amp;P 500 ETF or the components directly to hedge the swaps. They charge borrow rates in their swaps to do so as well, so they still profit. I'm sure they would love to have more people buy these leveraged ETFs for more swaps and so on! Of course they match the swaps to the short funds side as well, and profit twice. 

[Then you should really review how swap agreements work.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityswap.asp) Yes there is counterparty risk unfortunately, but reviewing how swaps work brings a lot of peace of mind to the portfolio. UPRO is on the hook if the S&amp;P 500 falls for their payments. The bank is on the hook if it's past the libor +markup rate, which the bank gets to subtract the interest from the payment. When the banks buy shares to hedge the swaps they get their money to make up for losses, and they still get their interest rate they want for the cost to buy securities. These swaps turn out to be profit centers for the bank. The bank can also decide to hedge many other ways - they could hedge with futures contracts, call options, etc. 

Yes there is counter party risk, but these ETFs set up swaps with several banks to minimize the risk. I'm able to sleep at night holding these leveraged ETFs. I really don't think they will burn due to counter party risk. 

# But that 0.75% management fee UPRO and TMF are charging - Bogle must be rolling in his grave

[You'll be paying the same 0.75% markup for under a $3 million account at IBKR for the same strategy on Portfolio Margin.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376)

Let's look in depth how a leveraged ETF works! [I decided to make a spreadsheet comparing a 3x daily-reset leveraged ETF to do it yourself monthly reset.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVYLmEtnLCVJ-bZvBR22aRauG7arMGS6TXs2-s123gw/edit?usp=sharing) Please COPY the spreadsheet instead of requesting edit access. Please take lots of time and play with variables on this spreadsheet. I won't be spoon feeding every combination of expectations. 

And yes, before anyone comments, this spreadsheet has 0 volatility in it. I'll leave it as homework to try to model volatility. If anyone models volatility as up or down every day though that is a failing grade. The stock market is mostly trending in all of our stock market crashes. Yes there are a few 10% up days in covid, but for the most part it's vastly trending.

Most of the inflated volatility figures comes from the put premium calculations. Big surprise - puts increase premiums in a stock market crash, [those numbers feed the VIX](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/vix/vixwhite.pdf), and now volatility is high. That doesn't mean we are going to start seeing days of washing machine +10% followed by -10% followed by +10% over and over. **That just simply does not happen.**

In UPRO's prospectus they take the expense ratio and management fee daily out of the fund's equity.

You can see how in a trending market that grows 12% annually the leveraged ETF has equity of $140,112 while doing it yourself at IBKR once a month monthly your equity is $138,478.  

**The LETF has 1.18% higher equity**,  and thus has an effective expense ratio of -1.18% given these parameters.

Likewise, in a trending losing market at -12% per year the leveraged ETF is **1.38% higher equity** for being able to de-risk faster than your taxable account!

Despite that Bogle-Rolling-In-The-Grave 0.75% management fee, these leveraged ETFs are an excellent deal! 

Now this spreadsheet shows why re-balancing leverage yourself is a **brainfuck strategy.** Look at 2x on monthly for selling off -12% annually. Each month the market loses you're selling shares to pay down your loan to keep the same leverage ratio! Month 0 you have $100k equity and a $200k loan. At the first of the next month you have $96,750 in equity and you need to sell shares to pay your loan down to $193,500! Second month you're at $93,605 equity and you need to sell your loan down to $187,211, and so on! 

**Do you have the mental fortitude to hit that sell button every month you're losing money?** I don't. That is why I recommend you buy a leveraged ETF instead of investing on margin yourself. 

# If this strategy is so great why aren't any funds doing it?

I was really frustrated to see this comment repeat over and over on my guide. I provided two funds that ARE doing the same or a similar strategy, just at lower leverage ratios:

[2x PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

One [popular investment is 1.5x NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSAX's return with slightly less risk!  NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

[Read my just posted guide on NTSX for more info on that fund!](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o9proo/the_case_for_ntsx_and_chill_instead_of_vtsax_and/) 

[RenTech might be playing HFEA, they just bought $934k of TMF.](https://fintel.io/so/us/tmf) Or maybe it's a sole bored trader running HFEA, lol. Other Hedge funds are long too on TMF.

You can think of Hedgefundie's portfolio as buying 2x of NTSX on margin, or 2x of VTSAX on margin but it's leverage is reset daily and it has a huge LTT treasury bond component as a hedge. That's how I view it, it's risky, but it's not out of the world risky. That is why I have a de-risking strategy and a final portfolio target when I substantially stop playing it.

I hope my additional charts and data helps solidify and explain this awesome trading strategy.

I found an [awesome graph from Forbes showing the Overnight Rate from 1954-2020.](https://i.imgur.com/JFVMJcz.jpg) Deleted 2nd futures section.

Just look at the insanity 1970-1984 is. Do you really think we will repeat 20%+ overnight interest rates along with callable bonds? Do you think the Feds would jump interest rates that high with non-callable bonds? My answers to both questions are no.

personalfinance,Should we repay 25K loan early?,"We plan to purchase another home around 18 months from now. We have $25K remaining on a personal loan with an interest rate slightly above 5%, and coincidentally, 18 months of payments remaining.

We have the cash to easily pay it off. Will paying this loan off early have any negative impact on the review of our creditworthiness for a mortgage loan in 18 months?

The loan was used to renovate the home (countertops, cabinets, bathrooms). In addition to the interest savings we would realize, this would allow us to recoup the cash needed for repayment to deploy elsewhere, free any encumbrance for our DTI, and not require early repayment fees.",finance

Personally, I think a project called SafeDoller getting hacked twice, and subsequently their ""STABLECOIN""  getting REKT probably best illustrates the current situation. We have a problem in DEFI...

One thing I see in common is almost all of these projects claim to be Audited or ""Forking from the most audited version""...

If there is one thing I learned in the bull run and Defi Boom... is there is no shortage of ""*great projects, with a killer community, backed by a super experienced team (*that might rug you*)*""... but there IS a HUGE shortage of companies capable of doing an Audit that actually means anything.

My question is, is it really that difficult to bump interest rates up .25% just to help ease the amount of inflation that is happening around the USA?

I noticed that other countries are also raising rates already and even India &amp; china have higher interest rates than the USA right now. Why do they insist waiting until 2023-2024?

 One of the first things u studied if you took economics was that 0% interest rates (making money free and printing alot of it) leads to hyperinflation. We are supposed to be able to put our money in the bank and collect at least 2% in interest rates. Why is money so cheap still? None of this is adding up. So I was hoping somebody could explain why interest rates are going to stay at \~ 0% for more years. I am so scared to invest in the stock market now seeing as to how pumped up it is with fake money.

investing,No Hype SoFi Analysis. Long term hold.,"I’ve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI s etc. but I’m investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here’s why:

1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO’s can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ’22, $484M ’23 ($1.17B in ’25 but that’s a bit of a wild card since it’s so far in the future…).  That’s a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4’20 and in Q1’21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #’s.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans, Crypto trading and IPO investing (underwriting).
2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans, crypto…and hopefully options soon!)
3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #’s) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo’s APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities.
4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021
5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi’s investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)
6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this….
7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it’s all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account and Crypto trading.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a “member” and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).
   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you’re not a customer yet – you’re doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them – you’ll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.
8. Post lockup period (ended Monday 6/28) we should see a lot more interest from  ETFs, Mutual Funds, Institutional investors and analysts.   Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&amp;P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc.

Analyst Price Targets:

Oppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target

Rosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target

I personally don’t follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check.

My 2024 Price Target is $42-$50 based on their 2024 projected revenue (with current product offerings, this should increase as they offer new products and finalize the bank acquisition).  This is based on a pretty simple comparison to other FinTech's (Square and Paypal) P/S multiples.  Pretty rudimentary so I'd welcome other input.  

There are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.

I’ve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams pushing it higher and sure there’s a tiny chance that happens but that’s not why I put my money into SoFi.  I’m an investor not a gambler…

Bitcoin,Never sell your Bitcoin?,"Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to see what the overall consensus was on selling Bitcoin. The well-known Bitcoin advocate Mr. Michael Saylor has already stated that you should never sell your Bitcoin and that you should hold onto it for life. He argues that when you sell you're Bitcoin you're taxed, but if you hold onto it you can borrow against the Bitcoin (tax-free) at a decent interest rate. Platforms such as Block Fi offer this type of service. 

What do you guys think about this? If I double my investment during this next bull run it would be tempting not to sell a little bit for liquidity purposes. I do love Bitcoin and the direction it's going so I plan on investing in this for the long term regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

personalfinance,Unsure how to move forward with allocating my money,"Hey guys,

I'm 16 and am currently ""worth"" about $6,000 across three accounts, and am not sure how I should invest it moving forward.

To begin with, I technically have three sources of income. These are my direct deposits from my work, the cash tips I receive from my work, and the weekly Venmo payments I receive for another job of mine.

As for financial goals, I have a few. I want to pass the $10k mark by the end of the year, and I really want to be a homeowner as soon as possible out of high school, and want my investments to be more short-term based to reflect this, which is my issue with dumping my money into a Roth.

As for accounts, I have a savings account, brokerage/checking account, and a Roth IRA. Starting with the checking account, it has $2,000 in it, and horrible interest rates for a savings account (local bank).  I use it because I need somewhere that I can deposit my tips, as none of my other accounts have nearby physical banks. Aside from that, this bank account is essentially just for moving money into a different account.

On that note, the second account I opened was a Vanguard Roth IRA. I invested $1,000 into VTI at $200/share around February of this year. I am very hesitant to invest further as I am worried about putting away money that you're not really supposed to take back until you're 65, as my biggest goal is to put a down payment on a house (soon) out of high school.

Finally, my Fidelity Youth Brokerage Account. This account was opened within the past couple of weeks and now serves as my primary account for its ability to fully function as both a checking and brokerage account. This is the primary basis for my question, as I got this account mostly for investing, but currently, it just has $3k just sitting there. Any ideas for how I can better gauge my investments to match my goal of homeownership?

Two sidenotes, I have already begun to build my credit, and my college is completely paid for if I choose to do so.",finance

By my calculations using the rate for 4 people for the same amount of labor hours would have been about $400 less, including no overtime fee which we are currently being charged.

CryptoCurrency,Earn interest on stablecoins : the profits don't have to stop.,"I've compiled some strategies on how to earn interest on stablecoins, as this question gets asked frequently in the daily:

**1. 18.5-20% APY on UST using Anchor Protocol**. Anchor protocol is a savings platform on the Terra network. Decentralized solution.

Pros : The platform is adamant on keeping the rate not lower than 18.5% APY. Even during the recent crash, it kept the rate at 18.5% (now it's at 19.4% to be precise). The Terra USD (UST) is the most decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. Nexus Mutual is offering insurance for any smart contract hack on Anchor (2.6% APY).

Cons: The platform is only a couple of months old. Terra USD is a lesser know stable coin, and parameters were recently optimized to prevent it from de-pegging. Getting on the Terra system necessitates a bridge, it's easy but an extra step for some.

**2. 12-20% APY on USDC, USDT, BUSD or DAI using Orion Money.** Orion Money is Anchor's little brother on the Ethereum Network. Decentralized solution.

Pros: Use the stablecoin of your choice. Ethereum network is more known for some.

Cons: 12% is the regular staking APY, if you want a higher staking APY you have to hold the Orion Token. The platform is very new, just launched a couple of weeks ago. Ethereum network fees.

**3. 5-20% APY on USDC/USDT or USDC/DAI by providing liquidity** on Sushiswap or Quickswap on the Matic Network. 10% APY on USDC/USDT on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain. Uniswap V3 pools on ETH network (L2 arbitrum coming soon). Decentralized option.

Pros: Matic network and BSC have very cheap fees, initial APYs were much higher for several weeks (40%-100%). You can always try to find a new AMM, but it is VERY risky if it's an unknown name (risk of getting hacked).

Cons: APYs went down to 5-10%. Still an interesting option. Risk of USDT depegging :P

**4. 8-12% on stablecoins on Nexo/Celsius/Blockfi/Ledn.** Centralized ''banking'' solution.

Pros: Some feel more safe on a centralized solution, the interest rates are better than your savings account at the bank. Some insurance is provided (unsure of the coverage).

Cons: In order to achieve the 12% you need to hold a significant amount of the native token or a significant portfolio. Interest rates get sometimes dropped without warning.

**5. 4% on USDC on Coinbase or 4-5% on USDT/BUSD on Binance.** Centralized exchange.

Pros: Some feel more safe on a centralized exchange they use, the interest rates are better than your savings account at the bank. Some insurance is provided (unsure of the coverage).

Cons: Worst savings rate. Can drop interest rates without warning.

**6. 6-14% on crypto dot com.** Centralized exchange

Pros: Better rates than other centralized exchanges, especially if you hold CRO. Centralized exchange feels safer for some (unsure of insurance coverage)

Cons: You have to lock your stablecoin for 1 to 3 months for the best rates. Hold 40k$ in CRO for the 14% APY. Can drop interest rates, or increase CRO staking threshold. 

**\*\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\*** So why isn't everyone using these strategies? **The money is not FDIC insured and there are risks to crypto** : smart contracts get hacked, stablecoins can get de-pegged (not worth 1 USD$), the exchange will leave with your crypto, etc... New insurance strategies are coming to the market for DeFi, but always keep in mind that the interest rates are proportional to the risk.

personalfinance,Sell condo early and pay into student loans or rent condo out?,"We will soon need to buy a house due to expanding family.  We don’t need the proceeds from the condo to do that. But we have to decide what to do with the condo that we’ve only lived in for two years. 

Both the condo mortgage and the student loans have a 4.375% interest rate. If I sold the condo now, I can cash in about 25k (after paying closing costs, my real estate agent, etc).

If I were to rent out the condo, we’d have minuscule cash flow ($250-$300, not accounting for vacancy and repairs).

personalfinance,Financial Advice required,"Hi,

I'm struggling with a difficult financial situation. In my home country, My parents messed up big time with the finances.

In my country, there are individuals who lend unsecured loans at very high interest rates such as 2%-5% per month. Suppose if a lender lends 10000 USD at 3%, the borrower has to pay 300 USD per month as an interest. The principal amount remains the same i.e. 10000 USD unless an additional amount is paid on top of interest. 

I learned recently that my naive parents trusted few people and borrowed money from person X at 2% and lended to person Y at 3-4%. Now the issue started few years ago when the person Y, who borrowed money from my parents didn't pay back. But my parents had to pay the interest to the person X on time. This went on and multiple such investments met same fate. Some of the investments they made turn out to be fraud and the borrowers ran away. And recently I've learned that the total loan amount comes out to 500000 USD with interest rate around 3-4% per month. 

I know my parents had fair share of struggles in their life, I just want to solve this and see the smile back on their face which has been missing from many years. I'm unable to think straight. 

At times, I question my fate, but nothing ever changes from thinking over past. With my current job, it would take me 10-15 years to pay off everything unless I hit a jackpot.

Is there any other way out of this? What are my options? Can I take a personal loan in US and transfer to my home country?

Also, can I take anyone's help? Is there anyone who would help in situations like this? 

P.S. I know there are many people who are in far more difficult situation than I'm, but I've to be selfish in this moment if I want to pay off my debts.

Thank you so much!",finance
personalfinance,Does a 529 for myself make sense if I already graduated college and am unsure about graduate school?,"I already have my college degree and I don't have any immediate plans for graduate school. Only a vague ""it would be beneficial to get a master's for career advancement/change"" but no solid plans yet

I guess it's something I might potentially end up doing in the future if it's worth it and I can get in? But it's uncertain at this point

I'm single, 28, and have no kids

Would it make sense for me to start a 529 with myself as the beneficiary without a solid plan for the future? I truly don't know if I'll go to graduate school or have kids, but I feel like if I do end up deciding to go to graduate school, I'd be in a much better position if I did a 529 today

But then what if I don't and then can't use the 529 for education expenses? I would've been better off investing that in a regular brokerage account and not have to pay the 10% penalty? Am I even going to be saving that much on tax-free growth vs. a regular brokerage? Long-term capital gains tax rate would be 15% federal for say... 20k for a complete masters? $1500 in savings federally for a 529

tl;dr - does a 529 make sense for a single college educated graduate who is uncertain about graduate school and kids

CryptoCurrency,Why would someone realistically buy Aave?,"I have been eyeing Aave for a long time (1 year+) because of its blue-chip status. I understand how the protocol works and the token's role in the model, however I can't understand why anyone would wish to use the Aave protocol, when deposit APYs are abysmally low (similar to bank account interest rates for wrapped BTC and ETH). Even on stablecoins, deposit APYs are comparable to holding USD in traditional savings account of some online banks, if not lower!! I've kept an eye on deposit APYs for months, and every time I thought they were just too low for anyone to actually use Aave for lending especially when most CeFi platforms offer 3-4x the returns. What's even more confusing is that borrow APRs are instead higher than on most CeFi platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing here?  **From the advertized APY/APRs, this platform seems extremely uncompetitive for both the lender and the borrower**. How is Aave so successful with the constantly low deposit APYs and high borrow APYs? I want to believe in the project and invest in it for the long haul (years), but I can't bring myself to invest in a platform whose economics I don't see profitability in.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Can you tell me why Aave is worth investing in? Given the terrible interest rates on both sides of the lending agreement, I don't see why anyone would choose Aave over any CeFi or even traditional finance alternatives?",cryptocurrency

10. The May Cardano 360 was yesterday and we had lots of updates including the Color Coding for the different stages of the testnet! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS33gRj9JYE)
11. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
12. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
13. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
14. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
15. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
16. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
17. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
18. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
19. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
20. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
21. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
22. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
23. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
24. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
25. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
26. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
27. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

30. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
31. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
32. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
33. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
34. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
35. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
36. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
37. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

[https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1401622548396314631](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1401622548396314631)
59. Bitcoin enthusiasm seems to be off to a great start among other Latin American politicians after the fervor around the El Salvador announcement. This will serve as a great gateway drug that only leads to Gen 3 projects and Cardano.

75. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
76. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”. Sounds like the Cardano train is rolling along as smoothly as ever in Africa. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104)
77. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)

79. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

80. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

81. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way.

84. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake?

88. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow.

92. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening.

93. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

100. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

104. The June Cardano 360 was yesterday. It is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
105. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
106. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
107. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
108. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
109. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
110. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

112. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

MELD is working on a new approach instead of an ICO/IEO, which are very famous for ETH's ecosystem. They are taking advantage of staking on Cardano and coming up with something innovative called ISPO (Initial Stakepool Offering)

**ISPO Details**

MELD WILL NOW OFFER 2 TYPES OF ISPO POOLS:

1️⃣ MELD1 - MELD ISPO 100% Pool

2️⃣ MELD2 - MELD ISPO 50% / 50% Pool

🤝 The MELD ISPO is intended to bring a fairer and more community driven approach to crypto project launches. Based on these goals we have been discussing and listening to the community which has resulted in a change to our ISPO structure.

1️⃣ MELD ISPO 100% Pool: These set of pools will contribute 100% of ADA rewards to MELD, for this delegators will receive approximately 2 MELD tokens for each 1 ADA if staked for the full ISPO (32 EPOCHS).

2️⃣ MELD ISPO 50% / 50% Pool: These set of pools will contribute 50% of ADA rewards to MELD, so in this case, delegators will get both 50% of ADA rewards as well as receive approximately 1 MELD token for every 1 ADA, if staked for the full ISPO (32 EPOCHS).

With this new structure, you get to choose!

You're in control

**The major advantage is to the US audience as they can't take part in ICO/IEO because os SEC, however,  getting rewards for staking is considered same as earning interest in banks, so it allow them to take part in ISPO. Second, The community have no risk other than loosing potential rewards as their ADA stays in the wallet and not with MELD team.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The things that I like and are innovative**

1. They will provide something called ""zero/negative interest loans"". They plan to take advantage of staking mechanism on Cardano to offset the interest rates that borrowers have to pay for taking out a loan. This will depend on various factors, but it's a novel concept.
2. ""Genius loans"" If you take out these loans, you will have an option to pay pack the principle. You can pay it back, but you don't have to. You only have to pay the interest back. They take advantage of DEXs and LP aggregators to earn trading fees from the assets that you have deposited. Remember, there is no central authority here, everything is managed by smart contracts, your crypto assets are safe and on-chain, just like you providing liquidity to a DEX yourself.
3. Crypto-to-fait loans will provide instant fiat loans to those who wanna take out loans in USD/EUR and not stable coins (NOTE: KYC is needed for this service, other services don't). Money will be directly deposited into your bank accounts.
4. Non-custodial wallet: You have to keys, and not MELD team or anyone else. You are the owner.
5. They are also working with Cardano foundation and will publish a paper of ISPO model so that other projects in future can also take advantage of this new concept.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns**

1. Since the ISPO model is new and untested, there might be some problems in calculating and distributing MELD tokens.
2. There may be delays in launching all the products as many things are new and we might face major delays.
3. Regulatory concerns might arise in dealing with banks in some jurisdictions for their fiat loan products.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to be debt free by July 31, 2022. My plan for this is to pay $1000/month towards one loan until completion, starting with my car (my student loans are in the federally mandated forbearance due to COVID so I'm paying 0% interest on them currently.)

CryptoCurrency,Digital Securities on Algorand. Here’s what’s available.,"Digital securities represent one of the most promising use cases of blockchain. 

For those unfamiliar, digital securities are real-world financial securities – including stocks, bonds, and derivatives – that are digitally represented on a blockchain. While using a blockchain infrastructure, digital securities are still in the purview of traditional securities laws.

Many reputable blockchain startups and even traditional companies choose to leverage Algorand to issue digital securities. Here are some of the most relevant case studies and examples of digital securities on Algorand. 

Realio Issues Hybrid Tokens on Algorand

In March 2020, Realio, a digital asset issuance and trading platform focused on real estate private equity, partnered with Algorand to use its ASA standard to tokenize its network. The Realio Security Token (RST) is built on Algorand’s Layer-1 blockchain and represents the first digital asset that acts both as a hybrid security and utility token for the Realio network.

The RST tokens provide ownership and profit share rights, as well as staking and utility features to encourage the participation in network validation, voting, and more.

The Realio platform is an end-to-end software as a service (SaaS) platform for the issuance, investment and management of digital assets. It merges access to a decentralized exchange with the features of an innovative investment platform for real estate private equity. 

W. Sean Ford, chief operating officer at Algorand, commented:

“Algorand's protocol was designed for decentralized financial applications and networks of the future like Realio, and we are pleased to support the long term value their initiative will provide. Combining Algorand's simplified asset creation, instant economic exchange, and immediate transaction finality with Realio's groundbreaking token issuance network is a significant step forward in defi compliance and innovation.”
The RST tokens were offered via the Reg D 506 (c) and Reg S exemptions, thus allowing investors all over the world to invest in the security token.



Securitize Partners with Algorand to Empower Clients to Issue Digital Securities through ASAs

In 2019, Algorand partnered with Securitize, one of the most important players in the digital securities space. The deal allows Securitize’s digital securities protocol to be supported on the Algorand blockchain, enabling Securitize users to issue, trade, and conduct corporate actions involving digital securities.

Thanks to the partnership, several Securitize clients, including Exodus and World Chess, selected Algorand as their blockchain of choice to issue and manage security tokens.

Exodus

Exodus, one of the most popular multi-currency wallet providers, issued EXIT tokens as ASAs representing shares in the company.

The cryptocurrency company closed its Regulation A public offering at the beginning of May 2021, distributing EXIT tokens representing Class A common stock. Investors who bought the tokens now hold shares in the company and can access them either through their Exodus Wallet or via their Securitize account.

Exodus issued 2,733,229 shares and raised $75 million. The company said it would make secondary trading available through an alternative trading system (ATS) like tZERO.

Securitize is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which allows its clients like Exodus to issue and sell tokenized equity in a transparent environment that focuses on regulatory compliance.

Speaking about the public offering organized in the April-May period, Exodus COO Sebastian Milla Goni stated:

“This is a compliant, transparent public offering by a profitable company with a working product. What better way to encourage product loyalty than by letting our customers own part of our business? There have been other Reg. A offerings, but this is the first offering of common stock that also has a digital representation by a token on a blockchain.”
For those unfamiliar, Regulation A (Reg A) contains rules offering exemptions from the registration, which enables certain US-based companies to raise funds by selling securities without registering them with the SEC. Last year, the SEC raised the maximum fundraising limit from $50 to $75 million.

World Chess

In 2019, World Chess, the company with the rights to broadcast the World Chess Championships, announced its plans to hold a hybrid Initial Public Offering (IPO) by selling 5% of its company in the form of security tokens built on Algorand. The digital securities offering took place last year.

World Chess acts as a media agency and a web-based gaming firm. Every year, it broadcasts the World Chess Championships and other FIDE (from “The International Chess Federation”) events. It also provides a gaming platform for users to compete by playing chess.

The company decided to turn to digital securities through Securitize and raise capital by selling Algorand-based security tokens. During the offering, CHESS tokens were made available to accredited investors located in the US and European Union (EU). The tokens represent ownership of World Chess shares.

World Chess CEO Ilya Merenzon said that the majority of the funds raised would be reinvested to develop chess as an e-sport.

Speaking about security token offerings, he told CNBC:

″[This is] a pioneering financial innovation, (and) one, I believe, many companies will use to raise funds in the future.”

Algorand’s relationship with World Chess went even further, with the blockchain project founded by MIT Professor Silvio Micali becoming an official partner of the FIDE Grand Prix Series.

TL;DR

Algorand is an excellent choice for digital securities issuers, as it is an unforkable, decentralized network built around speed and efficiency. It provides almost instant transaction finality and is now scaling to increase its performance from 1,000 to about 46,000 transactions per second (tps).

With its Role-Based Asset Control (RBAC) options, Algorand can be used to issue security tokens to be sold in certain jurisdictions and to a certain group of investors, such as accredited investors.

personalfinance,Mortgage Points Excel Calc,"Looking for advice on purchasing points to lower my interest rate. I’m refinancing a 163k loan, planning on never selling. I did some calculations on how much it would be to purchase points, break even months/years, total interest and total amount paid. I was told the $ for points will be added to closing costs but could be added to the loan. If I understand this correctly, paying for 5.75 points will be $9.3k (30 year). $9.3k divided by the total payments (360) will be about $26 while lowering my monthly payment by $93. Is the way interest calculated on the loan change this rough estimate since the loan amount will be increasing by the point cost?

Can someone with more experience and knowledge  help me understand how I should approach choosing how many points to buy?

Unsure how inflation affects this scenario. Also, points are a tax deduction, correct?

personalfinance,At what point is the amount of student loan debt enough to focus on paying it down instead of investing that money?,"I made mistakes in college and I graduated in December of 2019 with $40,000 in student loans and $40,000 in credit cards. I landed a decent job out of college making $72,000 and decided to aggressively pay down my credit card debt. Hit some speed bumps along the way because I ended up moving out from home since I graduated. The point is that I have a plan to finish paying off the remaining $22,000 by November of next year. I ended up rolling all the credit card debt into a single personal loan and got the interest rate down from 25% down to 8.5%.

My question is, however, where do I go from there (after the personal loan is paid off)? Thankfully, my student loans have garnered basically no interest since I graduated. The grace period after leaving school basically got extended because of the pandemic. This entire time I've made no payments on the student loans because I was focused on paying down the higher interest debt. So, after I finish paying off the personal loan should I focus on getting a 3 to 6 month emergency fund, retirement investment options (401k, HSA, Roth IRA, etc), and a house downpayment or should I focus on lowering my student loans before I go that route.

So far, my research has suggested that the former is the better option. A conservative rate of return on investments is 6% but I'm seeing averages on index funds around 10% or higher. Also, I should mention that all of my student loans have fixed interests rates ranging from 3.5% to 5%.

TL:DR Should I start investing or aggressively paying down student loans? At what point does the amount of student loan debt get priority over investing? Student Loans: $40k Gross Income: $72k

I'm in my early 30s now. (Also, if I do nothing, the balance will only grow by 1% more than the federal funds rate, so it's imperative I roll it over ASAP if I plan to roll it over at all.)

Alternatively, I can roll over the refund into an IRA or my new employer's 401k plan. I have a Roth IRA already, but that doesn't seem ideal because that would put me into the next tax bracket and a fraction of my refund would be taxed at 22%. So I'm debating whether I should open a Traditional IRA for this rollover, in addition to my Roth IRA, or if it makes more sense to roll this over into my 401k through my new employer.

In either case, if the $30k refund grows 7.5% each year (hypothetically) until I am 65 that would turn into about $300,000. If I want to limit my withdrawals to 4% in retirement, that leaves me with about $12,000/year or $1,000/month. So this seems better than the pension.

Is there any reason to go with a Traditional IRA vs. a 401k, and are there any other considerations I am missing? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Currently earning over $60k - how much of a setback would it be to take a new position earning under $50k?,"Current job: 2.5 years at a F500 financial services company in a low COL midwest state, kind of a mix of BA work and system/user support. Base salary is $59k with bonus of 7.5%. The benefits range from fine to great - $52/mo for high deductible health insurance, $10/mo dental, 3% 401k match (currently 75% vested in company match and won't get the last 25% unless I stay until next July), 15 days of PTO (only time off bucket), 9.5 paid holidays.

New prospective position: Reporting analyst at the local community college. Pay is much lower but the benefits, especially time off, seem much better. Advertised starting pay is $47k, cheapest health insurance is $365/mo, 403b mentioned but no details, 13 paid holidays, 20 vacation days, 2 personal days, 15 sick days, 6 free credit hours of classes per semester, 50% tuition discount for children and spouse, free rec center access

Me: 27M, BS in MIS in 2018, engaged to a DPT who makes $55-60k. Low COL area but we are beginning a $1600/mo lease tomorrow. I have about $9k in cash/emergency fund, $20k in investment/retirement accounts, no credit card debt, $18k in student loans (3.5% interest rate), and $12,500 owed on my car (2.9% interest).

Fiancee has about $25k in private student loan debt at like 7% interest but no other debt, and very little savings or investments (I think &lt;$5k total).

We have only been a two income household for about 3 months so I'm still getting used to it. What do I need to consider before taking this other job? Only earning $47k with a Bachelor's degree in tech feels a little off, but I think the additional time off and getting out of my current toxic situation would more than make up for that.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off the car or invest? 4.6APR,"The amount owed on the car is 15.5k, an interest rate of 4.69%APR. No credit card debt.

personalfinance,"Worked as a Contractor before starting Full Time Salaried Position, Company is classifying income as supplemental income (withholding ~40% tax)","Tell me if I'm wrong here: 

After accepting start date, company asked me to work 10-15 hours a week for two weeks before fulltime start. They issued a contract to me for an agreed upon hourly wage and scope of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

After starting full time, I invoiced them for the contract work. They ended up paying my first check and a separate payment for 'supplemental income' for the full amount of the contract invoice. This of course means 22% fed tax, state tax, and FICA. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking that I should get the full amount as 'self employment income' for which I will then be responsible for paying all taxes after deducting my expenses. Because my self-employment income is low and expenses higher, I would think i will pay no taxes on this income. (ie, bought computer, desk, education and a few more things). If this is the case, I will ask them to reclassify the income. 

How is my logic and understanding here? Much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Need to get my finances in order and don’t know where to start.,"Hi everyone! I’m lacking direction and any advice you have would be amazing. 

I am 31 yo beginner web designer that makes $50k/yr. I also have freelance opportunities on top of that that I frequently take. I know I could make more somewhere else, but I truly love my company and am not interested in leaving at this time. 

I live in a VERY expensive city, but I lucked out and purchased a condo a few years ago for 97k. It’s now worth about $160k in the current market. My mortgage is only about $600 but I also pay an HOA fee of $300/month. I split everything with my partner. 

I have about $6k in CC debt. I want to be dedicated to paying it down, so have decided to stop using it. But I’ve been struggling to pay it down and it’s very slow-going. 

I have about $24k in student debt, but most of that is federal debt on IBR. I will resume paying the minimum once it’s required again. About $6k of it is private loans averaging maybe 4-5% interest. 

I have about $30,000 in a 401k. And maybe $2k in savings.

I would really like to sell my condo and buy an actual house but the market is crazy here. To get a decent small fixer-upper would cost about $300k. 

I’m a little lost on how to reach my goals. Would anyone recommend pulling money from my 401k to pay off my CCs? I know there are hefty fees, but they can’t be more than my CC interest. 

Does anyone recommend selling my condo and buying something at the top of my price point at this time? 

Any advice would be so helpful.",finance

personalfinance,Is this financial security? What would you do in this situation?,"I mean, is this financial security? Is it not?

43 yrs old no wife no kids
Own outright a mobile home in a park ($450 or so rent)
No debt
$87k in my IRA
$82k outside of IRA
Car is 15 years old and probably needs to be looked at by a mechanic but works and I have no plans to replace it.

Also essentially own my parents' home in the same park, not that I want them to pass away but it's pretty much guaranteed I'll inherit it in 15 years or so. I paid about a third of the mortgage (to end it). Current market value is probably around $120k. I have no desire to live in it.

I was working on getting a place in the countryside but that's been put on the back burner as real estate is completely insane right now. Hence why I have so much in savings. Although, what else am I going to do with it?

About $8k in my HSA. No big health issues. 

My job is, eh, OK. Definitely one of the better places to work but I'd rather work much fewer hours, which just isn't part of the culture in any organization it seems. I'd be happier without certain stresses from certain people. 

As things are, if I lost my job I'd probably be OK for ten years without work.

Incidentally the savings is mostly in cash. I made a bundle last year but I'm sure the stock market is going to crash soon... Most of it is in a ""high yield"" savings account. I hate the Federal Reserve.

Edit; forgot to include, I have a pension that would be worth about $400 a month after age 55. Obviously that would increase if I kept my current job. It's with the state so pretty secure.",finance
investing,What is driving interest rates?,"As interest rates have spiked slightly from their lows last year, discussion about inflation has gone up with them. The Fed has begun “talking about” talking about raising rates. People have been pointing to dovish fed policies since ‘08 as a reason for high inflation. And claiming QE is a driving factor for the declining trend in interest rates. 

Isn’t it more likely that interest rates have been declining as a result of globalization and the deflationary pressures that come with technology? The Fed can’t just wave a wand and raise rates to say 5%? Unless there actually was true inflation and market pressures forced rates higher in tandem.

So my question is how much control does the Fed really have over interest rates? And i’m sure it’s been talked about before but does anyone think high inflation is really possible with technology driving down the price of everything?",finance

On April 27, my mother was sent to the ER for COVID-related pneumonia. She was then transferred to a private hospital through ambulance and stayed for a week and a half. 
However, nothing has been sent yet regarding the expenses. She went through multiple x-rays, COVID testing, was put on steroids and other medical things, had therapy to be able to move her body again, etc. Many doctors were visiting her as well, and we’d expected for a bill to be sent with high expenses. But we’ve gotten nothing yet
We do not have insurance, and through google, it says it usually takes up to a month to get billed without insurance 
My mother also had plasma treatment, and according to her, she saw that some treatments for COVID can get federally paid off?? Not really sure about that 
But I just want to know more, because we’re in the midst of needing to spend thousands on home renovations, but we cannot do that until we know our bill costs.",finance
